**Start of Rules**

---

**Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal primary amino group (-NH₂) or amide group (-CONH₂) on an aliphatic chain lead to high Fe/Hf values (`True`).**

*Explanation*: The presence of both amino (or amide) and carboxylate groups allows for bidentate chelation with Fe ions, enhancing Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

*Applicable Modifiers*:

- 5-aminopentanoic acid
- 7-aminoheptanoic acid
- 8-aminooctanoic acid
- (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
- (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid
- 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

---

**Rule 2**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with substituents at the para position capable of coordinating with Fe ions (e.g., pyridyl, nitro, bromomethyl groups) lead to high Fe/Hf values (`True`), while those with non-coordinating or electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, amino, hydroxyl) lead to low Fe/Hf values (`False`).**

*Explanation*: Coordinating substituents provide additional binding sites for Fe ions, enhancing Fe incorporation through chelation. Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, hindering coordination.

*Applicable Modifiers*:

- **High Fe/Hf (`True`)**:
  - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid

- **Low Fe/Hf (`False`)**:
  - 4-methylbenzoic acid
  - 4-aminobenzoic acid
  - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid

---

**Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing sulfur functional groups, such as thiol (-SH) or thioether (-S-) groups, lead to high Fe/Hf values (`True`).**

*Explanation*: Sulfur atoms have lone pairs that form strong coordination bonds with Fe ions due to their soft donor properties, enhancing Fe incorporation through effective chelation.

*Applicable Modifiers*:

- 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
- 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
- 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

---

**Rule 4**: **Modifiers with flexible ether linkages and terminal coordinating groups (e.g., amino or carboxylic acid groups) lead to high Fe/Hf values (`True`).**

*Explanation*: Ether oxygen atoms and terminal functional groups can chelate Fe ions. The flexibility of the ether linkages allows the molecule to adopt conformations that facilitate effective coordination with Fe ions.

*Applicable Modifiers*:

- 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
- 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

---

**Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups in close proximity (e.g., polyols or sugars) or phenolic hydroxyl groups on aromatic rings lead to low Fe/Hf values (`False`).**

*Explanation*: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase hydrophilicity and engage in intramolecular hydrogen bonding, reducing the availability of lone pairs for coordination with Fe ions. Phenolic hydroxyl groups can form strong hydrogen bonds, hindering effective coordination.

*Applicable Modifiers*:

- (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid
- 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid
- 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
- 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
- 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

*Exception*:

- **High Fe/Hf (`True`)**:
  - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid (The terminal hydroxyl group on a flexible aliphatic chain facilitates coordination.)

---

**Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky or electron-rich aromatic side chains lead to low Fe/Hf values (`False`), while those with less bulky aromatic side chains lead to high Fe/Hf values (`True`).**

*Explanation*: Bulky side chains introduce steric hindrance, and electron-rich aromatic rings can delocalize electron density, reducing effective coordination with Fe ions.

*Applicable Modifiers*:

- **High Fe/Hf (`True`)**:
  - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid

- **Low Fe/Hf (`False`)**:
  - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid

---

**Rule 7**: **Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups lead to low Fe/Hf values (`False`).**

*Explanation*: Fluorine's high electronegativity withdraws electron density from coordinating atoms, diminishing their ability to effectively coordinate with Fe ions.

*Applicable Modifiers*:

- 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
- 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

---

**Rule 8**: **Modifiers with pyridine rings connected via an aliphatic linker to a carboxylic acid group lead to high Fe/Hf values (`True`), whereas those with pyridine rings directly attached to the carboxylic acid lead to low Fe/Hf values (`False`).**

*Explanation*: The aliphatic linker provides flexibility, allowing both the pyridine nitrogen and carboxylate oxygen to coordinate effectively with Fe ions. Direct attachment may hinder coordination due to steric or electronic factors.

*Applicable Modifiers*:

- **High Fe/Hf (`True`)**:
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid

- **Low Fe/Hf (`False`)**:
  - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid
  - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

---

**Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (-CHO) or ketone (>C=O) groups adjacent to an aromatic ring lead to low Fe/Hf values (`False`).**

*Explanation*: Conjugated carbonyl groups can delocalize electron density away from the carboxylate oxygen, diminishing its ability to coordinate effectively with Fe ions.

*Applicable Modifiers*:

- 4-formylbenzoic acid
- 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
- 4-oxoheptanedioic acid

---

**Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups lead to low Fe/Hf values (`False`), while those with terminal coordinating groups (e.g., amino or hydroxyl) lead to high Fe/Hf values (`True`).**

*Explanation*: Without strong coordinating groups, the molecule has limited interaction with Fe ions. Terminal functional groups like -NH₂ or -OH facilitate effective coordination by providing additional binding sites.

*Applicable Modifiers*:

- **High Fe/Hf (`True`)**:
  - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Low Fe/Hf (`False`)**:
  - Octanoic acid

---

**Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing small heteroaromatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups lead to low Fe/Hf values (`False`).**

*Explanation*: Heteroaromatic rings directly attached to the carboxyl group may not coordinate effectively due to electronic factors or steric hindrance, resulting in lower Fe incorporation.

*Applicable Modifiers*:

- 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
- 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
- Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid

---

**Rule 12**: **Modifiers with hydrophilic polyhydroxy structures (e.g., sugar acids) lead to low Fe/Hf values (`False`), whereas those with a single terminal hydroxyl group on an aliphatic chain may lead to high Fe/Hf values (`True`).**

*Explanation*: High hydrophilicity and extensive hydrogen bonding in polyhydroxy structures reduce coordination efficiency with Fe ions. A single terminal hydroxyl group can still participate effectively in coordination.

*Applicable Modifiers*:

- **Low Fe/Hf (`False`)**:
  - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid

- **High Fe/Hf (`True`)**:
  - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid

---

**Rule 13**: **Modifiers with electron-rich methoxy-substituted aromatic rings and adjacent carbonyl groups lead to high Fe/Hf values (`True`).**

*Explanation*: Methoxy groups can donate electron density through resonance, and adjacent carbonyl groups provide additional coordination sites, enhancing Fe incorporation.

*Applicable Modifier*:

- 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid

---

**Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing cyclic anhydrides or lactones adjacent to the carboxylic acid group lead to high Fe/Hf values (`True`).**

*Explanation*: Additional carbonyl groups in cyclic structures provide extra coordination sites for Fe ions, enhancing Fe incorporation through multidentate chelation.

*Applicable Modifier*:

- 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid

---

**Rule 15**: **Modifiers with amide functional groups in addition to carboxylic acid groups and lacking other strong coordinating groups lead to low Fe/Hf values (`False`).**

*Explanation*: Amide groups may not coordinate as effectively due to delocalization of the lone pair on nitrogen, reducing the number of effective coordination sites.

*Applicable Modifier*:

- 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

These rules capture the relationship between the structural features of molecular modifiers and their effect on the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst. By combining multiple sub-structures and considering underlying physicochemical properties such as electronic effects, steric factors, and coordination ability, the rules provide a predictive framework to determine whether a given modifier will lead to a high or low Fe/Hf value. The rules balance simplicity and complexity while covering a broad range of the dataset, illustrating how specific functional groups influence the incorporation of Fe ions in the catalyst system.---------------------------------------------------------------
