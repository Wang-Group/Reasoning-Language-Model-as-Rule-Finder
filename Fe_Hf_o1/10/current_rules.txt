**Start of Rules**

---

**Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are **ω-amino acids**—aliphatic carboxylic acids with a **terminal amino group (-NH₂)** at the opposite end of the chain—result in a **high Fe/Hf value**.*

- **Justification**: The presence of both **amino** and **carboxyl** groups on opposite ends facilitates **bidentate chelation** with iron ions. The flexible aliphatic chain allows the molecule to wrap around the iron center, enhancing coordination.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **octanoic acid**—Lacks an amino group for effective chelation.

---

**Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are **amino acids or amino acid derivatives** with **short aliphatic side chains** result in a **high Fe/Hf value**. Those with **bulky or aromatic side chains** result in a **low Fe/Hf value**.*

- **Justification**: **Short side chains** reduce steric hindrance, allowing the amino and carboxyl groups to coordinate effectively with iron. **Bulky aromatic side chains** hinder access to coordination sites due to increased steric bulk.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Lysine derivative)
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)—Longer side chain increases steric hindrance.
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)—Bulky indole ring obstructs coordination.

---

**Rule 3**: *Modifiers containing **sulfur-containing groups** such as **thiol (-SH)** or **thioether (-S-)** groups in proximity to a **carboxyl group** result in a **high Fe/Hf value**.*

- **Justification**: **Sulfur atoms** are excellent soft Lewis bases that can form strong bonds with iron ions. Their proximity to the carboxyl group enhances **multidentate chelation**, increasing Fe incorporation.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (Methionine derivative)

---

**Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-withdrawing substituents** (e.g., **nitro (-NO₂)**, **halomethyl (-CH₂X)** where X is a halogen) on the aromatic ring result in a **high Fe/Hf value**. Those with **electron-donating substituents** (e.g., **amino (-NH₂)**, **hydroxyl (-OH)**, **methoxy (-OCH₃)**) result in a **low Fe/Hf value**.*

- **Justification**: **Electron-withdrawing groups** increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to deprotonate and coordinate with iron ions. **Electron-donating groups** decrease acidity and can hinder coordination via resonance donation.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**

---

**Rule 5**: *Modifiers with a **pyridine ring** connected to a **carboxyl group** via an **aliphatic linker** result in a **high Fe/Hf value**. If the pyridine ring is **directly attached** to the carboxyl group, it results in a **low Fe/Hf value**.*

- **Justification**: The **aliphatic linker** provides flexibility and reduces steric hindrance, allowing both the nitrogen atom of the pyridine and the carboxyl group to coordinate with iron. Direct attachment can lead to electronic and steric factors that reduce coordination efficiency.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**—Direct attachment limits effective coordination.

---

**Rule 6**: *Modifiers featuring **flexible ether linkages (-O-)** with **terminal amino groups (-NH₂)** result in a **high Fe/Hf value**.*

- **Justification**: The **ether oxygens** and **amino groups** provide multiple coordination sites. The flexibility of the ether chain allows the modifier to adopt conformations that facilitate chelation with iron ions.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**—Lacks a terminal amino group, reducing coordination ability.

---

**Rule 7**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with a **terminal hydroxyl group (-OH)** on the aliphatic chain result in a **high Fe/Hf value**. If the hydroxyl group is **attached to an aromatic ring (phenolic)**, the Fe/Hf value is **low**.*

- **Justification**: **Aliphatic hydroxyl groups** are more nucleophilic and freely rotate to coordinate with iron. **Phenolic hydroxyl groups** are less available due to resonance stabilization within the aromatic ring.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**

---

**Rule 8**: *Modifiers containing **multiple coordinating groups** in a **conjugated system**, such as **dicarbonyls** or **fused rings with carbonyl groups**, result in a **high Fe/Hf value**.*

- **Justification**: Multiple coordination sites in a conjugated system facilitate strong chelation with iron ions, enhancing Fe loading.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

---

**Rule 9**: *Modifiers that are **simple aliphatic carboxylic acids** without additional coordinating functional groups result in a **low Fe/Hf value**.*

- **Justification**: Lack of additional donor atoms or groups limits the ability to form strong coordination bonds with iron ions.

- **Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **octanoic acid**
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

---

**Rule 10**: *Modifiers containing **strong electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms** on an **aliphatic chain** result in a **low Fe/Hf value**.*

- **Justification**: **Fluorine's** high electronegativity withdraws electron density, reducing the nucleophilicity of coordinating atoms and hindering effective coordination with iron.

- **Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

---

**Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are **amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains** result in a **low Fe/Hf value**.*

- **Justification**: Bulky aromatic groups increase **steric hindrance**, preventing effective coordination of the amino and carboxyl groups with iron ions.

- **Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

---

**Rule 12**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** substituted with **electron-donating groups** at the **ortho or para positions** result in a **low Fe/Hf value**.*

- **Justification**: **Electron-donating groups** decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group and can delocalize electron density, reducing the carboxylate's ability to coordinate with iron ions.

- **Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

---

**Rule 13**: *Modifiers containing an **aldehyde group (-CHO)** in addition to a **carboxyl group** result in a **low Fe/Hf value**.*

- **Justification**: The aldehyde group can engage in side reactions or compete for coordination, and it can reduce the availability of the carboxylate group for effective chelation with iron.

- **Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**

---

**Rule 14**: *Modifiers with a **pyrazole ring** directly attached to a **carboxyl group** result in a **low Fe/Hf value**.*

- **Justification**: The pyrazole nitrogen atoms may compete with the carboxyl group for coordination, and the rigid structure may hinder effective chelation.

- **Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

---

**Rule 15**: *Modifiers with **bulky substituents** or extensive **conjugation** that do not provide additional coordinating atoms result in a **low Fe/Hf value**.*

- **Justification**: Bulky groups and extensive conjugation can increase steric hindrance and delocalize electron density, reducing the effectiveness of coordination sites.

- **Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

**End of Rules**

---

These rules are derived from an analysis of the dataset and consider the underlying physicochemical properties influencing the Fe/Hf ratio. They combine multiple **functional groups** and **structural features** to predict whether a molecular modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value. The rules prioritize broader coverage while balancing specificity, ensuring they can be applied to a wide range of modifiers.

Each rule clearly predicts the Fe/Hf value based on identifiable features such as:

- Presence and position of **amino**, **carboxyl**, **hydroxyl**, **thiol**, and **ether** groups.
- Type and position of **electron-withdrawing** or **electron-donating substituents**.
- Structural elements like **aliphatic chains**, **aromatic rings**, **heterocycles**, and **conjugated systems**.
- **Steric factors** due to bulky groups or flexible linkages.

By applying these rules, one can infer the potential Fe/Hf value of new molecular modifiers, assisting in the selection and design of modifiers to optimize and control the yield of the reaction.

---

**Note**: These rules have been carefully formulated to align with the requirements, combining functional groups and structural features to create predictive models. Redundant or less effective rules have been refined or omitted to improve clarity and applicability. The balance between simple high-coverage rules and complex low-coverage rules ensures both generality and specificity where needed.

---

I hope these rules effectively assist in predicting the Fe/Hf values based on the structure of molecular modifiers. Applying these insights should aid in optimizing the catalyst system and improving the yield of your remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------
