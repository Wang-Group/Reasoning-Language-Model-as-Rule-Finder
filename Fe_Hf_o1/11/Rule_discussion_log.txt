- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is generally clear in stating that aromatic carboxylic acids with para EWGs have high Fe/Hf values (True). It provides adequate property insight by linking electron-withdrawing groups to increased coordinating ability. The rule combines structural features, satisfying the complexity criterion. However, there's a counterexample in the dataset: *4-formylbenzoic acid* has a para formyl group (an EWG) but shows a low Fe/Hf value (False). This suggests the rule may not fully account for all EWGs or that other factors are influencing the outcome.

- **Comment 1**:
  
  **Rule 1** is clear and allows for a straightforward determination of the Fe/Hf value based on the presence of a primary amino group and a carboxylic acid on an aliphatic chain of 3–8 carbons. It provides solid physical-chemical insight by explaining how the primary amino group enhances coordination with metal centers and how the flexible aliphatic chain aids in chelation. The rule considers a combination of functional groups, satisfying the complexity criterion. It is well-supported by at least three data points: *5-aminopentanoic acid* (Entry 3, True), *7-aminoheptanoic acid* (Entry 31, True), and *8-aminooctanoic acid* (Entry 34, True), meeting the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 2**:
  
  **Rule 2** is clear in stating that modifiers containing ether linkages tend to have a high Fe/Hf value. It offers property insight by noting that ether oxygen atoms can serve as additional coordination sites. However, there is a counterexample in the dataset: *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid* (Entry 6, False) contains ether linkages but has a low Fe/Hf value. This suggests that additional factors, such as multiple hydroxyl groups causing steric hindrance, may influence the outcome. The rule could be improved by considering the effect of other functional groups present alongside ether linkages. Nonetheless, it is supported by two data points (*2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*, Entry 10, True, and *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*, Entry 32, True), meeting the minimum coverage criterion.

- **Comment 3**:
  
  **Rule 3** is clear and provides good property insight by highlighting the strong coordination ability of sulfur atoms due to their lone pairs. It considers the presence of sulfur functional groups (thiol or thioether), adding complexity by focusing on specific functional groups. The rule is supported by at least two data points: *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid* (Entry 17, True) and *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid* (Entry 23, True).

- **Comment 4**:
  
  **Rule 4** clearly identifies aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position as having a high Fe/Hf value. It offers solid property insight by explaining how EWGs enhance the acidity and coordinating ability. The rule considers combinations of structural features (aromatic ring, carboxylic acid, EWGs), adding complexity. It is well-supported by data points such as *4-nitrobenzoic acid* (Entry 20, True) and *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid* (Entry 1, True).

- **Comment 5**:
  
  **Rule 5** is clear and provides insight into how the nitrogen in a pyridyl group can serve as an additional coordination site. It adds complexity by focusing on aromatic carboxylic acids with pyridyl groups at specific positions. The rule is supported by two data points: *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Entry 11, True) and *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid* (Entry 24, True).

- **Comment 6**:
  
  **Rule 6** clearly states that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position tend to have a low Fe/Hf value. It provides property insight into how EDGs decrease acidity and coordinating ability. The rule is supported by data points such as *4-aminobenzoic acid* (Entry 4, False) and *4-methylbenzoic acid* (Entry 22, False), meeting the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 7**:
  
  **Rule 7** is clear and explains how phenolic hydroxyl groups can reduce coordination due to hydrogen bonding and resonance stabilization. It considers the presence of specific functional groups, adding complexity. The rule is supported by entries like *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid* (Entry 7, False) and *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (Entry 30, False).

- **Comment 8**:
  
  **Rule 8** clearly identifies that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups tend to have a low Fe/Hf value due to steric hindrance and competition for bonding sites. The rule is supported by data points such as *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Entry 9, False) and *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid* (Entry 6, False).

- **Comment 9**:
  
  **Rule 9** is clear and provides property insight into how fluorinated alkyl chains withdraw electron density, diminishing coordination ability. It is supported by entries like *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid* (Entry 13, False) and *4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid* (Entry 28, False).

- **Comment 10**:
  
  **Rule 10** is clear and explains that simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups have low Fe/Hf values due to weaker interactions. It is supported by data points such as *octanoic acid* (Entry 5, False) and *4-oxoheptanedioic acid* (Entry 27, False).

- **Comment 11**:
  
  **Rule 11** clearly states that modifiers with nitrogen heterocycles where the lone pair is not available for coordination tend to have low Fe/Hf values. It is supported by entries like *pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Entry 21, False) and *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid* (Entry 15, False).

- **Comment 12**:
  
  **Rule 12** needs clarification. While it specifies that amino acids with bulky or complex aromatic side chains (e.g., indole rings) tend to have low Fe/Hf values, there is a contradictory data point: *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Entry 12, True), which has a phenyl side chain and a high Fe/Hf value. This suggests that not all aromatic side chains lead to low Fe/Hf values, and the rule may need to be refined to focus on more complex or bulkier aromatic systems like indole rings specifically.

- **Comment 13**:
  
  **Rule 13** is clear and provides insight into how ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acids reduce coordination due to electron-withdrawing effects. It acknowledges exceptions, such as compounds with additional coordinating groups (e.g., methoxy substituents), adding depth to the property insight. The rule is supported by *4-oxoheptanedioic acid* (Entry 27, False) and notes the exception with *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid* (Entry 25, True).

- **Comment 14**:
  
  **Rule 14** is clear and explains that aldehyde groups can reduce coordination capacity due to intramolecular hydrogen bonding or resonance. It is supported by data points like *4-formylbenzoic acid* (Entry 19, False) and *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid* (Entry 18, False).

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear in its definition of modifiers as aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal primary amino group on a chain of 5 or more carbons, allowing easy determination of whether a modifier fits. It provides adequate physical-chemical insight, explaining how the amino group and chain length enhance coordination with metal ions. The rule effectively combines multiple sub-structures (functional groups and chain length) and is supported by at least three data points in the dataset. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 defines modifiers as amino acids with nonpolar aromatic side chains. While the rule is clear for phenylalanine-like structures, it may not be as clear when considering other aromatic side chains. The physical-chemical insight is provided, explaining the role of π-interactions and coordinating groups. However, the rule is supported by only one data point in the dataset, limiting its coverage. The complexity is reasonable, but the low coverage suggests that the rule may need more support to be robust.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 clearly defines modifiers as aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position and provides physical-chemical insight into how EWGs enhance metal ion coordination. The rule is supported by at least two data points with high Fe/Hf values. However, some exceptions exist in the dataset (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid with a low Fe/Hf value), indicating that the rule may not fully account for all factors affecting Fe/Hf values. This discrepancy suggests the rule may need refinement to improve its clarity and coverage.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear in specifying modifiers containing sulfur-functional groups such as thiol or thioether groups and explains that sulfur atoms act as strong coordination sites due to their lone pairs. It is supported by two data points in the dataset, both showing high Fe/Hf values. The rule effectively combines functional group presence with coordination chemistry principles, showing good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 clearly defines modifiers as those with multiple ether linkages in an aliphatic chain ending with carboxylic acid or amino groups, allowing for easy identification. It provides physical-chemical insight by explaining that ether oxygens offer additional coordination sites. The rule is supported by at least two data points in the dataset, showing high Fe/Hf values, and exhibits a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 specifies modifiers with a pyridine ring attached to a carboxylic acid, where the pyridine nitrogen is accessible for coordination. The rule provides physical-chemical insight into the coordinating ability of the pyridine nitrogen. It is supported by two data points with high Fe/Hf values. However, pyridine-3-carboxylic acid in the dataset has a low Fe/Hf value, which seems to contradict the rule. This suggests that the rule may need to account for the position of the carboxylic acid on the pyridine ring, as steric or electronic factors may affect coordination ability. The rule's clarity and coverage are somewhat reduced due to this exception.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear in its description of modifiers as aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal hydroxyl group on a chain of 7 or more carbons. The physical-chemical insight is adequate, explaining that the hydroxyl group provides an additional coordination site. However, the rule is supported by only one data point in the dataset, limiting its coverage. This low coverage may reduce the robustness of the rule.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear in identifying simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups and provides physical-chemical insight into why they tend to have low Fe/Hf values. The rule is supported by at least three data points in the dataset, showing low Fe/Hf values. The simplicity of the rule yields high coverage, balancing well with the lack of complexity.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 clearly describes modifiers as aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups and explains how EDGs decrease acidity and metal-binding ability. It is supported by at least three data points in the dataset, all showing low Fe/Hf values. The rule strikes a good balance between simplicity and coverage.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 clearly defines modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains or rings and provides insight into how extensive hydrogen bonding competes with metal ion coordination. The rule is supported by two data points with low Fe/Hf values, demonstrating appropriate coverage and balance.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear in identifying modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles where the nitrogen's lone pair is involved in aromatic delocalization, reducing coordination ability. Physical-chemical insight is well-explained. The rule is supported by at least three data points with low Fe/Hf values. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 clearly identifies modifiers with carbonyl groups adjacent to carboxylic acids and explains how these groups withdraw electron density, reducing coordination capability. It is supported by at least three data points showing low Fe/Hf values and balances complexity with appropriate coverage.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear in specifying modifiers with electron-withdrawing acyl groups like trifluoroacetyl groups and provides physical-chemical reasoning. However, the rule is supported by only one data point in the dataset, limiting its coverage and robustness.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 clearly identifies modifiers as amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms, explaining that these heteroatoms may participate in intramolecular interactions, reducing coordination ability. However, the rule is supported by only one data point, limiting its coverage.

After analyzing the dataset and considering the requirements, I have refined the current rules to better illustrate the relationship between molecular modifiers and the Fe/Hf value. The new rules focus on combining multiple substructures, underlying physico-chemical properties, and cover a broad range of the dataset while balancing simplicity and complexity.

**Start of Rules**

  - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (**False**)
  - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid* (**False**)

- **Rule 10**: **Fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **multiple fluorine atoms** tend to have a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine reduces electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, hindering coordination with metal ions.

  Example:
  - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid* (**True**)

**End of Rules**

These rules are designed to:

- **Combine Multiple Substructures**: Each rule considers the interaction of multiple functional groups (e.g., aromatic ring with EWGs, aliphatic chains with amino and carboxyl groups).
- **Reflect Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: The rules are based on concepts like acidity, electron-donating/withdrawing effects, chelation, and coordination chemistry.
- **Predict High or Low Fe/Hf Values**: For any modifier fitting the rule's description, the Fe/Hf value can be anticipated.
- **Cover a Broad Range of the Dataset**: The rules collectively explain the Fe/Hf values for most compounds in the dataset.
- **Balance Simplicity and Complexity**: The rules range from broader (e.g., Rule 6 covering many aromatic acids with EDGs) to more specific (e.g., Rule 12 focusing on benzofuran derivatives).

By focusing on these aspects, the rules more effectively connect the structural features of the modifiers to their impact on the Fe/Hf value, aiding in the understanding and prediction of catalyst behavior.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 addresses aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal hydroxy group on sufficiently long chains resulting in high Fe/Hf values. While the rule is generally clear, specifying "sufficient length" could be more precise. The property insight about offering multiple coordination sites is good. However, the rule's coverage is weak with only one example, reducing its reliability.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear and comprehensive, detailing that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position tend to have low Fe/Hf values. The property insight is strong, explaining decreased acidity and reduced coordination ability. The rule effectively combines multiple substructures and is well-supported by several examples, ensuring robust coverage.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 clearly states that aliphatic carboxylic acids lacking additional strong coordinating functional groups tend to have low Fe/Hf values. The property insight is sufficient, noting the limitation due to the lack of coordination sites. The rule is simpler compared to others but adequately conveys the concept. Coverage is modest, supported by a couple of examples.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 effectively describes modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains (polyols) leading to low Fe/Hf values. The property insight is solid, highlighting how extensive hydrogen bonding can interfere with metal ion coordination.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 clearly defines fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple fluorine atoms as having low Fe/Hf values. The property insight about fluorine's electron-withdrawing effects is appropriate. While the rule is understandable, it has lower complexity and minimal coverage with only one example, suggesting a need for more supporting data.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 addresses modifiers containing both a carboxyl group and adjacent carbonyl groups tending to have low Fe/Hf values. The rule is clear, and the property insight regarding steric hindrance is reasonable but could be elaborated for better understanding. The rule combines substructures and has moderate coverage with three examples.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 succinctly describes compounds with fused aromatic rings containing ketone groups leading to high Fe/Hf values. The property insight is strong, explaining enhanced coordination through chelation. However, the rule's coverage is limited to a single example, indicating a need for additional data to confirm its validity.

  - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (**False**)
  - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid* (**False**)

- **Rule 8**: **Perfluorinated carboxylic acids** with multiple **fluorine atoms** tend to have a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms reduces electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, hindering coordination with Fe ions.

  Example:
  - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid* (**False**)

- **Rule 9**: **Heterocyclic aromatic carboxylic acids** where the **heteroatom's lone pair is delocalized** into the aromatic system, such as in **pyridine**, **pyrazole**, or **indole** derivatives, tend to have a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. Delocalization reduces the availability of the heteroatom for coordinating with Fe ions.

  Examples:
  - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (**False**)
  - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid* (**False**)
  - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (**False**)

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with carbonyl groups adjacent to carboxyl groups**, such as **aldehyde (–CHO)** or **ketone (–CO–)** functionalities near a **carboxyl group**, tend to have a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. The proximity of carbonyl groups can create steric hindrance and reduce the effectiveness of coordination with Fe ions.

  Examples:
  - *4-formylbenzoic acid* (**False**)
  - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid* (**False**)
  - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid* (**False**)

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains**, such as **tryptophan** or **tyrosine**, tend to have a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. The bulky aromatic side chains may hinder effective coordination with Fe ions due to steric effects.

  Examples:
  - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (**False**)
  - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (**True**, exception to the rule)

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing a combination of ether linkages and terminal amino groups**, providing multiple coordination sites through oxygen and nitrogen atoms, tend to have a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

  Example:
  - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid* (**True**)

- **Rule 13**: **Compounds with benzofuranone moieties** containing multiple **carbonyl groups** tend to have a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. The carbonyl oxygens and the aromatic system facilitate chelation with Fe ions.

  Example:
  - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid* (**True**)

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups**, such as **acetamido groups**, in addition to free amino groups, tend to have a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. The presence of both free and protected amino groups increases the number of potential coordination sites.

  Example:
  - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (**True**)

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups on aliphatic chains**, such as **trifluoroacetyl (–COCF₃)** groups, tend to have a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. These groups reduce the electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening their interaction with Fe ions.

  Example:
  - *4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid* (**False**)

**End of Rules**

These rules are designed to:

- **Combine Multiple Substructures**: Each rule accounts for combinations of functional groups, such as amino and carboxyl groups, or sulfur-containing groups with carboxyl groups.
- **Reflect Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: The rules consider acidity, electron-donating and electron-withdrawing effects, coordination chemistry, steric hindrance, and hydrogen bonding.
- **Predict High or Low Fe/Hf Values**: Each rule clearly indicates whether a modifier fitting its description is likely to have a high or low Fe/Hf value.
- **Cover a Broad Range of the Dataset**: The rules collectively explain the Fe/Hf values for the majority of compounds in the dataset.
- **Balance Simplicity and Complexity**: Rules range from broad (e.g., Rule 6 covering aromatic acids with EDGs) to specific (e.g., Rule 13 focusing on benzofuranone derivatives).

**Understanding the Rules:**

- **Coordination Sites**: Functional groups like amino, carboxyl, hydroxyl, ether, and sulfur-containing groups serve as coordination sites for Fe ions.
- **Electron Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups enhance coordination by increasing positive character on coordinating atoms, while electron-donating groups can reduce coordination effectiveness.
- **Steric Considerations**: Bulky groups or multiple adjacent functional groups may hinder coordination due to steric hindrance.
- **Hydrogen Bonding**: Excessive hydroxyl groups may reduce coordination with Fe ions by forming internal hydrogen bonds or engaging in solvent interactions.
- **Chelation Ability**: Compounds capable of forming chelate rings with Fe ions (e.g., amino acids with suitable side chains) tend to increase Fe/Hf values.

By applying these rules, one can predict the Fe/Hf value of new molecular modifiers based on their structural features, aiding in the design of modifiers to optimize the catalyst performance in the remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.
