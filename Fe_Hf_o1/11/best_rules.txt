**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position** tend to have a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. Examples:
  - *4-nitrobenzoic acid*
  - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid*
  - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*
  - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*
  - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid*

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position** tend to have a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, reducing metal coordination efficiency. Examples:
  - *4-aminobenzoic acid*
  - *4-methylbenzoic acid*
  - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
  - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*
  - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*
  - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing **sulfur-functional groups**, such as **thiol (–SH)** or **thioether (–S–)** groups, tend to have a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. Sulfur atoms have lone pairs that strongly coordinate with metal centers. Examples:
  - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*
  - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid* (Methionine derivative)

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic amino acids with primary amino groups and carboxylic acid groups** tend to have a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. The proximity of these groups facilitates chelation with metal centers. Examples:
  - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid)
  - *5-aminopentanoic acid*
  - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
  - *8-aminooctanoic acid*
  - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid*
  - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with **multiple hydroxyl groups (polyhydroxy acids)** tend to have a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. Excessive hydroxyl groups can lead to intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonding, hindering effective metal coordination. Examples:
  - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
  - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing **ether linkages** in their side chains tend to have a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. Ether oxygen atoms can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing Fe incorporation. Examples:
  - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
  - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing **fluorinated aliphatic chains** tend to have a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. Fluorine's high electronegativity reduces the electron density on coordinating atoms, diminishing their ability to bond with metals. Examples:
  - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*
  - *4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid*

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups** tend to have a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. The absence of additional coordinating groups results in minimal interaction with metal centers. Examples:
  - *Octanoic acid*
  - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **aromatic hydroxy groups (phenolic OH)** tend to have a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. The hydroxyl group can engage in hydrogen bonding, reducing the availability of the carboxylate group for metal coordination. Examples:
  - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*
  - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*
  - *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing **pyridine rings directly attached to a carboxylic acid group** exhibit **variable Fe/Hf values** based on the position of the nitrogen in the ring:
  - **High Fe/Hf value (True)** when nitrogen is positioned to coordinate effectively with metals:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid*
  - **Low Fe/Hf value (False)** when nitrogen's position hinders effective coordination:
    - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with **terminal hydroxyl groups on long aliphatic chains** tend to have a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. The hydroxyl group provides an additional coordination site, and long chains may enhance interactions with the metal-organic layer. Example:
  - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **keto groups adjacent to carboxylic acids** on aliphatic chains tend to have a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. The keto group can withdraw electron density, reducing the coordinating ability of the carboxylate. Example:
  - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **fused aromatic ring systems containing carbonyl groups** can have a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. These structures provide rigid frameworks and multiple coordination sites. Example:
  - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*
