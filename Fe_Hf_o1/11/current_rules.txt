**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Aliphatic amino acids** with a straight-chain aliphatic backbone containing a **primary amino group (–NH₂)** and a **carboxyl group (–COOH)** at opposite ends tend to have a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. The presence of these functional groups allows for effective coordination with Fe ions through chelation.

  Examples:
  - *5-aminopentanoic acid* (**True**)
  - *7-aminoheptanoic acid* (**True**)
  - *8-aminooctanoic acid* (**True**)

- **Rule 2**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)** at the **para position**, such as **nitro (–NO₂)**, **bromomethyl (–CH₂Br)**, or **pyridyl (–C₅H₄N)** groups, tend to have a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxyl group and enhance its ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  Examples:
  - *4-nitrobenzoic acid* (**True**)
  - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid* (**True**)
  - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (**True**)

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing sulfur functional groups**, such as **thiol (–SH)** or **thioether (–S–)** groups, in combination with **amino or carboxyl groups**, tend to have a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. Sulfur atoms provide soft coordination sites that strongly bind to Fe ions.

  Examples:
  - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid* (**True**)
  - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid* (**True**)

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with long aliphatic chains (6 carbons or more)** terminating with a **carboxyl group (–COOH)** and containing additional **terminal hydroxyl (–OH)** or **amino (–NH₂)** groups tend to have a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. The extended chain provides flexibility, and multiple functional groups offer several coordination sites for Fe ions.

  Examples:
  - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (**True**)
  - *7-aminoheptanoic acid* (**True**)
  - *8-aminooctanoic acid* (**True**)

- **Rule 5**: **Polyether carboxylic acids** with multiple **ether linkages (–O–)** in the backbone terminating with a **carboxyl group (–COOH)** tend to have a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. The ether oxygen atoms act as coordination sites, increasing the overall binding capacity with Fe ions.

  Example:
  - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid* (**True**)

- **Rule 6**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-donating groups (EDGs)** at the **para position**, such as **amino (–NH₂)**, **hydroxy (–OH)**, or **methyl (–CH₃)** groups, tend to have a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing its ability to coordinate effectively with Fe ions.

  Examples:
  - *4-aminobenzoic acid* (**False**)
  - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (**False**)
  - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (**False**)

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups** (polyols), especially on aliphatic chains, tend to have a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. Extensive hydrogen bonding from hydroxyl groups can compete with metal coordination, reducing Fe binding.

  Examples:
  - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (**False**)
  - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid* (**False**)

- **Rule 8**: **Perfluorinated carboxylic acids** with multiple **fluorine atoms** tend to have a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms reduces electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, hindering coordination with Fe ions.

  Example:
  - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid* (**False**)

- **Rule 9**: **Heterocyclic aromatic carboxylic acids** where the **heteroatom's lone pair is delocalized** into the aromatic system, such as in **pyridine**, **pyrazole**, or **indole** derivatives, tend to have a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. Delocalization reduces the availability of the heteroatom for coordinating with Fe ions.

  Examples:
  - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (**False**)
  - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid* (**False**)
  - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (**False**)

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with carbonyl groups adjacent to carboxyl groups**, such as **aldehyde (–CHO)** or **ketone (–CO–)** functionalities near a **carboxyl group**, tend to have a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. The proximity of carbonyl groups can create steric hindrance and reduce the effectiveness of coordination with Fe ions.

  Examples:
  - *4-formylbenzoic acid* (**False**)
  - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid* (**False**)
  - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid* (**False**)

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains**, such as **tryptophan** or **tyrosine**, tend to have a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. The bulky aromatic side chains may hinder effective coordination with Fe ions due to steric effects.

  Examples:
  - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (**False**)
  - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (**True**, exception to the rule)

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing a combination of ether linkages and terminal amino groups**, providing multiple coordination sites through oxygen and nitrogen atoms, tend to have a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

  Example:
  - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid* (**True**)

- **Rule 13**: **Compounds with benzofuranone moieties** containing multiple **carbonyl groups** tend to have a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. The carbonyl oxygens and the aromatic system facilitate chelation with Fe ions.

  Example:
  - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid* (**True**)

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups**, such as **acetamido groups**, in addition to free amino groups, tend to have a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. The presence of both free and protected amino groups increases the number of potential coordination sites.

  Example:
  - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (**True**)

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups on aliphatic chains**, such as **trifluoroacetyl (–COCF₃)** groups, tend to have a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. These groups reduce the electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening their interaction with Fe ions.

  Example:
  - *4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid* (**False**)

**End of Rules**

These rules are designed to:

- **Combine Multiple Substructures**: Each rule accounts for combinations of functional groups, such as amino and carboxyl groups, or sulfur-containing groups with carboxyl groups.
- **Reflect Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties**: The rules consider acidity, electron-donating and electron-withdrawing effects, coordination chemistry, steric hindrance, and hydrogen bonding.
- **Predict High or Low Fe/Hf Values**: Each rule clearly indicates whether a modifier fitting its description is likely to have a high or low Fe/Hf value.
- **Cover a Broad Range of the Dataset**: The rules collectively explain the Fe/Hf values for the majority of compounds in the dataset.
- **Balance Simplicity and Complexity**: Rules range from broad (e.g., Rule 6 covering aromatic acids with EDGs) to specific (e.g., Rule 13 focusing on benzofuranone derivatives).

**Understanding the Rules:**

- **Coordination Sites**: Functional groups like amino, carboxyl, hydroxyl, ether, and sulfur-containing groups serve as coordination sites for Fe ions.
- **Electron Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups enhance coordination by increasing positive character on coordinating atoms, while electron-donating groups can reduce coordination effectiveness.
- **Steric Considerations**: Bulky groups or multiple adjacent functional groups may hinder coordination due to steric hindrance.
- **Hydrogen Bonding**: Excessive hydroxyl groups may reduce coordination with Fe ions by forming internal hydrogen bonds or engaging in solvent interactions.
- **Chelation Ability**: Compounds capable of forming chelate rings with Fe ions (e.g., amino acids with suitable side chains) tend to increase Fe/Hf values.

By applying these rules, one can predict the Fe/Hf value of new molecular modifiers based on their structural features, aiding in the design of modifiers to optimize the catalyst performance in the remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------
