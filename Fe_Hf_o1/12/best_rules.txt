**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that contain a thiol group (–SH) and a carboxylic acid group predict a high Fe/Hf value due to sulfur's strong coordination ability with iron.**

  *Examples:*
  - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid* (True)
  - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* (True)
  - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid* (True)

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic amino acids with a primary amine (–NH₂) and a single carboxylic acid group on a carbon chain of five or more carbons predict a high Fe/Hf value, provided there are no additional carboxylic acid groups.**

  *Examples:*
  - *5-aminopentanoic acid* (True)
  - *7-aminoheptanoic acid* (True)
  - *8-aminooctanoic acid* (True)
  - *Counter-example:* *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (False) – contains two carboxylic acid groups.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers with aromatic rings substituted at the para position with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halomethyl) and a carboxylic acid group predict a high Fe/Hf value.**

  *Examples:*
  - *4-nitrobenzoic acid* (True)
  - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid* (True)
  - *Counter-examples:*
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid* (False) – aldehyde group may hinder coordination.
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (False) – methyl is electron-donating.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with the nitrogen atom positioned to coordinate with iron, especially when linked via para substitution to a carboxylic acid group, predict a high Fe/Hf value.**

  *Examples:*
  - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (True)
  - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid* (True)
  - *Counter-example:* *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (False) – nitrogen position less favorable for coordination.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids lacking additional strong coordinating functional groups (e.g., amino, thiol) predict a low Fe/Hf value.**

  *Examples:*
  - *Octanoic acid* (False)
  - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid* (False)
  - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (False) – additional carboxylic acid group reduces coordination efficiency.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxylic acid group predict a low Fe/Hf value due to intramolecular hydrogen bonding hindering coordination with Fe ions.**

  *Examples:*
  - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (False)
  - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]propanoic acid* (False)

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing electron-donating groups (e.g., amino, hydroxy, methoxy) on aromatic rings at the para position, along with a carboxylic acid group, predict a low Fe/Hf value due to decreased ability to coordinate with Fe ions.**

  *Examples:*
  - *4-aminobenzoic acid* (False)
  - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid* (False)
  - *4-hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives* (False)

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains predict a low Fe/Hf value due to steric hindrance limiting coordination with Fe ions.**

  *Examples:*
  - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (False)
  - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (True) – exception due to smaller aromatic side chain.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing carbonyl groups adjacent to aromatic rings (e.g., keto groups, lactones) predict a high Fe/Hf value due to potential chelation with Fe ions.**

  *Examples:*
  - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid* (True)
  - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid* (True)

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with long aliphatic chains containing terminal hydroxy groups predict a high Fe/Hf value due to additional coordination sites provided by the hydroxy groups.**

  *Example:*
  - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (True)

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing ether linkages in aliphatic chains along with an amino group predict a high Fe/Hf value due to increased flexibility and additional oxygen atoms enhancing coordination with Fe ions.**

  *Example:*
  - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid* (True)

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains predict a low Fe/Hf value due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect reducing electron density on coordinating atoms.**

  *Example:*
  - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid* (False)

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde groups on aromatic rings predict a low Fe/Hf value, possibly due to the aldehyde group's potential to engage in side reactions or hinder coordination with Fe ions.**

  *Examples:*
  - *4-formylbenzoic acid* (False)
  - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid* (False)

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with sulfur-containing side chains predict a high Fe/Hf value due to sulfur's strong affinity for coordination with Fe ions.**

  *Example:*
  - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid* (True)

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with aliphatic chains containing both amino and acetamido groups predict a high Fe/Hf value due to multiple coordination sites enhancing binding with Fe ions.**

  *Example:*
  - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (True)

**End of Rules**

**Explanation and Analysis:**

- **Rule Refinement:** The rules have been refined to ensure clarity and to avoid redundancy. Some rules were merged or adjusted for better coverage.

- **Coverage Balance:** The rules aim to balance simplicity and complexity, covering a broad range of modifiers while highlighting key functional groups that influence Fe/Hf values.

- **Chemical Insights:**
  - **Coordination Sites:** Functional groups like thiols, amines, and pyridine nitrogens have lone pairs that can coordinate with Fe ions, increasing the Fe/Hf value.
  - **Steric Factors:** Bulky substituents near coordination sites can hinder binding to Fe ions, resulting in a low Fe/Hf value.
  - **Electronic Effects:** Electron-withdrawing groups enhance coordination by stabilizing the Fe-ligand bond, while electron-donating groups can decrease coordination efficiency.
  - **Intramolecular Interactions:** Intramolecular hydrogen bonding or resonance can reduce the availability of coordinating atoms, lowering the Fe/Hf value.

- **Applicability:** These rules can be applied to predict the Fe/Hf value (high or low) of other modifiers based on their structural features, aiding in the selection of modifiers to optimize the catalytic performance.

**Note:** The rules are based on observed trends in the provided dataset and general principles of coordination chemistry. Exceptions may occur, and experimental validation is recommended for new modifiers.---------------------------------------------------------------
