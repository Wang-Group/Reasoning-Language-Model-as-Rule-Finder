**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position, such as nitro (–NO₂) or halomethyl (–CH₂Hal), predict a high Fe/Hf value. EWGs increase the acidity and coordinating ability of the carboxylate group toward Fe ions.**

  *Examples:*
  - *4-nitrobenzoic acid* (High Fe/Hf)
  - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid* (High Fe/Hf)

  *Counter-examples:*
  - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (Low Fe/Hf) – Methyl group is electron-donating.
  - *4-aminobenzoic acid* (Low Fe/Hf) – Amino group is electron-donating.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position, such as amino (–NH₂), hydroxy (–OH), or methyl (–CH₃), predict a low Fe/Hf value. EDGs decrease the acidity and coordinating ability of the carboxylate group toward Fe ions.**

  *Examples:*
  - *4-aminobenzoic acid* (Low Fe/Hf)
  - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (Low Fe/Hf)
  - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (Low Fe/Hf)
  - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid* (Low Fe/Hf)

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing sulfur functional groups, such as thiol (–SH) or thioether (–S–), along with a carboxylic acid group, predict a high Fe/Hf value. Sulfur’s strong affinity for Fe enhances coordination stability through Fe–S interactions.**

  *Examples:*
  - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid* (High Fe/Hf)
  - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* (High Fe/Hf)
  - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid* (High Fe/Hf)

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic amino acids with a terminal amino group (–NH₂) and a terminal carboxylic acid group (–COOH), especially with medium to long carbon chains, predict a high Fe/Hf value. The presence of both functional groups allows effective chelation with Fe ions.**

  *Examples:*
  - *5-aminopentanoic acid* (High Fe/Hf)
  - *7-aminoheptanoic acid* (High Fe/Hf)
  - *8-aminooctanoic acid* (High Fe/Hf)
  - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (High Fe/Hf)

  *Counter-example:*
  - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (Low Fe/Hf) – Additional carboxyl group may interfere with coordination.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing pyridine rings where the nitrogen atom is positioned to coordinate effectively (e.g., in 4-pyridyl carboxylic acids) predict a high Fe/Hf value due to potential bidentate chelation through the nitrogen and carboxylate oxygen atoms.**

  *Examples:*
  - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (High Fe/Hf)
  - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid* (High Fe/Hf)

  *Counter-example:*
  - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Low Fe/Hf) – Nitrogen position is less favorable for coordination.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups (–OH) adjacent to the carboxylic acid group predict a low Fe/Hf value. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding competes with Fe coordination sites, diminishing their ability to bind Fe ions effectively.**

  *Examples:*
  - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Low Fe/Hf)
  - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]propanoic acid* (Low Fe/Hf)

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional strong coordinating functional groups predict a low Fe/Hf value. The lack of donor atoms or groups reduces their interaction and coordination capacity with Fe ions.**

  *Examples:*
  - *Octanoic acid* (Low Fe/Hf)
  - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid* (Low Fe/Hf)
  - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid* (Low Fe/Hf)

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with bulky side chains or rigid structures near the coordinating groups predict a low Fe/Hf value due to steric hindrance that affects effective interaction with Fe ions. Sterically encumbered ligands are less able to coordinate tightly.**

  *Examples:*
  - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (Low Fe/Hf)
  - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid* (Low Fe/Hf)

  *Counter-example:*
  - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (High Fe/Hf) – Smaller aromatic group allows better coordination.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with aldehyde groups (–CHO) adjacent to an aromatic ring predict a low Fe/Hf value. Aldehyde groups may interfere with coordination or undergo side reactions, reducing Fe incorporation efficiency.**

  *Examples:*
  - *4-formylbenzoic acid* (Low Fe/Hf)
  - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid* (Low Fe/Hf)

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing ether linkages (–O–) and amino groups within the same molecule predict a high Fe/Hf value. Multiple heteroatoms provide additional coordination sites, enhancing binding affinity with Fe ions.**

  *Example:*
  - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid* (High Fe/Hf)

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with additional carbonyl groups (e.g., ketones, lactones) adjacent to the carboxylic acid or within aromatic systems can enhance coordination with Fe ions, predicting a high Fe/Hf value. Multiple carbonyl groups increase the chelation potential via coordination through oxygen atoms.**

  *Examples:*
  - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid* (High Fe/Hf)
  - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid* (High Fe/Hf)

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with highly fluorinated alkyl chains predict a low Fe/Hf value. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms reduces electron density on coordinating groups, weakening interactions with Fe ions and diminishing coordination strength.**

  *Example:*
  - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid* (Low Fe/Hf)
