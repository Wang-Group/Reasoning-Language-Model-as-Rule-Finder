- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing sulfur-containing functional groups (such as thiol (-SH) or thioether (-S-)) tend to result in **high Fe/Hf** values. Examples include modifiers with sulfanyl groups attached to aromatic rings or aliphatic chains.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are benzoic acid derivatives with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro (-NO₂), bromo (-Br)) at the para position result in **high Fe/Hf** values. These groups enhance metal coordination by withdrawing electron density from the aromatic ring.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are benzoic acid derivatives with electron-donating groups (e.g., amino (-NH₂), hydroxy (-OH), methyl (-CH₃)) at the para position result in **low Fe/Hf** values. Electron-donating groups decrease the ability of the carboxylate to coordinate with Fe ions.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers containing aliphatic amino groups on carbon chains with four or more carbons result in **high Fe/Hf** values. The presence of amino groups enhances coordination with Fe ions, especially in longer chains that provide flexibility.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with multiple hydroxy groups (polyols) on aliphatic chains result in **low Fe/Hf** values. Extensive hydrogen bonding from multiple hydroxyl groups can hinder effective coordination with Fe ions.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing methoxy groups and/or polyether chains result in **high Fe/Hf** values. Ether oxygen atoms can coordinate with Fe ions, enhancing Fe loading.

- **Rule 7**: Long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups (e.g., octanoic acid) result in **low Fe/Hf** values. Lack of coordinating functional groups diminishes interaction with Fe ions.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains result in **low Fe/Hf** values. The strong electronegativity of fluorine reduces the ability of the molecule to coordinate with Fe ions.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers featuring aromatic rings fused with oxygen (e.g., benzofuran derivatives) tend to result in **high Fe/Hf** values. The heteroaromatic structure can enhance coordination with Fe ions.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a single hydroxy group on long aliphatic chains (five carbons or more) result in **high Fe/Hf** values. The hydroxy group facilitates coordination while the long chain enhances interaction with the catalyst surface.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are small amino acids with side-chain carboxylic acids (e.g., dicarboxylic amino acids like glutamic acid) result in **low Fe/Hf** values. The presence of multiple carboxyl groups may lead to unfavorable binding modes for Fe ions.

**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and specifies that modifiers containing sulfur-containing functional groups like thiol (-SH) or thioether (-S-) result in high Fe/Hf values. The property insight is strong, as sulfur atoms are known to enhance metal coordination due to their lone pair electrons. The rule covers multiple data points (entries 10, 17, and 23), providing good coverage. The complexity is appropriate, focusing on specific functional groups, and the rule balances specificity with sufficient coverage effectively.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear in stating that benzoic acid derivatives with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position lead to high Fe/Hf values. The property insight is solid, as electron-withdrawing groups can enhance metal coordination by stabilizing negative charge on coordinating atoms. The rule is supported by at least two data points (entries 1 and 20), demonstrating acceptable coverage. The complexity is reasonable, focusing on specific substituents on a common scaffold, and the rule maintains a good balance between specificity and coverage.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 clearly states that benzoic acid derivatives with electron-donating groups at the para position result in low Fe/Hf values. The property insight is sound, as electron-donating groups can decrease the electron deficiency needed for effective metal coordination. The rule covers multiple data points (entries 4, 7, and 22), showing good coverage. The complexity is appropriate, focusing on specific electron-donating substituents, and the rule effectively balances detail with coverage.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear and indicates that modifiers with aliphatic amino groups on carbon chains of four or more carbons yield high Fe/Hf values. The property insight is adequate, considering that amino groups can enhance coordination with Fe ions and longer chains offer flexibility. The rule covers several data points (entries 5, 31, 33, and 34), demonstrating strong coverage. The complexity involves both functional group presence and chain length, providing a good balance between specificity and applicability.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 clearly states that modifiers with multiple hydroxy groups on aliphatic chains result in low Fe/Hf values. The property insight is reasonable, as excessive hydrogen bonding from multiple hydroxyl groups can hinder metal coordination. The rule is supported by at least two data points (entries 6 and 9), offering acceptable coverage. The complexity is appropriate, focusing on polyol structures, and the rule maintains a good balance.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear in stating that modifiers containing methoxy groups or polyether chains result in high Fe/Hf values. The property insight is strong, as ether oxygen atoms can coordinate with Fe ions. The rule is supported by multiple data points (entries 11, 25, and 32), showing good coverage. The complexity is appropriate, considering both methoxy and polyether functionalities, and the rule balances specificity with coverage effectively.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 clearly indicates that long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups result in low Fe/Hf values. The property insight is acceptable, as the absence of coordinating functional groups diminishes interaction with Fe ions. However, the rule is supported by only one data point (entry 5), limiting its coverage. The simplicity of the rule ensures clarity but may reduce its applicability due to limited data support.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear, stating that modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains lead to low Fe/Hf values. The property insight is plausible, as fluorine's high electronegativity can reduce coordination ability. The rule is supported by only one data point (entry 13), offering limited coverage. The specificity is high, but the lack of additional supporting data points affects the rule's robustness.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 clearly describes that modifiers featuring aromatic rings fused with oxygen result in high Fe/Hf values. The property insight is solid, considering that heteroaromatic structures can enhance metal coordination. However, the rule is supported by only one data point (entry 16), limiting its coverage. While the rule is specific, more data points are needed to strengthen its reliability.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear, indicating that modifiers with a single hydroxy group on long aliphatic chains (five carbons or more) result in high Fe/Hf values. The property insight is reasonable, as the hydroxy group aids coordination and the long chain enhances surface interaction. The rule is supported by only one data point (entry 29), limiting coverage. The rule balances specificity with physical-chemical reasoning but would benefit from more supportive data.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 suggests that small amino acids with side-chain carboxylic acids result in low Fe/Hf values. However, this rule lacks clarity and consistency, as it is contradicted by data (entry 2 shows a high Fe/Hf value). The property insight may be insufficient or oversimplified, and the rule covers limited data points with conflicting results. This inconsistency indicates that the rule may need to be revised or reconsidered.

**Analysis of Current Rules and Suggestions for Improvement**

After reviewing the current set of rules and the dataset provided, I have some suggestions to enhance the rules to better meet the specified requirements:

1. **Combining Overlapping Rules**: Some rules overlap in their functional groups or underlying principles. Merging these rules can simplify the rule set and increase coverage.

2. **Emphasizing Combinations of Substructures**: The guidelines recommend illustrating direct combinations of substructures (functional groups). We can refine the rules to focus more on specific combinations rather than single functional groups.

3. **Balancing Coverage and Specificity**: Some rules are very specific with low coverage, while others are broad. We aim to balance simple rules with higher coverage and complex rules with lower coverage.

4. **Clarity and Predictive Power**: Each rule should clearly predict the Fe/Hf value (high or low) based on the presence of certain substructures.

**Revised Rules**

**Start of Rules**

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and precise, allowing for easy identification of matching modifiers. It provides strong physicochemical insight by explaining how the combination of primary amine and carboxylic acid groups on a sufficiently long aliphatic chain enhances Fe coordination. The rule effectively considers combinations of substructures, and it is well-supported by multiple data points (e.g., 5-aminopentanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid, (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid), satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is explicit and straightforward, making it easy to determine when a modifier fits the description. The rule offers adequate property insight by highlighting the role of sulfur as a soft Lewis base with high affinity for Fe ions. It combines sulfur-containing groups with carboxylic acids, adding complexity. The rule is supported by multiple data points (e.g., 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid, 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid, 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid), demonstrating good coverage.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear and unambiguous, focusing on aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position. The property insight is sound, explaining how electron-withdrawing groups increase acidity and enhance Fe coordination. The rule effectively combines substructures and is supported by data points like 4-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, meeting the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is well-defined, specifying modifiers with multiple ether linkages and terminal coordinating groups. It provides solid physicochemical insight by explaining how ether oxygens contribute additional coordination sites. The rule accounts for combinations of substructures and is backed by data points such as 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid and 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid, satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 lacks clarity due to the difficulty in determining whether a nitrogen heterocycle's lone pair is available for coordination. The distinction between available and delocalized lone pairs in aromatic systems can be nontrivial, which may hinder practical application. The rule has limited coverage, with only one strong supporting data point (4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid), reducing its overall effectiveness.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear and easy to apply, focusing on aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups. The property insight is appropriate, explaining why the lack of strong coordinating sites leads to low Fe incorporation. It is a simpler rule but effectively covers common cases and is supported by multiple data points (e.g., octanoic acid, 4-oxoheptanedioic acid), fulfilling the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is explicit, identifying aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position resulting in low Fe/Hf values. The property insight is solid, as electron-donating groups decrease acidity and coordination ability. The rule combines functional groups effectively and is supported by several data points (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-methylbenzoic acid, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid), demonstrating good coverage.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear and specific, focusing on modifiers with aldehyde groups adjacent to carboxylic acids. The property insight is plausible, citing possible internal interactions hindering coordination. The rule is supported by data points like 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid, meeting the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear but has limited coverage, as it is supported by only one data point (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid). While the property insight concerning the electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine is valid, the rule's applicability may be limited due to its narrow scope.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is well-defined, addressing modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups without strong coordinating groups. The property insight is sound, explaining how internal hydrogen bonding reduces coordination availability. The rule combines substructures effectively and is supported by data points such as (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid and 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]propanoic acid, satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 lacks clarity due to the subjective nature of "bulky" aromatic groups and what constitutes significant steric hindrance. While the property insight regarding steric effects is reasonable, the rule may be challenging to apply consistently. It is supported by data points (e.g., (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid), but the lack of clear criteria reduces its effectiveness.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 presents difficulties in clarity because assessing whether a nitrogen's lone pair is involved in aromatic delocalization requires advanced understanding of electronic structures. Despite valid property insight and support from data points like pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, the rule may not be easily applicable by all practitioners.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 introduces ambiguity with the condition "if steric hindrance is minimized," making it less clear. Determining steric hindrance levels can be subjective. The rule has limited coverage, primarily supported by (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid. This reduces its overall reliability and applicability.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 is clear and provides good property insight about cyclic structures facilitating chelation. However, it has limited coverage with only one data point (1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid), which diminishes its generalizability and effectiveness.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 is clear and effectively combines multiple coordinating functional groups on a flexible aliphatic chain. The physicochemical insight is strong, highlighting the importance of flexibility for effective chelation. It is supported by data points like 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid and 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, satisfying the coverage criterion and making it a valuable rule.

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing a primary amino group (-NH₂) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) on an aliphatic chain of exactly four carbons result in high Fe/Hf values**.

  *Combination of Substructures*: Primary amine + Carboxylic acid + Aliphatic chain (4 carbons)

  *Explanation*: The specific chain length allows effective chelation with Fe ions without significant steric hindrance. The amino and carboxyl groups can act as bidentate ligands, forming stable complexes.

  *Exceptions*: Modifiers like (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (glutamic acid), which have extra carboxyl groups, result in low Fe/Hf values.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers featuring sulfur-containing groups (thiol (-SH) or thioether (-S-)) in conjunction with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) result in high Fe/Hf values**.

  *Combination of Substructures*: Sulfur-containing group + Carboxylic acid

  *Explanation*: Sulfur atoms are soft Lewis bases with a strong affinity for Fe ions. The combination of sulfur and carboxyl groups enhances the ligand's ability to chelate Fe, forming stable complexes.

  *Combination of Substructures*: Aromatic ring + Carboxylic acid + Electron-withdrawing group at para position

  *Explanation*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group and stabilize the negative charge on the oxygen atom, enhancing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  *Examples*: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid

  *Consistency*: This rule consistently predicts high Fe/Hf values for such modifiers.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing ether linkages (-O-) along with terminal coordinating groups (e.g., carboxylic acid or amino group) and minimal hydroxyl groups result in high Fe/Hf values**.

  *Combination of Substructures*: Ether linkages + Terminal coordinating group (carboxyl or amino) + Minimal hydroxyl groups

  *Explanation*: Ether oxygens provide additional coordination sites, and the flexibility of ether chains facilitates chelation with Fe ions. Excessive hydroxyl groups (as in polyols) can lead to internal hydrogen bonding, reducing coordination efficiency.

  *Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

  *Exceptions*: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups, such as polyols, result in low Fe/Hf values.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with aromatic nitrogen heterocycles where the nitrogen's lone pair is available for coordination, and the carboxylic acid group is not directly attached to the heterocycle, result in high Fe/Hf values**.

  *Combination of Substructures*: Aromatic nitrogen heterocycle (with available lone pair) + Aliphatic linker + Carboxylic acid

  *Explanation*: When the nitrogen's lone pair is not delocalized in aromaticity and the carboxyl group is positioned away from the ring, both can coordinate with Fe ions effectively, enhancing Fe incorporation.

  *Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid

  *Exceptions*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (nicotinic acid), where the carboxyl group is directly attached to the ring, results in low Fe/Hf values due to delocalization of the nitrogen's lone pair.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional strong coordinating functional groups result in low Fe/Hf values**.

  *Combination of Substructures*: Aliphatic chain + Carboxylic acid (no additional coordinating groups like amino, hydroxyl, or sulfur-containing groups)

  *Explanation*: The lack of multiple or strong coordinating sites limits the modifier's ability to chelate Fe ions effectively, leading to low Fe incorporation.

  *Examples*: Octanoic acid, 4-oxoheptanedioic acid, 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

  *Consistency*: This rule consistently predicts low Fe/Hf values for such modifiers.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., amino (-NH₂), hydroxyl (-OH), methoxy (-OCH₃), methyl (-CH₃)) at the para position result in low Fe/Hf values**.

  *Combination of Substructures*: Aromatic ring + Carboxylic acid + Electron-donating group at para position

  *Explanation*: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions by making the oxygen less negatively charged.

  *Examples*: 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-methylbenzoic acid, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

  *Consistency*: Modifiers fitting this description consistently show low Fe/Hf values.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) without additional strong coordinating groups result in low Fe/Hf values**.

  *Combination of Substructures*: Multiple hydroxyl groups (polyol structure) + Carboxylic acid

  *Explanation*: Hydroxyl-rich modifiers tend to form internal hydrogen bonds, reducing the availability of hydroxyl groups to coordinate with Fe ions. This internal stabilization diminishes their chelating ability.

  *Examples*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid, 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]propanoic acid

  *Consistency*: Modifiers with polyol structures consistently exhibit low Fe/Hf values.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with bulky aromatic groups adjacent to coordinating atoms result in low Fe/Hf values due to steric hindrance**.

  *Combination of Substructures*: Bulky aromatic group near coordinating atom + Carboxylic acid

  *Explanation*: Steric hindrance from bulky groups can impede the approach and effective coordination of the ligand with Fe ions, reducing Fe incorporation.

  *Examples*: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan), 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

  *Consistency*: This rule accurately predicts low Fe/Hf values for such modifiers.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with conjugated systems capable of chelation, especially when combined with a carboxylic acid group, result in high Fe/Hf values**.

  *Combination of Substructures*: Conjugated system (e.g., carbonyl groups in a cyclic structure) + Carboxylic acid

  *Explanation*: Conjugated systems can delocalize electron density and offer multiple coordination sites, enhancing the ligand's ability to chelate Fe ions effectively.

  *Example*: 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid

  *Consistency*: Modifiers fitting this description show high Fe/Hf values.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing multiple coordinating functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) on a flexible aliphatic chain result in high Fe/Hf values if steric hindrance is minimized**.

  *Combination of Substructures*: Multiple coordinating groups (amino, hydroxyl) + Flexible aliphatic chain + Carboxylic acid

  *Explanation*: The flexibility of the aliphatic chain allows the coordinating groups to align effectively for chelation. Multiple coordination sites enhance the stability of the Fe-ligand complex.

  *Examples*: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

  *Exceptions*: Modifiers where steric hindrance from bulky groups interferes with coordination may not conform to this rule.

**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**:

  **Rule 1** is clear in specifying that modifiers with a primary amino group and two carboxylic acid groups on a four-carbon aliphatic chain result in high Fe/Hf values. The structural description is precise, allowing straightforward identification of matching modifiers. The property insight is strong, explaining how the specific chain length facilitates optimal bidentate chelation with Fe ions, enhancing Fe incorporation. The rule combines multiple substructures, showing appropriate complexity. However, the coverage is limited, primarily supported by aspartic acid, with glutamic acid as an exception due to its longer chain. Overall, Rule 1 is sound but could benefit from more supporting data points.

- **Comment 2**:

  **Rule 2** provides a clear criterion by specifying modifiers with a primary amino group and a carboxylic acid on aliphatic chains of five or more carbons, without additional carboxyl groups. The property insight is solid, noting that longer chains offer flexibility for effective coordination, and that extra carboxyl groups may interfere with this process. The rule considers combinations of substructures, adding to its complexity. It has good coverage, supported by several examples like 5-aminopentanoic acid and 7-aminoheptanoic acid. The balance between complexity and coverage is well-maintained, making Rule 2 robust.

- **Comment 3**:

  **Rule 3** is clear in identifying modifiers with sulfur-containing groups and a carboxylic acid as leading to high Fe/Hf values. The property insight accurately reflects the strong affinity of sulfur atoms for Fe ions due to their soft Lewis base characteristics. The rule combines functional groups, adding complexity. With multiple supporting examples and no exceptions in the dataset, the coverage is strong. Rule 3 effectively balances clarity, insight, complexity, and coverage.

- **Comment 4**:

  **Rule 4** clearly states that aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted nitro groups result in high Fe/Hf values. The property insight suggests that the electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group enhances coordination with Fe ions, which is chemically plausible. The rule's complexity is appropriate, focusing on specific substituent effects and positions. However, coverage is limited to one example—4-nitrobenzoic acid—with exceptions like 4-formylbenzoic acid showing low Fe/Hf values. Expanding the dataset could strengthen this rule.

- **Comment 5**:

  **Rule 5** defines modifiers with ether linkages and terminal coordinating groups (carboxyl or amino) while minimizing hydroxyl groups. The clarity is good, although the rule requires careful analysis of the modifier's structure. The property insight is sound, explaining how ether oxygens contribute to coordination and how excessive hydroxyl groups can hinder it. The rule's complexity is adequate, and it is supported by examples like 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid. Coverage is satisfactory, making Rule 5 well-founded.

- **Comment 6**:

  **Rule 6** specifies modifiers with aromatic nitrogen heterocycles where the nitrogen's lone pair is available for coordination, and the carboxylic acid is not directly attached to the ring. The rule is clear but requires understanding of electronic effects in heterocycles. The property insight is strong, highlighting the significance of the lone pair's availability and the placement of the carboxyl group. Complexity is high due to the consideration of aromaticity and coordination chemistry. Coverage is limited, with 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid as the primary example. Expanding data points would enhance the rule's robustness.

- **Comment 7**:

  **Rule 7** is straightforward, stating that aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional strong coordinating groups result in low Fe/Hf values. Clarity is excellent, and the property insight logically explains the insufficient chelating ability due to the lack of strong coordinating sites. The rule is simple but effective, with strong coverage from multiple examples like octanoic acid. The balance between simplicity and high coverage makes Rule 7 reliable.

- **Comment 8**:

  **Rule 8** clearly identifies that aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-donating groups lead to low Fe/Hf values. The property insight is accurate, emphasizing how electron-donating groups reduce the carboxyl group's ability to coordinate with Fe ions. The rule's complexity is appropriate, considering electronic effects and substituent positions. Coverage is strong, with several consistent examples. Rule 8 successfully balances detail and applicability.

- **Comment 9**:

  **Rule 9** specifies that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups without strong coordinating groups result in low Fe/Hf values. Clarity is high, and the property insight correctly attributes the low coordination to internal hydrogen bonding. The rule is simple but considers combinations of substructures. Coverage is solid, supported by examples like pentahydroxyhexanoic acid. The rule maintains a good balance between simplicity and coverage.

- **Comment 10**:

  **Rule 10** states that modifiers with bulky aromatic groups near coordinating atoms lead to low Fe/Hf values due to steric hindrance. The clarity is good, though it requires careful structural examination. The property insight into steric effects impeding coordination is valid. Complexity is present, considering the spatial arrangement of functional groups. Coverage includes examples like tryptophan, supporting the rule. Rule 10 effectively highlights the impact of steric factors.

- **Comment 11**:

  **Rule 11** suggests that modifiers with conjugated systems capable of chelation, combined with a carboxylic acid, result in high Fe/Hf values. While the rule offers valuable property insight about conjugation enhancing chelation, the clarity is somewhat lacking due to the broad definition of "conjugated systems capable of chelation." Complexity is high, but coverage is limited, with only one primary example. Refining the rule for clarity and expanding coverage would improve its applicability.

- **Comment 12**:

  **Rule 12** indicates that modifiers with multiple coordinating functional groups on a flexible aliphatic chain result in high Fe/Hf values if steric hindrance is minimized. Clarity is moderate, as the rule is broad and requires assessment of steric factors. The property insight about flexibility and multiple coordination sites enhancing stability is sound. Complexity is high, combining structural flexibility and functional group effects. Coverage includes examples like 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid but is limited. Greater specificity and additional data points would strengthen this rule.

    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

  *Exceptions*: Compounds with rigid structures or additional bulky groups near the coordinating sites may not conform to this rule.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing conjugated systems capable of chelation, especially when combined with a carboxylic acid group, result in high Fe/Hf values**.

  *Combination of Substructures*: Conjugated system (e.g., cyclic diketones) + Carboxylic acid

  *Explanation*: Conjugated systems can delocalize electron density and offer multiple coordination sites. This enhances the ligand's ability to chelate Fe ions effectively, leading to higher Fe incorporation.

  *Example*: 
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

  *Consistency*: Modifiers fitting this description show high Fe/Hf values.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with fluorinated aliphatic chains result in low Fe/Hf values**.

  *Combination of Substructures*: Fluorinated aliphatic chain + Carboxylic acid

  *Explanation*: Fluorine atoms are highly electronegative and can withdraw electron density from the carboxylate group, reducing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions. This leads to lower Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

  *Example*: 
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

  *Consistency*: This rule consistently predicts low Fe/Hf values for such modifiers.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with an amino acid structure containing an aromatic side chain directly attached to the chiral center result in low Fe/Hf values due to steric hindrance and electronic effects**.

  *Combination of Substructures*: Amino acid backbone + Aromatic side chain at the α-carbon

  *Explanation*: The proximity of the bulky aromatic side chain to the coordinating amino and carboxyl groups can hinder effective chelation with Fe ions. Additionally, the electronic properties of the aromatic ring may affect the availability of lone pairs on the coordinating atoms.

  *Examples*: 
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine)
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan)

  *Exceptions*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) is an exception as it results in a high Fe/Hf value, likely due to the absence of a bulky aromatic side chain.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows us to determine whether a modifier will result in high Fe/Hf values based on the presence of a primary amino group and a carboxylic acid on a linear aliphatic chain of five or more carbons without additional carboxyl groups. The rule provides strong property insight by explaining how the chain length and functional groups enhance Fe incorporation through effective coordination with Fe ions. It considers combinations of substructures, meeting complexity requirements. The rule is supported by multiple examples and exceptions, ensuring good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear and can be easily applied to determine high Fe/Hf values for modifiers containing sulfur groups and a carboxylic acid. The property insight is solid, explaining the role of sulfur as a soft Lewis base enhancing coordination with Fe ions. The rule elegantly combines functional groups, satisfying complexity, and is well-supported by examples without noted exceptions, ensuring excellent coverage and balance.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clearly defined and allows for straightforward identification of modifiers that will result in high Fe/Hf values due to the presence of electron-withdrawing groups on aromatic carboxylic acids at the para position. The property insight is logical, relating increased acidity to enhanced Fe coordination. While the rule is complex enough, involving combinations of substructures, its coverage is limited to a couple of examples, which may affect its robustness. Balance could be improved by including more supporting data or considering whether the rule applies more broadly.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 offers a reasonable degree of clarity, though its application might require careful structural analysis to ensure modifiers fit the specified pattern. The property insight is acceptable, explaining the role of ether linkages and terminal groups in coordination. Complexity is appropriate, involving combinations of substructures, but coverage is limited to a couple of examples, which may not be sufficient to establish the rule's general applicability. A broader dataset or further examples would enhance both coverage and balance.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear in its criteria but is quite specific to a narrow set of modifiers. The property insight into the coordination of nitrogen heterocycles is sound. The complexity is adequate, focusing on combinations of substructures. However, the rule is supported by only one example and one exception, which suggests limited coverage. To improve the rule, more supporting data or broader applicability would be beneficial to ensure balance.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear and easy to apply, stipulating that aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups result in low Fe/Hf values. The property insight is straightforward and logical, explaining the lack of coordination leading to low Fe incorporation. While the rule is simpler and less complex than others, it has good coverage and balances simplicity with predictive power effectively.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 clearly defines the structural factors leading to low Fe/Hf values, focusing on the effect of electron-donating groups at the para position. The property insight is well-explained. The rule is appropriately complex, involving combinations of substructures, and is supported by several examples, indicating good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear and provides a reasonable explanation for the low Fe/Hf values associated with polyol modifiers lacking additional coordinating groups. The property insight regarding internal hydrogen bonding is appropriate. While the rule is fairly specific and covers limited examples, it addresses an important structural factor. The balance could be improved by broadening the coverage with more data points.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is reasonably clear but may require additional structural analysis to determine whether a modifier fits the criteria of having sterically hindered groups near coordinating atoms. The property insight regarding steric hindrance is valid. Given that the rule is based on few examples, it may lack sufficient coverage, and balance could be improved by including more data points or refining the rule for broader applicability.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear and provides an understandable explanation of how flexible chains with terminal coordinating groups lead to high Fe/Hf values. The complexity is appropriate, involving combinations of structural features. However, the rule is supported by only two examples, which limits coverage. To improve balance, additional data points would be helpful.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is somewhat general and may lack clarity regarding which conjugated systems are capable of chelation. The property insight is reasonable but could use more detail. The rule is complex but supported by only a single example, which limits coverage and balance. To improve the rule, it should be clarified and supported with additional data points to validate its applicability.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is clear and provides a logical explanation for why fluorinated chains lead to low Fe/Hf values. The simplicity of the rule is acceptable, but coverage is limited to a single example, which may affect its reliability. Adding more examples would improve coverage and balance.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is specific and clear, focusing on amino acids with aromatic side chains attached to the α-carbon. The property insight explains the steric and electronic factors affecting Fe incorporation. The rule is appropriately complex but is supported by only two examples and an exception, indicating limited coverage. To improve balance, more data points or broader applicability would be beneficial.

    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) without additional strong coordinating groups result in low Fe/Hf values.**

  *Combination of Substructures*: Multiple hydroxyl groups + Carboxylic acid

  *Explanation*: Multiple hydroxyl groups can engage in internal hydrogen bonding, reducing their availability to coordinate with iron ions. This diminishes the ligand's chelating ability.

  *Examples*:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with fluorinated aliphatic chains result in low Fe/Hf values.**

    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains directly attached to the α-carbon may result in variable Fe/Hf values depending on the size and electronic effects of the side chain.**

  *Combination of Substructures*: Amino acid backbone + Bulky aromatic side chain at α-carbon

  *Explanation*: Steric hindrance from bulky side chains can impede effective coordination with iron ions. However, electronic factors may also play a role, leading to variability.

  *Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine) – High Fe/Hf value

The rule provides adequate physicochemical insight about internal hydrogen bonding limiting coordination, maintaining a good balance.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** lacks sufficient coverage, as it is based on a single data point (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) resulting in a low Fe/Hf value. While the physicochemical explanation is reasonable, the rule does not meet the coverage criterion of at least two supporting data points, reducing its reliability.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** is supported by only one data point (octanoic acid) showing a low Fe/Hf value. The rule is clear and the explanation logical, but insufficient coverage limits its effectiveness. Additional data points are needed to strengthen this rule's validity.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** is clear and provides good property insight; however, it is supported by only one positive data point (4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) showing a high Fe/Hf value.

  Rule 4 is clear and provides sufficient physicochemical insight into the inhibitory effect of electron-donating groups on Fe coordination. It involves combinations of substructures and is supported by multiple data points (`4-aminobenzoic acid`, `4-methylbenzoic acid`, `5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid`, `3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid`), thus scoring highly on all criteria.

- **Comment 5**:

  Rule 5 is clear and offers insight into how ether linkages and terminal coordinating groups enhance Fe incorporation. It considers combinations of substructures and is supported by two data points (`2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid`, `3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid`), meeting the coverage requirement. Rule 5 meets all the criteria effectively.

- **Comment 6**:

  Rule 6 is clear, with good physicochemical insight regarding how multiple hydroxyl groups can reduce a modifier's ability to coordinate with iron ions. The rule combines substructures effectively and is backed by two data points (`(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid`, `2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]propanoic acid`), satisfying the coverage criterion. Rule 6 scores well on all criteria.

- **Comment 7**:

  Rule 7 is clear and provides physicochemical insight into how fluorinated aliphatic chains reduce Fe coordination due to electron-withdrawing effects. However, it is supported by only one data point (`2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid`), failing to meet the coverage requirement of at least two data points. Rule 7 scores low on coverage, and additional data is needed to strengthen this rule.

- **Comment 8**:

  Rule 8 is clear but has low coverage, as it is supported by only one data point (`octanoic acid`). While it provides some property insight into why simple aliphatic carboxylic acids result in low Fe/Hf values, the lack of multiple supporting examples reduces its reliability. Rule 8 scores low on coverage.

- **Comment 9**:

  Rule 9 is clear and offers physicochemical insight into how terminal hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains enhance Fe coordination. However, it is supported by only one data point (`7-hydroxyheptanoic acid`), not meeting the coverage criterion. Rule 9 scores low on coverage and would benefit from additional supporting data.

- **Comment 10**:

  Rule 10 is clear and provides good property insight into the role of heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen in enhancing Fe coordination. It considers combinations of substructures and uses both a supporting example (`4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid`) and a counterexample (`pyridine-3-carboxylic acid`). While supported by only two data points, it meets the minimum coverage requirement. Rule 10 is acceptable but could be strengthened with more examples.

- **Comment 11**:

  Rule 11 lacks clarity because it states that the Fe/Hf values are variable, which does not allow for clear prediction of high or low Fe/Hf values. While it provides some physicochemical insight into how bulky aromatic side chains can influence coordination, it does not meet the clarity criterion essential for the rules. Rule 11 scores low on clarity.

- **Comment 12**:

  Rule 12 is clear, with good physicochemical insight into how formyl or carbonyl groups adjacent to a carboxylic acid can reduce Fe coordination. It considers combinations of substructures and is supported by two data points (`5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid`, `4-formylbenzoic acid`), satisfying the coverage criterion. Rule 12 scores well on all criteria.

- **Comment 13**:

  Rule 13 is clear and offers good physicochemical insight into how multiple coordinating groups on aliphatic chains enhance Fe incorporation. However, it is supported by only one data point (`(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid`), failing the coverage criterion. Rule 13 scores low on coverage and would be more robust with additional supporting data.

- **Comment 14**:

  Rule 14 is clear but is supported by only one data point (`2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid`), not meeting the coverage requirement. While it provides property insight into intramolecular interactions reducing Fe coordination, the lack of multiple examples reduces its reliability. Rule 14 scores low on coverage.

- **Comment 15**:

  Rule 15 presents an inconsistency between the rule and the dataset. The rule states that modifiers with cyclic diketones or keto acids may result in low Fe/Hf values due to steric hindrance or unfavorable geometry, but the example provided (`1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid`) has a high Fe/Hf value according to the dataset. This contradiction indicates a lack of clarity and undermines the property insight. Moreover, it is supported by only one data point. Rule 15 scores low on clarity and consistency.

  - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) without additional strong coordinating groups result in low Fe/Hf values.**

  **Combination of Substructures**: Multiple hydroxyl groups + Carboxylic acid

  **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can engage in internal hydrogen bonding or solvation, reducing their availability to coordinate with iron ions. This diminishes the ligand's chelating ability.

  **Examples**:
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**
  - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with aromatic rings bearing hydroxyl groups (-OH) result in low Fe/Hf values.**

  **Explanation**: The nitrogen atom in the heteroaromatic ring acts as an additional coordination site. The alkyl linker reduces steric hindrance, allowing effective chelation with iron ions.

  **Example**:
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**

  **Counterexample**: If the carboxyl group is directly attached to the ring, as in **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, steric or electronic factors may hinder coordination, leading to low Fe/Hf values.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with formyl (-CHO) or carbonyl groups adjacent to a carboxylic acid on aromatic rings result in low Fe/Hf values.**

  **Combination of Substructures**: Aromatic ring + Formyl or carbonyl group adjacent to carboxylic acid

  **Explanation**: The proximity of electron-withdrawing groups like formyl can reduce the electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, diminishing its ability to coordinate with iron ions.

  - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 12**: **Amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains directly attached to the α-carbon result in variable Fe/Hf values depending on the side chain's ability to coordinate.**

  **Combination of Substructures**: Amino acid backbone + Bulky aromatic side chain

  **Explanation**: Larger side chains can introduce steric hindrance or engage in π-stacking interactions that affect iron coordination. The electronic properties of the side chain also influence Fe incorporation.

  **Examples**:
  - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (High Fe/Hf value due to favorable coordination)
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Low Fe/Hf value potentially due to steric hindrance)

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with aliphatic chains containing terminal hydroxyl groups (-OH) in addition to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) result in high Fe/Hf values.**

  **Combination of Substructures**: Aliphatic chain + Terminal hydroxyl group + Carboxylic acid

  **Explanation**: The terminal hydroxyl group provides an additional coordination site, and the flexibility of the chain allows for effective interaction with iron ions, enhancing Fe incorporation.

  **Example**:
  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

  **Exceptions**: Modifiers with hydroxyl groups on aromatic rings may not follow this rule due to different electronic and steric environments.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing cyclic diketones or keto acids with potential for chelation may result in low Fe/Hf values due to steric hindrance or unfavorable geometry affecting coordination.**

  **Combination of Substructures**: Cyclic diketones or keto acids adjacent to carboxylic acid

  **Explanation**: Despite the presence of chelating groups, steric factors or rigid structures can impede effective interaction with iron ions, leading to lower Fe incorporation.

  **Example**:
  - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing aliphatic chains with multiple coordinating groups (e.g., amino and acetamido groups) result in high Fe/Hf values due to enhanced chelation.**
