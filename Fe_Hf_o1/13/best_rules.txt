**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing terminal primary amino groups (-NH₂) on aliphatic chains of four or more carbons result in high Fe/Hf values**. The primary amino group acts as a strong ligand, coordinating effectively with Fe ions.

  *Examples*: 5-aminopentanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid, (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers with sulfur-containing functional groups** (e.g., thiol (-SH), thioether (-S-)) **result in high Fe/Hf values**, especially when combined with other coordinating groups like carboxylic acids. Sulfur atoms have a high affinity for Fe ions, enhancing coordination.

  *Examples*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid, 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid, 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid.

- **Rule 3**: **Benzoic acid derivatives with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position result in high Fe/Hf values**. Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro (-NO₂), bromo (-Br)) increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  *Examples*: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing multiple ether linkages (polyethers) without multiple hydroxyl groups result in high Fe/Hf values**. Ether oxygen atoms can serve as coordination sites for Fe ions.

  *Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: **Aromatic amino acids with an accessible amino group result in high Fe/Hf values**. The combination of an aromatic ring and amino group provides multiple coordination sites for Fe ions.

  *Example*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine).

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing aromatic nitrogen heterocycles with accessible nitrogen lone pairs result in high Fe/Hf values**. The nitrogen atom's lone pair can coordinate with Fe ions.

  *Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with terminal hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains of six or more carbons result in high Fe/Hf values**. The hydroxyl group enhances coordination with Fe ions due to its lone pairs.

  *Example*: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups (polyols) result in low Fe/Hf values**. Extensive hydrogen bonding within the polyol may hinder effective coordination with Fe ions.

  *Examples*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid, 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]propanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: **Long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups result in low Fe/Hf values**. The lack of additional coordination sites reduces interaction with Fe ions.

  *Example*: Octanoic acid.

- **Rule 10**: **Benzoic acid derivatives with electron-donating groups at the para position result in low Fe/Hf values**. Electron-donating groups (e.g., amino (-NH₂), methyl (-CH₃)) decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing coordination efficiency with Fe ions.

  *Examples*: 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-methylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with aldehyde groups (-CHO) result in low Fe/Hf values**. Aldehyde groups can participate in side reactions or form intramolecular interactions that hinder coordination with Fe ions.

  *Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing fluorinated alkyl chains result in low Fe/Hf values**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms decreases the electron density on coordinating atoms, reducing their ability to bind Fe ions.

  *Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with nitrogen heterocycles where the nitrogen's lone pair is delocalized or less accessible result in low Fe/Hf values**. Delocalization reduces the nitrogen's ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  *Example*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (nicotinic acid).

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers featuring fused aromatic rings with oxygen heteroatoms result in high Fe/Hf values**. The oxygen atoms in such structures can effectively coordinate with Fe ions.

  *Example*: 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers combining both carboxylic acid groups and additional chelating groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) adjacent to the carboxylate result in high Fe/Hf values**. The proximity of multiple coordinating groups enhances Fe ion binding.

  *Examples*: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid), (2S)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan).
