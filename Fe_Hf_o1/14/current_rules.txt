**Start of Rules**

---

**Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal primary amino group (–NH₂) or hydroxyl group (–OH) at the ω-position (opposite the carboxylate group), and a carbon chain length of at least five carbons, result in `Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value` being **True**.**

- **Physical-Chemical Basis**: The terminal amino or hydroxyl groups act as additional coordination sites for Fe ions. The sufficient chain length provides flexibility, allowing the molecule to effectively chelate Fe ions through intramolecular coordination, enhancing Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

- **Examples**:
  - **5-aminopentanoic acid** *(True)*
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(True)*
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(True)*
  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(True)*

- **Counter-Examples**:
  - **Octanoic acid** *(False)* (no terminal coordinating group)
  - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(False)* (short chain length)

---

**Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position (e.g., nitro, halomethyl, sulfanyl), which enhance acidity and coordination ability, result in `Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value` being **True**.**

- **Physical-Chemical Basis**: EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid by stabilizing the negative charge on the carboxylate anion. This enhances its ability to coordinate with Fe ions by forming stronger Fe–O bonds.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(True)*
  - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** *(True)*
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** *(True)*

- **Counter-Examples**:
  - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(False)* (methyl is electron-donating)
  - **4-aminobenzoic acid** *(False)* (amino group is electron-donating)

---

**Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids containing a pyridine ring with an accessible nitrogen atom capable of coordinating with Fe result in `Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value` being **True**.**

- **Physical-Chemical Basis**: The lone pair on the pyridine nitrogen provides an additional coordination site for Fe ions, facilitating chelation and stabilizing the metal complex.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(True)*
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** *(True)*

- **Counter-Examples**:
  - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(False)* (nitrogen positioned away from effective coordination)
  - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** *(False)* (nitrogens are less accessible due to aromaticity)

---

**Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing sulfur atoms in functional groups such as thiol (–SH) or thioether (–S–) within close proximity (within three carbon atoms) to the carboxylate group result in `Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value` being **True**.**

- **Physical-Chemical Basis**: Sulfur atoms are soft Lewis bases and coordinate strongly with transition metals like Fe. Their proximity to the carboxylate group allows for bidentate or polydentate chelation, enhancing Fe incorporation.

- **Examples**:
  - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)*
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** *(True)*
  - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** *(True)*

- **Counter-Example**:
  - **Octanoic acid** *(False)* (no sulfur-containing groups)

---

**Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with flexible polyether chains (containing –O–CH₂–CH₂– units) and terminal amino (–NH₂) or other coordinating groups result in `Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value` being **True**.**

- **Physical-Chemical Basis**: Ether oxygen atoms and terminal amino groups provide multiple coordination sites for Fe ions. The flexibility of the polyether chain allows the molecule to wrap around Fe ions, facilitating effective chelation.

- **Examples**:
  - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** *(True)*
  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(True)*

- **Counter-Example**:
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(False)* (multiple hydroxyl groups reduce coordination due to hydrogen bonding)

---

**Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) such as amino (–NH₂) or hydroxyl (–OH) directly attached to the ring result in `Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value` being **False**.**

- **Physical-Chemical Basis**: EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid by donating electron density, which reduces its ability to deprotonate and coordinate with Fe ions. Additionally, these groups can engage in intramolecular hydrogen bonding, further hindering coordination.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-aminobenzoic acid** *(False)*
  - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** *(False)*
  - **(2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid)** *(False)*

- **Counter-Example**:
  - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(True)* (contains EWG enhancing coordination)

---

**Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids lacking additional coordinating groups or electron-withdrawing substituents result in `Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value` being **False**.**

- **Physical-Chemical Basis**: Without extra coordination sites or activation by electron-withdrawing groups, these modifiers interact weakly with Fe ions, leading to lower incorporation into the catalyst.

- **Examples**:
  - **Octanoic acid** *(False)*
  - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** *(False)*

---

**Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids containing bulky substituents near coordinating groups, causing steric hindrance, result in `Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value` being **False**.**

- **Physical-Chemical Basis**: Steric hindrance from bulky groups impedes effective coordination by blocking access to Fe ions, reducing chelation efficiency.

- **Examples**:
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(False)* (tryptophan, bulky indole ring near amino group)
  - **(4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid)** *(True)* (exception due to ketone group enhancing coordination despite bulkiness)

---

**Rule 9**: **Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups (polyols) near the carboxylate group result in `Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value` being **False**.**

- **Physical-Chemical Basis**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can form strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds, reducing the availability of lone pairs on oxygen atoms for coordination with Fe ions.

- **Example**:
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(False)*

- **Counter-Example**:
  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(True)* (ether oxygens are more available for coordination)

---

**Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with side-chain carboxylate groups close to the α-carbon, allowing for effective chelation through formation of five-membered rings, result in `Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value` being **True**.**

- **Physical-Chemical Basis**: The proximity of the side-chain carboxylate group to the α-amino group enables the molecule to form stable chelate rings with Fe ions, enhancing coordination and incorporation.

- **Example**:
  - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)* (aspartic acid)

- **Counter-Example**:
  - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(False)* (glutamic acid; longer side chain reduces ring stability and chelation efficiency)

**Explanation:**

These rules have been developed to elucidate the relationship between the structural features of molecular modifiers and their impact on the `Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value` in the catalyst. By combining multiple functional groups and considering the underlying physical-chemical properties, the rules predict the likelihood of high or low Fe incorporation.
