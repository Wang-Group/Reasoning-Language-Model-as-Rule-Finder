**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are benzoic acid derivatives substituted at the para (4-) position with strongly electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro or bromomethyl, or functional groups with strong metal-coordinating ability such as pyridyl rings linked via the para position, will lead to **high Fe/Hf values**.
  - *Explanation*: Electron-withdrawing groups at the para position increase the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxylic acid group. Pyridyl groups act as strong ligands for metal coordination when attached through a linker, enhancing Fe incorporation.
  - *Examples*:
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Entry 1) – True
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Entry 20) – True
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 12) – True
  - *Counter-Example*:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19) – False (The formyl group does not enhance coordination sufficiently)

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers containing sulfur atoms capable of acting as ligands, such as thiol (–SH) groups or thioether (–S–) groups, will lead to **high Fe/Hf values**.
  - *Explanation*: Sulfur atoms have lone pairs that can coordinate strongly with metal ions, enhancing Fe loading on the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Entry 10) – True
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 17) – True
    - **Methionine derivative** (Entry 23) – True

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with free primary amino groups at terminal positions (ω-amino acids) lead to **high Fe/Hf values**.
  - *Explanation*: Terminal amino groups can effectively chelate metal ions, increasing metal incorporation into the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (Entry 3) – True
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Entry 31) – True
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Entry 34) – True
  - *Counter-Example*:
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** (Entry 28) – False (The amino group is blocked by trifluoroacetylation)

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted on the aromatic ring with electron-donating groups such as amino (–NH₂) or hydroxy (–OH) lead to **low Fe/Hf values**.
  - *Explanation*: Electron-donating groups reduce the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxylic acid group. Additionally, these groups may engage in hydrogen bonding rather than metal coordination.
  - *Examples*:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Entry 4) – False
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Entry 7) – False
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30) – False
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Entry 26) – False

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing polyhydroxy aliphatic chains (sugar-like structures) lead to **low Fe/Hf values**.
  - *Explanation*: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase hydrophilicity and steric hindrance, which can interfere with effective metal coordination.
  - *Examples*:
    - **Pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Entry 9) – False
    - **Glycerol-derived acid** (Entry 6) – False

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with aliphatic chains that have a terminal hydroxyl or amino group and sufficient chain length (typically six or more carbons) lead to **high Fe/Hf values**.
  - *Explanation*: Terminal polar groups at an appropriate distance from the carboxylic acid can enhance metal coordination by acting as additional binding sites without causing steric hindrance.
  - *Examples*:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Entry 29) – True
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32) – True

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are amino acids with small aromatic side chains (e.g., phenylalanine) lead to **high Fe/Hf values**; those with larger heterocyclic aromatic side chains (e.g., tryptophan) lead to **low Fe/Hf values**.
  - *Explanation*: Smaller aromatic side chains allow for better metal coordination without significant steric hindrance, while larger heterocycles may impede effective interaction with the metal center.
  - *Examples*:
    - **Phenylalanine** (Entry 13) – True
    - **Tryptophan** (Entry 14) – False

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that have pyridine rings attached to the carboxylic acid through linkers (aromatic or aliphatic bridges) lead to **high Fe/Hf values**, whereas pyridine rings directly attached to the carboxylic acid lead to **low Fe/Hf values**.
  - *Explanation*: Linkers provide flexibility and proper spatial orientation for the pyridine nitrogen to coordinate effectively with metal ions.
  - *Examples*:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 12) – True
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** (Entry 24) – True
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Entry 21) – False

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups (e.g., hydroxyl or amino groups) lead to **low Fe/Hf values**.
  - *Explanation*: Lack of coordinating groups means fewer interactions with metal ions, resulting in lower metal incorporation into the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - **Octanoic acid** (Entry 5) – False
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Entry 27) – False

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing fused aromatic heterocycles with coordinating atoms (e.g., oxygen or nitrogen) lead to **high Fe/Hf values**.
  - *Explanation*: Heterocyclic compounds with coordinating atoms can chelate metal ions effectively, enhancing metal loading.
  - *Examples*:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Entry 16) – True

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with carboxylic acid groups adjacent to strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., keto or trifluoroacetyl groups) lead to **low Fe/Hf values**.
  - *Explanation*: Adjacent electron-withdrawing groups can reduce the electron density on the carboxylate, diminishing its ability to coordinate with metal ions.
  - *Examples*:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Entry 27) – False
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** (Entry 28) – False

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are amino acids with side-chain acetamido groups lead to **high Fe/Hf values**.
  - *Explanation*: Acetamido groups can participate in metal coordination through lone pairs on oxygen and nitrogen, enhancing metal loading.
  - *Examples*:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 33) – True
