- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers containing a terminal primary amine group (-NH₂) connected via an aliphatic chain of at least three carbon atoms to a carboxylic acid group increase Fe/Hf (Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value == True).*

  - **Explanation**: The combination of a primary amine and a carboxylic acid allows the modifier to act as a bidentate ligand, chelating Fe ions more effectively. The aliphatic chain provides flexibility, facilitating optimal coordination geometry with Fe ions and enhancing metal loading onto the catalyst.

  - **Examples**: 
    - **High Fe/Hf**: 
      - *5-aminopentanoic acid*
      - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
      - *8-aminooctanoic acid*
      - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**: 
      - Modifiers lacking the primary amine or with shorter chains, such as *octanoic acid*, do not show increased Fe/Hf.

---

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers with both a thiol group (-SH) and a carboxylic acid group increase Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: Thiol groups can form strong coordination bonds with Fe ions due to the lone pair electrons on sulfur. When combined with a carboxylate group, the modifier can act as a chelating agent, significantly enhancing Fe loading.

  - **Examples**: 
    - **High Fe/Hf**: 
      - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*
      - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid*

  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**: 
      - Modifiers without thiol groups, such as *4-aminobenzoic acid*, do not exhibit this effect.

---

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers containing a pyridine ring directly attached or connected via a short linker to a carboxylic acid group increase Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: The nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring serves as an additional coordination site for Fe ions. The proximity of the pyridine nitrogen to the carboxylate group allows for effective bidentate coordination, enhancing Fe ion binding and increasing Fe/Hf.

  - **Examples**: 
    - **High Fe/Hf**: 
      - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*
      - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid*

  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**: 
      - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (nicotinic acid) may have less effective coordination due to steric factors or less optimal positioning of coordinating sites.

---

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers with an aromatic ring bearing electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halogens) at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid group increase Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups enhance the acidity of the carboxylic acid, increasing its ability to deprotonate and coordinate with Fe ions. This leads to stronger metal-ligand interactions and higher Fe loading.

  - **Examples**: 
    - **High Fe/Hf**: 
      - *4-nitrobenzoic acid*
      - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid*

  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**: 
      - *4-methylbenzoic acid*, with an electron-donating methyl group, does not increase Fe/Hf.

---

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are α-amino acids with side chains containing additional coordinating functional groups, such as carboxylate or aromatic rings, increase Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: α-Amino acids can coordinate through both the amino and carboxylate groups. Side chains with extra coordinating groups enhance chelation by providing additional binding sites for Fe ions, leading to increased metal loading.

  - **Examples**: 
    - **High Fe/Hf**: 
      - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (aspartic acid) with an extra carboxylate group
      - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (phenylalanine) with an aromatic side chain

  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**: 
      - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (glutamic acid) may have side chains that are less effective in coordinating Fe due to steric hindrance or unfavorable orientation.

---

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups decrease Fe/Hf (Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value == False).*

  - **Explanation**: Without extra functional groups to provide additional coordination sites, these modifiers interact weakly with Fe ions. The limited coordination reduces Fe loading onto the catalyst.

  - **Examples**: 
    - **Low Fe/Hf**: 
      - *Octanoic acid*
      - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*

  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**: 
      - Modifiers with additional coordinating groups, such as *5-aminopentanoic acid*, increase Fe/Hf.

---

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) on a short aliphatic chain decrease Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can participate in intramolecular hydrogen bonding, which may reduce the availability of oxygen lone pairs for coordination with Fe ions. Additionally, the increased hydrophilicity and potential steric hindrance can impede effective Fe binding.

  - **Examples**: 
    - **Low Fe/Hf**: 
      - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (gluconic acid)

  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**: 
      - Modifiers with terminal hydroxyl groups on longer chains, such as *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*, may not significantly decrease Fe/Hf.

---

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers containing an aromatic ring with electron-donating groups (e.g., amino, hydroxy, methoxy) decrease Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid by increasing electron density on the aromatic ring. This reduces the propensity of the carboxylate to coordinate with Fe ions, leading to lower Fe loading.

  - **Examples**: 
    - **Low Fe/Hf**: 
      - *4-aminobenzoic acid*
      - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*
      - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*

  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**: 
      - Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups, such as *4-nitrobenzoic acid*, increase Fe/Hf.

---

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers with aldehyde groups (-CHO) adjacent to the carboxylic acid group decrease Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups can participate in side reactions, such as oxidation or polymerization, reducing the effective concentration of the modifier. They may also form internal hydrogen bonds or engage in resonance structures that decrease the availability of coordinating oxygen atoms.

  - **Examples**: 
    - **Low Fe/Hf**: 
      - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
      - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*

  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**: 
      - Modifiers without aldehyde groups, such as *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*, increase Fe/Hf.

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers containing polyether chains ending with a carboxylic acid group increase Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: Polyether chains enhance solubility and flexibility, allowing the terminal carboxylate group to access and coordinate with Fe ions more effectively. The ether oxygens may also participate in coordination or stabilize the Fe complex through dipole interactions.

  - **Examples**: 
    - **High Fe/Hf**: 
      - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
      - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**: 
      - Modifiers without polyether chains, such as *octanoic acid*, do not exhibit increased Fe/Hf.

---

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers with highly electronegative substituents (e.g., fluorine atoms) on aliphatic chains decrease Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: Electronegative atoms like fluorine withdraw electron density from the carboxylate group, reducing its ability to donate electron density to Fe ions. This weakens metal-ligand interactions and lowers Fe loading.

  - **Examples**: 
    - **Low Fe/Hf**: 
      - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*

  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**: 
      - Modifiers without electronegative substituents, such as *5-aminopentanoic acid*, increase Fe/Hf.

---

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers that contain bulky groups adjacent to coordinating sites decrease Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: Bulky substituents can create steric hindrance, impeding the approach and binding of Fe ions to the coordinating groups. This reduces the efficiency of metal loading onto the catalyst.

  - **Examples**: 
    - **Low Fe/Hf**: 
      - *4-methylbenzoic acid*
      - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid*

  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**: 
      - Modifiers without bulky groups near coordinating sites, such as *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid*, increase Fe/Hf.

---

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers with multiple coordinating groups appropriately spaced to act as multidentate ligands increase Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: Multidentate ligands can form multiple bonds with a single Fe ion, creating more stable complexes. The spatial arrangement of coordinating groups is crucial for effective chelation.

  - **Examples**: 
    - **High Fe/Hf**: 
      - *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid* (hydroxy and carboxyl groups)
      - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (lysine derivative with amino and amide groups)

  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**: 
      - Modifiers with coordinating groups too distant or improperly oriented, such as *octanoic acid*, do not increase Fe/Hf.

---

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers with carbonyl groups adjacent to nitrogen atoms in ring structures (e.g., lactams, keto-pyridines) decrease Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: The electron-withdrawing effect of the carbonyl group reduces the electron density on the nitrogen atom, diminishing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions. Additionally, ketone groups may not participate effectively in coordination.

  - **Examples**: 
    - **Low Fe/Hf**: 
      - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
      - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*

  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**: 
      - Modifiers without adjacent carbonyl groups, such as *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid*, increase Fe/Hf.

---

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers containing both ether linkages and coordinating nitrogen atoms increase Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: Ether linkages provide flexibility and solubility, while nitrogen atoms offer strong coordination sites for Fe ions. The combination enhances the overall binding affinity for Fe.

  - **Examples**: 
    - **High Fe/Hf**: 
      - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**: 
      - Modifiers lacking nitrogen atoms or ether linkages, such as *octanoic acid*, do not exhibit increased Fe/Hf.

      - *4-aminobenzoic acid* (amine on aromatic ring reduces flexibility)

---

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers containing thiol groups (-SH) alongside carboxylic acid groups increase Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: Thiol groups form strong coordinate bonds with Fe ions due to the lone pair electrons on sulfur. The combination of thiol and carboxylate groups enables the modifier to chelate Fe ions effectively, enhancing metal binding.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:

  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *4-hydroxybenzoic acid* (has hydroxyl group instead of thiol)
      - *Octanoic acid* (no thiol group)

---

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers containing an aromatic ring with an electron-withdrawing group (e.g., nitro (-NO₂), halogen (-Br), pyridyl) at the para position relative to a carboxylic acid group increase Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid by stabilizing the negative charge on the carboxylate anion, enhancing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions. This leads to stronger metal-ligand interactions and higher Fe loading.

      - *4-aminobenzoic acid* (electron-donating amino group)

---

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers containing an aromatic ring with an electron-donating group (e.g., amino (-NH₂), hydroxyl (-OH), methyl (-CH₃)) at the para position relative to a carboxylic acid group decrease Fe/Hf* (Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value == False).

  - **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid by destabilizing the carboxylate anion. This reduces the carboxylate's ability to coordinate with Fe ions, leading to weaker metal-ligand interactions and lower Fe loading.

      - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (nicotinic acid; nitrogen adjacent to carboxylic acid group)

---

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) on a short aliphatic chain decrease Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can engage in intramolecular hydrogen bonding or increase steric hindrance, reducing available coordination sites for Fe ions. Increased hydrophilicity may also adversely affect interactions with the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (gluconic acid)
      - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*
    - **Structural Features**:

---

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers containing perfluorinated or highly fluorinated aliphatic chains decrease Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: Fluorine atoms are highly electronegative and withdraw electron density from coordinating oxygen atoms, reducing their ability to donate electron pairs to Fe ions. This weakens metal-ligand interactions and lowers Fe loading.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*
      - *4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid*
    - **Structural Features**:

---

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers containing aldehyde groups (-CHO) adjacent to the carboxylic acid group decrease Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups may engage in side reactions or form intramolecular interactions that interfere with Fe coordination. The proximity of the aldehyde can create steric hindrance, reducing effective metal binding.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
      - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*
    - **Structural Features**:
      - Aromatic ring
      - Aldehyde group (-CHO) adjacent to or in conjugation with carboxylic acid (-COOH)

  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:

---

- **Rule 9**: *Simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups decrease Fe/Hf* (Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value == False).

  - **Explanation**: These modifiers interact weakly with Fe ions due to the absence of additional coordinating sites. Limited coordination reduces Fe loading onto the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *Octanoic acid*
      - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*
    - **Structural Features**:
      - Aliphatic chain
      - Only carboxylic acid group (-COOH)
      - No additional coordinating groups (e.g., amine, hydroxyl, thiol)

  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *5-aminopentanoic acid* (presence of amine group)
      - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (additional hydroxyl group)

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers containing polyether chains ending with a carboxylic acid or amine group increase Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: Polyether chains increase solubility and flexibility, allowing terminal coordinating groups to interact effectively with Fe ions. Ether oxygens may also contribute to coordination through lone pair electrons, enhancing Fe binding.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
      - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*
    - **Structural Features**:
      - Polyether chain (-O-CH₂-CH₂-)ₙ
      - Terminal carboxylic acid (-COOH) or primary amine (-NH₂)

  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *Modifiers lacking polyether chains or with terminal groups that do not coordinate effectively*

---

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers containing an aromatic ring fused to a lactone or lactam ring with a carboxylic acid group increase Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: The fused ring system provides rigidity and multiple coordination sites. The lactone or lactam can interact with Fe ions through carbonyl oxygens, enhancing metal binding and increasing Fe loading.

      - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*
    - **Structural Features**:
      - Fused aromatic and lactone/lactam rings
      - Carbonyl groups
      - Carboxylic acid group (-COOH)

  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid* (smaller ring system; less effective coordination)

---

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains increase Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: The aromatic side chain can provide additional π-π interactions and potential coordination sites. The amino and carboxylate groups facilitate chelation with Fe ions, enhancing metal binding.

---

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains increase Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: The combination of an amino group, carboxylate group, and aromatic side chain provides multiple coordination sites and potential for π-π interactions. This enhances the ligand's ability to chelate Fe ions effectively.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (phenylalanine)
      - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid* (aromatic ketone and methoxy groups)
    - **Structural Features**:
      - α-Amino acid structure
      - Aromatic side chain (e.g., phenyl group, substituted phenyl)
      - Carboxylic acid group (-COOH)

  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *Aliphatic amino acids without aromatic side chains (unless covered by other rules)*

---

  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *Modifiers lacking polyether chains or with non-coordinating terminal groups*

---

- **Rule 10**: *Simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups decrease Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: These modifiers have limited ability to chelate Fe ions due to the absence of additional donor atoms or functional groups. The single carboxylate group provides minimal interaction, resulting in lower Fe loading.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *Octanoic acid*
      - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*
    - **Structural Features**:
      - Straight-chain aliphatic acids
      - Only carboxylic acid groups (-COOH)
      - Lack of additional coordinating groups (e.g., amine, hydroxyl, thiol)

  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *Modifiers with additional functional groups capable of coordinating Fe ions*

---

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers containing fused aromatic systems with carbonyl groups and a carboxylic acid increase Fe/Hf.*

      - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid* (smaller ring system; fewer coordination sites)

---

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers with long aliphatic chains terminating in a hydroxyl group (-OH) increase Fe/Hf when the chain length allows sufficient flexibility and reduced steric hindrance.*

  - **Explanation**: A long aliphatic chain with a terminal hydroxyl group can coordinate with Fe ions while minimizing steric interference. The increased chain length provides flexibility for optimal interaction with the catalyst surface.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*
    - **Structural Features**:
      - Aliphatic chain of seven or more carbon atoms
      - Terminal hydroxyl group (-OH)
      - Carboxylic acid group (-COOH)

  - **Counter-Examples**:

      - *4-nitrobenzoic acid* (electron-withdrawing group)
      - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (electron-withdrawing pyridyl group)

---

- **Rule 8**: *Simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups decrease Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: These modifiers have limited ability to chelate Fe ions due to the absence of additional donor atoms or functional groups. The single carboxylate group provides minimal interaction, resulting in lower Fe loading.

  - **Examples**:

Supported by examples like *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*, the coverage is acceptable but may benefit from additional data points.

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13** suggests that long aliphatic chains terminating in a hydroxyl group increase Fe/Hf when chain length allows sufficient flexibility. The rule is somewhat less clear due to the conditional nature ("when the chain length allows sufficient flexibility"), which may be subjective. The explanation provides some insight into steric factors affecting coordination. It combines sub-structures (long aliphatic chain, terminal hydroxyl group), meeting complexity. However, with limited examples (e.g., *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*), the coverage may be insufficient.

- **Comment 14**: **Rule 14** states that modifiers with multiple electron-donating groups increase Fe/Hf if they can coordinate in a chelating fashion. The rule's conditional phrasing makes it less clear and potentially challenging to apply. The explanation provides insight into how chelation can overcome electron-donating effects. It considers combinations of sub-structures, satisfying complexity. However, limited examples reduce the rule's coverage, and more data points are needed to strengthen it.

- **Comment 15**: **Rule 15** specifies that hydroxyaromatic acids decrease Fe/Hf unless additional coordinating groups enable chelation. The rule is somewhat complex due to the exception clause but remains clear. The explanation offers good insight into how extra coordinating groups can offset electron-donating effects of hydroxyl groups. It considers multiple sub-structures and their interactions, fulfilling complexity. Supported by examples (*4-hydroxybenzoic acid* decreasing Fe/Hf and exceptions like *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*), the coverage is adequate. The rule balances complexity and coverage reasonably well.

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers containing a primary amine group (-NH₂) attached to an aliphatic chain of at least five carbon atoms, along with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), increase Fe/Hf* (Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value == True).

  - **Explanation**: The primary amine and carboxylic acid groups can act as bidentate ligands, effectively chelating Fe ions. The longer aliphatic chain provides flexibility and reduces steric hindrance, enhancing coordination with Fe and increasing its loading onto the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *5-aminopentanoic acid*
      - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
      - *8-aminooctanoic acid*
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (glutamic acid; amine too close to multiple carboxylic groups, leading to intramolecular interactions)
      - *4-aminobenzoic acid* (amine directly attached to aromatic ring, less flexible for chelation)

---

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers containing an aromatic ring with a strong electron-withdrawing group (e.g., nitro (-NO₂), halomethyl (-CH₂X), pyridyl) at the para position relative to a carboxylic acid group increase Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid by stabilizing the negative charge of the carboxylate anion. This enhances the ligand's ability to coordinate with Fe ions, strengthening metal-ligand interactions and promoting higher Fe loading.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *4-nitrobenzoic acid*
      - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid*
      - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*
      - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid*
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (electron-donating methyl group)
      - *4-hydroxybenzoic acid* (electron-donating hydroxyl group)

---

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers containing sulfur-containing groups such as thiols (-SH) or thioethers (-S-) in combination with carboxylic acid groups increase Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: Sulfur atoms have a high affinity for transition metals like iron. The presence of sulfur-containing groups enhances coordination with Fe ions due to strong metal-sulfur interactions, increasing Fe loading onto the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*
      - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid*
      - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid*
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *Modifiers lacking sulfur-containing groups*
      - *Octanoic acid* (no sulfur groups present)

---

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are α-amino acids with aromatic side chains increase Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: The combination of an amino group (-NH₂), a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), and an aromatic side chain provides multiple coordination sites. The aromatic ring can participate in π-π stacking interactions, and the amino and carboxylate groups can chelate Fe ions, enhancing metal loading.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (phenylalanine)
      - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (contains additional amide group for coordination)
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (glutamic acid; aliphatic side chain with extra carboxylate group may hinder coordination)

---

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) on a short aliphatic chain decrease Fe/Hf* (Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value == False).

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase hydrophilicity and can engage in extensive hydrogen bonding, which may compete with metal coordination sites. This reduces the ability of the molecule to effectively chelate Fe ions, leading to lower Fe loading.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (gluconic acid)
      - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (single hydroxyl group on a longer chain reduces steric hindrance)

---

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers containing electron-donating groups (e.g., amino (-NH₂), hydroxyl (-OH), methoxy (-OCH₃)) attached to an aromatic ring decrease Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid by destabilizing the carboxylate anion. This weakens the ligand's ability to coordinate with Fe ions, resulting in lower Fe loading onto the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *4-aminobenzoic acid*
      - *4-hydroxybenzoic acid*
      - *4-methylbenzoic acid*
      - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*
      - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *4-nitrobenzoic acid* (electron-withdrawing group enhances coordination)
      - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (electron-withdrawing pyridyl group)

---

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers containing long aliphatic chains (seven or more carbon atoms) terminating in a hydroxyl group (-OH) increase Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: The long aliphatic chain provides flexibility and reduces steric hindrance, allowing the terminal hydroxyl group to effectively coordinate with Fe ions. This enhances metal-ligand interactions and increases Fe loading.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *Short-chain hydroxy acids with increased steric hindrance or hydrophilicity*
      - *Modifiers lacking terminal hydroxyl groups*

---

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers containing multiple fluorine atoms (perfluorinated or highly fluorinated aliphatic chains) decrease Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: Fluorine atoms are highly electronegative and create strong carbon-fluorine bonds, leading to low polarizability. This reduces the molecule's ability to coordinate with Fe ions, resulting in lower Fe loading onto the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*
      - *4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid*
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *Non-fluorinated analogs with coordinating groups*

---

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups decrease Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: The absence of additional donor atoms or functional groups limits the ability of the modifier to chelate Fe ions effectively. Single carboxylate groups provide minimal interaction, resulting in lower Fe loading.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *Octanoic acid*
      - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *Modifiers with additional coordinating groups such as amines or thiols*

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers containing aldehyde groups (-CHO) adjacent to or conjugated with a carboxylic acid group on an aromatic ring decrease Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups may engage in side reactions or form internal hydrogen bonds, interfering with metal coordination. Their presence can also introduce steric hindrance or unfavorable electronic effects that reduce the ligand's affinity for Fe ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
      - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *Aromatic carboxylic acids without aldehyde groups or with electron-withdrawing substituents*

---

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids lacking additional coordinating functional groups decrease Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: Heterocycles without additional donor atoms provide limited coordination sites, resulting in weaker interactions with Fe ions and lower Fe loading onto the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
      - *pyridine-3-carboxylic acid*
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (additional aromatic ring and coordinating groups enhance Fe binding)

---

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers containing polyether chains ending with a primary amine (-NH₂) or carboxylic acid group (-COOH) increase Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: Polyether chains improve solubility and flexibility, allowing terminal functional groups to coordinate effectively with Fe ions. Ether oxygen atoms may also participate in coordination through lone pair donation, enhancing metal-ligand interactions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
      - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *Modifiers lacking polyether chains or terminal coordinating groups*

---

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers containing multiple electron-donating groups arranged to facilitate chelation increase Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: While electron-donating groups typically decrease coordination ability, when arranged properly, they can act as multidentate ligands, effectively chelating Fe ions and enhancing metal loading onto the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid* (methoxy groups positioned for chelation)
      - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (amide and amine groups enable multidentate coordination)
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *Modifiers with electron-donating groups that are not positioned to chelate Fe ions effectively*

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers containing a primary amine group (-NH₂) attached to a linear aliphatic chain of five or more carbon atoms, along with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), increase Fe/Hf* (Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value == True).

  - **Explanation**: The primary amine and carboxylic acid groups can act as bidentate ligands, coordinating with Fe ions to form stable chelate complexes. The longer aliphatic chain provides flexibility and reduces steric hindrance, facilitating effective coordination with Fe. This enhances the incorporation of Fe into the catalyst structure, increasing the Fe/Hf ratio.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *5-aminopentanoic acid*
      - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
      - *8-aminooctanoic acid*
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (glutamic acid; the presence of two carboxylic acid groups in close proximity may lead to intramolecular hydrogen bonding, hindering Fe coordination)
      - *4-aminobenzoic acid* (amine attached directly to an aromatic ring, which is less flexible and may not position the amine optimally for Fe chelation)

---

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers containing an aromatic ring with a strong electron-withdrawing group (e.g., nitro (-NO₂), halomethyl (-CH₂X), pyridyl) at the para position relative to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) increase Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups enhance the acidity of the carboxylic acid, stabilizing the carboxylate anion. This increases the ligand's ability to coordinate with Fe ions through stronger ionic interactions. Additionally, such substituents can facilitate π-backbonding and improve overall coordination strength, leading to higher Fe loading.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *4-nitrobenzoic acid*
      - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid*
      - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*
      - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid*
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (methyl group is electron-donating, decreasing acidity and coordination ability)
      - *4-hydroxybenzoic acid* (hydroxyl group is electron-donating through resonance)

---

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers containing sulfur-containing groups such as thiols (-SH) or thioethers (-S-) in combination with a carboxylic acid group increase Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: Sulfur atoms have a high affinity for transition metals due to their larger atomic radius and availability of d-orbitals for bonding. The presence of sulfur-containing groups provides additional coordination sites, forming stronger complexes with Fe ions. This enhances Fe incorporation into the catalyst, increasing the Fe/Hf ratio.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*
      - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid*
      - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid*
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *Octanoic acid* (lacks sulfur-containing groups)
      - *Modifiers without sulfur atoms*

---

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are α-amino acids with aromatic side chains increase Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: The combination of an amino group (-NH₂), a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), and an aromatic side chain provides multiple sites for coordination. The aromatic ring can engage in π-interactions with Fe ions, and the amino and carboxylate groups can act as chelating ligands. This multidentate coordination enhances Fe binding, increasing the Fe/Hf ratio.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (phenylalanine)
      - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (contains additional amide group for coordination)
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (glutamic acid; additional carboxylic acid group may interfere with coordination)
      - *Aliphatic amino acids without aromatic side chains*

---

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) on a short aliphatic or cyclic chain decrease Fe/Hf* (Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value == False).

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase hydrophilicity and can participate in extensive hydrogen bonding networks. This may interfere with metal coordination by occupying potential coordination sites or causing steric hindrance. Additionally, the high polarity of such molecules may reduce their affinity for the coordination environment of Fe ions, leading to lower Fe incorporation.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (gluconic acid)
      - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (single hydroxyl group on a longer chain minimizes steric hindrance and allows for coordination)

---

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers containing electron-donating groups (e.g., amino (-NH₂), hydroxyl (-OH), methoxy (-OCH₃)) directly attached to an aromatic ring decrease Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid by destabilizing the carboxylate anion, making it a weaker ligand for metal coordination. They can also donate electron density to the aromatic ring, reducing its ability to participate in π-interactions with Fe ions. This leads to weaker metal-ligand bonding and lower Fe loading.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *4-aminobenzoic acid*
      - *4-hydroxybenzoic acid*
      - *4-methylbenzoic acid*
      - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*
      - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *4-nitrobenzoic acid* (electron-withdrawing group enhances coordination)
      - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (pyridyl group withdraws electron density)

---

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers containing long aliphatic chains (seven or more carbon atoms) terminating in a hydroxyl group (-OH) increase Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: The long aliphatic chain offers flexibility and reduces steric hindrance around the coordinating group. The terminal hydroxyl group can act as a ligand, coordinating with Fe ions. The hydrophobic chain may also facilitate interactions within the catalyst matrix, promoting higher Fe incorporation.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *Short-chain hydroxy acids with multiple hydroxyl groups causing steric hindrance*
      - *Octanoic acid* (lacks a terminal hydroxyl group)

---

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers containing multiple fluorine atoms (perfluorinated or highly fluorinated aliphatic chains) decrease Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: Fluorine's high electronegativity and the strength of C-F bonds reduce the polarizability of the molecule. This limits the ability of the modifier to donate electron density for metal coordination. The fluorinated chains are also highly hydrophobic, which may inhibit effective interaction with Fe ions, resulting in lower Fe loading.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*
      - *4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid*
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *Non-fluorinated analogs with coordinating groups*

---

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups decrease Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: Simple aliphatic carboxylic acids with only a single carboxylate group offer limited coordination ability. Without additional donor atoms or functional groups, these modifiers cannot form strong interactions with Fe ions, leading to minimal Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *Octanoic acid*
      - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid* (although it has two carboxylic acid groups, the lack of additional coordinating groups reduces Fe binding)
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *Modifiers with additional coordinating groups like amines or thiols*

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers containing aldehyde groups (-CHO) adjacent to or conjugated with a carboxylic acid group on an aromatic ring decrease Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups can engage in side reactions or form internal hydrogen bonds, which may interfere with metal coordination. The presence of the aldehyde can also create steric hindrance or electronic effects that reduce the ability of the carboxylate group to coordinate with Fe ions, resulting in lower Fe loading.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
      - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *Aromatic carboxylic acids without aldehyde groups or with electron-withdrawing groups*

---

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids lacking additional coordinating functional groups decrease Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: Heterocyclic carboxylic acids without additional donor atoms provide limited coordination sites. The heteroatoms within the ring may not be positioned optimally for coordination, leading to weaker interactions with Fe ions and lower Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
      - *pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (nicotinic acid)
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (additional aromatic ring and positioning of nitrogen enhance Fe binding)

---

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers containing polyether chains ending with a coordinating group such as a primary amine (-NH₂) or carboxylic acid (-COOH) increase Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: Polyether chains provide flexibility and solubility, allowing the terminal coordinating groups to effectively interact with Fe ions. Ether oxygen atoms can contribute to coordination through lone pair donation. The combination of these features facilitates stronger metal-ligand interactions, enhancing Fe incorporation.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
      - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *Modifiers lacking polyether chains or terminal coordinating groups*
      - *Polyols with multiple hydroxyl groups causing steric hindrance*

---

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers containing multiple electron-donating groups arranged to facilitate chelation increase Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: While electron-donating groups generally decrease coordination ability, when appropriately positioned, they can act as multidentate ligands. The spatial arrangement allows simultaneous coordination of multiple donor atoms to the Fe ion, forming stable chelate complexes and increasing Fe loading.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid* (methoxy groups positioned for chelation)
      - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (amide and amine groups enable multidentate coordination)
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *Modifiers with electron-donating groups not positioned for effective chelation*
      - *Electron-donating groups causing steric hindrance or competing interactions*

---

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers containing keto groups (C=O) adjacent to carboxylic acid groups on a flexible chain increase Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: Keto groups adjacent to carboxylic acids can participate in enolization and offer additional coordination sites. The flexibility of the aliphatic chain permits the keto and carboxylate groups to chelate Fe ions effectively, enhancing Fe incorporation.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*
      - *4-oxoheptanoic acid* (if it exhibited high Fe/Hf in data)
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *Aromatic keto acids where rigidity limits coordination*

---

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers with conjugated systems that include additional heteroatoms capable of coordination increase Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: Conjugated systems with heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen) can delocalize electron density and provide multiple coordination sites. These systems can form stronger complexes with Fe ions through synergistic interactions, increasing Fe loading.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid* (pyridyl group contributes nitrogen for coordination)
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *Heterocycles without additional coordinating groups or with less optimal positioning*

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal primary amino group (-NH₂) increase Fe/Hf* (Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value == True).

  - **Explanation**: The primary amino group at the end of an aliphatic chain can coordinate with Fe ions through its lone pair of electrons. The flexibility of the aliphatic chain allows the amino and carboxylate groups to effectively chelate the Fe ion, enhancing metal binding and increasing the Fe/Hf ratio.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *5-aminopentanoic acid*
      - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
      - *8-aminooctanoic acid*
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *Octanoic acid* (lacks an amino group)
      - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (amino group is α to carboxylate and additional carboxyl groups may hinder coordination)

---

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers containing an aromatic carboxylic acid with an electron-withdrawing group (e.g., nitro (-NO₂), bromomethyl (-CH₂Br), pyridyl) at the para position increase Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups enhance the acidity of the carboxylic acid, facilitating deprotonation and forming a stronger carboxylate ligand. The electron-deficient aromatic ring can also interact more effectively with Fe ions, improving coordination and increasing Fe incorporation.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *4-nitrobenzoic acid*
      - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid*
      - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (methyl group is electron-donating)
      - *4-aminobenzoic acid* (amino group is electron-donating)

---

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers containing sulfur-containing functional groups such as thiols (-SH) or thioethers (-S-) increase Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: Sulfur atoms have lone pairs of electrons and larger atomic orbitals that can form strong coordinate bonds with Fe ions. The presence of sulfur enhances metal binding affinity, leading to higher Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid*
      - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*
      - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid*
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *Octanoic acid* (lacks sulfur-containing groups)
      - *Modifiers without sulfur atoms*

---

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains (e.g., phenylalanine) increase Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: The combination of an amino group (-NH₂), a carboxylate group (-COO⁻), and an aromatic side chain provides multiple coordination sites. The aromatic ring can participate in π-stacking interactions with the Fe ion, while the amino and carboxylate groups can chelate the metal, enhancing Fe binding.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (phenylalanine)
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (glutamic acid; lacks aromatic side chain)
      - *Aliphatic amino acids without aromatic side chains*

---

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) on a short aliphatic or cyclic chain decrease Fe/Hf* (Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value == False).

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can engage in extensive hydrogen bonding and increase steric hindrance, which may interfere with Fe coordination. High hydrophilicity can reduce the modifier's affinity for Fe ions, leading to lower Fe incorporation.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (gluconic acid)
      - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (single hydroxyl group on a longer chain minimizes interference)

---

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers containing electron-donating groups (e.g., amino (-NH₂), hydroxyl (-OH), methyl (-CH₃)) directly attached to an aromatic ring decrease Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups increase the electron density of the aromatic ring, reducing the acidity of the carboxylic acid and weakening its ability to coordinate with Fe ions. This leads to weaker metal-ligand interactions and lower Fe loading.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *4-aminobenzoic acid*
      - *4-hydroxybenzoic acid*
      - *4-methylbenzoic acid*
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *4-nitrobenzoic acid* (electron-withdrawing group enhances coordination)
      - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (pyridyl group withdraws electron density)

---

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers with perfluorinated aliphatic chains decrease Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: Fluorine's high electronegativity reduces the electron density available for coordination. Perfluorinated chains are also highly hydrophobic, which may hinder effective interactions with Fe ions, resulting in lower Fe incorporation.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*
      - *4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid*
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *Non-fluorinated analogs with coordinating groups*

---

- **Rule 8**: *Simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups decrease Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: Without additional donor atoms or functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, thiol), these modifiers have limited ability to form strong coordination bonds with Fe ions, leading to minimal Fe incorporation.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *Octanoic acid*
      - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *Modifiers with additional coordinating groups like amines or thiols*

---

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers containing an aldehyde group (-CHO) on an aromatic ring decrease Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups can engage in side reactions or form internal hydrogen bonds, which may interfere with metal coordination. The presence of the aldehyde can create steric hindrance or electronic effects that reduce the ligand's ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
      - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *Aromatic carboxylic acids without aldehyde groups or with electron-withdrawing groups*

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups decrease Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: Heterocyclic rings may not position their heteroatoms optimally for Fe coordination. Without extra donor atoms or functional groups, these modifiers form weaker interactions with Fe ions, resulting in lower Fe loading.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
      - *pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (nicotinic acid)
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (additional aromatic ring and positioning of nitrogen enhance Fe binding)

---

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers containing polyether chains ending with a coordinating functional group (e.g., amino (-NH₂), carboxyl (-COOH)) increase Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: Polyether chains provide flexibility and solubility, allowing terminal coordinating groups to effectively interact with Fe ions. Ether oxygen atoms can also contribute to coordination through lone pair donation, enhancing metal-ligand interactions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
      - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *Modifiers lacking polyether chains or terminal coordinating groups*
      - *Polyols with multiple hydroxyl groups causing steric hindrance*

---

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers containing keto groups (C=O) adjacent to carboxylic acid groups on aromatic rings increase Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: Keto groups adjacent to carboxylic acids can participate in enolization, offering additional coordination sites. The planar structure and conjugation facilitate strong interactions with Fe ions, enhancing metal binding.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *Aromatic keto acids where rigidity limits coordination*

---

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers with methoxy groups (-OCH₃) arranged to facilitate chelation increase Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: Methoxy groups can act as electron donors, and when appropriately positioned, they can coordinate with Fe ions. The combined effect of multiple methoxy groups can enhance the overall binding affinity to Fe.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid*
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *Modifiers with methoxy groups not positioned for effective coordination*
      - *Electron-donating groups causing steric hindrance*

---

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers containing long-chain aliphatic acids with a terminal hydroxyl group (-OH) increase Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: The terminal hydroxyl group can act as an additional coordination site, and the long aliphatic chain provides flexibility, allowing the hydroxyl and carboxylate groups to effectively chelate the Fe ion.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *Short-chain polyhydroxy acids with steric hindrance*
      - *Aliphatic acids without terminal hydroxyl groups*

---

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers containing conjugated systems with heteroatoms capable of coordination increase Fe/Hf.*

  - **Explanation**: Conjugated systems with heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen in pyridine rings) can delocalize electron density and provide multiple coordination sites. This facilitates stronger and more stable complexes with Fe ions, increasing Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid* (pyridyl group contributes nitrogen for coordination)
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *Heterocycles without additional coordinating groups or with less optimal positioning of heteroatoms*

      - *Polyols with excessive hydroxyl groups causing hindrance*

---

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups decrease Fe/Hf*.

  - **Explanation**: Without additional donor atoms or functional groups (like amino or hydroxyl groups), these modifiers have limited ability to form strong coordination bonds with Fe ions, leading to minimal Fe incorporation.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *Octanoic acid*
      - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *Aliphatic acids with terminal amino or hydroxyl groups*

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers containing fluorinated aliphatic chains decrease Fe/Hf*.

  - **Explanation**: Fluorine's high electronegativity reduces the electron density available for coordination with Fe ions. Perfluorinated chains are also highly hydrophobic, which may hinder interactions with Fe ions, resulting in lower Fe incorporation.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*
      - *4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid*
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *Non-fluorinated analogs with coordinating groups*
      - *Modifiers with electron-donating groups*

---

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains increase Fe/Hf*.

  - **Explanation**: The aromatic side chain can participate in π-stacking interactions with Fe ions, while the amino and carboxylate groups provide additional coordination sites. This combination enhances metal binding and Fe incorporation.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (phenylalanine)
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (glutamic acid; lacks aromatic side chain)
      - *Aliphatic amino acids without aromatic features*

---

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers containing coordinating heterocycles (e.g., pyridine rings) attached to carboxylic acids increase Fe/Hf*.

  - **Explanation**: Heterocyclic nitrogen atoms can coordinate with Fe ions, forming strong metal-ligand bonds. The aromatic system and positioning of the heteroatom facilitate effective coordination.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*
      - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid*
  - **Counter-Examples**:

      - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (nicotinic acid; less effective positioning)
      - *Heterocycles without coordinating groups or optimal orientation*

---

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers containing electron-withdrawing keto groups (C=O) adjacent to carboxylate groups on aromatic systems increase Fe/Hf*.

  - **Explanation**: Keto groups adjacent to carboxylate can participate in resonance structures and enolization, offering additional coordination sites. The conjugated system facilitates strong interactions with Fe ions, enhancing metal binding.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*
  - **Counter-Examples**:

      - *Modifiers with isolated keto groups not adjacent to coordinating sites*

---

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers with methoxy groups (-OCH₃) on aromatic rings that are positioned to facilitate chelation increase Fe/Hf*.

  - **Explanation**: Methoxy groups can act as electron donors, and when appropriately positioned (e.g., ortho to carboxylate), they can coordinate with Fe ions. This enhances metal-ligand interactions and Fe incorporation.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid*
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *Modifiers where methoxy groups are not optimally positioned*
      - *Methoxy groups causing steric hindrance*

---

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers with electron-donating groups on aliphatic chains that create chelating sites increase Fe/Hf*.

  - **Explanation**: Donor groups such as amino (-NH₂) or hydroxyl (-OH) on aliphatic chains can coordinate with Fe ions when positioned appropriately. The presence of multiple coordination sites enhances metal binding.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid* (terminal amino group on a flexible chain)
      - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid*
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:

---

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers containing sulfur-functional groups such as thiols (-SH) or thioethers (-S-) increase Fe/Hf*.

  - **Explanation**: Sulfur atoms have lone pairs and larger orbitals, allowing them to form strong coordinate bonds with Fe ions. The presence of sulfur enhances metal-binding affinity, leading to higher Fe incorporation.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid*
      - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*

      - *Modifiers lacking terminal coordinating groups or with short, rigid chains*

---

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups decrease Fe/Hf*.

  - **Explanation**: Without additional donor atoms or functional groups (like amino or hydroxyl groups), these modifiers have limited ability to form strong coordination bonds with Fe ions, leading to minimal Fe incorporation.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *Octanoic acid*
      - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *Aliphatic acids with terminal amino or hydroxyl groups*
      - *Modifiers with additional coordinating functionalities*

---

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers containing fluorinated aliphatic chains decrease Fe/Hf*.

  - **Explanation**: Fluorine's high electronegativity reduces the electron density available for coordination with Fe ions. Perfluorinated chains are also highly hydrophobic, which may hinder interactions with Fe ions, resulting in lower Fe incorporation.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*
      - *4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid*

  - **Explanation**: Chelation involves the formation of multiple bonds between a ligand and a single metal ion, enhancing complex stability and Fe incorporation. Adjacent functional groups can coordinate simultaneously to the Fe ion.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (aspartic acid)
  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (glutamic acid; side chain may not favor effective chelation due to longer distance)

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers containing coordinating heterocycles (e.g., pyridine rings) attached to carboxylic acids increase Fe/Hf*.

  - **Explanation**: Heterocyclic nitrogen atoms can coordinate with Fe ions, forming strong metal-ligand bonds. The aromatic system and positioning of the heteroatom facilitate effective coordination.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*
      - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid*
  - **Counter-Examples**:

  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid*
- **Counter-Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (nicotinic acid; nitrogen not optimally positioned for coordination)
    - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid* (may not coordinate effectively due to electronic factors)

---

**Rule 10**: *Simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups decrease Fe/Hf*.

- **Explanation**: Without additional donor atoms or functional groups (like amino or hydroxyl groups), these modifiers have limited ability to form strong coordination bonds with Fe ions, leading to minimal Fe incorporation.

- **Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:

    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*
- **Counter-Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - *Modifiers with terminal amino groups (e.g., omega-amino acids)*
    - *Modifiers with additional coordinating functionalities*

---

**Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with omega-hydroxyl groups (terminal hydroxyl groups) can increase Fe/Hf*.

- **Explanation**: Terminal hydroxyl groups can participate in coordination with Fe ions, potentially forming hydrogen bonds or coordinating directly, which enhances Fe incorporation.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*
- **Counter-Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - *Modifiers with internal hydroxyl groups or multiple hydroxyls leading to steric hindrance*

---

**Rule 12**: *Modifiers with aromatic rings linked to carboxylic acids via ketone groups increase Fe/Hf*.

- **Explanation**: Ketone groups adjacent to aromatic rings can coordinate with Fe ions, and the extended conjugation may enhance the stability of the metal-ligand complex.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*
    - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid*

    - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (methyl group is electron-donating)
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid* (amino group is electron-donating)

---

**Rule 3**: *Modifiers containing sulfur functional groups such as thiols (-SH) or thioethers (-S-)* **increase Fe/Hf**.

- **Explanation**: Sulfur atoms are soft Lewis bases with a high affinity for transition metals like Fe. The presence of sulfur-containing groups enhances coordination through strong metal-sulfur interactions, leading to increased Fe incorporation.

    - *4-nitrobenzoic acid* (electron-withdrawing group)
    - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid* (electron-withdrawing group)

---

**Rule 6**: *Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) without additional strong coordinating groups* **decrease Fe/Hf**.

- **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can increase hydrophilicity and introduce steric hindrance, impeding effective coordination with Fe ions. Without other strong coordinating groups, these modifiers have a reduced ability to chelate Fe.

- **Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (gluconic acid)
    - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid* (multiple hydroxyl groups)

    - *Modifiers with hydroxyl groups adjacent to other strong coordinating groups*

---

**Rule 7**: *Modifiers containing fluorinated aliphatic chains or fluorinated functional groups* **decrease Fe/Hf**.

- **Explanation**: Fluorine's high electronegativity withdraws electron density from adjacent atoms, reducing their ability to coordinate with Fe ions. Fluorinated chains are also hydrophobic, which may hinder interactions with Fe ions in polar solvents.

- **Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid* (perfluorinated chain)

---

**Rule 9**: *Simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups* **decrease Fe/Hf**.

- **Explanation**: Without functional groups that can provide additional coordination sites (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, sulfur-containing groups), these modifiers have limited ability to form strong complexes with Fe ions, resulting in lower Fe incorporation.

- **Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - *Octanoic acid* (straight-chain fatty acid)
    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid* (ketone group may not coordinate effectively)
  - **Structural Features**:
    - Aliphatic chain without coordinating substituents
- **Counter-Examples**:

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (seven-carbon chain with terminal hydroxyl and carboxyl groups)
  - **Structural Features**:
    - Linear aliphatic chain (6-8 carbons)
    - Carboxyl group at one end, hydroxyl group at the opposite end
- **Counter-Examples**:

    - *Compounds with multiple hydroxyl groups causing steric hindrance*

---

**Rule 11**: *Modifiers containing conjugated carbonyl groups adjacent to aromatic rings* **increase Fe/Hf**.

    - *Compounds where the carbonyl group is not favorably positioned for coordination*

---

**Rule 12**: *Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing thioether groups* **increase Fe/Hf**.

- **Explanation**: Amino acids like methionine have thioether groups in their side chains, which can coordinate with Fe ions through sulfur atoms. The amino and carboxyl groups of the amino acid backbone may also participate in coordination, enhancing Fe incorporation.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid* (methionine derivative)
  - **Structural Features**:
    - Thioether-containing side chain (–S–CH₃)

- **Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid* (steric hindrance around nitrogen and carbonyl groups)
    - *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid* (bulky aromatic group adjacent to amide linkage)
  - **Structural Features**:
    - Bulky groups near coordinating atoms
    - Steric hindrance preventing effective chelation
- **Counter-Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - *Modifiers with minimal steric hindrance around coordinating groups*

---

**Rule 14**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with meta-substituted coordinating groups* **decrease Fe/Hf**.

- **Explanation**: Substituents in the meta position are less effective at delocalizing electron density toward the coordinating carboxyl group compared to para-substituted groups. This positioning reduces the overall ability of the modifier to coordinate with Fe ions.

- **Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (nicotinic acid)
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid* (substituents in positions that do not favor coordination enhancement)
  - **Structural Features**:
    - Substituents at meta positions relative to the carboxyl group
    - Less effective in enhancing coordination
- **Counter-Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:

    - *Modifiers with para-substituted coordinating groups

---

**Rule 15**: *Modifiers containing rigid cyclic structures without coordinating heteroatoms* **decrease Fe/Hf**.

- **Explanation**: Rigid ring systems lacking coordinating heteroatoms or functional groups cannot effectively interact with Fe ions. The absence of flexible coordinating sites leads to lower Fe incorporation.

- **Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid* (rigid heterocycle with limited coordination ability)
    - *Modifiers with saturated rings and no coordinating substituents*
  - **Structural Features**:

These rules have been developed by carefully analyzing the provided dataset and considering the underlying physicochemical properties that influence Fe coordination. Each rule combines multiple substructures—functional groups and structural motifs—to predict whether a modifier will increase or decrease the Fe/Hf ratio.

- **Direct Combination of Substructures**: The rules focus on specific combinations of functional groups (e.g., carboxyl with amino or sulfur groups) and structural features (e.g., chain length, aromatic systems, heterocycles) that directly influence Fe binding.

- **Physicochemical Considerations**: Explanations are grounded in principles such as electron donation and withdrawal, chelation ability, steric effects, and coordination chemistry. This ensures the rules are scientifically sound and based on chemical intuition.

- **Clear Predictions**: Each rule explicitly states whether the presence of certain structural features will lead to a high or low Fe/Hf value, allowing for unambiguous application to new modifiers.

- **Coverage and Balance**: The set includes 15 rules that strike a balance between broad applicability (simple rules with higher coverage) and specificity (complex rules targeting particular structural features). This approach ensures that most modifiers in the dataset are accounted for, while also allowing for nuanced predictions.

By applying these rules, researchers can effectively predict the impact of new molecular modifiers on the Fe/Hf ratio. This aids in the rational design and optimization of catalysts for the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction, ultimately improving reaction outcomes and efficiency.

- **Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

- **Structural Features**:
  - Electron-donating groups (e.g., -OH) near the carboxyl group
  - Lack of additional coordinating functional groups

---

**Rule 14**: **Modifiers with terminal hydroxyl groups distant from the carboxyl group on medium-length aliphatic chains increase Fe/Hf**.

- **Explanation**: Terminal hydroxyl groups can act as additional coordination sites when adequately separated from the carboxyl group, facilitating Fe binding.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

- **Structural Features**:
  - Aliphatic chain (7 carbons)
  - Carboxyl group at one end
  - Terminal hydroxyl group at the opposite end
  - Sufficient chain length for flexible coordination

---

**Rule 15**: **Modifiers with rigid heterocyclic structures lacking accessible coordinating atoms decrease Fe/Hf**.

- **Explanation**: Steric hindrance and the absence of suitable coordination sites reduce the ability of these modifiers to interact effectively with Fe ions.

- **Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

- **Structural Features**:
  - Rigid heterocyclic rings
  - Nitrogen atoms in positions not favorable for coordination
  - Minimal flexibility for ligand binding
