**Start of Rules**

---

**Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are omega-amino aliphatic carboxylic acids (terminal amino group on the opposite end of the carboxyl group) increase Fe/Hf* (**Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value == True**).

- **Explanation**: The presence of a terminal amino group at the end opposite to the carboxyl group allows for bidentate coordination with Fe ions. This dual binding enhances complex stability and increases Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - *5-aminopentanoic acid*
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*
- **Counter-Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - *Octanoic acid* (no amino group present)
    - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (amino group is alpha to the carboxyl, not terminal)

---

**Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with **para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups capable of coordinating** (e.g., nitro (-NO₂), bromomethyl (-CH₂Br), pyridyl rings) increase Fe/Hf*.

- **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing its ability to deprotonate and coordinate with Fe ions. Additionally, substituents like pyridyl rings can directly coordinate with Fe, further stabilizing the complex.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - *4-nitrobenzoic acid*
    - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid*
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*
- **Counter-Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (methyl group is electron-donating)
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid* (aldehyde group may not effectively coordinate)

---

**Rule 3**: *Modifiers containing sulfur functional groups such as thiols (-SH) or thioethers (-S-) increase Fe/Hf*.

- **Explanation**: Sulfur atoms have lone pairs and are polarizable, allowing them to form strong coordinate bonds with Fe ions. The presence of sulfur enhances metal-binding affinity, leading to higher Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* (thiol group on aromatic ring)
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid* (aliphatic thiol)
    - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid* (thioether group)
- **Counter-Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - *Benzoic acid* (lacks sulfur-containing groups)
    - *Octanoic acid* (no sulfur substituents)

---

**Rule 4**: *Modifiers that can form stable chelate rings through adjacent amino and carboxyl groups increase Fe/Hf*.

- **Explanation**: Chelation involves the formation of multiple bonds between a ligand and a single metal ion, enhancing complex stability and Fe incorporation. Adjacent functional groups can coordinate simultaneously to the Fe ion, forming five- or six-membered rings.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (aspartic acid)
    - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (phenylalanine)
- **Counter-Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (glutamic acid; longer side chain may reduce chelation efficiency)
    - *Modifiers where amino and carboxyl groups are too distant for effective chelation*

---

**Rule 5**: *Modifiers containing flexible polyether chains terminated with coordinating functional groups (e.g., carboxyl (-COOH), amino (-NH₂)) increase Fe/Hf*.

- **Explanation**: Polyether chains provide flexibility and solubility, allowing terminal coordinating groups to effectively interact with Fe ions. Ether oxygen atoms can also participate in coordination through lone pair donation, enhancing metal-ligand interactions.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*
- **Counter-Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - *Modifiers lacking terminal coordinating groups or with short, rigid chains*
    - *Polyether chains without coordinating end groups*

---

**Rule 6**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with **para-substituted electron-donating groups** (e.g., amino (-NH₂), hydroxyl (-OH), methoxy (-OCH₃), methyl (-CH₃)) decrease Fe/Hf* (**Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value == False**).

- **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, reducing its ability to deprotonate and coordinate with Fe ions. This diminishes metal-ligand interactions and lowers Fe incorporation.

- **Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid*
    - *4-hydroxybenzoic acid*
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid*
    - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*
- **Counter-Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - *4-nitrobenzoic acid* (electron-withdrawing group)
    - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid* (electron-withdrawing group)

---

**Rule 7**: *Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) without additional strong coordinating groups decrease Fe/Hf*.

- **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase the hydrophilicity and can lead to steric hindrance around the coordination sites. This can interfere with effective coordination of Fe ions, resulting in lower Fe incorporation.

- **Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (gluconic acid)
    - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*
- **Counter-Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (single hydroxyl group, less steric hindrance)

---

**Rule 8**: *Modifiers containing fluorinated aliphatic chains or fluorinated functional groups decrease Fe/Hf*.

- **Explanation**: Fluorine's high electronegativity reduces the electron density available for coordination with Fe ions. Fluorinated chains are also highly hydrophobic, which may hinder interactions with Fe ions, resulting in lower Fe incorporation.

- **Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*
    - *4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid*
- **Counter-Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - *Non-fluorinated analogs with coordinating groups*
    - *Modifiers with electron-donating groups capable of coordinating*

---

**Rule 9**: *Modifiers containing coordinating heterocycles (e.g., pyridine rings) directly attached to carboxylic acids increase Fe/Hf*.

- **Explanation**: Heterocyclic nitrogen atoms can coordinate with Fe ions, forming strong metal-ligand bonds. The aromatic system and positioning of the heteroatom facilitate effective coordination.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid*
- **Counter-Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (nicotinic acid; nitrogen not optimally positioned for coordination)
    - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid* (may not coordinate effectively due to electronic factors)

---

**Rule 10**: *Simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups decrease Fe/Hf*.

- **Explanation**: Without additional donor atoms or functional groups (like amino or hydroxyl groups), these modifiers have limited ability to form strong coordination bonds with Fe ions, leading to minimal Fe incorporation.

- **Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - *Octanoic acid*
    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*
- **Counter-Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - *Modifiers with terminal amino groups (e.g., omega-amino acids)*
    - *Modifiers with additional coordinating functionalities*

---

**Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with omega-hydroxyl groups (terminal hydroxyl groups) can increase Fe/Hf*.

- **Explanation**: Terminal hydroxyl groups can participate in coordination with Fe ions, potentially forming hydrogen bonds or coordinating directly, which enhances Fe incorporation.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*
- **Counter-Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - *Modifiers with internal hydroxyl groups or multiple hydroxyls leading to steric hindrance*

---

**Rule 12**: *Modifiers with aromatic rings linked to carboxylic acids via ketone groups increase Fe/Hf*.

- **Explanation**: Ketone groups adjacent to aromatic rings can coordinate with Fe ions, and the extended conjugation may enhance the stability of the metal-ligand complex.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*
    - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid*
- **Counter-Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - *Compounds lacking ketone groups adjacent to aromatic systems*

These rules illustrate the relationship between molecular modifiers' structural features and their impact on the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst. By combining multiple substructures and considering physicochemical properties such as electron-donating or -withdrawing effects, steric factors, chelation ability, and coordination capabilities, these rules help predict whether a modifier will increase or decrease Fe loading. This understanding enables the rational design of modifiers to optimize catalyst performance and control the yield of the target radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------
