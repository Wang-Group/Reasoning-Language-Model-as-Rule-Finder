**Start of Rules**

---

**Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are linear aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal primary amino group (ω-amino acids) increase Fe/Hf**.

- **Explanation**: The presence of both a carboxyl group at one end and a terminal amino group at the opposite end allows the molecule to act as a bidentate ligand. This facilitates stronger chelation with Fe ions, enhancing their incorporation into the catalyst.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **Octanoic acid** (lacks terminal amino group)

- **Structural Features**:
  - Linear aliphatic chain (5–8 carbons)
  - Carboxyl group at one end (α-position)
  - Terminal primary amino group at the opposite end (ω-position)

---

**Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position increase Fe/Hf, while those with electron-donating groups decrease Fe/Hf**.

- **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups enhance the acidity of the carboxyl group and increase its ability to coordinate with Fe ions. Electron-donating groups reduce acidity and coordination effectiveness.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf** (electron-withdrawing groups):
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (-NO₂ group)
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (-CH₂Br group)
  - **Low Fe/Hf** (electron-donating groups):
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (-CH₃ group)
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (-NH₂ group)
    - **4-hydroxybenzoic acid** (-OH group)

- **Structural Features**:
  - Benzoic acid core
  - Substituent at the para position
  - Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., -NO₂, -Br)
  - Electron-donating groups (e.g., -NH₂, -CH₃, -OH)

---

**Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing sulfur atoms (thiol -SH or thioether -S- groups) enhance Fe/Hf**.

- **Explanation**: Sulfur atoms are good soft Lewis bases and form strong coordination bonds with Fe ions, improving metal-ligand interactions.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

- **Structural Features**:
  - Presence of sulfur-containing functional groups
  - Potential for multidentate coordination

---

**Rule 4**: **Modifiers with nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic rings, where the nitrogen is positioned to coordinate with Fe ions, increase Fe/Hf**.

- **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings like pyridine can act as strong coordination sites, enhancing Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nitrogen position less favorable for coordination)

- **Structural Features**:
  - Heteroaromatic ring with accessible nitrogen atom
  - Appropriate position relative to the carboxyl group for effective coordination

---

**Rule 5**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains decrease Fe/Hf**.

- **Explanation**: Perfluorinated chains are highly electronegative and hydrophobic, which can hinder coordination by reducing electron density at the coordinating atoms and creating steric hindrance.

- **Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

- **Structural Features**:
  - Alkyl chain fully substituted with fluorine atoms
  - Carboxyl group potentially less accessible due to electron-withdrawing effects

---

**Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are linear aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups decrease Fe/Hf**.

- **Explanation**: Without extra coordination sites, these modifiers interact weakly with Fe ions, leading to lower metal incorporation.

- **Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **Octanoic acid**
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

- **Structural Features**:
  - Linear aliphatic chain
  - Only carboxyl group(s) present
  - Lack of additional functional groups that can coordinate with Fe

---

**Rule 7**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups, especially polyhydroxylated aliphatic acids, decrease Fe/Hf**.

- **Explanation**: Excessive hydroxyl groups increase hydrophilicity and can lead to steric hindrance, reducing effective coordination with Fe ions.

- **Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (a sugar acid)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**

- **Structural Features**:
  - Multiple hydroxyl groups along the aliphatic chain
  - Lack of strong coordinating atoms beyond hydroxyls

---

**Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing multiple strong coordinating functional groups (e.g., amino and sulfur groups) enhance Fe/Hf**.

- **Explanation**: The combination of different coordinating atoms (nitrogen, sulfur) provides multiple binding sites, strengthening chelation with Fe ions.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (contains both amino and thioether groups)
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

- **Structural Features**:
  - Presence of multiple functional groups capable of coordination
  - Potential for multidentate chelation

---

**Rule 9**: **Modifiers with ether linkages terminating in coordinating groups (e.g., carboxyl or amino groups) increase Fe/Hf**.

- **Explanation**: Ether oxygen atoms can serve as additional coordination sites, and flexible chains may facilitate binding of terminal groups to Fe ions.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

- **Structural Features**:
  - Polyether chain (e.g., ethylene glycol units)
  - Terminal coordinating group (carboxyl or amino)
  - Flexibility allows multiple points of interaction with Fe

---

**Rule 10**: **Modifiers with conjugated aromatic systems containing carbonyl groups (e.g., conjugated ketones or lactones adjacent to aromatic rings) increase Fe/Hf**.

- **Explanation**: Conjugation enhances electron delocalization, improving the ligand's ability to coordinate with Fe ions through resonance stabilization.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**

- **Structural Features**:
  - Conjugated carbonyl groups adjacent to aromatic rings
  - Potential for π-backbonding with Fe ions

---

**Rule 11**: **Modifiers with aldehyde (formyl) groups adjacent to carboxyl groups decrease Fe/Hf**.

- **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups can participate in side reactions or reduce the availability of coordination sites, hindering Fe binding.

- **Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

- **Structural Features**:
  - Aldehyde group ortho or para to the carboxyl group
  - Potential for intramolecular interactions that limit Fe coordination

---

**Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic or sulfur-containing side chains increase Fe/Hf**.

- **Explanation**: Aromatic rings and sulfur atoms in side chains provide additional coordination sites, enhancing Fe incorporation.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine)
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid; extra carboxyl group may hinder coordination)

- **Structural Features**:
  - Amino acid backbone
  - Side chains containing aromatic rings or sulfur atoms
  - Potential for multidentate binding

---

**Rule 13**: **Modifiers with electron-donating substituents adjacent to the carboxyl group, without other strong coordinating groups, decrease Fe/Hf**.

- **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups reduce the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxyl group, weakening interaction with Fe ions.

- **Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

- **Structural Features**:
  - Electron-donating groups (e.g., -OH) near the carboxyl group
  - Lack of additional coordinating functional groups

---

**Rule 14**: **Modifiers with terminal hydroxyl groups distant from the carboxyl group on medium-length aliphatic chains increase Fe/Hf**.

- **Explanation**: Terminal hydroxyl groups can act as additional coordination sites when adequately separated from the carboxyl group, facilitating Fe binding.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

- **Structural Features**:
  - Aliphatic chain (7 carbons)
  - Carboxyl group at one end
  - Terminal hydroxyl group at the opposite end
  - Sufficient chain length for flexible coordination

---

**Rule 15**: **Modifiers with rigid heterocyclic structures lacking accessible coordinating atoms decrease Fe/Hf**.

- **Explanation**: Steric hindrance and the absence of suitable coordination sites reduce the ability of these modifiers to interact effectively with Fe ions.

- **Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

- **Structural Features**:
  - Rigid heterocyclic rings
  - Nitrogen atoms in positions not favorable for coordination
  - Minimal flexibility for ligand binding

These rules illustrate the relationship between specific structural features of molecular modifiers and their effect on the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst. By considering combinations of functional groups and underlying physicochemical properties, these rules help predict whether a modifier will increase or decrease Fe incorporation. This understanding aids in the rational design and selection of modifiers to optimize the catalyst's performance in the target radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------
