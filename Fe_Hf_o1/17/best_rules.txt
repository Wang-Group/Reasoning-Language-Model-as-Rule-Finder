**Start of Rules**

---

**Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal primary amino group (-NH₂) located at least four carbons away from the carboxyl group** result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

- **Counter-example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid)

- **Rationale**: The extended carbon chain provides flexibility, allowing the terminal amino group to effectively coordinate with Fe ions without significant steric hindrance. In contrast, when the amino group is too close to the carboxyl group, as in glutamic acid, coordination is less favorable.

---

**Rule 2**: **Modifiers containing thiol (-SH) groups**, whether **aliphatic** or **aromatic**, lead to a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Thiol groups have a strong affinity for metal ions due to the lone pair on sulfur. This enhances coordination with Fe ions, increasing their incorporation into the catalyst.

---

**Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, such as **nitro (-NO₂)** or **halomethyl (-CH₂X)** groups, result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
  - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group by stabilizing the negative charge upon deprotonation. This promotes better coordination with metal ions like Fe, enhancing their binding to the catalyst.

---

**Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing pyridine rings with accessible nitrogen atoms for coordination**, especially when connected via a flexible linker, lead to a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**

- **Counter-example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid)

- **Rationale**: The nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring can coordinate with Fe ions. Optimal positioning and flexibility enhance this interaction. In nicotinic acid, the nitrogen's position relative to the carboxyl group may hinder effective coordination.

---

**Rule 5**: **Modifiers with flexible ether linkages terminating with coordinating groups**, such as **amino (-NH₂)** or **carboxyl (-COOH)** groups, result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
  - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Ether linkages provide molecular flexibility, allowing terminal coordinating groups to adjust their orientation for optimal interaction with Fe ions. This flexibility enhances Fe binding to the catalyst.

---

**Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing coordinating groups**, such as an additional **carboxyl (-COOH)**, **amino (-NH₂)**, or **amide (-CONH₂)** group, especially when the side chain is short, increase the **Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid)
  - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

- **Counter-example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid)

- **Rationale**: Additional coordinating groups on short side chains enhance the ability to bind Fe ions. Longer side chains may introduce steric hindrance, reducing coordination efficiency.

---

**Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position**, such as **hydroxy (-OH)** or **amino (-NH₂)** groups, lead to a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
  - **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**
  - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, making deprotonation less favorable. This reduces the ability of the carboxyl group to coordinate with metal ions like Fe, resulting in lower Fe incorporation.

---

**Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups** lead to a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Example**:
  - **Octanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: The lack of functional groups offering lone pairs for coordination (such as amino or hydroxyl groups) limits the modifier's ability to bind Fe ions effectively. The carboxyl group alone may not provide sufficient coordination.

---

**Rule 9**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups within an aliphatic chain (polyols)** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Example**:
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid)

- **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can engage in intramolecular or intermolecular hydrogen bonding, limiting their availability to coordinate with Fe ions. This reduces the overall coordination sites available for Fe binding.

---

**Rule 10**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Example**:
  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms decreases the electron density on potential coordinating atoms, destabilizing coordination interactions with Fe ions. Additionally, fluorinated chains may introduce steric hindrance.

---

**Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (-CHO) or keto (=O) groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** lead to a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
  - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

- **Rationale**: Aldehyde or keto groups near the carboxyl group can alter electron distribution and steric environment, potentially interfering with coordination to Fe ions.

---

**Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing bulky aromatic side chains that could hinder coordination** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Example**:
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan)

- **Rationale**: Bulky side chains may sterically hinder the approach of Fe ions to coordinating sites on the modifier, reducing effective coordination and Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

**Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are long-chain hydroxyalkanoic acids with the hydroxyl group positioned several carbons away from the carboxyl group** can result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Example**:
  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: The hydroxyl group positioned away from the carboxyl group can act as an additional coordination site without causing significant steric hindrance. This promotes effective binding of Fe ions.

---

**Rule 14**: **Modifiers with methoxy (-OCH₃) groups attached to aromatic rings and additional coordinating features** result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Example**:
  - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Methoxy groups can influence the electronic properties of the aromatic ring, potentially enhancing coordination interactions when other coordinating groups are present. They may also affect the solubility and overall binding environment.

---

**Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are conjugated aromatic compounds with accessible coordination sites**, such as those containing **diketone** or **dioxo** groups, lead to a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Example**:
  - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

- **Rationale**: Conjugated systems with electron-rich areas can stabilize coordination with Fe ions through delocalization, enhancing Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

**End of Rules**

---

These rules are designed to predict whether a molecular modifier will result in a **high** or **low Fe/Hf value** based on its structural features and the physicochemical properties of its functional groups. The considerations include:

1. **Coordination Ability**: Functional groups like **amino (-NH₂)**, **thiol (-SH)**, **pyridine nitrogen**, and **hydroxyl (-OH)** offer lone pairs for coordination with Fe ions, enhancing Fe incorporation.

2. **Electronic Effects**: **Electron-withdrawing groups** (e.g., nitro, halogens, perfluoroalkyl) can either increase or decrease coordination ability depending on their impact on the acidity and electron density of coordinating atoms. **Electron-donating groups** (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) may decrease acidity and coordination ability when attached to aromatic rings.

3. **Steric Factors**: Bulky groups or improper positioning can hinder effective coordination. Optimal chain length and flexibility allow functional groups to access Fe ions without steric hindrance.

4. **Molecular Flexibility**: Flexible linkers and ether chains enable coordinating groups to adjust their spatial orientation for optimal interaction with Fe ions.

5. **Hydrogen Bonding and Solvation**: Excessive hydroxyl groups can engage in hydrogen bonding, reducing the availability of coordination sites for Fe ions.

6. **Functional Group Interactions**: Reactive groups like aldehydes or ketones near coordinating sites may interfere with Fe binding due to side reactions or altered electron distribution.

By applying these rules, researchers can predict the impact of different molecular modifiers on the **Fe/Hf ratio** in the **Hf-TPY-MOL(Fe)** catalyst. This knowledge facilitates the design of modifiers that optimize the catalyst's performance, ultimately improving the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------
