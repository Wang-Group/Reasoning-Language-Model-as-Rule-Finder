**Start of Rules**

---

**Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing a primary amino group (-NH₂) connected by an aliphatic chain of at least three carbons to the carboxyl group** result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
  - **4-aminobutanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: The primary amino group provides a strong coordination site for Fe ions. The flexible aliphatic chain allows the amino and carboxyl groups to act as bidentate ligands, forming stable chelate complexes with Fe. This enhances the incorporation of Fe into the catalyst.

---

**Rule 2**: **Modifiers containing thiol (-SH) groups** result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Thiol groups are excellent ligands due to the high affinity of sulfur for transition metals like Fe. The strong Fe–S bond increases the stability of the Fe-modifier complex, promoting higher Fe incorporation into the catalyst structure.

---

**Rule 3**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, such as **nitro (-NO₂)** or **halomethyl (-CH₂Hal)** groups, result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
  - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

- **Counter-examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(electron-donating methyl group)*
  - **4-aminobenzoic acid** *(electron-donating amino group)*

- **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group by stabilizing the negative charge on the carboxylate anion. This enhances its ability to coordinate with Fe ions, leading to increased Fe incorporation.

---

**Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing a pyridine ring** result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**

- **Counter-example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(possible steric hindrance or less optimal positioning of nitrogen)*

- **Rationale**: The lone pair on the nitrogen atom of the pyridine ring can coordinate with Fe ions. When the pyridine nitrogen is accessible and properly positioned, it enhances Fe coordination, increasing Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

**Rule 5**: **Modifiers with flexible ether linkages and terminal coordinating groups**, such as **amino (-NH₂)** or **carboxyl (-COOH)** groups, result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
  - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Ether linkages increase molecular flexibility, allowing coordinating groups to adopt favorable conformations for Fe binding. This flexibility facilitates the formation of stable Fe complexes, enhancing Fe incorporation.

---

**Rule 6**: **Amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking bulky substituents** result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Example**:
  - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(Phenylalanine)*

- **Counter-example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(Tryptophan, bulky indole group)*

- **Rationale**: Aromatic side chains can interact with Fe ions via π-electron interactions or direct coordination. Minimal steric hindrance in the side chain allows effective Fe binding, enhancing Fe incorporation.

---

**Rule 7**: **Modifiers with multiple carboxyl groups capable of chelation**, such as **dicarboxylic acids or amino acids with carboxylate side chains**, result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(Aspartic acid)*
  - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(Glutamic acid)*

- **Rationale**: Multiple carboxyl groups can act as bidentate ligands, chelating Fe ions more effectively. Chelation increases the stability of the Fe complex, promoting higher incorporation into the catalyst.

---

**Rule 8**: **Modifiers with electron-donating groups at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids**, such as **amino (-NH₂)** or **hydroxy (-OH)** groups, result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
  - **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**
  - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group by increasing electron density. This reduces the ability of the carboxylate to coordinate with Fe ions, leading to lower Fe incorporation.

---

**Rule 9**: **Simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional strong coordinating functional groups** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Example**:
  - **Octanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Without additional coordinating sites, these modifiers rely solely on the carboxyl group for Fe binding. The single coordination site is insufficient for significant Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

**Rule 10**: **Modifiers with bulky or sterically hindered groups near coordinating sites** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(Tryptophan)*
  - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(Acetylated lysine)*

- **Rationale**: Bulky groups near coordination sites create steric hindrance, impeding Fe ion access. This reduces coordination efficiency and Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

**Rule 11**: **Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl (-OH) groups near the carboxyl group (polyhydroxy carboxylic acids)** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Example**:
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(Gluconic acid)*

- **Rationale**: Extensive hydrogen bonding from multiple hydroxyl groups can sequester lone pairs on oxygen atoms, reducing their availability for Fe coordination. This diminishes Fe incorporation.

---

**Rule 12**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains attached to the carboxyl group** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Example**:
  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Perfluorinated groups are highly electron-withdrawing, excessively lowering electron density on the carboxylate oxygen. This weakens coordination ability with Fe ions, resulting in decreased Fe incorporation.

---

**Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing conjugated carbonyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group without additional strong coordinating groups** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
  - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

- **Rationale**: Conjugation with additional carbonyl groups delocalizes electron density away from the carboxylate oxygen, reducing its coordinating ability with Fe ions and leading to lower Fe incorporation.

---

**Rule 14**: **Modifiers with unique chelating structures, such as fused aromatic systems containing carbonyl groups**, can result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Example**:
  - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

- **Rationale**: Fused aromatic systems with multiple carbonyl groups can offer several coordination sites, enabling effective chelation with Fe ions. This enhances Fe incorporation despite lacking typical strong coordinating functional groups.

---

**Rule 15**: **Modifiers with flexible aliphatic chains terminating with coordinating functional groups on both ends**, such as **amino (-NH₂)** and **carboxyl (-COOH)** groups, result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Example**:
  - **(2S)-6-aminohexanoic acid** *(Lysine)*

- **Rationale**: The presence of coordinating groups at both ends of a flexible chain allows for simultaneous coordination with Fe ions, forming stable chelate rings that enhance Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

**End of Rules**

These rules have been developed to predict whether a molecular modifier will result in a **high** or **low Fe/Hf value** based on its structural features, considering the underlying physical and chemical properties.

**Key Considerations in the Rules:**

1. **Coordination Ability of Functional Groups**:
   - **Strong Coordinating Groups**: Primary amino (-NH₂) and thiol (-SH) groups enhance coordination with Fe ions (**Rules 1 and 2**).
   - **Multiple Coordination Sites**: Modifiers with two or more coordinating groups can chelate Fe ions effectively (**Rules 1, 5, 7, and 15**).

2. **Electronic Effects**:
   - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups**: Increase carboxylate acidity, enhancing Fe coordination (**Rule 3**).
   - **Electron-Donating Groups**: Decrease carboxylate acidity, weakening Fe coordination (**Rule 8**).
   - **Excessive Electron Withdrawal**: Highly electron-withdrawing perfluoroalkyl groups may overly diminish coordination ability (**Rule 12**).

3. **Steric Factors**:
   - **Steric Hindrance**: Bulky substituents near coordinating sites hinder Fe access (**Rule 10**).
   - **Optimal Chain Length and Flexibility**: Adequate separation between coordinating groups allows effective chelation without steric clashes (**Rules 1, 5, and 15**).

4. **Molecular Flexibility**:
   - **Flexible Linkers**: Ether or aliphatic chains enable coordinating groups to adopt favorable conformations (**Rules 5 and 15**).

5. **Hydrogen Bonding and Delocalization**:
   - **Polyhydroxy Compounds**: Extensive hydrogen bonding can reduce available coordination sites (**Rule 11**).
   - **Conjugated Carbonyl Groups**: Delocalization can weaken Fe coordination (**Rule 13**).

6. **Unique Structural Features**:
   - **Chelating Structures**: Fused aromatic systems with carbonyl groups provide effective Fe coordination (**Rule 14**).

By applying these rules, researchers can predict the Fe/Hf value outcome for modifiers based on their molecular structure. This aids in the rational design and selection of molecular modifiers to optimize catalyst performance in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

**Summary of Modifiers and Predicted Fe/Hf Values Based on the Rules:**

- **High Fe/Hf Value (True)**:
  - Modifiers with primary amino groups connected by flexible chains (**Rule 1**).
  - Modifiers containing thiol groups (**Rule 2**).
  - Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing para substituents (**Rule 3**).
  - Modifiers containing pyridine rings (**Rule 4**).
  - Modifiers with flexible ether linkages and terminal coordinating groups (**Rule 5**).
  - Amino acids with non-bulky aromatic side chains (**Rule 6**).
  - Modifiers with multiple carboxyl groups capable of chelation (**Rule 7**).
  - Modifiers with unique chelating structures (**Rule 14**).
  - Modifiers with flexible chains terminating with coordinating groups (**Rule 15**).

- **Low Fe/Hf Value (False)**:
  - Modifiers with electron-donating para substituents on aromatic rings (**Rule 8**).
  - Simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups (**Rule 9**).
  - Modifiers with bulky substituents causing steric hindrance (**Rule 10**).
  - Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups (**Rule 11**).
  - Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains (**Rule 12**).
  - Modifiers with conjugated carbonyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group (**Rule 13**).

By focusing on these structural features, chemists can tailor molecular modifiers to achieve the desired Fe/Hf ratio, thereby controlling the catalytic properties and optimizing the yield of the target reaction.
