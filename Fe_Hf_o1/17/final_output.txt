    Current_Rules:
    Based on the analysis of the provided dataset and considering the underlying physical and chemical properties of the molecular modifiers, here are the generated rules that describe the relationship between the modifiers' structural features and the **Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value**. These rules aim to predict whether a given modifier will result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)** or a **low Fe/Hf value (False)** in the catalyst Hf-TPY-MOL(Fe).

---

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids containing a terminal primary amino group (-NH₂) on medium to long chains (5 to 8 carbons)** lead to a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. The primary amino group acts as a strong coordinating site for Fe ions, and the flexible aliphatic chain facilitates effective chelation.

  _Examples:_
  
  - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with **aromatic carboxylic acids bearing strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, such as **nitro (-NO₂), bromomethyl (-CH₂Br), or thiol (-SH)**, result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  _Examples:_
  
  - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
  - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing **sulfur-functional groups**, specifically **thiols (-SH)** or **thioethers (-S-)**, contribute to a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. Sulfur atoms are soft Lewis bases that coordinate strongly with Fe ions.

  _Examples:_
  
  - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**
  - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with **pyridine rings connected to the carboxyl group directly or via a linker** lead to a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. The nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring can coordinate with Fe ions, and the structure allows for effective interaction.

  _Examples:_
  
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers having **long ether chains ending with amino groups (-NH₂) or carboxyl groups (-COOH)** promote a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. The ether linkages provide flexibility, enabling coordinating groups to interact effectively with Fe ions.

  _Examples:_
  
  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
  - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **short-chain aliphatic dicarboxylic amino acids**, such as **aspartic acid**, result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. The proximity of amino and carboxylate groups facilitates chelation with Fe ions.

  _Example:_
  
  - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid)

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with **long-chain hydroxy acids**, specifically **hydroxyl groups (-OH) at terminal positions on medium-length chains (6 to 7 carbons)**, may contribute to a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. The hydroxyl group can coordinate with Fe ions, aided by chain flexibility.

  _Example:_
  
  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **heterocyclic structures with potential coordinating atoms (e.g., oxygen or nitrogen)** can have a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. These atoms act as coordination sites for Fe ions.

  _Example:_
  
  - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position**, such as **amino (-NH₂), hydroxy (-OH), or methyl (-CH₃)**, lead to a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, reducing its coordination ability with Fe ions.

  _Examples:_
  
  - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
  - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
  - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers rich in **hydroxyl groups (-OH) on aliphatic chains or rings (polyols)** exhibit a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. Extensive hydrogen bonding with solvent molecules can reduce the availability of coordination sites for Fe ions.

  _Examples:_
  
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid)
  - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with **perfluorinated alkyl chains** lead to a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. The strong electronegativity and steric bulk of fluorinated groups hinder coordination with Fe ions.

  _Example:_
  
  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers containing **aldehyde groups (-CHO) attached to the aromatic ring** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. Aldehyde groups may engage in side reactions or form intramolecular interactions, hindering coordination with Fe ions.

  _Examples:_
  
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
  - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups** lead to a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. The lack of donor atoms like nitrogen or sulfur limits coordination with Fe ions.

  _Example:_
  
  - **Octanoic acid**

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with **ketone groups (-C=O) on aliphatic chains** have a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. Ketone groups may not effectively coordinate with Fe ions compared to other donor groups.

  _Example:_
  
  - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aromatic amino acids with bulky or polar side chains**, such as **tryptophan**, contribute to a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. Steric hindrance and potential intramolecular interactions reduce the effectiveness of Fe coordination.

  _Example:_
  
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan)

**End of Rules**

---

These rules are formulated to directly combine multiple sub-structures and functional groups within the modifiers, considering their physical and chemical properties such as coordination ability, electron-donating or withdrawing effects, and molecular flexibility. Each rule aims to predict the **Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value** based on the presence of specific functional groups or structural features in the modifiers.

By prioritizing rules that cover a broader range of the dataset and maintaining a balance between simplicity and complexity, these rules provide a comprehensive understanding of how different modifiers influence the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst. Modifiers that facilitate effective coordination with Fe ions, such as those containing primary amino groups, sulfur atoms, or pyridine rings, tend to result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. In contrast, modifiers lacking such coordinating groups or containing functional groups that hinder coordination lead to a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

---

**Note:** These rules replace the previous set, refining the descriptions and ensuring they align with the requirements. The focus is on combining multiple functional groups and considering the underlying chemical principles to make accurate predictions for modifiers not included in the dataset.---------------------------------------------------------------

    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal primary amino group (-NH₂) on medium-length chains (5 to 8 carbons)** result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. The terminal amino group acts as a strong coordination site for Fe ions, and the chain length provides flexibility for effective interaction.

  _Examples:_

  - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, such as **nitro (-NO₂), bromomethyl (-CH₂Br), or sulfanyl (-SH)**, lead to a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group and may provide additional coordination sites.

  _Examples:_

  - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
  - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing sulfur functional groups**, specifically **thiols (-SH) or thioethers (-S-)**, contribute to a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. Sulfur atoms are soft Lewis bases that form strong coordinate bonds with Fe ions.

  _Examples:_

  - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**
  - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with pyridine rings connected to carboxyl groups directly or via a linker** result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. The nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring provides an additional coordination site for Fe ions.

  _Examples:_

  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with small side-chain length or functional groups that enhance coordination**, such as **aspartic acid (short side chain)** and **phenylalanine (aromatic side chain)**, result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. Short or coordinating side chains facilitate effective interaction with Fe ions.

  _Examples:_

  - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid)
  - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine)

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing flexible ether linkages with terminal coordinating groups**, such as **amino (-NH₂)** or **carboxyl (-COOH)** groups, lead to a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. The ether chains provide flexibility, allowing the terminal groups to coordinate effectively with Fe ions.

  _Examples:_

  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
  - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal hydroxy group (-OH) on medium-length chains (5 to 8 carbons)** result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. The hydroxy group serves as an additional coordination site, enhancing interaction with Fe ions.

  _Example:_

  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing heterocyclic structures with coordinating atoms**, such as **oxygen or nitrogen within rings**, can lead to a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. These atoms provide additional sites for coordination with Fe ions.

  _Example:_

  - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-donating groups at the para position**, such as **amino (-NH₂), hydroxy (-OH), or methyl (-CH₃)**, result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  _Examples:_

  - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
  - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
  - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) on aliphatic chains (polyols)** lead to a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. Extensive hydroxylation increases hydrogen bonding with the solvent, reducing the availability of coordination sites for Fe ions.

  _Examples:_

  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid)
  - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with aldehyde groups (-CHO) attached to aromatic rings** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. Aldehyde groups may undergo side reactions or form intramolecular interactions, diminishing their coordination with Fe ions.

  _Examples:_

  - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
  - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with highly fluorinated alkyl chains or fluorinated acyl groups** lead to a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. Fluorination increases steric hindrance and electron-withdrawing effects, hindering effective coordination with Fe ions.

  _Examples:_

  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**
  - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. The lack of donor atoms like nitrogen or sulfur limits their ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  _Example:_

  - **Octanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing ketone groups (-C=O) within aliphatic chains** have a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. Ketone groups are less effective at coordinating with Fe ions compared to other donor groups.

  _Example:_

  - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains**, such as **tryptophan**, exhibit a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. Steric hindrance from bulky side chains reduces their ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  _Example:_

  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan)

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules are designed to predict whether the **Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value** will be **True** (high) or **False** (low) based on the structural features of the molecular modifiers. Each rule combines multiple functional groups and sub-structures to provide insights into how specific combinations influence the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst **Hf-TPY-MOL(Fe)**.

- Modifiers resulting in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)** typically contain functional groups that are strong Lewis bases or have atoms capable of coordinating with Fe ions, such as terminal amino groups, sulfur-containing groups, pyridine rings, flexible ether chains with coordinating termini, or terminal hydroxy groups on medium-length aliphatic chains.

- Modifiers leading to a **low Fe/Hf value (False)** often lack coordinating groups or possess functional groups that hinder coordination, such as electron-donating groups on aromatic rings, multiple hydroxyl groups causing extensive hydrogen bonding, aldehyde groups, highly fluorinated chains increasing steric hindrance, simple aliphatic acids without additional donor atoms, ketone groups within aliphatic chains, or bulky aromatic side chains causing steric hindrance.

By covering a broad range of the dataset and balancing between simple rules with wider coverage and complex rules with narrower focus, these rules provide a comprehensive understanding of the structural features affecting the Fe/Hf ratio. They can be applied to predict the **Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value** for new molecular modifiers by analyzing their functional groups and structural characteristics.

    Target Name: Fe/Hf
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal primary amino group (-NH₂) on medium-length chains (5 to 8 carbons)** result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. The terminal amino group acts as a strong coordination site for Fe ions, and the chain length provides flexibility for effective interaction.

  _Examples:_

  - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strongly electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, such as **nitro (-NO₂), bromomethyl (-CH₂Br), or sulfanyl (-SH)**, generally lead to a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. However, aldehyde groups (-CHO) at the para position result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

  _Examples:_

  - **High Fe/Hf (True):**

    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

  - **Low Fe/Hf (False):**

    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing sulfur functional groups**, specifically **thiols (-SH)** or **thioethers (-S-)**, contribute to a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. Sulfur atoms are soft Lewis bases that form strong coordinate bonds with Fe ions.

  _Examples:_

  - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**
  - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing a pyridine ring attached to an aromatic carboxylate group via a phenyl linker** result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. The extended conjugation and additional nitrogen coordination site enhance Fe ion binding.

  _Examples:_

  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**

  _Counter-example (Low Fe/Hf):_

  - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid)

---

- **Rule 5**: **Amino acids with small to moderately sized side chains that can provide additional coordination sites**, such as **carboxylate or aromatic groups**, result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. **Amino acids with bulky or long side chains** tend to result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)** due to steric hindrance reducing coordination efficiency.

  _Examples (High Fe/Hf):_

  - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid)
  - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine)

  _Examples (Low Fe/Hf):_

  - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid)
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan)

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with flexible ether linkages terminating with coordinating groups**, such as **amino (-NH₂)** or **carboxyl (-COOH)** groups, lead to a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. The ether chains provide flexibility, allowing terminal groups to coordinate effectively with Fe ions.

  _Examples:_

  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
  - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal hydroxy group (-OH) on medium-length chains** (7 carbons) can result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. The hydroxy group serves as an additional coordination site, enhancing interaction with Fe ions.

  _Example:_

  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing fused aromatic heterocycles with oxygen atoms within the ring system, especially when combined with carboxyl groups**, lead to a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. The fused ring structure and heteroatoms enhance coordination with Fe ions.

  _Example:_

  - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

  _Counter-example (Low Fe/Hf):_

  - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-donating groups at the para position**, such as **amino (-NH₂), hydroxy (-OH), or methyl (-CH₃)**, result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  _Examples:_

  - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
  - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
  - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) on aliphatic chains (polyols)** lead to a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. Extensive hydroxylation increases hydrogen bonding with the solvent, reducing the availability of coordination sites for Fe ions.

  _Examples:_

  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid)
  - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with highly fluorinated alkyl chains or fluorinated acyl groups** lead to a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. Fluorination increases steric hindrance and electron-withdrawing effects, hindering effective coordination with Fe ions.

  _Examples:_

  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**
  - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. The lack of donor atoms like nitrogen or sulfur limits their ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  _Example:_

  - **Octanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing ketone groups (-C=O) within aliphatic chains** have a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. Ketone groups are less effective at coordinating with Fe ions compared to other donor groups.

  _Example:_

  - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains**, such as **tryptophan**, exhibit a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. Steric hindrance from bulky side chains reduces their ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  _Example:_

  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan)

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with aldehyde groups (-CHO) attached to aromatic rings** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. Aldehyde groups may undergo side reactions or form intramolecular interactions, diminishing their coordination with Fe ions.

  _Examples:_

  - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
  - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

---

**End of Rules**

---

These refined rules are designed to predict whether the **Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value** will be **True** (high) or **False** (low) based on the structural features of the molecular modifiers. Each rule combines multiple functional groups and sub-structures to provide insights into how specific combinations influence the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst **Hf-TPY-MOL(Fe)**.

- **Modifiers resulting in a high Fe/Hf value (True)** typically contain functional groups that are strong Lewis bases or have atoms capable of coordinating with Fe ions, such as:

  - **Terminal amino groups** on medium-length aliphatic chains (Rule 1).
  - **Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups** like nitro, bromomethyl, or sulfanyl at the para position (Rule 2).
  - **Sulfur-containing groups** like thiols or thioethers (Rule 3).
  - **Pyridine rings attached via a phenyl linker**, providing extended conjugation (Rule 4).
  - **Small to moderately sized amino acids** with additional coordinating groups (Rule 5).
  - **Flexible ether chains terminating with coordinating groups** (Rule 6).
  - **Fused aromatic heterocycles with oxygen atoms** (Rule 8).

- **Modifiers leading to a low Fe/Hf value (False)** often lack coordinating groups or possess functional groups that hinder coordination, such as:

  - **Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups** like amino, hydroxy, or methyl at the para position (Rule 9).
  - **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups**, increasing hydrogen bonding with solvents (Rule 10).
  - **Highly fluorinated chains or acyl groups**, causing steric hindrance (Rule 11).
  - **Simple aliphatic acids** without additional donor atoms (Rule 12).
  - **Ketone groups** within aliphatic chains (Rule 13).
  - **Amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains**, causing steric hindrance (Rule 14).
  - **Aldehyde groups** attached to aromatic rings, potentially interfering with coordination (Rule 15).

By covering a broad range of the dataset and balancing simple rules with wider coverage and complex rules with narrower focus, these refined rules provide a comprehensive understanding of the structural features affecting the Fe/Hf ratio. They can be applied to predict the **Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value** for new molecular modifiers by analyzing their functional groups and structural characteristics.

---

**Note**: These rules are based on the provided dataset and aim to explain the observed relationships between molecular structures and the Fe/Hf ratio. They combine multiple functional groups and sub-structures to capture the nuances of coordination chemistry affecting the catalyst's reactivity.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal primary amino group (-NH₂) on medium-length chains (5 to 8 carbons)** result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. The terminal amino group acts as a strong coordination site for Fe ions, enhancing metal binding efficiency.

  _Examples:_

  - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, such as **nitro (-NO₂), bromomethyl (-CH₂Br), or sulfanyl (-SH)**, generally lead to a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group and enhance its ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  _Examples:_

  - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
  - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

  _Counter-examples (Low Fe/Hf):_

  - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (electron-donating group)
  - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (electron-donating group)

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing sulfur functional groups**, specifically **thiols (-SH)** or **thioethers (-S-)**, contribute to a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. Sulfur atoms are soft Lewis bases that form strong coordinate bonds with Fe ions due to their lone pair electrons.

  _Examples:_

  - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**
  - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing a pyridine ring attached to a carboxylic acid group**, either directly or via a short linker, result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. The nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring provides an additional coordination site for Fe ions, enhancing metal complexation.

  _Examples:_

  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**

  _Counter-example (Low Fe/Hf):_

  - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid) — Positioning of the carboxyl group relative to the nitrogen affects coordination.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Amino acids with side chains capable of coordinating with Fe ions**, such as additional **carboxylate groups** or **aromatic rings**, result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. These groups facilitate stronger interactions with Fe ions.

  _Examples (High Fe/Hf):_

  - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid)
  - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine)
  - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

  _Counter-example (Low Fe/Hf):_

  - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid) — Longer side chain may introduce steric hindrance.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with flexible ether linkages terminating with coordinating groups**, such as **amino (-NH₂)** or **carboxyl (-COOH)** groups, lead to a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. The ether chains provide flexibility, allowing terminal groups to effectively coordinate with Fe ions.

  _Examples:_

  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
  - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing a hydroxy group (-OH) on a medium-length aliphatic chain (typically 7 carbons)** can result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. The hydroxy group serves as an additional coordination site, improving interaction with Fe ions.

  _Example:_

  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

  _Counter-example (Low Fe/Hf):_

  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** — Multiple hydroxyl groups may interfere with coordination due to increased hydrogen bonding with the solvent.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing fused aromatic heterocycles with oxygen atoms within the ring system, especially when combined with carboxyl groups**, lead to a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. The heteroatoms in the ring enhance coordination capabilities with Fe ions.

  _Example:_

  - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-donating groups at the para position**, such as **amino (-NH₂), hydroxy (-OH), or methyl (-CH₃)**, result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  _Examples:_

  - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
  - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
  - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
  - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) on aliphatic chains (polyols)** lead to a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. Extensive hydroxylation increases hydrogen bonding with the solvent, reducing the availability of coordination sites for Fe ions.

  _Examples:_

  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid)
  - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with highly fluorinated alkyl chains or fluorinated acyl groups** lead to a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. Fluorination increases steric hindrance and strong electron-withdrawing effects, hindering effective coordination with Fe ions.

  _Examples:_

  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**
  - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. The lack of donor atoms like nitrogen or sulfur limits their ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  _Example:_

  - **Octanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing ketone groups (-C=O) within aliphatic chains** have a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. Ketone groups are less effective at coordinating with Fe ions compared to other donor groups like amines or thiols.

  _Example:_

  - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde groups (-CHO) attached to aromatic rings** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. Aldehyde groups may undergo side reactions or form intramolecular interactions, diminishing their coordination with Fe ions.

  _Examples:_

  - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
  - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with bulky aromatic side chains that may cause steric hindrance**, such as **indole rings**, exhibit a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. Steric hindrance from bulky groups reduces their ability to coordinate effectively with Fe ions.

  _Example:_

  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan)

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules illustrate how specific combinations of functional groups and structural features in molecular modifiers influence the **Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value** in the catalyst **Hf-TPY-MOL(Fe)**. The underlying physicochemical properties affecting these outcomes include:

- **Coordination Sites**: Functional groups like **amino (-NH₂)**, **thiol (-SH)**, and **pyridine nitrogen** provide lone pairs that can coordinate with Fe ions, increasing the Fe/Hf ratio.

- **Electron-Withdrawing Groups**: Substituents like **nitro (-NO₂)** and **halomethyl (-CH₂Br)** enhance the acidity of the carboxyl group, promoting stronger Fe ion coordination.

- **Electron-Donating Groups**: Groups like **hydroxy (-OH)** and **amino (-NH₂)** at certain positions decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing coordination efficiency with Fe ions.

- **Steric Factors**: Bulky groups or extensive fluorination can hinder effective coordination due to increased steric hindrance.

- **Flexibility and Functional Group Positioning**: Modifiers with flexible chains or appropriately positioned functional groups facilitate better spatial arrangement for effective Fe ion binding.

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a new molecular modifier is likely to result in a **high** or **low Fe/Hf value** based on its structural features. This aids in the rational design and selection of modifiers to optimize the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

    Target Name: Fe/Hf
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal primary amino group (-NH₂) on medium-length chains (5 to 8 carbons)** result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

  - **Examples**:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: The terminal amino group provides a strong coordination site for Fe ions due to the lone pair on the nitrogen atom. The medium-length carbon chain offers optimal flexibility without causing significant steric hindrance, allowing effective interaction with Fe ions.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers containing thiol (-SH) groups** lead to a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

  - **Examples**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Sulfur atoms in thiol groups have lone pairs that can form strong coordinate bonds with Fe ions. The presence of the thiol group enhances the ligand's ability to bind Fe ions efficiently.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, such as **nitro (-NO₂)** or **halogens (e.g., -Br, -Cl)**, result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group by stabilizing the negative charge after deprotonation. This enhances the ability of the carboxylate ion to coordinate with Fe ions.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing pyridine rings adjacent to carboxyl groups**, especially when the nitrogen atom is positioned to coordinate, lead to a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**

  - **Counter-example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid)

  - **Rationale**: The nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring can serve as an additional coordination site for Fe ions. The position of the nitrogen relative to the carboxyl group affects the overall coordination geometry and efficiency.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains capable of additional coordination**, such as **side-chain amino or carboxyl groups**, contribute to a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

  - **Counter-example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid)

  - **Rationale**: Side chains with additional coordinating groups enhance Fe ion binding. However, excessive chain length or steric bulk from larger side chains can hinder coordination due to steric effects.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with flexible ether linkages terminating with coordinating groups**, such as **carboxyl (-COOH)** or **amino (-NH₂)** groups, result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Ether linkages increase molecular flexibility, allowing terminal coordinating groups to adjust their positions for optimal interaction with Fe ions. This flexibility enhances the overall binding efficiency.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position**, such as **amino (-NH₂)** or **hydroxy (-OH)** groups, lead to a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group by destabilizing the negative charge on the carboxylate ion. This reduces the ligand's ability to coordinate effectively with Fe ions.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) on aliphatic chains (polyols)** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid)

  - **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can engage in extensive hydrogen bonding with solvents, decreasing the availability of coordination sites for Fe ions. Additionally, intramolecular hydrogen bonding may reduce flexibility, hindering effective coordination.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (-CHO) or ketone (>C=O) functional groups in addition to carboxyl groups** lead to a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Aldehyde and ketone groups are less effective at coordinating with Fe ions compared to other donor groups. They may also participate in side reactions, reducing the overall coordination efficiency.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains or fluorinated acyl groups** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Fluorine atoms are highly electronegative and can withdraw electron density, destabilizing potential coordination sites. Their steric bulk may also hinder close approach to Fe ions.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups** lead to a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

  - **Example**:
    - **Octanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: The lack of additional donor atoms or functional groups limits the ligand's ability to coordinate effectively with Fe ions, resulting in a lower Fe/Hf ratio.

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules are designed to predict whether a molecular modifier will result in a **high** or **low Fe/Hf value** based on its structural features and functional groups. The underlying physicochemical principles considered include:

- **Coordination Chemistry**: Functional groups like **amino (-NH₂)**, **thiol (-SH)**, and **pyridine nitrogen** offer lone pairs that can coordinate with Fe ions, enhancing the Fe/Hf ratio.

- **Electronic Effects**: **Electron-withdrawing groups** (e.g., nitro, halogens) increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, promoting better coordination with Fe ions. Conversely, **electron-donating groups** (e.g., amino, hydroxy) decrease acidity and coordination ability.

- **Steric Factors**: Bulky side chains or excessive chain length can hinder coordination due to steric hindrance, reducing Fe ion binding efficiency.

- **Molecular Flexibility**: Flexible linkages like ethers allow coordinating groups to adjust their positions for optimal interaction with Fe ions.

- **Hydrogen Bonding**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can lead to extensive hydrogen bonding with the solvent, reducing the availability of coordinating sites.

By applying these rules, researchers can predict the impact of different molecular modifiers on the Fe/Hf ratio in the **Hf-TPY-MOL(Fe)** catalyst. This insight enables the selection and design of modifiers that optimize the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Target Name: Fe/Hf
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

**Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal primary amino group (-NH₂) located at least five carbons away from the carboxyl group** result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: The long carbon chain provides flexibility, allowing the terminal amino group to effectively coordinate with Fe ions. The distance reduces steric hindrance, enhancing Fe binding to the catalyst.

---

**Rule 2**: **Modifiers containing thiol (-SH) groups**, whether **aliphatic** or **aromatic**, lead to a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Thiol groups have lone pairs on the sulfur atom that form strong coordinate bonds with Fe ions. This enhances the ligand's ability to bind Fe efficiently.

---

**Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, such as **nitro (-NO₂)** or **halogen-containing groups**, result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
  - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, promoting deprotonation and enhancing coordination with Hf and Fe ions. They stabilize the coordination environment, improving Fe binding.

---

**Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles, specifically pyridine rings, where the nitrogen atom is positioned to coordinate**, lead to a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**

- **Counter-example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid)

- **Rationale**: The nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring can coordinate with Fe ions. Optimal positioning relative to the carboxyl group enhances coordination efficiency. Misaligned nitrogen atoms reduce this effect.

---

**Rule 5**: **Modifiers with flexible ether linkages terminating with coordinating groups**, such as **carboxyl (-COOH)** or **amino (-NH₂)** groups, result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
  - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Ether linkages provide molecular flexibility, allowing terminal coordinating groups to adjust their positions for optimal interaction with Fe ions, enhancing binding efficiency.

---

**Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains capable of effective coordination**, such as **shorter side-chain carboxyl groups**, increase the **Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Example (High Fe/Hf)**:
  - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid)

- **Counter-example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid)

- **Rationale**: Shorter side chains position coordinating groups favorably for Fe binding. Longer chains may introduce steric hindrance or reduce coordination efficiency.

---

**Rule 7**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) on aliphatic chains (polyols)** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Example**:
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid)

- **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups engage in hydrogen bonding with solvents or internally, reducing the availability of coordination sites for Fe ions.

---

**Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position**, such as **amino (-NH₂)** or **hydroxy (-OH)** groups, lead to a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
  - **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**
  - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing deprotonation and coordination with Hf and Fe ions, leading to lower Fe binding.

---

**Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (-CHO) groups directly attached to the aromatic ring** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
  - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Aldehyde groups may interfere with coordination due to their reactivity or steric hindrance, decreasing Fe binding efficiency.

---

**Rule 10**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Example**:
  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Fluorine's high electronegativity withdraws electron density, destabilizing potential coordination sites and hindering Fe ion binding.

---

**Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups** lead to a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Example**:
  - **Octanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: The absence of additional donor groups limits the molecule's ability to coordinate with Fe ions effectively, resulting in lower Fe incorporation.

---

**Rule 12**: **Modifiers with bulky or sterically hindered side chains reduce Fe/Hf value (False)**, especially when coordinating groups are inaccessible.

- **Example**:
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan)

- **Rationale**: Bulky side chains hinder the approach and binding of functional groups to Fe ions, decreasing coordination efficiency.

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules are designed to predict whether a molecular modifier will result in a **high** or **low Fe/Hf value** based on its structural features and the physicochemical properties of its functional groups. The considerations include:

1. **Coordination Chemistry**: Groups like **amino (-NH₂)**, **thiol (-SH)**, and **pyridine nitrogen** offer lone pairs for coordination with Fe ions.

2. **Electronic Effects**: **Electron-withdrawing groups** increase carboxyl acidity and coordination ability; **electron-donating groups** have the opposite effect.

3. **Steric Factors**: Bulkiness can hinder effective coordination; optimal chain length and flexibility enhance binding.

4. **Molecular Flexibility**: Flexible structures with coordinating termini adjust to optimize Fe ion interaction.

5. **Hydrogen Bonding and Solvation**: Excessive hydroxyl groups promote hydrogen bonding, reducing coordination sites for Fe ions.

By applying these rules, researchers can predict the impact of different molecular modifiers on the **Fe/Hf ratio** in the **Hf-TPY-MOL(Fe)** catalyst, facilitating the design of modifiers that optimize the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Target Name: Fe/Hf
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

**Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal primary amino group (-NH₂) located at least four carbons away from the carboxyl group** result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

- **Counter-example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid)

- **Rationale**: The extended carbon chain provides flexibility, allowing the terminal amino group to effectively coordinate with Fe ions without significant steric hindrance. In contrast, when the amino group is too close to the carboxyl group, as in glutamic acid, coordination is less favorable.

---

**Rule 2**: **Modifiers containing thiol (-SH) groups**, whether **aliphatic** or **aromatic**, lead to a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Thiol groups have a strong affinity for metal ions due to the lone pair on sulfur. This enhances coordination with Fe ions, increasing their incorporation into the catalyst.

---

**Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, such as **nitro (-NO₂)** or **halomethyl (-CH₂X)** groups, result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
  - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group by stabilizing the negative charge upon deprotonation. This promotes better coordination with metal ions like Fe, enhancing their binding to the catalyst.

---

**Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing pyridine rings with accessible nitrogen atoms for coordination**, especially when connected via a flexible linker, lead to a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**

- **Counter-example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid)

- **Rationale**: The nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring can coordinate with Fe ions. Optimal positioning and flexibility enhance this interaction. In nicotinic acid, the nitrogen's position relative to the carboxyl group may hinder effective coordination.

---

**Rule 5**: **Modifiers with flexible ether linkages terminating with coordinating groups**, such as **amino (-NH₂)** or **carboxyl (-COOH)** groups, result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
  - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Ether linkages provide molecular flexibility, allowing terminal coordinating groups to adjust their orientation for optimal interaction with Fe ions. This flexibility enhances Fe binding to the catalyst.

---

**Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing coordinating groups**, such as an additional **carboxyl (-COOH)**, **amino (-NH₂)**, or **amide (-CONH₂)** group, especially when the side chain is short, increase the **Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid)
  - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

- **Counter-example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid)

- **Rationale**: Additional coordinating groups on short side chains enhance the ability to bind Fe ions. Longer side chains may introduce steric hindrance, reducing coordination efficiency.

---

**Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position**, such as **hydroxy (-OH)** or **amino (-NH₂)** groups, lead to a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
  - **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**
  - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, making deprotonation less favorable. This reduces the ability of the carboxyl group to coordinate with metal ions like Fe, resulting in lower Fe incorporation.

---

**Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups** lead to a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Example**:
  - **Octanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: The lack of functional groups offering lone pairs for coordination (such as amino or hydroxyl groups) limits the modifier's ability to bind Fe ions effectively. The carboxyl group alone may not provide sufficient coordination.

---

**Rule 9**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups within an aliphatic chain (polyols)** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Example**:
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid)

- **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can engage in intramolecular or intermolecular hydrogen bonding, limiting their availability to coordinate with Fe ions. This reduces the overall coordination sites available for Fe binding.

---

**Rule 10**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Example**:
  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms decreases the electron density on potential coordinating atoms, destabilizing coordination interactions with Fe ions. Additionally, fluorinated chains may introduce steric hindrance.

---

**Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (-CHO) or keto (=O) groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** lead to a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
  - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

- **Rationale**: Aldehyde or keto groups near the carboxyl group can alter electron distribution and steric environment, potentially interfering with coordination to Fe ions.

---

**Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing bulky aromatic side chains that could hinder coordination** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Example**:
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan)

- **Rationale**: Bulky side chains may sterically hinder the approach of Fe ions to coordinating sites on the modifier, reducing effective coordination and Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

**Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are long-chain hydroxyalkanoic acids with the hydroxyl group positioned several carbons away from the carboxyl group** can result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Example**:
  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: The hydroxyl group positioned away from the carboxyl group can act as an additional coordination site without causing significant steric hindrance. This promotes effective binding of Fe ions.

---

**Rule 14**: **Modifiers with methoxy (-OCH₃) groups attached to aromatic rings and additional coordinating features** result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Example**:
  - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Methoxy groups can influence the electronic properties of the aromatic ring, potentially enhancing coordination interactions when other coordinating groups are present. They may also affect the solubility and overall binding environment.

---

**Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are conjugated aromatic compounds with accessible coordination sites**, such as those containing **diketone** or **dioxo** groups, lead to a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Example**:
  - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

- **Rationale**: Conjugated systems with electron-rich areas can stabilize coordination with Fe ions through delocalization, enhancing Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules are designed to predict whether a molecular modifier will result in a **high** or **low Fe/Hf value** based on its structural features and the physicochemical properties of its functional groups. The considerations include:

1. **Coordination Ability**: Functional groups like **amino (-NH₂)**, **thiol (-SH)**, **pyridine nitrogen**, and **hydroxyl (-OH)** offer lone pairs for coordination with Fe ions, enhancing Fe incorporation.

2. **Electronic Effects**: **Electron-withdrawing groups** (e.g., nitro, halogens, perfluoroalkyl) can either increase or decrease coordination ability depending on their impact on the acidity and electron density of coordinating atoms. **Electron-donating groups** (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) may decrease acidity and coordination ability when attached to aromatic rings.

3. **Steric Factors**: Bulky groups or improper positioning can hinder effective coordination. Optimal chain length and flexibility allow functional groups to access Fe ions without steric hindrance.

4. **Molecular Flexibility**: Flexible linkers and ether chains enable coordinating groups to adjust their spatial orientation for optimal interaction with Fe ions.

5. **Hydrogen Bonding and Solvation**: Excessive hydroxyl groups can engage in hydrogen bonding, reducing the availability of coordination sites for Fe ions.

6. **Functional Group Interactions**: Reactive groups like aldehydes or ketones near coordinating sites may interfere with Fe binding due to side reactions or altered electron distribution.

By applying these rules, researchers can predict the impact of different molecular modifiers on the **Fe/Hf ratio** in the **Hf-TPY-MOL(Fe)** catalyst. This knowledge facilitates the design of modifiers that optimize the catalyst's performance, ultimately improving the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Target Name: Fe/Hf
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

**Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing thiol (-SH) groups**, whether **aliphatic** or **aromatic**, lead to a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Thiol groups have lone pairs on sulfur atoms, providing strong coordination sites for Fe ions, enhancing Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

**Rule 2**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, such as **nitro (-NO₂)** or **halomethyl (-CH₂X)** groups, result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
  - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, promoting deprotonation and stronger coordination with Fe ions.

---

**Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing pyridine rings with nitrogen atoms accessible for coordination**, especially when connected via a flexible linker, lead to a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**

- **Counter-example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(nitrogen position hinders coordination)*

- **Rationale**: The nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring can coordinate with Fe ions. Proper positioning and linkage enhance this interaction.

---

**Rule 4**: **Modifiers with flexible ether linkages terminating with coordinating groups**, such as **amino (-NH₂)** or **carboxyl (-COOH)** groups, result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
  - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Ether linkages provide flexibility, allowing terminal groups to orient optimally for Fe coordination.

---

**Rule 5**: **Aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal primary amino group (-NH₂) located at least three carbons away from the carboxyl group** result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
  - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

- **Counter-example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(amino group too close to carboxyl group, additional carboxyl group may hinder coordination)*

- **Rationale**: A longer carbon chain positions the amino group sufficiently far from the carboxyl group, minimizing steric hindrance and allowing effective coordination with Fe ions.

---

**Rule 6**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position**, such as **amino (-NH₂)** or **hydroxy (-OH)**, result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
  - **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**
  - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing its ability to coordinate effectively with Fe ions.

---

**Rule 7**: **Simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups** lead to a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Example**:
  - **Octanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Lack of additional coordinating functional groups limits Fe binding to only the carboxyl group, which may not suffice for strong coordination.

---

**Rule 8**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups within an aliphatic chain (polyols)** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Example**:
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid)

- **Rationale**: Extensive hydrogen bonding among hydroxyl groups reduces availability of coordination sites for Fe ions.

---

**Rule 9**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Example**:
  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Strong electron-withdrawing effects of fluorine atoms decrease electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening Fe coordination.

---

**Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (-CHO) or keto (=O) groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** lead to a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
  - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

- **Rationale**: Aldehyde or keto groups can alter electron distribution near coordinating sites, hindering Fe binding.

---

**Rule 11**: **Modifiers with bulky aromatic side chains near the coordinating groups may result in a lower Fe/Hf value due to steric hindrance**.

- **Example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan)

- **Counter-example (High Fe/Hf)**:
  - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine)

- **Rationale**: Larger side chains like indole in tryptophan may cause steric hindrance, reducing accessibility of coordinating sites for Fe ions, whereas smaller aromatic side chains like phenyl in phenylalanine may not impede coordination.

---

**Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxyl groups directly attached to the main chain result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Example**:
  - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid)

- **Rationale**: The presence of multiple carboxyl groups close to each other may lead to intramolecular interactions that hinder Fe coordination.

---

**Rule 13**: **Modifiers with methoxy (-OCH₃) groups attached to aromatic rings and additional coordinating features** result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Example**:
  - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Methoxy groups can influence electronic properties and, along with other coordinating groups, enhance Fe binding.

---

**Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing conjugated systems with electron-rich areas and accessible coordinating sites**, such as **diketone** or **dioxo** groups, lead to a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Example**:
  - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

- **Rationale**: Conjugated systems can stabilize Fe binding through electron delocalization and provide multiple coordination sites.

---

**Rule 15**: **Long-chain hydroxyalkanoic acids with the hydroxyl group positioned several carbons away from the carboxyl group** can result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Example**:
  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: The distal hydroxyl group provides an additional coordination site without causing steric interference, enhancing Fe binding.

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules are developed based on the structural features of the molecular modifiers and their observed impact on the **Fe/Hf ratio** in the catalyst. Key considerations include:

1. **Coordination Sites**: Functional groups such as **thiol (-SH)**, **amino (-NH₂)**, **pyridine nitrogen**, and **hydroxyl (-OH)** provide lone pairs for Fe coordination.

2. **Electronic Effects**:
   - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups**: Increase carboxyl acidity, enhancing Fe coordination (**Rule 2**).
   - **Electron-Donating Groups**: Decrease carboxyl acidity, reducing Fe coordination (**Rule 6**).

3. **Steric Factors**:
   - **Optimal Chain Length**: Longer chains position coordinating groups favorably (**Rule 5**).
   - **Bulky Groups**: Can hinder Fe access to coordinating sites (**Rule 11**).

4. **Molecular Flexibility**:
   - **Ether Linkages**: Provide flexibility for optimal Fe-binding orientations (**Rule 4**).
   - **Flexible Linkers**: Enhance coordination with Fe ions (**Rule 3**).

5. **Hydrogen Bonding**:
   - **Polyols**: Excessive hydroxyl groups engage in hydrogen bonding, limiting Fe coordination (**Rule 8**).

6. **Functional Group Positioning**:
   - **Proximity of Coordinating Groups**: Close proximity can hinder coordination due to intramolecular interactions (**Rule 12**).

7. **Electron Density**:
   - **Perfluorinated Chains**: Decrease electron density, weakening Fe coordination (**Rule 9**).

8. **Conjugation and Delocalization**:
   - **Conjugated Systems**: Stabilize Fe binding through electron delocalization (**Rule 14**).

By applying these rules, it is possible to predict whether a given molecular modifier will result in a **high** or **low Fe/Hf value** based on its structural characteristics. This understanding aids in the rational design of modifiers to optimize catalyst performance for the target reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Target Name: Fe/Hf
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

**Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing thiol (-SH) groups**, whether **aliphatic** or **aromatic**, result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Thiol groups have lone pairs on sulfur atoms, providing strong coordination sites for Fe ions, enhancing Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

**Rule 2**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, such as **nitro (-NO₂)** or **halomethyl (-CH₂X)** (where X is a halogen), lead to a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
  - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

- **Counter-example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(aldehyde group does not sufficiently withdraw electrons to enhance Fe coordination)*

- **Rationale**: Strong electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, promoting deprotonation and stronger coordination with Fe ions.

---

**Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing pyridine rings with nitrogen atoms accessible for coordination**, especially when connected via a flexible linker, result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**

- **Counter-example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(nitrogen position may hinder effective coordination with Fe ions)*

- **Rationale**: The nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring can coordinate with Fe ions. Proper positioning and linkage enhance this interaction.

---

**Rule 4**: **Aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal primary amino group (-NH₂) located at least three carbons away from the carboxyl group** result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

- **Counter-example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(amino group too close to carboxyl group, possible steric hindrance)*

- **Rationale**: A longer carbon chain positions the amino group sufficiently far from the carboxyl group, allowing both groups to coordinate effectively with Fe ions without steric interference.

---

**Rule 5**: **Modifiers with flexible ether linkages terminating with coordinating groups**, such as **amino (-NH₂)** or **carboxyl (-COOH)** groups, result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
  - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Ether linkages provide molecular flexibility, allowing terminal coordinating groups to orient optimally for Fe coordination.

---

**Rule 6**: **Long-chain hydroxyalkanoic acids with the hydroxyl (-OH) group positioned several carbons away from the carboxyl group** result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Example**:
  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: The distal hydroxyl group serves as an additional coordination site without causing steric hindrance, enhancing Fe binding.

---

**Rule 7**: **Modifiers with aromatic rings substituted with methoxy (-OCH₃) groups and additional coordinating features**, such as **ketones** or extended carbon chains, can result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Example**:
  - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Methoxy groups can modulate the electronic properties of the aromatic ring. When combined with other coordinating groups, they enhance Fe ion binding.

---

**Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing conjugated systems with multiple carbonyl groups**, such as **diketones** or **lactones**, lead to a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Example**:
  - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

- **Rationale**: Conjugated systems with electron-rich areas and multiple coordination sites can effectively stabilize Fe ions through delocalized bonding.

---

**Rule 9**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position**, specifically **amino (-NH₂)** or **hydroxy (-OH)** groups, result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
  - **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**
  - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing its ability to deprotonate and coordinate effectively with Fe ions.

---

**Rule 10**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups within the molecule (polyols)** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Example**:
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(gluconic acid)*

- **Rationale**: Extensive hydrogen bonding among hydroxyl groups can limit the availability of coordination sites for Fe ions, reducing Fe incorporation.

---

**Rule 11**: **Simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups** lead to a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Example**:
  - **Octanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Lack of additional coordinating functional groups limits Fe binding to only the carboxyl group, which may not suffice for strong coordination.

---

**Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (-CHO) or keto (=O) groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** tend to result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
  - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
  - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

- **Rationale**: Aldehyde or keto groups near the coordinating carboxyl group can alter electron distribution and interfere with Fe ion binding.

---

**Rule 13**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains or strong electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Example**:
  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Strong electron-withdrawing effects of fluorine atoms decrease electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening Fe coordination.

---

**Rule 14**: **Modifiers with bulky side chains near the coordinating groups may result in a lower Fe/Hf value due to steric hindrance**.

- **Example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(tryptophan)*

- **Counter-example (High Fe/Hf)**:
  - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(phenylalanine)*

- **Rationale**: Larger side chains like indole in tryptophan may cause steric hindrance, reducing accessibility of coordinating sites for Fe ions, whereas smaller aromatic side chains like phenyl in phenylalanine may not impede coordination.

---

**Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side-chain carboxyl groups close to the main chain exhibit variable Fe/Hf values depending on chain length and steric considerations**.

- **Example (High Fe/Hf)**:
  - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(aspartic acid)*

- **Example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(glutamic acid)*

- **Rationale**: In aspartic acid, the shorter side chain allows effective coordination despite the proximity of carboxyl groups. In glutamic acid, the longer side chain may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorable interactions, reducing Fe coordination.

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules are developed based on the structural features of the molecular modifiers and their observed impact on the **Fe/Hf ratio** in the catalyst. Key considerations include:

1. **Coordination Sites**: Functional groups such as **thiol (-SH)**, **amino (-NH₂)**, **pyridine nitrogen**, and **distal hydroxyl (-OH)** groups provide lone pairs for Fe coordination.

2. **Electronic Effects**:
   - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups**: Increase carboxyl acidity, enhancing Fe coordination (**Rule 2**).
   - **Electron-Donating Groups**: Decrease carboxyl acidity, reducing Fe coordination (**Rule 9**).

3. **Steric Factors**:
   - **Optimal Chain Length**: Longer chains position coordinating groups favorably (**Rules 4, 6**).
   - **Bulky Groups**: Can hinder Fe access to coordinating sites (**Rule 14**).

4. **Molecular Flexibility**:
   - **Ether Linkages**: Provide flexibility for optimal Fe-binding orientations (**Rule 5**).
   - **Flexible Linkers**: Enhance coordination with Fe ions (**Rules 3, 5**).

5. **Hydrogen Bonding**:
   - **Polyols**: Excessive hydroxyl groups engage in hydrogen bonding, limiting Fe coordination (**Rule 10**).

6. **Functional Group Positioning**:
   - **Proximity of Coordinating Groups**: Close proximity can hinder coordination due to electronic and steric factors (**Rules 4, 12, 15**).

7. **Electron Density**:
   - **Perfluorinated Chains**: Decrease electron density, weakening Fe coordination (**Rule 13**).

8. **Conjugation and Delocalization**:
   - **Conjugated Systems**: Stabilize Fe binding through electron delocalization and multiple coordination sites (**Rule 8**).

By applying these rules, it is possible to predict whether a given molecular modifier will result in a **high** or **low Fe/Hf value** based on its structural characteristics. This understanding aids in the rational design of modifiers to optimize catalyst performance for the target radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

---

**Note**: These rules are formulated to cover a broad range of modifiers in the dataset, balancing simplicity and complexity to provide practical guidelines for predicting Fe/Hf values. They take into account underlying physical and chemical properties, including coordination chemistry, electronic effects, steric factors, and molecular flexibility.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Target Name: Fe/Hf
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

**Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing thiol (-SH) groups** result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Thiol groups have lone pairs on sulfur atoms, providing strong coordination sites for Fe ions, enhancing Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

**Rule 2**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, such as **nitro (-NO₂)** or **halomethyl (-CH₂Hal)** (where Hal is a halogen), lead to a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
  - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

- **Counter-examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
  - **4-methylbenzoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, promoting deprotonation and stronger coordination with Fe ions.

---

**Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing pyridine rings with accessible nitrogen atoms for coordination** result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**

- **Counter-example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**

- **Rationale**: The nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring can coordinate with Fe ions. Proper positioning and linkage enhance this interaction.

---

**Rule 4**: **Aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal primary amino group (-NH₂) located at least three carbons away from the carboxyl group** result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: A longer carbon chain positions the amino group sufficiently far from the carboxyl group, allowing both groups to coordinate effectively with Fe ions without steric interference.

---

**Rule 5**: **Modifiers with flexible ether linkages terminating with coordinating groups**, such as **amino (-NH₂)** or **carboxyl (-COOH)** groups, result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
  - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Ether linkages provide molecular flexibility, allowing terminal coordinating groups to orient optimally for Fe coordination.

---

**Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains capable of coordinating with Fe ions** result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**, provided the side chain is not excessively bulky.

- **Example (High Fe/Hf)**:
  - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(phenylalanine)*

- **Counter-example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(tryptophan)*

- **Rationale**: Side chains with moderate size can coordinate with Fe ions, whereas bulky side chains may cause steric hindrance, reducing accessibility of coordinating sites.

---

**Rule 7**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups adjacent to the carboxyl group (polyols)** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Example**:
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(gluconic acid)*

- **Rationale**: Extensive hydrogen bonding among hydroxyl groups can limit the availability of coordination sites for Fe ions, reducing Fe incorporation.

---

**Rule 8**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position**, specifically **amino (-NH₂)** or **hydroxy (-OH)** groups, result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
  - **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing its ability to deprotonate and coordinate effectively with Fe ions.

---

**Rule 9**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains or strong electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Example**:
  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Strong electron-withdrawing effects of fluorine atoms decrease electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening Fe coordination.

---

**Rule 10**: **Simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups** lead to a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Example**:
  - **Octanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Lack of additional coordinating functional groups limits Fe binding to only the carboxyl group, which may not suffice for strong coordination.

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules are developed based on the structural features of the molecular modifiers and their observed impact on the **Fe/Hf ratio** in the catalyst. Key considerations include:

1. **Coordination Sites**: Functional groups such as **thiol (-SH)**, **amino (-NH₂)**, **pyridine nitrogen**, and **flexible ether linkages** provide lone pairs for Fe coordination.

2. **Electronic Effects**:
   - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups**: Increase carboxyl acidity, enhancing Fe coordination (**Rule 2**).
   - **Electron-Donating Groups**: Decrease carboxyl acidity, reducing Fe coordination (**Rule 8**).

3. **Steric Factors**:
   - **Optimal Chain Length**: Longer chains position coordinating groups favorably (**Rules 4, 6**).
   - **Bulky Groups**: Can hinder Fe access to coordinating sites (**Rule 6**).

4. **Molecular Flexibility**:
   - **Ether Linkages**: Provide flexibility for optimal Fe-binding orientations (**Rule 5**).

5. **Hydrogen Bonding**:
   - **Polyols**: Excessive hydroxyl groups engage in hydrogen bonding, limiting Fe coordination (**Rule 7**).

6. **Electron Density**:
   - **Perfluorinated Chains**: Decrease electron density, weakening Fe coordination (**Rule 9**).

By applying these rules, it is possible to predict whether a given molecular modifier will result in a **high** or **low Fe/Hf value** based on its structural characteristics. This understanding aids in the rational design of modifiers to optimize catalyst performance for the target radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

---

**Note**: These rules are formulated to cover a broad range of modifiers in the dataset, balancing simplicity and complexity to provide practical guidelines for predicting Fe/Hf values. They take into account underlying physical and chemical properties, including coordination chemistry, electronic effects, steric factors, and molecular flexibility.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Target Name: Fe/Hf
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

**Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing thiol (-SH) groups** result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Thiol groups have a strong affinity for Fe ions due to the lone pair of electrons on the sulfur atom, enhancing coordination and promoting Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

**Rule 2**: **Modifiers containing an aromatic nitrogen heterocycle (e.g., pyridine ring) that is not sterically hindered** result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**

- **Counter-example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**

- **Rationale**: The nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring can coordinate with Fe ions. Optimal positioning and minimal steric hindrance enhance coordination efficiency and Fe incorporation.

---

**Rule 3**: **Aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal primary amino group (-NH₂) separated by at least four carbons from the carboxyl group** result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: The sufficient carbon chain length allows simultaneous coordination of both amino and carboxyl groups with Fe ions without steric hindrance, forming stable chelate complexes that enhance Fe incorporation.

---

**Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing aromatic rings without bulky substituents** result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Example (High Fe/Hf)**:
  - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(phenylalanine)*

- **Counter-example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(tryptophan)*

- **Rationale**: Aromatic side chains can interact with Fe ions through π-π interactions or coordinate via delocalized electrons, enhancing Fe incorporation unless hindered by bulky substituents.

---

**Rule 5**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, such as **nitro (-NO₂)** or **halomethyl (-CH₂Hal)**, lead to a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
  - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

- **Counter-examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
  - **4-aminobenzoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group by stabilizing the negative charge upon deprotonation, enhancing the ability of the carboxylate anion to coordinate effectively with Fe ions.

---

**Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing flexible ether linkages with terminal coordinating groups**, such as **amino (-NH₂)** or **carboxyl (-COOH)** groups, result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
  - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Ether linkages provide molecular flexibility, allowing terminal coordinating groups to adopt conformations that favor optimal Fe ion coordination, thereby enhancing Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

**Rule 7**: **Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl (-OH) groups near the carboxyl group (polyhydroxy carboxylic acids)** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Example**:
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(gluconic acid)*

- **Rationale**: The presence of multiple hydroxyl groups leads to extensive intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which can reduce the availability of coordination sites for Fe ions and hinder Fe incorporation.

---

**Rule 8**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position**, such as **amino (-NH₂)** or **hydroxy (-OH)** groups, result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
  - **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups increase electron density on the aromatic ring and decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, resulting in weaker deprotonation and less effective coordination with Fe ions.

---

**Rule 9**: **Modifiers with bulky or sterically hindered coordinating groups near the functional sites** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(tryptophan)*
  - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(glutamic acid)*

- **Rationale**: Bulky side chains can create steric hindrance around coordinating sites, impeding the approach and binding of Fe ions, thus reducing Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

**Rule 10**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains attached to the carboxyl group** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Example**:
  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Perfluorinated groups are highly electron-withdrawing and reduce electron density on coordinating atoms excessively, weakening their ability to donate electron density to Fe ions and thereby diminishing coordination effectiveness.

---

**Rule 11**: **Simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Example**:
  - **Octanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Without additional coordinating functional groups, these modifiers rely solely on the carboxyl group for Fe coordination, which may not provide sufficient interaction to significantly enhance Fe incorporation.

---

**Rule 12**: **Modifiers with conjugated carbonyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group and no additional coordinating groups** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
  - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Conjugated carbonyl groups can delocalize electron density away from the carboxylate oxygen, reducing its ability to coordinate effectively with Fe ions.

---

**Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing α-keto acids (carbonyl group adjacent to the carboxyl group) without additional coordinating groups** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Example**:
  - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

- **Rationale**: The adjacent carbonyl group may compete with the carboxylate for metal coordination or delocalize electron density, weakening overall coordination with Fe ions.

---

**Rule 14**: **Di-carboxylic acids without additional strong coordinating groups** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Example**:
  - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(aspartic acid)*

- **Rationale**: Closely spaced carboxyl groups may not simultaneously coordinate effectively with a single Fe ion, and without other strong coordinating sites, Fe incorporation is reduced.

---

**Rule 15**: **Modifiers with bulky substituents near coordinating functional groups, causing steric hindrance** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
  - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

- **Rationale**: Bulky substituents near amino or carboxyl groups can hinder the approach of Fe ions to these coordinating sites, reducing coordination efficiency and Fe incorporation.

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been developed to predict whether a molecular modifier will result in a **high** or **low Fe/Hf value** based on its structural features, considering the underlying physical-chemical properties.

**Key Considerations in the Rules:**

1. **Coordination Ability of Functional Groups**:
   - **Strong Coordinating Groups**: Thiol (-SH), amino (-NH₂), and pyridine nitrogen atoms enhance Fe coordination and incorporation (**Rules 1, 2, 3, 6**).
   - **Multiple Coordination Sites**: Modifiers with flexible linkages or sufficient chain length allow multiple coordinating groups to interact with Fe ions simultaneously (**Rules 3, 6**).

2. **Electronic Effects**:
   - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups**: Increase carboxylate acidity, enhancing coordination with Fe ions (**Rule 5**).
   - **Electron-Donating Groups**: Decrease carboxylate acidity, weakening coordination with Fe ions (**Rule 8**).
   - **Excessive Electron Withdrawal**: Perfluorinated chains can reduce electron density too much, impairing coordination (**Rule 10**).

3. **Steric Factors**:
   - **Steric Hindrance**: Bulky substituents near coordinating sites hinder Fe access, reducing incorporation (**Rules 9, 15**).
   - **Optimal Chain Length**: Adequate separation between coordinating groups prevents steric clashes (**Rule 3**).

4. **Molecular Flexibility**:
   - **Flexible Linkers**: Allow coordinating groups to adopt favorable conformations for Fe binding (**Rule 6**).

5. **Hydrogen Bonding and Delocalization**:
   - **Polyhydroxy Compounds**: Extensive hydrogen bonding can limit available coordination sites (**Rule 7**).
   - **Conjugated Carbonyl Groups**: Delocalization of electron density can weaken Fe coordination (**Rules 12, 13**).

6. **Coordination Competition**:
   - **Adjacent Functional Groups**: Functional groups like carbonyls adjacent to carboxyl may compete for coordination, reducing effectiveness (**Rules 12, 13**).

By applying these rules, researchers can predict the Fe/Hf value outcome for modifiers based on their molecular structure, aiding in the rational design of modifiers to optimize catalyst performance in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

    Target Name: Fe/Hf
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

**Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing a primary amino group (-NH₂) connected by an aliphatic chain of at least three carbons to the carboxyl group** result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
  - **4-aminobutanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: The primary amino group provides a strong coordination site for Fe ions. The flexible aliphatic chain allows the amino and carboxyl groups to act as bidentate ligands, forming stable chelate complexes with Fe. This enhances the incorporation of Fe into the catalyst.

---

**Rule 2**: **Modifiers containing thiol (-SH) groups** result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Thiol groups are excellent ligands due to the high affinity of sulfur for transition metals like Fe. The strong Fe–S bond increases the stability of the Fe-modifier complex, promoting higher Fe incorporation into the catalyst structure.

---

**Rule 3**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, such as **nitro (-NO₂)** or **halomethyl (-CH₂Hal)** groups, result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
  - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

- **Counter-examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(electron-donating methyl group)*
  - **4-aminobenzoic acid** *(electron-donating amino group)*

- **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group by stabilizing the negative charge on the carboxylate anion. This enhances its ability to coordinate with Fe ions, leading to increased Fe incorporation.

---

**Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing a pyridine ring** result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**

- **Counter-example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(possible steric hindrance or less optimal positioning of nitrogen)*

- **Rationale**: The lone pair on the nitrogen atom of the pyridine ring can coordinate with Fe ions. When the pyridine nitrogen is accessible and properly positioned, it enhances Fe coordination, increasing Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

**Rule 5**: **Modifiers with flexible ether linkages and terminal coordinating groups**, such as **amino (-NH₂)** or **carboxyl (-COOH)** groups, result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
  - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Ether linkages increase molecular flexibility, allowing coordinating groups to adopt favorable conformations for Fe binding. This flexibility facilitates the formation of stable Fe complexes, enhancing Fe incorporation.

---

**Rule 6**: **Amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking bulky substituents** result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Example**:
  - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(Phenylalanine)*

- **Counter-example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(Tryptophan, bulky indole group)*

- **Rationale**: Aromatic side chains can interact with Fe ions via π-electron interactions or direct coordination. Minimal steric hindrance in the side chain allows effective Fe binding, enhancing Fe incorporation.

---

**Rule 7**: **Modifiers with multiple carboxyl groups capable of chelation**, such as **dicarboxylic acids or amino acids with carboxylate side chains**, result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(Aspartic acid)*
  - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(Glutamic acid)*

- **Rationale**: Multiple carboxyl groups can act as bidentate ligands, chelating Fe ions more effectively. Chelation increases the stability of the Fe complex, promoting higher incorporation into the catalyst.

---

**Rule 8**: **Modifiers with electron-donating groups at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids**, such as **amino (-NH₂)** or **hydroxy (-OH)** groups, result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
  - **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**
  - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group by increasing electron density. This reduces the ability of the carboxylate to coordinate with Fe ions, leading to lower Fe incorporation.

---

**Rule 9**: **Simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional strong coordinating functional groups** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Example**:
  - **Octanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Without additional coordinating sites, these modifiers rely solely on the carboxyl group for Fe binding. The single coordination site is insufficient for significant Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

**Rule 10**: **Modifiers with bulky or sterically hindered groups near coordinating sites** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(Tryptophan)*
  - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(Acetylated lysine)*

- **Rationale**: Bulky groups near coordination sites create steric hindrance, impeding Fe ion access. This reduces coordination efficiency and Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

**Rule 11**: **Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl (-OH) groups near the carboxyl group (polyhydroxy carboxylic acids)** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Example**:
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(Gluconic acid)*

- **Rationale**: Extensive hydrogen bonding from multiple hydroxyl groups can sequester lone pairs on oxygen atoms, reducing their availability for Fe coordination. This diminishes Fe incorporation.

---

**Rule 12**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains attached to the carboxyl group** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Example**:
  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Perfluorinated groups are highly electron-withdrawing, excessively lowering electron density on the carboxylate oxygen. This weakens coordination ability with Fe ions, resulting in decreased Fe incorporation.

---

**Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing conjugated carbonyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group without additional strong coordinating groups** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
  - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

- **Rationale**: Conjugation with additional carbonyl groups delocalizes electron density away from the carboxylate oxygen, reducing its coordinating ability with Fe ions and leading to lower Fe incorporation.

---

**Rule 14**: **Modifiers with unique chelating structures, such as fused aromatic systems containing carbonyl groups**, can result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Example**:
  - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

- **Rationale**: Fused aromatic systems with multiple carbonyl groups can offer several coordination sites, enabling effective chelation with Fe ions. This enhances Fe incorporation despite lacking typical strong coordinating functional groups.

---

**Rule 15**: **Modifiers with flexible aliphatic chains terminating with coordinating functional groups on both ends**, such as **amino (-NH₂)** and **carboxyl (-COOH)** groups, result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Example**:
  - **(2S)-6-aminohexanoic acid** *(Lysine)*

- **Rationale**: The presence of coordinating groups at both ends of a flexible chain allows for simultaneous coordination with Fe ions, forming stable chelate rings that enhance Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been developed to predict whether a molecular modifier will result in a **high** or **low Fe/Hf value** based on its structural features, considering the underlying physical and chemical properties.

**Key Considerations in the Rules:**

1. **Coordination Ability of Functional Groups**:
   - **Strong Coordinating Groups**: Primary amino (-NH₂) and thiol (-SH) groups enhance coordination with Fe ions (**Rules 1 and 2**).
   - **Multiple Coordination Sites**: Modifiers with two or more coordinating groups can chelate Fe ions effectively (**Rules 1, 5, 7, and 15**).

2. **Electronic Effects**:
   - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups**: Increase carboxylate acidity, enhancing Fe coordination (**Rule 3**).
   - **Electron-Donating Groups**: Decrease carboxylate acidity, weakening Fe coordination (**Rule 8**).
   - **Excessive Electron Withdrawal**: Highly electron-withdrawing perfluoroalkyl groups may overly diminish coordination ability (**Rule 12**).

3. **Steric Factors**:
   - **Steric Hindrance**: Bulky substituents near coordinating sites hinder Fe access (**Rule 10**).
   - **Optimal Chain Length and Flexibility**: Adequate separation between coordinating groups allows effective chelation without steric clashes (**Rules 1, 5, and 15**).

4. **Molecular Flexibility**:
   - **Flexible Linkers**: Ether or aliphatic chains enable coordinating groups to adopt favorable conformations (**Rules 5 and 15**).

5. **Hydrogen Bonding and Delocalization**:
   - **Polyhydroxy Compounds**: Extensive hydrogen bonding can reduce available coordination sites (**Rule 11**).
   - **Conjugated Carbonyl Groups**: Delocalization can weaken Fe coordination (**Rule 13**).

6. **Unique Structural Features**:
   - **Chelating Structures**: Fused aromatic systems with carbonyl groups provide effective Fe coordination (**Rule 14**).

By applying these rules, researchers can predict the Fe/Hf value outcome for modifiers based on their molecular structure. This aids in the rational design and selection of molecular modifiers to optimize catalyst performance in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

**Summary of Modifiers and Predicted Fe/Hf Values Based on the Rules:**

- **High Fe/Hf Value (True)**:
  - Modifiers with primary amino groups connected by flexible chains (**Rule 1**).
  - Modifiers containing thiol groups (**Rule 2**).
  - Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing para substituents (**Rule 3**).
  - Modifiers containing pyridine rings (**Rule 4**).
  - Modifiers with flexible ether linkages and terminal coordinating groups (**Rule 5**).
  - Amino acids with non-bulky aromatic side chains (**Rule 6**).
  - Modifiers with multiple carboxyl groups capable of chelation (**Rule 7**).
  - Modifiers with unique chelating structures (**Rule 14**).
  - Modifiers with flexible chains terminating with coordinating groups (**Rule 15**).

- **Low Fe/Hf Value (False)**:
  - Modifiers with electron-donating para substituents on aromatic rings (**Rule 8**).
  - Simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups (**Rule 9**).
  - Modifiers with bulky substituents causing steric hindrance (**Rule 10**).
  - Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups (**Rule 11**).
  - Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains (**Rule 12**).
  - Modifiers with conjugated carbonyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group (**Rule 13**).

By focusing on these structural features, chemists can tailor molecular modifiers to achieve the desired Fe/Hf ratio, thereby controlling the catalytic properties and optimizing the yield of the target reaction.
