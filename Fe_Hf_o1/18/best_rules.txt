**Start of Rules**

1. **Modifiers with Terminal Amino Groups on Aliphatic Chains Predict High Fe/Hf Values**

   **Description:** Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal (ω-position) primary amino group (–NH₂) predict **high Fe/Hf** values. The presence of both amino and carboxyl groups at opposite ends facilitates chelation with Fe ions.

   - *High Fe/Hf Examples:*
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
   - *Low Fe/Hf Example:*
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (amino group is not terminal; additional carboxyl group may introduce steric hindrance)

2. **Modifiers Containing Thiol (–SH) Groups Predict High Fe/Hf Values**

   **Description:** Modifiers with thiol groups coordinate strongly with Fe ions due to sulfur's soft Lewis base character, enhancing Fe uptake.

   - *High Fe/Hf Examples:*
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
     - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

3. **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing Para Substituents Predict High Fe/Hf Values**

   **Description:** Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position (e.g., nitro, halomethyl) predict **high Fe/Hf** values. EWGs increase the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxylate group toward Fe ions.

   - *High Fe/Hf Examples:*
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
   - *Low Fe/Hf Examples:*
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (electron-donating amino group reduces coordination ability)
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**

4. **Modifiers Containing Pyridine Rings with Accessible Nitrogen Atoms Predict High Fe/Hf Values**

   **Description:** Modifiers featuring pyridine rings where the nitrogen atom is accessible for coordination (not sterically hindered) provide strong coordination sites for Fe ions, predicting **high Fe/Hf** values.

   - *High Fe/Hf Examples:*
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**
   - *Low Fe/Hf Example:*
     - **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nitrogen's position may reduce accessibility due to sterics or resonance)

5. **Modifiers with Ether Linkages and Terminal Donor Groups Predict High Fe/Hf Values**

   **Description:** Modifiers containing ether linkages (–O–) in the backbone along with terminal donor groups such as amino (–NH₂) or methoxy (–OCH₃) predict **high Fe/Hf** values. Ether oxygen atoms act as additional coordination sites for Fe ions.

   - *High Fe/Hf Examples:*
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**
   - *Low Fe/Hf Example:*
     - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (multiple hydroxyl groups may reduce coordination due to intramolecular hydrogen bonding or increased steric hindrance)

6. **Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups Predict Low Fe/Hf Values**

   **Description:** Modifiers possessing multiple hydroxyl groups (polyols) predict **low Fe/Hf** values. The hydroxyl groups may engage in intramolecular hydrogen bonding or create steric hindrance, reducing coordination with Fe ions.

   - *Low Fe/Hf Examples:*
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**
     - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**

7. **Modifiers Containing Perfluoroalkyl Groups Predict Low Fe/Hf Values**

   **Description:** Modifiers with perfluoroalkyl chains predict **low Fe/Hf** values. The strong electron-withdrawing effect decreases electron density on coordinating atoms, reducing their ability to bind Fe ions.

   - *Low Fe/Hf Examples:*
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**
     - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

8. **Modifiers with Conjugated Carbonyl Groups Adjacent to Aromatics Predict Low Fe/Hf Values**

   **Description:** Modifiers that have conjugated carbonyl groups (e.g., aldehydes or ketones) attached to aromatic rings predict **low Fe/Hf** values. Conjugation delocalizes electron density, reducing availability for Fe coordination.

   - *Low Fe/Hf Examples:*
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid**

9. **Simple Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Without Additional Donor Groups Predict Low Fe/Hf Values**

   **Description:** Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without other coordinating functional groups predict **low Fe/Hf** values due to limited coordination sites.

   - *Low Fe/Hf Example:*
     - **octanoic acid**

10. **Modifiers with Nitrogen Heterocycles Involving Resonance Delocalization Predict Low Fe/Hf Values**

    **Description:** Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles where the nitrogen's lone pair is involved in resonance (e.g., pyrazoles, pyridones) predict **low Fe/Hf** values. Resonance reduces nitrogen's availability for coordination.

    - *Low Fe/Hf Examples:*
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
      - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

11. **Modifiers with Both Amide and Amino Groups Predict High Fe/Hf Values**

    **Description:** Modifiers featuring both amide (–CONH–) and amino (–NH₂) groups predict **high Fe/Hf** values. Multiple nitrogen donors increase coordination opportunities with Fe ions.

    - *High Fe/Hf Example:*
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

12. **Modifiers with Electron-Donating Groups on Aromatic Rings Predict Low Fe/Hf Values**

    **Description:** Modifiers with electron-donating substituents (e.g., hydroxyl, amino groups) on aromatic rings predict **low Fe/Hf** values. These groups decrease the acidity and coordinating ability of the carboxylate group.

    - *Low Fe/Hf Examples:*
      - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid**

13. **Modifiers Containing Aromatic Hydroxyl Groups Predict Low Fe/Hf Values**

    **Description:** Modifiers with phenolic hydroxyl groups may form strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds, reducing the availability of coordination sites for Fe ions.

    - *Low Fe/Hf Examples:*
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**

14. **Modifiers with Aliphatic Chains Terminated with a Single Hydroxyl Group Predict High Fe/Hf Values**

    **Description:** Modifiers that have aliphatic chains terminated with a single hydroxyl group (without multiple hydroxyls) predict **high Fe/Hf** values. The terminal hydroxyl may not hinder Fe coordination significantly.

    - *High Fe/Hf Example:*
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - *Low Fe/Hf Example:*
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (multiple hydroxyls)

15. **Modifiers with Bulky Aromatic Side Chains and Electron-Donating Substituents Predict Low Fe/Hf Values**

    **Description:** Modifiers with bulky aromatic side chains bearing electron-donating groups (e.g., hydroxyl, methoxy) may predict **low Fe/Hf** values due to steric hindrance and reduced coordination capacity.

    - *Low Fe/Hf Examples:*
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid**
      - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**

**Explanation and Considerations:**

- **Combined Substructures:** Each rule focuses on combinations of functional groups and structural features that synergistically influence Fe coordination. For example, Rule 5 combines ether linkages with terminal donor groups, enhancing coordination potential.

- **Underlying Physico-Chemical Properties:** The rules are grounded in coordination chemistry principles, considering factors such as electron-withdrawing/donating effects, resonance delocalization, steric accessibility, hydrogen bonding, and the hard-soft acid-base theory.

- **Predictive Clarity:** Each rule explicitly states whether the presence of certain substructures predicts **high** or **low Fe/Hf** values, facilitating the application of these rules to new modifiers.

- **Dataset Coverage:** The rules cover a broad range of the dataset, explaining the Fe/Hf values for many modifiers. By focusing on common functional groups and structural motifs, the rules apply to multiple entries, ensuring comprehensive coverage.

- **Balance Between Simplicity and Complexity:** The rules strike a balance by including broad, simple rules with high coverage (e.g., Rule 1 on terminal amino groups) and more detailed rules that consider specific combinations of functional groups (e.g., Rule 11 on modifiers with both amide and amino groups).

- **Rule Refinement:** The rules have been refined to maximize effectiveness and generality. Redundant or less impactful rules have been combined or omitted to enhance their predictive power and clarity.
