- **Comment 1**:
  Rule 1 is clear and allows us to easily determine if a modifier matches the structural description. It provides good physical-chemical insight by focusing on primary amino groups on linear chains of 5 or more carbons, which may enhance Fe coordination. The complexity is moderate, considering both chain length and functional groups. Coverage is strong, supported by multiple data points in the dataset (e.g., 5-aminopentanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid, (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid).

- **Comment 2**:
  Rule 2 is clear and specifies modifiers with strongly electron-withdrawing groups at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids. It offers good property insight, suggesting that such groups may enhance Fe coordination. The complexity is moderate, involving aromatic structures and specific substituents. Coverage is adequate, supported by data points like 4-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid.

- **Comment 3**:
  Rule 3 is clear, focusing on modifiers containing sulfur atoms in thiol or thioether forms. The property insight is strong, as sulfur atoms are known to coordinate with metal ions like Fe. Complexity is moderate, considering the presence of specific functional groups. Coverage is adequate with examples such as 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid and 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid.

- **Comment 4**:
  Rule 4 clearly identifies modifiers with polyether chains containing multiple ether linkages. The property insight is good, as ether linkages may influence the Fe/Hf ratio through coordination effects. Complexity is higher due to the requirement of multiple ether linkages (three or more oxygen atoms). Coverage is sufficient, supported by modifiers like 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid and 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid.

- **Comment 5**:
  Rule 5 is clear, specifying aromatic carboxylic acids with a pyridine ring at the para position. The property insight is strong, considering the coordination ability of pyridine rings with Fe ions. Complexity is moderate, involving aromatic systems and heterocyclic attachments. Coverage is adequate with data points such as 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid and 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.

- **Comment 6**:
  Rule 6 is clear in its description of aliphatic carboxylic acids with a hydroxyl group on a linear chain of 7 or more carbons. The property insight is reasonable, suggesting that hydroxyl groups on longer chains may enhance Fe coordination. However, complexity is moderate, and coverage is limited, with only one supporting data point (7-hydroxyheptanoic acid). This limited coverage reduces the rule's robustness.

- **Comment 7**:
  Rule 7 is clear about targeting amino acids with aromatic side chains. While the property insight is logical, proposing that aromatic side chains may affect Fe coordination, the coverage is weak. Although (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine) supports the rule, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan) does not, as it is marked False in the dataset. This contradiction suggests the rule may not be reliable.

- **Comment 8**:
  Rule 8 is clear and provides good insight by associating electron-donating groups at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids with low Fe/Hf values. Complexity is moderate, focusing on specific substituents. Coverage is strong, with data points like 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-methylbenzoic acid, and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid supporting the rule.

- **Comment 9**:
  Rule 9 is clear, indicating that aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups predict low Fe/Hf values. The property insight is acceptable, as aldehyde groups may not favor coordination. Complexity is low to moderate, and coverage is adequate, supported by modifiers like 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.

- **Comment 10**:
  Rule 10 clearly identifies modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (polyols) predicting low Fe/Hf values. The property insight is reasonable, considering that excessive hydroxyl groups may hinder Fe coordination. Complexity is moderate due to the focus on polyols. Coverage is adequate, with support from data points like 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid and (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Comment 11**:
  Rule 11 is clear and focuses on aromatic carboxylic acids with adjacent carbonyl and hydroxyl groups. The property insight is good, as such arrangements might interfere with Fe binding. Complexity is moderate, considering specific positional relationships of functional groups. Coverage is adequate, with data points like 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid and 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid.

- **Comment 12**:
  Rule 12 is clear but has limited coverage. It addresses straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids longer than 6 carbons without additional functional groups predicting low Fe/Hf values. The property insight is acceptable, but only one data point (octanoic acid) supports it. The simplicity of the rule is good, but the lack of multiple supporting data points weakens it.

- **Comment 13**:
  Rule 13 is clear, specifying modifiers with carboxylic acid groups directly attached to heteroaromatic rings predicting low Fe/Hf values. The property insight is solid, and complexity is moderate. Coverage is adequate, supported by pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid in the dataset.

- **Comment 14**:
  Rule 14 is clear but suffers from limited coverage, with only one supporting data point (4-oxoheptanedioic acid). The property insight is reasonable, suggesting that ketone groups in dicarboxylic acids may not favor Fe coordination. Complexity is moderate due to the combination of functional groups, but the rule's reliability is questionable due to insufficient data.

- **Comment 15**:
  Rule 15 is clear and focuses on modifiers containing trifluoroacetyl groups predicting low Fe/Hf values. While the property insight is acceptable, considering the electron-withdrawing nature of trifluoroacetyl groups, coverage is limited to a single data point (4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid). The simplicity of the rule is good, but the lack of broader support reduces its robustness.

These rules are designed to capture the relationship between the molecular features of the modifiers and the Fe/Hf value in the dataset. Each rule combines specific substructures and functional groups, considering their physical and chemical properties:

- **Rule 1 & Rule 10**: **Chain Length and Functionalization**

  Longer aliphatic chains with terminal primary amino or hydroxyl groups enhance the interaction with the metal-organic layer (MOL), facilitating higher Fe incorporation. The presence of these functional groups at the terminal position on chains of five or more carbons increases ligand flexibility and the ability to chelate metal centers.

- **Rule 2 & Rule 4**: **Electronic Effects on Aromatic Rings**

  Electron-withdrawing groups at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids stabilize the negative charge of the carboxylate ion, enhancing coordination with metal ions and increasing Fe/Hf ratios. Conversely, electron-donating groups reduce the acidity and binding affinity, leading to lower Fe incorporation.

- **Rule 3**: **Metal-Coordinating Functional Groups**

  Functional groups capable of strong coordination with metal ions (e.g., thiols, thioethers, pyridine rings, amino groups) promote higher Fe loading due to the formation of stable complexes with Fe ions. These groups can donate electron density to the metal, enhancing binding affinity.

- **Rule 5**: **Polyether Chains**

  Polyether chains increase solubility and provide multiple coordination sites through ether oxygen atoms. This flexibility and ability to form multiple coordination bonds can enhance Fe incorporation into the MOL.

- **Rule 6**: **Polyols, Sugar-like Structures, and Perfluoroalkyl Chains**

  Molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups or sugar-like structures may form intramolecular hydrogen bonds or have high hydrophilicity, which can hinder effective coordination with Fe ions. Perfluoroalkyl chains are highly electronegative and can repel metal ions, reducing Fe incorporation.

- **Rule 7**: **Steric and Electronic Effects of Aromatic Amino Acids**

  Amino acids with smaller aromatic side chains (like phenylalanine) have less steric hindrance and can coordinate more effectively with Fe ions, resulting in higher Fe/Hf values. Larger, electron-rich side chains (like indole in tryptophan) can impede coordination due to steric bulk and electron density.

- **Rule 8**: **Aldehyde and Ketone Groups on Aromatic Rings**

  Aldehyde and ketone groups directly attached to aromatic rings can participate in resonance with the aromatic system, reducing the ability of the carboxylate group to coordinate with metal ions and leading to lower Fe/Hf ratios.

- **Rule 9**: **Lack of Functional Groups**

  Simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups have limited ability to interact with the MOL beyond basic carboxylate coordination, resulting in lower Fe incorporation.

- **Rule 11**: **Combined Electronic and Coordination Effects**

  Modifiers with ketone groups on aliphatic chains attached to methoxy-substituted aromatic rings can enhance Fe incorporation due to the combined effects of electron-donating methoxy groups increasing the electron density for coordination and ketone groups providing additional coordination sites.

---

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a new modifier is likely to result in a high or low Fe/Hf value based on its molecular structure. These rules consider important physical-chemical properties such as:

- **Chelation Ability**: Functional groups that can donate lone pairs to metal ions (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, ether, thiol) enhance Fe incorporation.
- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups stabilize negative charges and enhance metal coordination, while electron-donating groups can reduce metal binding affinity.
- **Sterics**: Bulky groups can hinder effective coordination with metal centers due to spatial constraints.
- **Solubility and Flexibility**: Modifiers that improve solubility and have flexible chains can interact more effectively with the MOL.

---

**Note**: These rules aim to balance coverage of the dataset with specificity. Rules like **Rule 1**, **Rule 2**, **Rule 3**, and **Rule 4** cover broader categories and explain trends observed across multiple compounds. More specific rules like **Rule 11** address unique combinations of functional groups that have a significant impact on Fe/Hf values. By combining simple, high-coverage rules with more detailed ones, we can create a comprehensive predictive model for Fe/Hf values based on modifier structures.

It is well-supported by data points like 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-methylbenzoic acid, and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, providing good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 states that modifiers containing polyether chains predict a high Fe/Hf value. The clarity is sufficient, and it provides property insight by highlighting how polyether chains increase solubility and offer multiple coordination sites. The rule considers both the polyether chain and potential terminal amino groups, adding to its complexity. Supported by at least two data points—2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid and 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid—it shows acceptable coverage and balances complexity with practical applicability.

These rules capture the relationship between the molecular features of the modifiers and the Fe/Hf value in the dataset, combining multiple substructures and considering underlying physical-chemical properties:

- **Rule 1**: **Chain Length and Terminal Functional Groups**

  Aliphatic chains with five or more carbons and terminal primary amino or hydroxyl groups enhance flexibility and coordination ability, promoting higher Fe incorporation. The presence of these groups increases the likelihood of chelation with metal centers.

- **Rule 2**: **Electron-Withdrawing Groups on Aromatic Rings**

  Electron-withdrawing groups at the para position stabilize the carboxylate ion and enhance coordination with Fe ions, leading to higher Fe/Hf ratios. These groups withdraw electron density from the aromatic ring, increasing the acidity of the carboxylic acid and promoting metal binding.

- **Rule 3**: **Strong Metal-Coordinating Functional Groups**

  Functional groups like thiol, thioether, pyridine rings, and terminal amino groups have lone pairs that can strongly coordinate with Fe ions. Their presence facilitates the formation of stable complexes, increasing Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: **Electron-Donating Groups on Aromatic Rings**

  Electron-donating groups at the para position reduce the acidity of the carboxylic acid and decrease its ability to coordinate with Fe ions, resulting in lower Fe/Hf values. These groups donate electron density to the aromatic ring, weakening the carboxylate's binding affinity.

- **Rule 5**: **Polyether Chains**

  Modifiers with polyether chains improve solubility and provide multiple coordination sites through ether oxygen atoms. These features enhance flexibility and the ability to interact with Fe ions, promoting higher Fe loading.

- **Rule 6**: **Polyols, Sugar-Like Structures, and Perfluoroalkyl Chains**

  Molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups or sugar-like structures may form intramolecular hydrogen bonds or exhibit high hydrophilicity, hindering effective coordination with Fe ions. Perfluoroalkyl chains are highly electronegative and can repel metal ions, reducing Fe incorporation.

- **Rule 7**: **Amino Acid Side Chains**

  Amino acids with small non-polar or small aromatic side chains (like phenylalanine and aspartic acid) have less steric hindrance and can coordinate more effectively with Fe ions, resulting in higher Fe/Hf values. Those with larger or polar side chains (like glutamic acid and tryptophan) may hinder coordination due to steric bulk and electron density.

- **Rule 8**: **Aldehyde and Ketone Groups on Aromatic Rings**

  Aldehyde and ketone groups directly attached to aromatic rings can participate in resonance with the aromatic system, reducing the ability of the carboxylate group to coordinate with Fe ions and leading to lower Fe/Hf ratios.

- **Rule 9**: **Lack of Additional Functional Groups**

  Simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups have limited interaction with the metal-organic layer beyond basic carboxylate coordination, resulting in lower Fe incorporation.

- **Rule 10**: **Amide Groups and Acylated Amino Groups**

  Modifiers containing amide groups or acylated amino groups can enhance Fe incorporation due to the presence of additional coordination sites (lone pairs on nitrogen and oxygen atoms) and increased binding affinity toward metal centers.

---

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a new modifier is likely to result in a high or low Fe/Hf value based on its molecular structure. These rules consider important physical-chemical properties such as:

- **Chelation Ability**: Functional groups that can donate lone pairs (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, ether, thiol, amide) enhance Fe incorporation through coordination bonds.
- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups stabilize negative charges and enhance metal coordination, while electron-donating groups reduce metal binding affinity by donating electron density to the carboxylate group.
- **Steric Factors**: Smaller, less bulky side chains facilitate better coordination with metal centers due to reduced steric hindrance.
- **Chain Flexibility and Length**: Longer aliphatic chains with terminal functional groups increase flexibility and the potential to wrap around and coordinate with metal sites.
- **Solubility Enhancements**: Polyether chains and certain functional groups improve solubility in the reaction medium, facilitating better interaction with the catalyst.

---

These rules maintain a balance between broader coverage and specificity:

- **Rules with Higher Coverage**: Rules 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 cover larger portions of the dataset by focusing on common functional groups and structural features.
- **Rules with Lower Coverage**: Rules like 10 address specific combinations of functional groups that significantly impact Fe/Hf values, capturing unique or less common modifiers.

By combining multiple substructures and considering underlying chemical principles, these rules provide a comprehensive framework for predicting Fe/Hf values based on modifier structures.

**Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties:**

- **Coordination Ability**: Functional groups with lone pairs (amino, thiol, ether oxygen atoms) can coordinate with Fe³⁺ ions, enhancing metal incorporation into the catalyst and leading to higher Fe/Hf values (Rules 1, 4, 5, 9, 11).

- **Electronic Effects**:
  - *Electron-Withdrawing Groups*: Increase the acidity of carboxylic acids and stabilize negative charges, promoting stronger interactions with metal ions (Rule 2).
  - *Electron-Donating Groups*: Decrease acidity and reduce metal-binding affinity, resulting in lower Fe/Hf values (Rule 3).

- **Steric Factors**: Bulky or rigid structures can hinder efficient coordination due to steric hindrance or limited flexibility (Rules 8, 14, 15).

- **Chain Length and Flexibility**: Longer, flexible chains with terminal functional groups facilitate effective coordination with metal sites (Rule 1).

- **Functional Group Interactions**:
  - *Sulfur-Containing Groups*: Sulfur has a high affinity for metal ions, enhancing coordination with Fe³⁺ (Rule 4).
  - *Polyether Chains*: Ether oxygens can donate lone pairs, increasing interaction with metal ions (Rule 5).
  - *Amide Groups*: Provide additional coordination sites through lone pairs on nitrogen and oxygen atoms (Rule 9).

- **Hydrophilicity**: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups may be too hydrophilic or form extensive hydrogen bonds, interfering with metal coordination and reducing Fe incorporation (Rule 6).

- **Substitution Patterns**: The position of substituents on aromatic rings affects coordination:
  - *Para-Substituted Electron-Withdrawing Groups*: Enhance metal coordination (Rule 2).
  - *Para-Substituted Electron-Donating Groups*: Diminish metal coordination (Rule 3).
  - *Heterocyclic Rings at Para Position*: Provide additional coordination sites (Rule 11).
  - *Direct Attachment of Aldehyde Groups*: May interfere with coordination due to competing interactions (Rule 13).

- **Perfluoroalkyl Chains**: Highly electronegative fluorine atoms create strong C–F bonds, reducing the ability of the modifier to interact with metal ions (Rule 7).

**Balance of Coverage and Specificity:**

- **Broad Coverage**: Rules 1, 2, 3, and 6 cover significant portions of the dataset by focusing on common functional groups and substitution patterns.

- **Specificity**: Rules 4, 5, 9, 11, and 14 address specific functional groups or structural features that have a pronounced effect on Fe/Hf values.

---

By applying these rules, you can predict whether a new molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low Fe/Hf value based on its structural features. This approach combines an understanding of chemical properties with observed patterns in the dataset, aiding in the selection and design of modifiers to optimize the catalyst's performance in the δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

Examples such as **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** support this rule by showing high Fe/Hf values. The rule is clear, and the property insight is solid since sulfur atoms have a high affinity for metal ions, enhancing Fe coordination. The rule appropriately considers combinations of substructures and has adequate coverage.

- **Comment 5**:
  
  Rule 5 states that modifiers with polyether chains (multiple ether oxygen atoms) attached to a carboxylic acid or amino acid backbone predict a high Fe/Hf value (True). This is exemplified by **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, which shows a high Fe/Hf value. The rule is clear and provides good physical-chemical insight, as ether oxygen atoms can donate lone pairs to Fe³⁺ ions. Complexity is well-managed by considering both polyether chains and the backbone, and coverage is sufficient.

- **Comment 6**:
  
  Rule 6 specifies that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups (polyols) predict a low Fe/Hf value (False). Data points like **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** confirm this, exhibiting low Fe/Hf values.

  Rule 8 indicates that modifiers containing amide groups in their structure predict a high Fe/Hf value (True). Examples such as **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** demonstrate high Fe/Hf values, supporting the rule. The rule is clear and provides adequate property insight, with amide groups offering additional coordination sites. Complexity is balanced, and coverage is sufficient.

- **Comment 9**:
  
  Rule 9 states that modifiers which are aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups predict a low Fe/Hf value (False). **Octanoic acid** exemplifies this, showing a low Fe/Hf value. The rule is clear, with the property insight that the lack of coordinating groups leads to reduced Fe incorporation. While the rule is simple, it effectively covers relevant cases without unnecessary complexity.

- **Comment 10**:
  
  Rule 10 specifies that modifiers which are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with heterocyclic rings (e.g., pyridine) at the para position predict a high Fe/Hf value (True). Supported by data points like **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**, which shows a high Fe/Hf value, the rule is clear. The property insight is strong, as the heterocyclic rings provide additional coordination sites. Complexity and coverage are appropriately balanced.

- **Comment 11**:
  
  Rule 11 indicates that modifiers which are pyridine carboxylic acids or contain pyridine rings directly attached to the carboxylic acid predict a low Fe/Hf value (False). This is confirmed by **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, which has a low Fe/Hf value. The rule is clear and distinguishes itself from Rule 10 by focusing on the position of the pyridine ring. Property insight is adequate, suggesting differences in coordination behavior based on attachment points. Coverage is acceptable.

- **Comment 12**:
  
  Rule 12 states that modifiers with aldehyde groups directly attached to aromatic rings predict a low Fe/Hf value (False). Examples like **4-formylbenzoic acid** support this rule, exhibiting low Fe/Hf values. The rule is clear, and the property insight suggests that aldehyde groups may form competing interactions or reduce coordination ability. Complexity is moderate, and coverage meets the criteria.

- **Comment 13**:
  
  Rule 13 specifies that modifiers containing bulky aromatic or heteroaromatic side chains (e.g., indole, pyrazole) predict a low Fe/Hf value (False). This is supported by data points such as **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid**, which shows a low Fe/Hf value. The rule is clear, with adequate property insight that steric hindrance from bulky groups can reduce Fe incorporation. Complexity and coverage are appropriate.

- **Comment 14**:
  
  Rule 14 indicates that modifiers containing ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acids in aliphatic chains predict a low Fe/Hf value (False). **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** is an example showing a low Fe/Hf value. The rule is clear, though coverage is limited to one data point, which slightly weakens its robustness. The property insight is acceptable, as adjacent ketone groups may affect coordination ability. Complexity is adequate but could benefit from additional supporting data.

- **Comment 15**:
  
  Rule 15 states that modifiers with hydroxy groups on aliphatic chains predict a high Fe/Hf value (True) if the hydroxy group is not part of a polyol. **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** supports this rule by exhibiting a high Fe/Hf value. The rule is clear and provides property insight that a single hydroxy group can enhance coordination without the drawbacks associated with polyols. However, coverage is limited, and adding more examples would strengthen the rule.

- **Coordination Ability**: Functional groups with lone pairs (e.g., amino, sulfhydryl, ether oxygen atoms, sulfur-containing side chains) enhance coordination with Fe³⁺ ions, increasing Fe incorporation and leading to higher Fe/Hf values (Rules 1, 2, 5, 8, 9, 11). Lack of such groups or presence of groups that do not coordinate effectively results in lower Fe/Hf values (Rules 3, 4, 6, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15).

- **Electronic Effects**:

  - *Electron-Withdrawing Groups*: Groups capable of enhancing coordination through electron withdrawal (e.g., bromomethyl, pyridinyl) increase the acidity of carboxylic acids and improve metal binding (Rule 2).

  - *Electron-Donating Groups*: Substituents that donate electron density (e.g., amino, hydroxy, methyl groups on aromatic rings) reduce the carboxylic acid's ability to coordinate with Fe³⁺ ions, leading to lower Fe/Hf values (Rule 3).

- **Steric Factors**: Bulky side chains or heterocyclic rings may hinder coordination due to steric hindrance or unfavorable interactions, reducing Fe incorporation (Rule 6). Linear and flexible chains promote effective coordination (Rules 1, 5, 9).

- **Hydrophilicity**: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups (polyols) may engage in extensive hydrogen bonding or become too hydrophilic, interfering with metal coordination and reducing Fe incorporation (Rule 4).

- **Functional Group Interactions**:

  - *Sulfur-Containing Groups*: Sulfur atoms possess lone pairs and have a high affinity for metal ions, enhancing Fe coordination (Rule 11).

  - *Ether Chains*: Ether oxygen atoms can donate lone pairs to Fe³⁺ ions, acting as additional coordination sites (Rule 8).

  - *Hydroxy Groups on Aliphatic Chains*: A single hydroxyl group can enhance coordination without the steric hindrance or solubility issues caused by multiple hydroxyl groups (Rule 9).

- **Perfluoroalkyl Chains**: The presence of highly electronegative fluorine atoms in perfluoroalkyl chains reduces the electron density available for coordination, leading to lower Fe/Hf values (Rule 7).

- **Substitution Patterns on Aromatic Rings**:

  - *Para-Substituted Coordinating Groups*: Introduction of groups capable of coordination at the para position provides additional sites for metal binding (Rule 2).

  - *Electron-Donating Substituents*: Substituents like amino, hydroxy, or methyl groups decrease the carboxylic acid's coordination ability (Rule 3).

  - *Aldehyde Groups*: Aldehyde groups may form competing interactions or reduce coordination ability due to their own reactivity (Rule 12).

  - *Aliphatic Chains with Polar Groups*: Aliphatic chains attached to aromatic rings that contain polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl) can hinder effective coordination due to increased steric hindrance or solvation effects (Rule 14).

- **Functional Group Reactivity**:

  - *Ketones Adjacent to Carboxylic Acids*: The presence of a ketone group adjacent to a carboxylic acid may lead to keto-enol tautomerism or additional steric hindrance, reducing coordination efficiency (Rule 15).

These rules are designed to capture the relationship between the structural features of molecular modifiers and their impact on the Fe/Hf value in the catalyst. They combine multiple substructural elements and consider underlying physical and chemical properties such as coordination ability, electron density, steric effects, and the presence of coordinating heteroatoms.

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a given modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value:

- **High Fe/Hf Value (True)**: Modifiers that enhance coordination with Fe³⁺ ions through the presence of coordinating groups (e.g., amino groups, sulfur atoms, ether linkages), electron-withdrawing substituents, or structures that promote effective metal binding.

- **Low Fe/Hf Value (False)**: Modifiers that lack effective coordinating groups, contain electron-donating substituents, have steric hindrance due to bulky groups or multiple hydroxyls, or possess functional groups that interfere with metal coordination.

These rules balance coverage and specificity, providing a useful tool for predicting the Fe/Hf value based on the modifier's structural features. They align with observed data and can guide the selection or design of modifiers to optimize catalyst performance in the target reaction.

3. **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted at the para position with electron-donating groups predict a low Fe/Hf value (False).**

   - *Functional Groups Included*: Amino (-NH₂), hydroxy (-OH), methyl (-CH₃).
   - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, reducing metal coordination efficiency.
   - *Examples*: 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, 4-methylbenzoic acid.

4. **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (polyols), especially when the hydroxyls are on adjacent carbons, predict a low Fe/Hf value (False).**

   - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups can lead to steric hindrance and intramolecular hydrogen bonding, hindering effective coordination with Fe³⁺ ions.
   - *Examples*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (sugar acids), 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid.

5. **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing sulfur atoms in their side chains or functional groups predict a high Fe/Hf value (True).**

   - *Functional Groups Included*: Sulfanyl (-SH), methylsulfanyl (-SCH₃).
   - *Rationale*: Sulfur has a high affinity for transition metals like Fe³⁺, enhancing coordination through soft-hard acid-base interactions.
   - *Examples*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid, 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid.

6. **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with perfluoroalkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups predict a low Fe/Hf value (False).**

   - *Rationale*: Fluorinated groups are highly electron-withdrawing and hydrophobic, reducing the ability of the modifier to coordinate with Fe³⁺ ions and decreasing solubility in polar solvents.
   - *Examples*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid, 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

7. **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing polyether chains (multiple ether linkages) attached to a carboxylic acid predict a high Fe/Hf value (True).**

   - *Rationale*: Ether oxygen atoms can coordinate with metal ions, and flexible polyether chains enhance the chelating ability of the modifier.
   - *Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid.

8. **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with hydrophobic aromatic side chains predict a high Fe/Hf value (True), unless the side chain contains heteroatoms that may interfere with coordination.**

   - *Rationale*: Hydrophobic aromatic side chains like phenyl groups can engage in π interactions with the Fe³⁺ ion, enhancing binding, whereas heteroatoms in the side chain can interfere with coordination due to competing interactions.
   - *High Fe/Hf Example*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine).
   - *Low Fe/Hf Example*: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan, contains nitrogen in indole ring).

9. **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups predict a low Fe/Hf value (False).**

   - *Rationale*: Lack of functional groups capable of coordinating with Fe³⁺ ions results in minimal interaction and lower Fe incorporation.
   - *Example*: Octanoic acid.

10. **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde groups directly attached to aromatic rings predict a low Fe/Hf value (False).**

    - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can form hydrate or hemiacetal structures, reducing availability for metal coordination, and may undergo side reactions that interfere with catalyst formation.
    - *Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.

11. **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with substitutions at meta or ortho positions, especially with potential coordinating groups, predict a low Fe/Hf value (False).**

    - *Rationale*: Substituents at meta or ortho positions may cause steric hindrance and reduce the effectiveness of coordination with Fe³⁺ ions compared to para-substituted compounds.
    - *Examples*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (nicotinic acid), 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid.

12. **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with aliphatic chains attached to aromatic rings, where the chain contains hydroxy groups, predict a low Fe/Hf value (False).**

    - *Rationale*: Hydroxy groups on aliphatic chains can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds or increase hydrophilicity, reducing coordination with Fe³⁺ ions.
    - *Examples*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid.

13. **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acids in aliphatic chains predict a low Fe/Hf value (False).**

    - *Rationale*: Ketone groups near carboxylic acids can form stable chelate rings with metals other than Fe or create steric hindrance, reducing Fe³⁺ coordination.
    - *Example*: 4-oxoheptanedioic acid.

14. **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are fused-ring aromatic carboxylic acids containing ketone functionalities predict a high Fe/Hf value (True).**

    - *Rationale*: Fused-ring systems with ketone groups can provide conjugated systems that stabilize metal complexes through delocalized π-electron interactions.
    - *Example*: 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid.

15. **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are N-acetylated amino acids predict a high Fe/Hf value (True).**

    - *Rationale*: N-acetylation can enhance metal coordination by providing additional donor atoms (carbonyl oxygen) and improving the overall ligand field around the metal ion.
    - *Example*: (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid.

**End of Rules**

---

**Explanation and Rationale**

These rules were formulated by closely examining the structural features of the modifiers and understanding how these features influence the coordination with Fe³⁺ ions, thereby affecting the Fe/Hf ratio. The following key considerations were made:

- **Coordination Ability**: Functional groups capable of donating lone pairs (e.g., amino, sulfanyl, ether oxygen atoms) enhance coordination with Fe³⁺.
- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase acidity and facilitate metal coordination, while electron-donating groups have the opposite effect.
- **Steric Factors**: Steric hindrance from bulky groups or multiple substituents can impede effective coordination.
- **Chain Length and Flexibility**: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility, allowing better alignment of coordinating groups with the metal ion.
- **Aromaticity and Conjugation**: Aromatic systems and conjugated double bonds can stabilize metal complexes through π interactions.

**Balance Between Coverage and Specificity**

The rules aim to cover a broad range of the dataset while maintaining specificity:

- **High Coverage Rules**: Rules 1, 2, 3, and 4 cover common structural features affecting a significant portion of the dataset.
- **Specific Rules**: Rules 14 and 15 address unique structural motifs with significant impact on the Fe/Hf ratio, despite fewer examples.

**Application of Rules**

By applying these rules, researchers can predict the Fe/Hf outcome for new modifiers:

- **High Fe/Hf Value (True)**: Select modifiers fitting Rules 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 14, or 15 to enhance Fe incorporation into the catalyst.
- **Low Fe/Hf Value (False)**: Avoid modifiers described by Rules 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 to prevent low Fe content.

**Conclusion**

The generated rules effectively describe the relationship between molecular modifiers' structural features and the Fe/Hf ratio, balancing simplicity and complexity. By considering both sub-structural combinations and underlying physical-chemical properties, these rules provide a practical guide for selecting or designing modifiers to optimize catalyst performance in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

**Analysis of the Dataset and Generation of Improved Rules**

After a thorough analysis of the dataset and careful consideration of the current rules and any advice provided, we have developed a set of refined rules. These rules aim to accurately describe the relationship between the structural features of molecular modifiers and the Fe/Hf ratio (high or low value). The rules combine multiple sub-structures (functional groups) and underlying physical-chemical properties to predict the Fe/Hf outcome effectively.

---

   - **Examples**: 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, 4-methylbenzoic acid.

4. **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing polyether chains (multiple ether linkages) attached to a carboxylic acid predict a high Fe/Hf value (True).**

   - **Functional Groups Included**: Ether linkages (-O-), carboxylic acid (-COOH).
   - **Rationale**: Ether oxygen atoms can coordinate with metal ions, and flexible polyether chains enhance the chelating ability of the modifier.
   - **Examples**: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid.

5. **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups predict a low Fe/Hf value (False).**

   - **Functional Groups Included**: Carboxylic acid (-COOH), long aliphatic chain.
   - **Rationale**: Lack of additional coordinating groups results in minimal interaction with Fe³⁺ ions, leading to lower Fe incorporation.

    - **Example**: (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid.

**End of Rules**

---

**Explanation and Rationale**

The rules above are formulated to capture the relationship between the structural features of molecular modifiers and the Fe/Hf ratio, considering both the combination of functional groups and the underlying physical-chemical properties.

- **Coordination Ability**: Functional groups like amino, pyridyl, sulfanyl, ether oxygen, and ketone groups enhance the ability of the modifier to coordinate with Fe³⁺ ions.
- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of carboxylic acids, promoting deprotonation and metal coordination. Electron-donating groups have the opposite effect.
- **Steric Factors**: Bulky groups or multiple substituents can cause steric hindrance, reducing effective metal coordination.
- **Aromatic vs. Aliphatic Systems**: Aromatic systems with appropriate substituents can stabilize metal complexes through π interactions, while aliphatic chains provide flexibility but may require additional functional groups for effective coordination.
- **Hydrophilicity and Hydrophobicity**: Modifiers with hydrophilic groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) can enhance solubility and coordination, whereas hydrophobic groups (e.g., perfluoroalkyl) may decrease interaction with metal ions.

**Balance Between Coverage and Specificity**

The rules aim for a balance between broad coverage and specificity:

- **Broad Coverage**: Rules like 1, 2, and 3 cover common structural motifs found in multiple modifiers, providing guidelines that apply to a wide range of compounds.
- **Specificity**: Rules like 12 and 15 address unique structural features that, while less common, have a significant impact on the Fe/Hf ratio.

**Application of Rules**

Researchers can use these rules to predict the Fe/Hf outcome for new molecular modifiers:

- **To Achieve High Fe/Hf Value (True)**:
  - Select modifiers with functional groups known to enhance metal coordination (e.g., terminal amino groups, pyridyl substituents, sulfur-containing groups).
  - Utilize modifiers with structures that stabilize metal complexes (e.g., fused-ring aromatic systems with ketone functionalities).

- **To Avoid Low Fe/Hf Value (False)**:
  - Avoid modifiers with electron-donating groups at positions that reduce metal coordination.
  - Steer clear of modifiers with steric hindrance or groups that may compete with desired coordination sites (e.g., multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups, aldehyde groups).

**Conclusion**

By incorporating both structural features and physical-chemical properties, these refined rules provide a practical framework for predicting the Fe/Hf ratio based on the molecular structure of modifiers. This guidance will aid in the selection and design of modifiers to optimize the catalyst's performance in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

     - **Functional Groups Included**: Phenyl group attached to an amino acid backbone.
     - **Rationale**: Smaller aromatic rings like phenyl groups may facilitate π interactions and potentially coordinate with Fe³⁺ ions without significant steric hindrance.
     - **Example**: 
       - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)
   - **Subrule 7b**: **Modifiers with bulky aromatic side chains predict a low Fe/Hf value (False).**
     - **Functional Groups Included**: Larger aromatic systems like indole rings attached to an amino acid backbone.

      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

12. **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are N-acetylated amino acids predict a high Fe/Hf value (True).**

    - **Functional Groups Included**: N-acetyl group (-NHCOCH₃) attached to an amino acid backbone.
    - **Rationale**: N-acetylation introduces an additional carbonyl group that can participate in metal coordination. The overall structure supports multidentate binding to Fe³⁺ ions, enhancing metal incorporation.
    - **Example**: 
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

13. **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with long aliphatic chains and terminal hydroxy groups predict a high Fe/Hf value (True).**

    - **Functional Groups Included**: Long aliphatic chain, terminal hydroxy group (-OH), carboxylic acid (-COOH).
    - **Rationale**: The hydroxy group at the end of a long chain may increase the modifier's solubility and provide additional coordination sites, facilitating interaction with Fe³⁺ ions through extended chelation.
    - **Example**: 
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

14. **Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing pyridine rings predict Fe/Hf values based on the position of the carboxylic acid group relative to the nitrogen atom.**

    - **Subrule 14a**: **Modifiers with pyridine rings attached through a para linkage predict a high Fe/Hf value (True).**
      - **Functional Groups Included**: Pyridine ring connected to a benzene ring bearing a carboxylic acid group at the para position.
      - **Rationale**: The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with Fe³⁺ ions, and the para linkage optimizes the spatial arrangement for effective coordination.
      - **Examples**: 
        - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
        - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 provides a clear structural description for identifying relevant modifiers. The rationale that electron-withdrawing groups enhance coordination with Fe³⁺ ions due to increased acidity and additional coordination sites is chemically reasonable. The rule considers a combination of functional groups and is supported by multiple data points (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid), ensuring good coverage.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 clearly defines modifiers with aromatic carboxylic acids and para-position electron-donating groups, predicting a low Fe/Hf value. The rationale that electron-donating groups decrease acidity and hinder coordination with Fe³⁺ ions is chemically justified. The rule involves a combination of functional groups and is supported by data points such as 4-aminobenzoic acid and 4-methylbenzoic acid, providing adequate coverage.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear in identifying sulfur-containing modifiers that predict a high Fe/Hf value. The rationale that sulfur's ability to coordinate with Fe³⁺ ions enhances metal binding is sound. The rule combines the presence of sulfur functional groups with consideration of their coordination properties. It is supported by data points such as 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid and 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid, ensuring sufficient coverage.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 clearly identifies modifiers with polyether chains and terminal carboxylic acid groups, predicting a high Fe/Hf value. The rationale that ether oxygens coordinate with Fe³⁺ ions and the flexibility allows multidentate coordination is plausible. The rule combines multiple functional groups and structural features and is supported by data points such as 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid and 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid, providing good coverage.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 specifies modifiers with nitrogen heterocycles capable of coordinating with Fe³⁺ ions, predicting a high Fe/Hf value. The rationale is valid, as nitrogen atoms in heterocycles coordinate with metals. The rule involves specific structural features and is supported by data points like 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid and 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid, demonstrating adequate coverage.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear in predicting a low Fe/Hf value for aliphatic carboxylic acids without strong coordinating groups. The rationale that lack of coordinating groups limits Fe³⁺ binding is sound. While the rule is simpler, it effectively captures the lack of coordination sites. Supported by data points such as octanoic acid and 4-oxoheptanedioic acid, the coverage is sufficient.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 allows identification of modifiers with aldehyde groups on aromatic rings, predicting a low Fe/Hf value. The rationale, considering reactivity of aldehyde groups and their effect on coordination, is acceptable. The rule is supported by data points like 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid, providing adequate coverage.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 identifies modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups that predict a low Fe/Hf value. The rationale that polyols' hydrophilicity and hydrogen bonding interfere with metal coordination is reasonable. The rule considers combinations of functional groups and is supported by data points like 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid and (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid, ensuring coverage.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 states that modifiers with perfluoroalkyl or trifluoromethyl groups predict a low Fe/Hf value. The rationale regarding electron-withdrawing effects and reduced coordination due to hydrophobicity is chemically sound. The rule is straightforward and is supported by data points such as 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid and 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid, demonstrating adequate coverage.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 distinguishes between amino acids with small versus bulky aromatic side chains, providing clear predictions. The rationale that bulky side chains cause steric hindrance, reducing coordination, is acceptable. The rule accounts for subtle structural differences and is supported by data points like phenylalanine (True) and tryptophan (False), giving adequate coverage.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 identifies modifiers with aromatic hydroxyl groups predicting a low Fe/Hf value. The rationale that phenolic hydroxyl groups may hinder metal coordination due to hydrogen bonding and resonance stabilization is sound. The rule is supported by data points such as 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid, ensuring good coverage.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear in predicting a high Fe/Hf value for N-acetylated amino acids. The rationale that N-acetylation adds a coordination site is acceptable. However, the rule appears to be supported by only one data point ((2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid), so coverage is limited.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 indicates that modifiers with ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acids have varying Fe/Hf values depending on the structure, making predictions less clear. The rationale is somewhat speculative. The rule is not definitive and is supported by limited data (e.g., 4-oxoheptanedioic acid predicting low Fe/Hf), so coverage and clarity are lacking.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 predicts Fe/Hf values based on the chain length and presence of amino groups in aliphatic dicarboxylic acids. The distinctions between short-chain with amino groups (high Fe/Hf) and longer-chain or without amino groups (low Fe/Hf) are clear. The rationale about chelate stability and steric effects is reasonable. Data points support the rule (e.g., (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid - True, (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid - False), providing adequate coverage.

   - **Example**:
     - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

10. **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl chains predict a low Fe/Hf value (False).**

    - **Functional Groups Included**: Perfluoroalkyl groups (-CₙF₂ₙ₊₁) attached to aliphatic carboxylic acids.
    - **Rationale**: Highly electronegative fluorine atoms withdraw electron density, reducing the ability of carboxylate groups to coordinate with Fe³⁺ ions. Additionally, the hydrophobic nature may hinder interactions in polar solvents used in the reaction.
    - **Example**:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

11. **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups predict a low Fe/Hf value (False).**

    - **Functional Groups Included**: Aromatic ring with a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an aldehyde group (-CHO), especially when the aldehyde is adjacent to the carboxylic acid.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: **Rule 1** is clear and well-defined, specifying that linear aliphatic amino acids with terminal primary amino and carboxylic acid groups connected by an unbranched aliphatic chain of at least four carbon atoms predict a high Fe/Hf value. The rationale provides strong physico-chemical insight into how these functional groups facilitate chelation with Fe³⁺ ions. The rule combines multiple sub-structures (functional groups and chain length), demonstrating appropriate complexity. With at least four data points supporting the rule (e.g., 5-aminopentanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid, (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid), the coverage is excellent.

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 2** is clearly articulated, focusing on aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position predicting a high Fe/Hf value. The rationale effectively explains how electron-withdrawing groups enhance the acidity of the carboxylic acid, promoting coordination with Fe³⁺ ions. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures (aromatic ring, carboxylic acid, electron-withdrawing substituents), showing appropriate complexity. It is well-supported by multiple data points (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid), indicating strong coverage.

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 3** is clear in identifying modifiers containing sulfur atoms capable of coordinating with metals, predicting a high Fe/Hf value. The rationale is solid, highlighting the ability of sulfur atoms to efficiently coordinate with Fe³⁺ ions due to their lone pair electrons. The rule combines sulfur-containing functional groups with various molecular backbones, offering suitable complexity. With at least two supporting data points (4-sulfanylbenzoic acid and 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid), the coverage is adequate.

- **Comment 4**: **Rule 4** is clearly defined, emphasizing aliphatic carboxylic acids with polyether chains and terminal coordinating groups predicting a high Fe/Hf value. The rationale provides good physico-chemical insight into how ether oxygen atoms and flexible polyether chains enhance coordination with Fe³⁺ ions. The rule combines polyether chains with terminal functional groups, demonstrating appropriate complexity. It is supported by at least two data points (2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid and 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid), ensuring reasonable coverage.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** is clear, stating that linear aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups predict a low Fe/Hf value. The rationale effectively explains that the absence of supplementary coordinating groups reduces the ability to chelate Fe³⁺ ions. While the rule is simpler, focusing on the lack of functional groups, it provides broad coverage, which is valuable. Supported by multiple data points (e.g., octanoic acid, 4-oxoheptanedioic acid, 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), the coverage is strong.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** is clear and well-explained, indicating that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position predict a low Fe/Hf value. The rationale soundly discusses how electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, hindering coordination with Fe³⁺ ions. The rule combines multiple sub-structures, including the aromatic ring, carboxylic acid, and para substituents, showing appropriate complexity. It is substantiated by several data points (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-methylbenzoic acid, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid), providing good coverage.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** clearly states that modifiers containing multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups (polyols) predict a low Fe/Hf value. The rationale is satisfactory, considering that high hydrophilicity and intramolecular hydrogen bonding can hinder metal coordination. The rule focuses on a specific combination of sub-structures (adjacent hydroxyl groups), offering suitable complexity. With at least two supporting data points (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid and 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid), the coverage is adequate.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** posits that amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains predict a low Fe/Hf value. However, the data shows inconsistency. For instance, (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine) has a *high* Fe/Hf value, contrary to the rule's prediction. Only (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan) supports the rule. The rule lacks clarity due to conflicting data and has insufficient coverage, undermining its reliability.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** suggests that aromatic carboxylic acids fused with additional carbonyl-containing rings predict a high Fe/Hf value. The rationale is reasonable, but the rule lacks clarity due to its specificity and has limited complexity. Only one data point (1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) supports the rule, which is insufficient for strong coverage, reducing its reliability.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** indicates that modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl chains predict a low Fe/Hf value. While the rationale is acceptable, considering the electron-withdrawing effects of fluorine atoms, the rule has limited complexity and is supported by only one data point (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid). The coverage is insufficient, which diminishes the rule's robustness.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** clearly states that aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups predict a low Fe/Hf value. The rationale is solid, explaining how aldehyde groups may interfere with metal coordination. The rule combines multiple sub-structures, showing appropriate complexity. With two supporting data points (4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid), the coverage is acceptable.

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** is clear, indicating that aromatic nitrogen heterocycles with carboxylic acid groups predict a low Fe/Hf value. The rationale is plausible, noting that nitrogen lone pairs may be less available for coordination. The rule has suitable complexity by combining heterocyclic structures with carboxylic acids. It is supported by multiple data points (e.g., 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid, pyridine-3-carboxylic acid), providing strong coverage.

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13** asserts that aliphatic dicarboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups predict a low Fe/Hf value. However, the examples provided (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid) contain amino groups, contradicting the rule's description. Additionally, the data for (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid shows a high Fe/Hf value, conflicting with the rule's prediction. The rule lacks clarity and sufficient coverage due to these inconsistencies.

- **Comment 14**: **Rule 14** clearly states that aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxylate predict a low Fe/Hf value. The rationale is sound, considering intramolecular hydrogen bonding hindering metal coordination. The rule combines specific positions of functional groups, demonstrating suitable complexity. With two supporting data points (5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid and 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid), the coverage is adequate.

- **Comment 15**: **Rule 15** proposes that aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy groups on the aromatic ring predict a high Fe/Hf value. The rationale is less convincing since methoxy groups are electron-donating, which typically decreases carboxylic acid acidity and may hinder metal coordination. The rule lacks clarity due to this contradiction and is supported by only one data point (4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), resulting in insufficient coverage.
