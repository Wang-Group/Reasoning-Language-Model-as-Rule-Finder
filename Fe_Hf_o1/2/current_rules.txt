**Start of Rules**

---

**Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing both an *amino group (-NH₂)* and a *carboxylic acid group (-COOH)* separated by an aliphatic chain of at least four carbon atoms predict a **high Fe/Hf** value.**

- **Explanation**: The amino and carboxylate groups can act as bidentate ligands, effectively chelating Fe ions. The longer aliphatic chain provides flexibility for optimal coordination geometry, enhancing Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (Entry 2)
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Entry 31)
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Entry 34)
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Entry 0) – Additional carboxylate groups may hinder effective chelation due to over-coordination or steric hindrance.
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Entry 3) – Amino and carboxylate groups attached directly to the aromatic ring may not have optimal geometry for chelation.

---

**Rule 2**: **Modifiers featuring a *pyridine ring* where the nitrogen atom can coordinate with Fe, and a *carboxylic acid group (-COOH)* attached directly or via a short aliphatic chain predict a **high Fe/Hf** value.**

- **Explanation**: The lone pair on the pyridine nitrogen and the carboxylate oxygen can coordinate simultaneously with Fe ions, forming stable complexes. The positioning of these groups allows for effective chelation.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 11)
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** (Entry 24)
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Entry 21) – The nitrogen and carboxylate groups are positioned such that simultaneous coordination is less favorable due to geometrical constraints.

---

**Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing both a *thiol group (-SH)* and a *carboxylic acid group (-COOH)* predict a **high Fe/Hf** value if the thiol and carboxylate are appropriately spaced to allow chelation.**

- **Explanation**: Thiol groups are strong ligands for Fe ions. Combined with a carboxylate group, they can chelate Fe effectively. The spatial arrangement must allow both groups to coordinate simultaneously.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 17)
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Entry 9)

---

**Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are carboxylic acids (aromatic or aliphatic) without additional strong coordinating groups predict a **low Fe/Hf** value.**

- **Explanation**: Without extra coordinating functionalities, these modifiers have limited ability to chelate Fe ions, resulting in lower Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

- **Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **Octanoic acid** (Entry 4)
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 22)
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Entry 27)
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Entry 21)

---

**Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *electron-withdrawing groups* (e.g., nitro -NO₂) on the ring predict a **high Fe/Hf** value.**

- **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing the carboxylate's ability to donate electron density to Fe ions. This facilitates stronger coordination and higher Fe incorporation.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Entry 20)
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19) – Despite having an electron-withdrawing group (aldehyde), steric factors or resonance effects may reduce coordination effectiveness.

---

**Rule 6**: **Modifiers featuring *polyether chains* (repeating -O-CH₂CH₂- units) ending with a *carboxylic acid group (-COOH)* predict a **high Fe/Hf** value.**

- **Explanation**: The oxygen atoms in the polyether chain can coordinate with Fe ions. The flexible chain allows for multiple coordination points, enhancing Fe binding and incorporation.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 10)
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32)
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (Entry 5) – Multiple hydroxyl groups may form hydrogen bonds, reducing their availability for metal coordination.

---

**Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are *amino acids* with *aromatic side chains* capable of participating in coordination predict a **high Fe/Hf** value.**

- **Explanation**: The amino and carboxylate groups provide primary coordination sites, while aromatic side chains can offer additional stabilization through π-interactions or direct coordination if they contain suitable substituents.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Entry 12)
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Entry 14) – The bulky indole group may cause steric hindrance, reducing coordination efficiency.

---

**Rule 8**: **Modifiers with multiple adjacent *hydroxyl groups (-OH)* (polyols) along with a *carboxylic acid group (-COOH)* predict a **low Fe/Hf** value.**

- **Explanation**: Extensive hydrogen bonding among hydroxyl groups can decrease their availability for metal coordination. The formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds may also alter the structure, making coordination less favorable.

- **Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Entry 8)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (Entry 5)

---

**Rule 9**: **Modifiers featuring a combination of *amide bonds (-CONH-)* and additional coordination sites such as an *amino group (-NH₂)* or *thioether (-S-)* predict a **high Fe/Hf** value.**

- **Explanation**: Amide groups can participate in coordination through the carbonyl oxygen and/or nitrogen lone pairs. Additional coordinating groups like amino or thioether enhance the overall binding capacity to Fe ions.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 33)
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (Entry 23)

---

**Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing *nonaromatic heterocycles* with nitrogen atoms that are less accessible for coordination predict a **low Fe/Hf** value.**

- **Explanation**: Nonaromatic heterocycles may have nitrogen lone pairs involved in internal resonance or hydrogen bonding, making them less available for effective metal coordination.

- **Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 15)
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 7)

---

**Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *electron-donating groups* (e.g., hydroxyl -OH, methoxy -OCH₃) on the ring predict a **low Fe/Hf** value unless additional coordinating groups are present.**

- **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, reducing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions. Without other strong coordinating sites, Fe incorporation remains low.

- **Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Entry 6)
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30)
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Entry 26)

---

**Rule 12**: **Modifiers with long-chain *aliphatic hydroxyl groups (-OH)* and a *carboxylic acid group (-COOH)* predict a **high Fe/Hf** value.**

- **Explanation**: The hydroxyl group can coordinate with Fe ions, and the flexible aliphatic chain allows the hydroxyl and carboxylate groups to adopt conformations favorable for chelation.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Entry 29)

---

**Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing multiple *electron-withdrawing groups* (e.g., fluorine atoms) in the aliphatic chain predict a **low Fe/Hf** value.**

- **Explanation**: Strong electron-withdrawing groups reduce the basicity of potential coordinating atoms (like oxygen), making them less effective at donating electron density to Fe ions for coordination.

- **Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Entry 13)
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** (Entry 28)

---

**Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing *ketone groups (C=O)* adjacent to an aromatic ring and a *carboxylic acid group (-COOH)* predict a **high Fe/Hf** value when the ketone can participate in coordination.**

- **Explanation**: The ketone oxygen provides an additional coordination site. Conjugation with the aromatic ring can stabilize the Fe complex through delocalization of electron density.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Entry 16)
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (Entry 25)

---

**Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing both *thioether groups (-S-)* and *amide bonds (-CONH-)* along with a *carboxylic acid group (-COOH)* predict a **high Fe/Hf** value.**

- **Explanation**: Thioethers and amides contribute additional coordination sites through sulfur and nitrogen atoms. This multiplicity of coordinating groups enhances Fe binding and incorporation.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (Entry 23)

These rules illustrate how combinations of specific sub-structures (functional groups) in molecular modifiers influence the Fe/Hf ratio. By considering underlying physicochemical properties—such as coordination ability, electronic effects, and steric factors—these rules can predict whether a modifier will lead to a high or low Fe/Hf value. This predictive framework assists in designing effective modifiers to optimize catalyst performance and enhance the yield of the target δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------
