**End of Rules**

---

**Explanation:**

- **Rule 1** captures modifiers that can coordinate with metals through the terminal amino group on an aliphatic chain, enhancing Fe loading.
- **Rule 2** acknowledges that simple aliphatic acids lack additional coordinating sites, resulting in lower Fe loading.
- **Rule 3** focuses on thiol groups, which have strong metal-binding ability due to the sulfur atom.
- **Rules 4 and 5** differentiate the effects of electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups on aromatic rings, influencing metal coordination.
- **Rules 6 and 7** distinguish between pyridine rings connected via linkers (which can enhance Fe coordination) and those directly attached (which may not favor coordination).
- **Rule 8** highlights PEG-like structures that provide flexible coordination environments for metal ions.
- **Rule 9** considers ω-hydroxy acids, where the terminal hydroxyl group can participate in metal coordination.
- **Rule 10** notes that heavily hydroxylated acids may not favor high Fe loading due to steric hindrance or competition between coordinating groups.
- **Rule 11** observes that perfluorinated chains, which are electron-withdrawing and hydrophobic, may not favor metal coordination.
- **Rule 12** differentiates aromatic amino acids based on the nature of their side chains, affecting their metal-binding properties.
- **Rule 13** recognizes that amide-linked aromatic rings with electron-donating groups may not enhance Fe loading due to resonance structures that delocalize electron density away from potential coordination sites.
- **Rule 14** includes modifiers with multiple coordinating groups (acetamido and amino) enhancing Fe binding.
- **Rule 15** includes methoxy-substituted aromatic rings connected by linkers, where methoxy groups can influence electron density and coordination ability.

These rules aim to provide clear guidelines for predicting whether a molecular modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf ratio based on its structural features and functional groups, considering underlying chemical principles.---------------------------------------------------------------

    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **omega-functionalized aliphatic carboxylic acids** with a **terminal primary amino or thiol (–SH) group** at the end of a straight carbon chain (chain length of 3 or more carbons), and **no additional bulky or hindering groups**, have **Fe/Hf\_high\_or\_low\_value = True**.
  - *Examples*: 5-aminopentanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid, 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted functional groups capable of metal coordination**, such as **pyridyl rings, nitro groups, or bromomethyl groups**, have **Fe/Hf\_high\_or\_low\_value = True**.
  - *Examples*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid.

  - *Examples*: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid), (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic or aromatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups**, or with **electron-donating substituents** (e.g., **methyl, amino, hydroxyl**), have **Fe/Hf\_high\_or\_low\_value = False**.

  - *Examples*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan).

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids** where the **heterocycle is directly attached to the carboxyl group** and **lacks additional coordinating groups**, have **Fe/Hf\_high\_or\_low\_value = False**.

  - *Examples*: Octanoic acid, 4-oxoheptanedioic acid.

**End of Rules**

---

These rules aim to capture the relationship between the structural features of the molecular modifiers and their impact on the **Fe/Hf\_high\_or\_low\_value**. By focusing on the presence of functional groups capable of metal coordination (e.g., amino, thiol, pyridyl) and the absence of such groups, we can predict the relative Fe/Hf ratio effectively.

- **Rules 1-4** identify modifiers that are likely to coordinate with metal centers due to the presence of coordinating groups, leading to a **True** value.
- **Rules 5-10** cover modifiers lacking coordinating groups or possessing features that hinder coordination, resulting in a **False** value.

These rules consider underlying physical-chemical properties such as coordination ability, electron-withdrawing or donating effects, and steric hindrance, aligning with the requirements for generating meaningful and predictive rules.---------------------------------------------------------------

**End of Rules**

---

**Explanation and Justification:**

1. **Rule 1** focuses on aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal primary amino or thiol groups on straight chains of three or more carbons. These functional groups are excellent ligands for metal coordination, especially when positioned at the end of a flexible aliphatic chain. The lack of branching or additional functional groups minimizes steric hindrance, facilitating effective iron coordination and resulting in a higher Fe/Hf ratio.

2. **Rule 2** identifies aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups capable of metal coordination, such as thiol, bromomethyl, or nitro groups. These groups enhance the ability of the modifier to coordinate with iron due to their electron-withdrawing nature and availability of lone pairs or polarizable electrons, leading to increased Fe incorporation.

3. **Rule 3** pertains to modifiers containing a pyridine ring connected via a linker (such as an alkyl chain or aromatic ring) to a carboxylic acid group, forming a bidentate ligand system. The nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring can coordinate with iron, and the linker allows for optimal spatial arrangement, promoting a higher Fe/Hf ratio.

4. **Rule 4** includes modifiers with flexible ether chains terminating with coordinating groups like amino or methoxy. The flexibility of the ether chain allows the terminal group to effectively interact with the metal center. These structures resemble polyethylene glycol derivatives, which are known to enhance coordination with metals.

5. **Rule 5** covers alpha-amino acids with sulfur-containing side chains or additional acetamido groups. Sulfur atoms have a high affinity for transition metals like iron, and acetamido groups can participate in coordination through lone pairs on nitrogen or oxygen, enhancing Fe incorporation.

6. **Rule 6** addresses modifiers lacking functional groups capable of effective metal coordination. Aliphatic or aromatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating sites do not provide sufficient interaction with iron ions, resulting in a lower Fe/Hf ratio.

7. **Rule 7** includes modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups or bulky polyhydroxylated structures. While hydroxyl groups can coordinate with metals, the presence of multiple such groups and bulky structures can lead to steric hindrance and chelation effects that prevent effective iron coordination within the MOL framework.

8. **Rule 8** identifies aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-donating groups that are not effective at coordinating metals, such as amino, hydroxyl, or methyl groups. These substituents do not enhance metal coordination significantly and may even hinder it due to electron donation to the aromatic ring, reducing the affinity for metal ions.

9. **Rule 9** focuses on modifiers with perfluoroalkyl chains or non-coordinating electron-withdrawing groups. Perfluoroalkyl groups are highly electronegative and do not possess lone pairs for coordination, thus failing to promote iron incorporation.

10. **Rule 10** pertains to heterocyclic carboxylic acids where the heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen in pyridine or pyrazole) are not positioned favorably for coordination with iron in the MOL framework. The geometry or electronic environment does not facilitate effective interaction with the metal center, resulting in a lower Fe/Hf ratio.

---

**Alignment with Physical-Chemical Properties:**

- **Coordination Ability:** Functional groups capable of donating lone pairs (e.g., amino, thiol, pyridine nitrogen) enhance metal coordination. The presence and position of these groups significantly impact the Fe/Hf ratio.
  
- **Electron-Withdrawing vs. Donating Groups:** Electron-withdrawing groups can stabilize metal complexes, while electron-donating groups may reduce metal binding affinity.
  
- **Steric Factors:** Linear, unbranched chains and flexible linkers facilitate coordination by allowing functional groups to approach metal centers without steric hindrance.
  
- **Geometry and Accessibility:** The spatial arrangement of functional groups and heteroatoms affects their ability to coordinate with metals. Modifiers where coordinating atoms are accessible and properly oriented favor higher Fe incorporation.

---

**Coverage and Balance:**

- The revised set of **10 rules** provides comprehensive coverage of the dataset while maintaining a balance between simplicity and specificity.
  
- **Rules 1-5** focus on modifiers that lead to a **high Fe/Hf ratio**, emphasizing the importance of coordinating functional groups and molecular geometry.
  
- **Rules 6-10** address modifiers resulting in a **low Fe/Hf ratio**, highlighting the lack of effective coordinating sites or the presence of groups that hinder metal coordination.
  
- The rules combine multiple sub-structures and functional groups to make more predictive and generalizable statements about the modifiers.
  
- By merging similar rules and eliminating redundancies, the rules are streamlined for better applicability without sacrificing accuracy.

---

**Conclusion:**

The revised rules closely adhere to the specified requirements by:

- Combining multiple sub-structures to illustrate direct correlations between functional groups and Fe/Hf ratios.
  
- Considering underlying physical-chemical properties such as coordination chemistry, electronic effects, and steric factors.
  
- Clearly predicting the **Fe/Hf\_high\_or\_low\_value** for any SMILES structure fitting the descriptions.
  
- Prioritizing broader coverage of the dataset while balancing rule complexity.
  
- Generating an appropriate number of rules (10) within the specified range (5-15).
  
- Improving upon the current rules by refining definitions and consolidating overlapping or redundant rules.

These rules provide a robust framework for predicting the impact of molecular modifiers on the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst system, aiding in the optimization and control of the reaction yield for the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization.---------------------------------------------------------------

**End of Rules**

---

**Explanation and Justification:**

1. **Rule 1** emphasizes that straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal coordinating groups like –NH₂, –SH, or –OH are effective in increasing the Fe/Hf ratio. The chain length provides flexibility, allowing the terminal group to effectively coordinate with iron ions. This coordination enhances iron incorporation into the catalyst.

2. **Rule 2** focuses on aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted groups capable of metal coordination. Functional groups like pyridyl, sulfhydryl, and nitro can coordinate with iron due to available lone pairs or resonance structures. The para position is crucial as it allows the coordinating group to be optimally oriented for interaction with the metal center.

3. **Rule 3** highlights the importance of flexible linkers ending with coordinating groups. Ether chains provide flexibility, enabling the terminal functional group to reach and coordinate with iron ions. Amino and methoxy groups are good ligands because of their lone pair electrons.

4. **Rule 4** encompasses modifiers that can chelate the metal ion through multiple coordinating atoms. Chelation forms more stable complexes, effectively increasing the Fe/Hf ratio. Functional groups that provide multiple coordination sites enhance iron binding.

5. **Rule 5** identifies that electron-donating groups like –NH₂ and –OH in the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids are not effective in coordinating iron under the given conditions. These groups may not facilitate effective metal-ligand interactions, leading to lower Fe/Hf ratios.

6. **Rule 6** points out that modifiers lacking additional coordinating groups or having non-coordinating substituents do not effectively increase the Fe/Hf ratio. Sterically hindered groups or substituents that do not participate in coordination fail to enhance iron incorporation.

7. **Rule 7** notes that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups or bulky hydrophilic substituents can hinder effective coordination due to steric crowding. Excessive hydroxylation or bulky groups prevent close interaction between the ligand and iron ions.

8. **Rule 8** addresses modifiers where heterocycles contain nitrogen atoms not favorably positioned for coordination. If the nitrogen's lone pair is involved in resonance stabilization, it becomes less available for metal coordination, reducing the Fe/Hf ratio.

9. **Rule 9** highlights that strong electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density on potential coordinating sites, making them less effective in metal coordination. Non-coordinating electron-withdrawing groups do not contribute to iron binding and may impede coordination.

---

**Alignment with Physical-Chemical Properties:**

- **Coordination Chemistry:** Effective metal coordination requires functional groups with lone pair electrons positioned correctly to interact with metal ions. Coordinating groups like –NH₂, –SH, –OH, and pyridyl nitrogen are crucial for binding iron.

- **Steric Considerations:** Flexibility and minimal steric hindrance allow ligands to approach metal centers closely. Bulky substituents or multiple hydrophilic groups can prevent effective coordination due to spatial constraints.

- **Electronic Effects:** Electron-donating groups may weaken metal-ligand interactions by reducing the metal's ability to accept electrons. Electron-withdrawing groups can either enhance or impede coordination depending on whether they participate in metal binding.

- **Chelation:** Molecules capable of chelating metals through multiple coordination sites form more stable complexes, enhancing iron incorporation into the catalyst.

---

**Coverage and Balance:**

- The **9 rules** provide comprehensive coverage of the dataset, explaining the observed Fe/Hf ratios based on structural features.

- **Simple Rules with High Coverage:** Rules like 5 and 6 cover broad categories of modifiers that result in low Fe/Hf ratios due to lack of effective coordinating groups.

- **Complex Rules with Lower Coverage:** Rules like 4 address specific structures that enhance Fe/Hf ratios through chelation, explaining unique cases within the dataset.

- The balance between simple and complex rules ensures both general trends and specific observations are captured.

---

**Conclusion:**

These rules were generated by analyzing the dataset and applying principles of coordination chemistry and molecular structure. By considering combinations of functional groups and their spatial arrangement, the rules predict the effect of different modifiers on the Fe/Hf ratio.

Applying these rules allows for the rational design of modifiers to optimize iron incorporation into the catalyst. This optimization is essential for improving the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction, advancing the goals of the research program.---------------------------------------------------------------

**End of Rules**

---

**Explanation and Justification:**

1. **Rule 1** emphasizes that a longer carbon chain provides flexibility, allowing the **terminal primary amino group (–NH₂)** to effectively coordinate with iron ions. The amino group donates lone pair electrons to the metal, enhancing iron incorporation into the catalyst.

2. **Rule 2** highlights that **sulfhydryl groups (–SH)** are strong ligands due to the polarizable sulfur atom, which can coordinate effectively with iron ions. The straight-chain aliphatic nature ensures minimal steric hindrance.

3. **Rule 3** focuses on the **para-substituted pyridyl groups** on aromatic rings, where the nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring can coordinate with iron. The para position ensures optimal orientation for coordination.

4. **Rule 4** points out that **para-substituted sulfhydryl groups** on aromatic rings can effectively coordinate with iron due to the availability of lone pair electrons on sulfur, with the aromatic system providing resonance stabilization.

5. **Rule 5** addresses modifiers with **flexible ether linkages**, which allow the terminal coordinating groups (**–NH₂** or **–OCH₃**) to reach the metal centers. The flexibility reduces steric hindrance, facilitating coordination.

6. **Rule 6** encompasses **amino acids** whose side chains have functional groups capable of donating electrons to metals. Examples include carboxylate groups, aromatic rings, and sulfur-containing moieties, all of which can coordinate with iron.

7. **Rule 7** notes that **electron-withdrawing groups** like **–NO₂** and **–CH₂Br** can participate in metal coordination through resonance structures or by stabilizing the metal ion, thus enhancing iron incorporation.

8. **Rule 8** emphasizes that **long-chain aliphatic acids** with terminal **hydroxy groups (–OH)** have flexibility and can coordinate via the oxygen atom. The chain length allows the hydroxy group to interact effectively with iron ions.

9. **Rule 9** indicates that **para-substituted amino or hydroxy groups** on aromatic rings may not effectively coordinate with metals due to delocalization of lone pair electrons into the aromatic ring, reducing their availability for coordination.

10. **Rule 10** explains that **polyols** or modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups can cause **steric hindrance**, preventing effective approach and coordination of the ligand to the metal ion.

11. **Rule 11** highlights that when nitrogen atoms are in positions not favorable for coordination (e.g., meta position) or are involved in strong resonance within heterocycles, they are less available to coordinate with metal ions.

12. **Rule 12** states that modifiers lacking **additional coordinating groups** or possessing **non-coordinating substituents** do not enhance iron incorporation, as there are no functional groups to interact with iron ions.

13. **Rule 13** addresses the effect of **strong electron-withdrawing groups** that pull electron density away from potential coordinating sites, making them less effective in donating electrons to metals and therefore less likely to coordinate iron.

14. **Rule 14** considers that **bulky or complex side chains** on amino acids can create **steric hindrance**, reducing the ability of coordinating groups to interact with iron ions.

15. **Rule 15** emphasizes that in **heterocyclic structures** where nitrogen atoms are involved in delocalized π systems or resonance stabilization, these nitrogen atoms are less available for metal coordination due to their reduced lone pair availability.

---

**Alignment with Physical-Chemical Properties:**

- **Coordination Chemistry:** Effective coordination to iron requires functional groups with available lone pair electrons, such as amino, sulfhydryl, hydroxy, and pyridyl groups. The position and accessibility of these groups are crucial.
  
- **Steric Hindrance:** Modifiers with bulky groups or multiple substituents near the coordinating site can hinder the approach of iron ions, reducing coordination effectiveness.

- **Flexibility:** Longer chain lengths and flexible linkers allow coordinating groups to reach and interact with metal centers more easily.

- **Electronic Effects:** Electron-donating groups enhance coordination by increasing electron density at the coordinating site, while electron-withdrawing groups can either stabilize metal ions or decrease coordination ability depending on their nature and position.

- **Resonance and Delocalization:** Nitrogen atoms involved in resonance structures within heterocycles may have lone pair electrons delocalized, making them less available for coordination.

---

**Coverage and Balance:**

- The **15 rules** provide comprehensive coverage of the dataset, addressing both general trends and specific cases.

- **Simple Rules with High Coverage:**

  - *Rule 1* and *Rule 12* cover broad categories of aliphatic acids with or without effective coordinating groups.

  - *Rule 9* and *Rule 10* address common functional groups that impact coordination due to their electronic properties or steric effects.

- **Complex Rules with Lower Coverage:**

  - *Rule 7* and *Rule 15* explain specific instances where unique functional groups or resonance effects influence iron coordination.

  - *Rule 14* identifies exceptions in amino acids with bulky side chains that deviate from the general trend.

- This balance ensures that both prevalent patterns and unique observations are captured, enhancing the predictive power of the rules.

---

**Conclusion:**

By analyzing the dataset and applying principles of coordination chemistry, these rules elucidate the relationship between molecular modifiers and the **Fe/Hf\_high\_or\_low\_value** in the catalyst. The rules emphasize the importance of:

- **Functional Groups:** Presence of coordinating groups like **–NH₂**, **–SH**, **–OH**, and **pyridyl** nitrogen.

- **Molecular Structure:** Effect of chain length, position of substituents, and steric factors on coordination ability.

- **Electronic Effects:** Influence of electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups on metal-ligand interactions.

Understanding these relationships allows for the rational design of molecular modifiers to optimize iron incorporation into the **Hf-TPY-MOL(Fe)** catalyst. Enhanced iron incorporation is critical for improving the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction, advancing the objectives of the research program.

---

**Practical Application:**

- **Designing New Modifiers:** Researchers can use these rules to select or synthesize modifiers that are more likely to result in high Fe/Hf ratios, focusing on compounds that fit the criteria outlined.

- **Predicting Outcomes:** By applying the rules to potential modifiers, predictions can be made about their effectiveness, saving time and resources in experimental trials.

- **Further Research:** These rules provide a foundation for exploring new functional groups or molecular structures that may enhance catalyst performance.

**Note:** These rules are based on observed trends in the provided dataset and are intended to guide future experimentation. Exceptions may exist, and experimental validation is recommended for new modifiers.---------------------------------------------------------------

**End of Rules**

**Explanation and Justification:**

- **Rule 1 (Terminal Primary Amines):** Primary amines are strong Lewis bases that readily coordinate with metal ions like Fe³⁺. The flexibility of an aliphatic chain with sufficient length (four or more carbons) allows the amine group to effectively interact with the metal centers in the catalyst.

- **Rule 2 (Para-Substituted Electron-Withdrawing Groups):** Electron-withdrawing groups enhance the acidity of the carboxylic acid and promote deprotonation, increasing the anion's ability to coordinate with metal ions. Groups like nitro, halogens, and sulfhydryl not only withdraw electrons but can also serve as additional coordination sites.

- **Rule 3 (Accessible Pyridine Nitrogen):** The lone pair on the nitrogen atom of a pyridine ring is available for coordination with metal ions. When connected at the 4-position, the pyridine nitrogen is more accessible, facilitating stronger interactions with Fe³⁺ ions.

- **Rule 4 (Flexible Ether Linkages):** Ether linkages provide molecular flexibility, allowing terminal coordinating groups (e.g., –NH₂, –OCH₃) to reach and bind metal centers effectively. This increases the likelihood of Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

- **Rule 5 (Sulfhydryl Groups):** Sulfhydryl (–SH) groups are soft Lewis bases that form strong bonds with transition metals like iron. Their presence enhances the coordination potential of the modifier.

- **Rule 6 (Small Amino Acids):** Amino acids with small or sulfur-containing side chains have minimal steric hindrance, allowing both the amino and carboxyl groups to coordinate with metal ions efficiently.

- **Rule 7 (Electron-Donating Groups):** Electron-donating groups like –NH₂ and –OH on aromatic rings increase electron density, reducing the effectiveness of the carboxylate group in coordinating metal ions due to decreased acidity and potential intramolecular hydrogen bonding.

- **Rule 8 (Bulky Amino Acids):** Bulky or aromatic side chains introduce steric hindrance, limiting the accessibility of coordinating groups (e.g., amino and carboxyl groups) to metal centers.

- **Rule 9 (Polyhydroxylated Compounds):** Multiple hydroxyl groups can lead to steric congestion and competing hydrogen bonding interactions, which can interfere with metal coordination.

- **Rule 10 (Lack of Coordinating Groups):** Aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups have limited ability to coordinate with metal ions beyond the carboxylate, resulting in lower Fe incorporation.

- **Rule 11 (Perfluorinated Chains):** Strong electron-withdrawing effects of perfluorinated chains decrease electron density on potential coordinating atoms, weakening their ability to bind metal ions.

- **Rule 12 (Adjacent Carbonyl Groups):** Keto and aldehyde groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid can participate in resonance stabilization, delocalizing electron density and reducing the availability of lone pairs for coordination.

- **Rule 13 (Resonance-Involved Heterocycles):** Heteroatoms in aromatic rings involved in resonance (e.g., pyridine nitrogen in certain positions) have lone pairs delocalized over the ring system, making them less available for coordination.

- **Rule 14 (Steric Hindrance from Bulky Substituents):** Large substituents near coordinating sites can obstruct access to metal ions, decreasing the likelihood of effective coordination.

- **Rule 15 (Multiple Electron-Donating Groups):** Excess electron density from multiple electron-donating groups can lead to strong intramolecular interactions (like hydrogen bonding), which can compete with and hinder metal coordination.

---

**Alignment with Physical-Chemical Properties:**

- **Coordination Ability:** Functional groups with available lone pairs (e.g., –NH₂, –SH, pyridine nitrogen) enhance the ability of modifiers to coordinate with Fe³⁺ ions.

- **Steric Factors:** The presence of bulky groups near potential coordination sites can inhibit effective interaction with metal ions due to spatial constraints.

- **Electronic Effects:** Electron-withdrawing groups stabilize negative charges on coordinating atoms, promoting metal binding, whereas electron-donating groups can decrease coordination efficiency.

- **Molecular Flexibility:** Flexible linkages (e.g., ether chains) allow coordinating groups to adopt conformations favorable for metal ion interaction.

- **Resonance Delocalization:** Delocalization of lone pairs in aromatic systems can reduce the availability of electrons for coordination.

---

**Coverage and Balance:**

- **Broad Coverage:** The rules address a wide range of structural features present in the dataset, capturing both common and unique modifiers.

- **Balance Between Simplicity and Complexity:** Rules are designed to be straightforward where possible (e.g., Rule 10 on aliphatic acids without coordinating groups) and more detailed when necessary to explain specific trends (e.g., Rule 13 on resonance-involved heterocycles).

- **High Predictive Power:** By combining multiple substructures and considering both electronic and steric factors, the rules improve the ability to predict Fe/Hf\_high\_or\_low\_value accurately.

---

**Practical Application:**

- **Modifier Selection:** Researchers can utilize these rules to select or design molecular modifiers that are more likely to enhance Fe incorporation into the catalyst, thereby optimizing the reaction yield.

- **Predictive Tool:** The rules serve as a guideline to predict the Fe/Hf ratio of new modifiers based on their structural features before experimental validation.

- **Design Strategy:** Understanding the interplay of functional groups, electronic effects, and steric factors allows for the rational design of efficient catalysts tailored to specific reactions.

---

**Conclusion:**

These **15 rules** provide a comprehensive understanding of how different structural features of molecular modifiers influence the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst. By considering combinations of functional groups and their physical-chemical properties, the rules enable accurate predictions and guide the design of effective modifiers to optimize catalytic performance.

---

**Note:** While the rules are derived from the provided dataset and grounded in chemical principles, experimental validation is essential when applying them to new compounds or different reaction conditions to account for potential exceptions or unforeseen interactions.---------------------------------------------------------------

**End of Rules**

---

**Explanation and Justification:**

1. **Rule 1 (Long-Chain Aliphatic Amino Acids):** Modifiers with a primary or secondary amino group and a carboxylic acid on a flexible aliphatic chain can effectively coordinate with Fe³⁺ ions through both the amine and carboxylate groups. The flexibility and length of the chain (five or more carbons) reduce steric hindrance and allow for bidentate coordination, enhancing Fe incorporation.

2. **Rule 2 (Aromatic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing Groups):** Electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, facilitating deprotonation and stronger coordination with Fe³⁺ ions. Additionally, groups like nitro, bromo, or pyridyl rings can participate in coordination through lone pairs or pi interactions.

3. **Rule 3 (Sulfur-Containing Groups Near Carboxyl Groups):** Sulfur atoms in thiol or thioether groups are good soft Lewis bases and can coordinate with Fe³⁺ ions. Proximity to the carboxyl group allows for chelation, forming a more stable complex with Fe and increasing Fe/Hf ratios.

4. **Rule 4 (Amino Acids with Aromatic Side Chains):** The combination of an amine group, carboxylate group, and an aromatic ring with delocalized pi electrons provides multiple coordination sites. Despite potential steric hindrance from aromatic rings, the strong coordinating ability of amine and carboxylate groups leads to increased Fe incorporation.

5. **Rule 5 (Simple Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids):** Lack of additional coordinating functional groups beyond the carboxylic acid limits the ability to chelate Fe³⁺ ions effectively. Long hydrophobic chains may also decrease solubility and accessibility to metal sites, resulting in lower Fe/Hf values.

6. **Rule 6 (Aromatic Acids with Electron-Donating Groups):** Electron-donating groups like amino and hydroxy at the para position decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, making deprotonation less favorable and weakening coordination with Fe³⁺ ions. These groups can also engage in hydrogen bonding or resonance stabilization, further reducing available coordination sites.

7. **Rule 7 (Modifiers with Multiple Adjacent Hydroxyl Groups):** Polyhydroxy compounds can form extensive intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonds, reducing the availability of hydroxyl groups for coordination with Fe³⁺ ions. Steric hindrance from multiple hydroxyl groups may also impair effective coordination.

8. **Rule 8 (Pyridine Carboxylic Acids):** When the pyridine nitrogen is directly adjacent to the carboxyl group, steric hindrance and potential intramolecular interactions may reduce coordination efficiency with Fe³⁺ ions. Additionally, the lone pair on pyridine nitrogen may be less available due to resonance with the carboxyl group.

9. **Rule 9 (Perfluorinated Alkyl Chains):** Strong electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups reduce electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening interactions with Fe³⁺ ions. The hydrophobic nature of perfluorinated chains may also impede effective interaction with the metal sites.

10. **Rule 10 (Flexible Polyether Chains with Terminal COOH):** Polyether chains provide flexibility, allowing the terminal carboxyl group to access and coordinate with Fe³⁺ ions effectively. The ether oxygens may also participate in coordination, enhancing Fe incorporation.

11. **Rule 11 (Cyclic Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Carbonyl Groups):** The presence of conjugated carbonyl groups in cyclic structures can delocalize electron density and provide multiple coordination sites through oxygen atoms, promoting strong binding with Fe³⁺ ions.

12. **Rule 12 (Sterically Hindered Functional Groups):** Modifiers with bulky substituents or intramolecular interactions near coordination sites hinder the approach of Fe³⁺ ions, reducing coordination efficiency and Fe incorporation.

13. **Rule 13 (Aliphatic Hydroxy Acids with Distant OH Groups):** Hydroxyl groups located away from the carboxylic acid reduce steric hindrance at the primary coordination site while providing additional sites for coordination, enhancing Fe binding.

14. **Rule 14 (Modifiers with Trifluoroacetyl Groups):** Strongly electron-withdrawing trifluoroacetyl groups reduce electron density on potential coordinating atoms and may hinder deprotonation of the carboxylic acid, resulting in weaker Fe coordination.

15. **Rule 15 (Modifiers with Multiple Coordinating Groups):** The presence of both free and acylated amino groups, along with a carboxylic acid, provides multiple coordination sites. This increases the likelihood of Fe³⁺ binding through chelation, leading to higher Fe/Hf ratios.

---

**Alignment with Physical-Chemical Properties:**

- **Coordination Chemistry:** Effective coordination with Fe³⁺ ions requires functional groups with lone pairs capable of donating electron density. Amino, carboxylate, thiol, and ether groups are common donors.

- **Electronic Effects:** Electron-withdrawing groups enhance acidity and coordination ability of carboxylic acids by stabilizing the negative charge on the carboxylate ion, facilitating Fe³⁺ binding.

- **Steric Factors:** Steric hindrance from bulky groups or intramolecular interactions can impede the approach and binding of Fe³⁺ ions to the coordinating atoms.

- **Molecular Flexibility:** Flexible chains allow functional groups to adopt conformations that favor coordination with Fe³⁺ ions, enhancing binding efficiency.

- **Hydrogen Bonding:** Extensive hydrogen bonding can sequester coordinating groups, making them less available for metal binding.

---

**Coverage and Balance:**

- **Broad Coverage:** The rules collectively address modifiers with various functional groups and structural features present in the dataset, including amino acids, aromatic acids, aliphatic acids, sulfur-containing compounds, and more.

- **Balance Between Simplicity and Complexity:**

  - **Simple Rules (e.g., Rule 5 and Rule 6):** Address common structural motifs with higher coverage in the dataset.

  - **Complex Rules (e.g., Rule 3 and Rule 15):** Involve combinations of multiple functional groups that influence Fe incorporation, providing nuanced insights.

- **Avoiding Redundancy:** Rules are structured to be distinct and specific, reducing overlap and enhancing clarity for predictive purposes.

---

**Practical Application:**

- **Predictive Tool:** Researchers can use these rules to predict whether a new molecular modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf ratio based on its structural features.

- **Guidance for Modifier Design:** The rules highlight key functional groups and structural arrangements that favor or hinder Fe incorporation, aiding in the rational design of effective modifiers.

- **Understanding Structure-Property Relationships:** By linking specific substructures to Fe/Hf ratios, the rules enhance understanding of how molecular structure influences catalyst composition and performance.

---

**Conclusion:**

The **15 rules** provided offer a comprehensive framework for predicting the Fe/Hf ratio based on the structural features of molecular modifiers. They incorporate essential physical-chemical principles such as coordination chemistry, electronic effects, steric hindrance, and molecular flexibility. By balancing simplicity and complexity, these rules cover a broad range of modifiers in the dataset and can be valuable tools for researchers aiming to optimize catalytic reactions involving Fe³⁺ incorporation.

**End of Rules**

---

**Explanation and Justification:**

1. **Rule 1 (Aliphatic Amino Acids with Long Chains):** Primary amine and carboxylic acid groups act as bidentate ligands, effectively chelating Fe³⁺ ions. The unbranched long carbon chain increases flexibility, allowing better coordination without steric hindrance.

2. **Rule 2 (Aromatic Acids with Para Electron-Withdrawing Groups):** Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing deprotonation and coordination with Fe³⁺. The para position allows for resonance stabilization and effective metal binding.

3. **Rule 3 (Thiol Groups Adjacent to Carboxyl Groups):** Thiol groups are good soft Lewis bases, forming strong bonds with Fe³⁺. Proximity to the carboxyl group enables chelation, resulting in higher Fe incorporation.

4. **Rule 4 (Polyether Carboxylic Acids):** Multiple ether oxygens provide additional coordination sites. The flexibility of the polyether chain allows these oxygens to align properly with Fe³⁺ ions, enhancing complex stability.

5. **Rule 5 (Amino Acids with Unhindered Aromatic Side Chains):** The aromatic ring can participate in π-interactions with Fe³⁺. When the side chain is not bulky, it does not hinder the coordination of the amine and carboxyl groups.

6. **Rule 6 (Para Electron-Donating Groups on Aromatic Acids):** Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, making deprotonation less favorable. This reduces the ability to coordinate with Fe³⁺ ions, resulting in lower Fe incorporation.

7. **Rule 7 (Polyhydroxy Acids):** Multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups can engage in intramolecular hydrogen bonding or form stable ring structures, reducing the availability of oxygen lone pairs for coordination with Fe³⁺.

8. **Rule 8 (Long-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids):** Without additional coordinating groups, these acids have limited ability to chelate Fe³⁺ ions. The lack of donor atoms other than the carboxylate oxygen results in low Fe incorporation.

9. **Rule 9 (Fluorinated Groups):** Fluorine is highly electronegative, pulling electron density away from potential donor atoms and weakening their ability to coordinate with Fe³⁺. The hydrophobic nature of fluorinated chains may also hinder interaction with metal ions.

10. **Rule 10 (Sterically Hindered Aromatic Acids):** Bulky groups near the carboxylate hinder the approach and binding of Fe³⁺ ions. Steric hindrance reduces coordination efficiency, leading to lower Fe incorporation.

11. **Rule 11 (Aliphatic Hydroxy Acids with Distant OH Groups):** Hydroxyl groups located away from the carboxylate can act as additional coordination sites without causing steric clashes. This configuration enhances overall coordination capacity.

12. **Rule 12 (Amino Acids with Bulky Aromatic Side Chains):** Bulky side chains like the indole ring in tryptophan create steric hindrance, impeding effective coordination of the amine and carboxylate groups with Fe³⁺ ions.

13. **Rule 13 (Dicarboxylic Acids with Short Chains):** The proximity of two carboxylate groups can lead to chelation that forms small, strained rings, which are less stable. This reduces effective coordination with Fe³⁺.

14. **Rule 14 (Modifiers with Keto Groups Adjacent to Aromatics):** Keto groups adjacent to aromatic systems can engage in resonance, stabilizing negative charge upon deprotonation. This increases the ability of oxygen atoms to coordinate with Fe³⁺.

15. **Rule 15 (Aliphatic Acids with Terminal Aldehyde Groups):** Aldehyde groups can undergo side reactions or may not effectively coordinate with Fe³⁺. In some cases, they may also be oxidized or interfere with coordination, leading to lower Fe incorporation.

---

**Alignment with Physical-Chemical Properties:**

- **Coordination Sites:** Modifiers with multiple and accessible donor atoms (N, O, S) enhance Fe³⁺ coordination. Bidentate or polydentate ligands form more stable complexes.

- **Electronic Effects:** Electron-withdrawing groups increase acidity and promote deprotonation, enhancing metal coordination. Electron-donating groups have the opposite effect.

- **Steric Effects:** Bulky groups near coordination sites hinder metal binding due to spatial constraints.

- **Molecular Flexibility:** Flexible chains allow donor atoms to adopt favorable conformations for metal binding.

- **Hydrogen Bonding and Intramolecular Interactions:** Internal hydrogen bonding can sequester potential donor atoms, reducing availability for coordination.

---

**Coverage and Balance:**

- **Broad Coverage:** The rules encompass various structural features, including amino acids, aromatic and aliphatic acids, thiol-containing modifiers, polyethers, and fluorinated compounds.

- **Balance Between Simplicity and Complexity:**
  - **Simple Rules:** Rules like **Rule 8** and **Rule 9** deal with straightforward features that apply to multiple compounds.
  - **Complex Rules:** Rules such as **Rule 4** and **Rule 14** consider combinations of functional groups and their interactions, covering more specific cases.

- **Optimizing Coverage:** By combining multiple substructures in rules, we cover a wider range of the dataset while maintaining specificity.

---

**Practical Application:**

- **Predictive Utility:** These rules can predict the Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value for new modifiers based on structural features, aiding in the rational design of catalysts.

- **Design Guidance:** Understanding which functional groups promote high Fe incorporation allows for the synthesis of effective modifiers.

- **Structure-Property Relationship Insight:** The rules highlight how specific substructures and their combinations influence Fe coordination, enhancing our understanding of the system.

---

**Conclusion:**

The **15 rules** provided offer a comprehensive guide to predicting whether a molecular modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value. By focusing on combinations of functional groups and considering underlying physical-chemical properties, these rules can be applied to a broad range of compounds. They balance simplicity and complexity, ensuring both wide coverage and specificity where needed. This framework can assist researchers in selecting or designing molecular modifiers to achieve desired catalytic outcomes.
