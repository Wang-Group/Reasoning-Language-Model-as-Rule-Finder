**Rule 5: Modifiers with Electron-Rich Aromatic Hydroxyl Groups Predict Low Fe/Hf**

- **Description**: Modifiers that contain **electron-rich aromatic rings** with **hydroxyl groups (-OH)**, particularly **phenolic hydroxyls**, predict a **low Fe/Hf value**.
- **Underlying Property**: Phenolic hydroxyl groups can form strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds or compete with Fe binding sites, reducing the availability of coordination sites for Fe ions.
- **Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

**Rule 6: Modifiers with Electron-Rich Heteroaromatic Rings Predict Low Fe/Hf**

- **Description**: Modifiers containing **electron-rich heteroaromatic rings** like **indole**, **pyrazole**, or **pyridone**, along with a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**, predict a **low Fe/Hf value**.
- **Underlying Property**: Electron-rich heterocycles may form competing interactions or exhibit steric hindrance that interferes with effective Fe coordination.
- **Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

---

**Rule 7: Modifiers with Highly Fluorinated Aliphatic Chains Predict Low Fe/Hf**

- **Description**: Modifiers featuring **highly fluorinated aliphatic chains** with multiple **fluorine atoms (-F)** predict a **low Fe/Hf value**.
- **Underlying Property**: Fluorine's strong electronegativity pulls electron density away from coordinating groups, diminishing their ability to bind Fe ions effectively.
- **Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

---

**Rule 8: Straight-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Without Additional Functional Groups Predict Low Fe/Hf**

- **Description**: Modifiers that are **straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** lacking additional polar or coordinating functional groups predict a **low Fe/Hf value**.
- **Underlying Property**: The absence of extra coordination sites limits the molecule's ability to bind Fe ions, resulting in lower Fe incorporation.
- **Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **Octanoic acid**
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

---

**Rule 9: Modifiers with Multiple Carboxylic Acid Groups Without Additional Coordinating Functionalities Predict Low Fe/Hf**

- **Description**: Modifiers that have multiple **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** groups but lack other strong coordinating functionalities predict a **low Fe/Hf value**.
- **Underlying Property**: Excessive carboxylate groups without complementary coordinating sites may lead to unfavorable interactions or precipitation, reducing Fe incorporation.
- **Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**

**Rule 10: Modifiers with Aliphatic Chains Terminated with Polar Groups Predict High Fe/Hf**

- **Description**: Modifiers featuring **long aliphatic chains** terminated with **polar functional groups** like **hydroxyl (-OH)** or **amino (-NH₂)** groups, in addition to a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**, predict a **high Fe/Hf value**.
- **Underlying Property**: The flexibility of the aliphatic chain and the presence of terminal polar groups provide multiple coordination sites, enhancing Fe binding through chelation.
- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

**Rule 11: Modifiers with Sterically Hindered Carboxylic Acid Groups Predict Low Fe/Hf**

- **Description**: Modifiers where the **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)** is adjacent to **bulky substituents** that cause steric hindrance predict a **low Fe/Hf value**.
- **Underlying Property**: Steric hindrance near the coordinating carboxylate group impedes effective interaction with Fe ions, reducing Fe incorporation.
- **Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

**Rule 12: Modifiers with Electron-Withdrawing Groups and Additional Coordination Sites Predict High Fe/Hf**

- **Underlying Property**: EWGs increase the acidity of coordinating sites, while additional functional groups provide multiple points for Fe coordination, enhancing Fe incorporation.
- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**
