**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic amino acids with terminal primary amino groups on carbon chains of five or more carbons tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: The primary amino group can coordinate with Fe ions, and the flexible aliphatic chain allows for optimal spatial arrangement, enhancing metal-ligand interactions through chelation.

  - *Examples*:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid** *(Entry 3)*
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(Entry 31)*
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(Entry 34)*
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(Entry 33)*

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers containing sulfur functional groups, such as thiol (–SH) or thioether (–S–R) groups, especially when combined with carboxylic acid groups, tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Sulfur atoms have lone pairs that strongly coordinate with Fe ions, forming stable complexes that enhance Fe incorporation.

  - *Examples*:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** *(Entry 10)*
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(Entry 18)*
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]-4-methylsulfanylbutanoic acid** *(Entry 23)*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) such as nitro (–NO₂) or halogens attached to an aromatic ring, particularly at the para position relative to a carboxyl group, tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid by stabilizing the carboxylate anion, enhancing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  - *Examples*:
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** *(Entry 1)*
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(Entry 21)*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing aromatic rings with strong electron-donating groups (EDGs) such as amino (–NH₂) or hydroxy (–OH) groups directly attached to the ring tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid by destabilizing the carboxylate anion, reducing its coordinating ability with Fe ions.

  - *Examples*:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** *(Entry 4)*
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** *(Entry 7)*
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** *(Entry 30)*
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** *(Entry 26)*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**; introducing polar groups like amino (–NH₂) or hydroxy (–OH) can increase Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Simple aliphatic acids have limited coordination sites. Adding polar functional groups provides additional coordination points for Fe ions, enhancing metal-ligand interactions.

  - *Examples*:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - **Octanoic acid** *(Entry 5)*
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(Entry 29)*
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(Entry 31)*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles separated by a linker (an aliphatic chain or aromatic ring) from the carboxyl group tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**; those where the heterocycle is directly attached may result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: A linker allows better spatial orientation of coordinating sites, facilitating Fe ion coordination. Direct attachment may hinder effective coordination due to steric and electronic factors.

  - *Examples*:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(Entry 12)*
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** *(Entry 24)*
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(Entry 22)*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups (polyols) on aliphatic chains or sugar acid derivatives tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Multiple hydroxyl groups can form hydrogen bonds, reducing the availability of these groups and the carboxylate for coordination with Fe ions.

  - *Examples*:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(Entry 9)*
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** *(Entry 6)*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with simple aromatic side chains tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**, whereas those with bulky or heteroaromatic side chains may result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to steric hindrance.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Simple aromatic side chains allow effective metal coordination without significant steric obstruction. Bulky side chains may hinder access to coordinating sites.

  - *Examples*:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(Entry 13)*
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(Entry 15)*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing ether linkages (–O–) along with carboxylic acid and amino groups tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values** due to increased flexibility and multiple coordination sites.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Ether oxygen atoms and amino groups provide additional lone pairs for coordination with Fe ions. The flexibility allows optimal positioning for metal-ligand interactions.

  - *Examples*:
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** *(Entry 32)*
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(Entry 11)*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with electron-deficient aromatic rings containing electron-withdrawing substituents adjacent to carboxylic acid groups tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to reduced electron density on coordinating atoms.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Strong electron-withdrawing groups can decrease the donor ability of the carboxylate oxygen, weakening coordination with Fe ions.

  - *Examples*:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(Entry 20)*
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** *(Entry 19)*

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing perfluorinated aliphatic chains tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms, which decreases the coordinating ability of the carboxylate group.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Fluorine atoms withdraw electron density, reducing the basicity and donor strength of the carboxylate oxygen atoms, hindering Fe coordination.

  - *Example*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(Entry 14)*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with keto and carboxylic acid groups separated by a short aliphatic chain tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values** unless additional coordinating groups are present.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: The keto group may engage in resonance with the carboxyl group, delocalizing electron density and reducing coordination with Fe ions.

  - *Examples*:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** *(Entry 27)*
    - **High Fe/Hf** (due to additional coordinating groups):
      - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** *(Entry 25)*

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing both amino and hydroxyl groups on the same aliphatic chain tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values** due to increased coordination sites and potential chelation.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: The combination provides multiple coordination points for Fe ions, forming stable chelate complexes.

  - *Example*:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(Entry 0)*

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing adjacent chelating groups, such as hydroxyl and carbonyl groups in close proximity on aromatic rings, tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values** by forming stable chelate complexes with Fe ions.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Chelating ligands form ring structures upon coordination, increasing the stability of the metal complex through the chelate effect.

  - *Examples*:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** *(Entry 17)*
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** *(Entry 8)*

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing small nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to carboxylic acid groups may result in **variable Fe/Hf values** depending on the electronic properties of the heterocycle.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Nitrogen heterocycles can coordinate with Fe ions through nitrogen lone pairs. However, factors such as ring electron density and substituents influence their coordinating ability.

  - *Examples*:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** *(Entry 16)*
    - **Variable Fe/Hf**:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(Entry 22)*

**Notes:**

- **Chemical Insights**: The rules consider electronic effects (electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups), coordination chemistry (multidentate ligands, chelation), and steric factors that influence Fe incorporation.

- **Balance of Coverage**: The rules aim to cover a broad range of the dataset, balancing simple rules with higher coverage and more specific rules that capture nuanced relationships.

- **Application**: Each rule provides clear criteria to predict whether a modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value, aiding in the rational design of new modifiers to control the Fe/Hf ratio.
