**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic amino acids with a terminal primary amino group (–NH₂) and a carboxylate group, possessing carbon chains of 5 to 8 carbons, tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: The flexible aliphatic chain allows the amino and carboxylate groups to effectively coordinate with Fe ions, forming stable chelate complexes. This bidentate interaction enhances Fe incorporation into the catalyst by stabilizing the Fe coordination environment.

  - **Examples**:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (Entry 3)
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Entry 31)
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Entry 34)
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 33)

  - **Counterexamples**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Entry 0) – The presence of two carboxylate groups may lead to less effective coordination due to rigidity or unfavorable binding geometry, resulting in a **low Fe/Hf value**.
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Entry 4) – The aromatic ring introduces rigidity, reducing flexibility for effective chelation, leading to a **low Fe/Hf value**.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: EWGs, such as nitro or bromo groups, increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid by stabilizing the negative charge on the carboxylate anion through resonance or inductive effects. This enhanced acidity facilitates deprotonation and improves the ability of the carboxylate to coordinate with Fe ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Entry 1)
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Entry 21)

  - **Counterexamples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 20) – Although an aldehyde is an EWG, it may engage in side reactions or reduce effective coordination, leading to a **low Fe/Hf value**.
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 8) – The positioning of the EWG may not favor coordination, resulting in a **low Fe/Hf value**.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: EDGs, such as amino or hydroxy groups, decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid by destabilizing the carboxylate anion. This reduced acidity hinders deprotonation and weakens the ability of the carboxylate to coordinate with Fe ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Entry 4)
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Entry 7)
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30)
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Entry 26)

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing heterocyclic aromatic rings with nitrogen atoms positioned to coordinate (e.g., pyridine rings at the 4-position relative to the carboxylate) tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocyclic rings can act as Lewis bases, providing additional coordination sites for Fe ions. When the nitrogen is positioned appropriately, it can participate in chelation alongside the carboxylate group, enhancing Fe incorporation.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 12)
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** (Entry 24)

  - **Counterexample**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Entry 22) – The nitrogen atom is adjacent to the carboxylate, potentially causing steric hindrance or unfavorable geometry, leading to a **low Fe/Hf value**.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal hydroxy groups (–OH) tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: The terminal hydroxy group introduces an additional coordination site. The flexibility of the aliphatic chain allows both the carboxylate and hydroxy groups to simultaneously coordinate with Fe ions, forming chelate rings that stabilize the Fe complex.

  - **Example**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Entry 29)

  - **Counterexample**:
    - **Octanoic acid** (Entry 5) – Lacks the hydroxy group and thus offers fewer coordination sites, resulting in a **low Fe/Hf value**.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with multiple coordinating functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxy, ether linkages) in flexible aliphatic chains tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Multiple coordinating groups increase the possibilities for chelation, enhancing the stability of the Fe complex. Ether linkages add flexibility, allowing coordinating groups to align favorably with Fe ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32)
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 11)
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Entry 2)

  - **Counterexample**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Entry 9) – Although it has multiple hydroxy groups, the rigidity from multiple hydroxylation may hinder effective coordination, leading to a **low Fe/Hf value**.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing sulfur atoms in functional groups such as thiol (–SH) or thioether (–S–) tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Sulfur is a soft Lewis base that can coordinate strongly with Fe ions. The presence of sulfur-containing groups enhances the overall coordination capacity of the modifier, facilitating Fe incorporation.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Entry 10)
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 18)
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (Entry 23)

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing perfluorinated alkyl chains tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Perfluorinated groups are highly electronegative and can withdraw electron density from coordinating groups, diminishing their ability to bind with Fe ions. Additionally, the hydrophobic nature of fluorinated chains may reduce solubility and interaction with the catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Entry 14)

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on rigid or bulky aliphatic chains tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can lead to intramolecular hydrogen bonding or increased hydrophilicity, which may interfere with coordination to Fe ions. Bulky structures can also introduce steric hindrance.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Entry 9)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (Entry 6)

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with bulky or rigid aromatic structures without additional coordinating groups tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to steric hindrance and limited coordination sites.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Rigid aromatic rings limit the flexibility required for effective coordination with Fe ions. Without additional coordinating groups, these modifiers cannot form strong interactions with Fe.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Entry 15)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 16)

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are dicarboxylic acids with adjacent carbonyl groups (e.g., α-keto diacids) tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: The presence of adjacent carbonyl groups may delocalize electron density away from the carboxylate oxygens, weakening their ability to coordinate with Fe ions. Additionally, these structures may adopt conformations unfavorable for chelation.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Entry 27)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Entry 0)

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy groups on the aromatic ring tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**, especially when additional coordinating groups are present.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Methoxy groups, while electron-donating, can participate in resonance, potentially enhancing the coordination ability of neighboring groups. In combination with other functional groups, they can facilitate Fe binding.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (Entry 25)

  - **Counterexample**:
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 19) – Despite methoxy-like groups, the presence of aldehyde and hydroxy groups may interfere with coordination, leading to a **low Fe/Hf value**.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with aldehyde groups adjacent to carboxylic acids on aromatic rings tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Aldehyde groups are susceptible to oxidation and may engage in side reactions. They can also withdraw electron density from the carboxylate, reducing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 20)
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 19)

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing flexible ether linkages with terminal coordinating groups (e.g., amino or carboxylate) tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Ether linkages increase molecular flexibility, allowing terminal coordinating groups to effectively align and interact with Fe ions. This enhances the formation of stable complexes through chelation.

  - **Examples**:
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32)
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 11)

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with fused aromatic systems containing additional carbonyl groups may have varying effects, but certain structures can result in **high Fe/Hf values** when they facilitate coordination.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Fused rings with carbonyl groups can create unique electronic environments that, in some cases, enhance coordination with Fe ions. The overall molecular geometry and electron distribution play crucial roles.

  - **Example**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Entry 17)

  - **Note**: Due to the complexity of these structures, predictions may require case-by-case analysis.

**End of Rules**

These rules aim to illustrate the relationship between structural features of molecular modifiers and their impact on the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst. By focusing on combinations of functional groups, chain length, electronic effects, and molecular flexibility, we can predict whether a modifier will lead to **high** or **low Fe/Hf values**.

**Key Takeaways for Designing Modifiers**:

- **Enhanced Coordination**: Incorporate multiple coordinating groups (e.g., –NH₂, –OH, –SH) in flexible chains to promote chelation with Fe ions.

- **Electronic Effects**: Utilize strong EWGs to increase carboxylic acid acidity, enhancing Fe coordination.

- **Avoid Steric Hindrance**: Minimize bulky or rigid structures without additional coordinating sites, as they impede effective interaction with Fe ions.

- **Balance Hydrophilicity**: Be cautious with highly hydrophilic modifiers (e.g., multiple –OH groups) that may not coordinate well due to solvent interactions.

By applying these principles, researchers can tailor molecular modifiers to achieve desired Fe/Hf ratios, optimizing catalyst performance for remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reactions.---------------------------------------------------------------
