    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing a terminal amino group (–NH₂) on a linear aliphatic chain of five or more carbons tend to result in high Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: The amino group acts as an additional coordination site, enhancing Fe incorporation into the catalyst by forming stronger metal-ligand complexes.
  - *Examples*: 
    - 5-aminopentanoic acid *(Entry 3)*
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid *(Entry 31)*
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid *(Entry 34)*
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid *(Entry 33)*

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers containing sulfur-containing functional groups such as sulfhydryl (–SH) or thioether (–S–CH₃) groups, especially when combined with carboxylic acid groups, tend to result in high Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Sulfur atoms have lone pair electrons that can coordinate strongly with Fe ions, enhancing Fe loading through the formation of stable metal-thiolate complexes.
  - *Examples*: 
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid *(Entry 10)*
    - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid *(Entry 18)*
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]-4-methylsulfanylbutanoic acid *(Entry 23)*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) such as nitro (–NO₂) or halogens (e.g., –Br) attached to an aromatic ring, particularly in conjugation with a carboxyl group, tend to result in high Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: EWGs increase the acidity and electrophilicity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions by stabilizing the negative charge upon deprotonation.
  - *Examples*: 
    - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid *(Entry 1)*
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid *(Entry 21)*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing aromatic rings with electron-donating groups (EDGs) such as amino (–NH₂), hydroxy (–OH), or methoxy (–OCH₃) groups tend to result in low Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid group and can reduce its ability to coordinate with Fe ions. Additionally, steric hindrance from these groups may impede effective metal-ligand interaction.
  - *Examples*: 
    - 4-aminobenzoic acid *(Entry 4)*
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid *(Entry 7)*
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid *(Entry 30)*
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid *(Entry 26)*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (polyols) on aliphatic chains or sugar acid derivatives tend to result in low Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Multiple hydroxyl groups can engage in intramolecular hydrogen bonding or form competing coordination sites, reducing the overall availability for effective Fe coordination.
  - *Examples*: 
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid *(Entry 9)*
    - 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid *(Entry 6)*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group tend to result in low Fe/Hf values, whereas those with an intervening linker (aliphatic chain or another aromatic ring) tend to result in high Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Direct attachment of heterocyclic nitrogen can lead to poor overlap of orbitals or unfavorable electronic interactions with Fe ions. An intervening linker reduces these effects and allows for better coordination.
  - *Examples*: 
    - **Low Fe/Hf**: pyridine-3-carboxylic acid *(Entry 22)*
    - **High Fe/Hf**: 
      - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid *(Entry 12)*
      - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid *(Entry 24)*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups tend to result in low Fe/Hf values; however, introducing polar groups like hydroxyl (–OH) or amino (–NH₂) can increase Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Simple aliphatic acids lack additional coordination sites. Adding polar groups introduces new binding sites for Fe ions, enhancing metal coordination.
  - *Examples*: 
    - **Low Fe/Hf**: 
      - Octanoic acid *(Entry 5)*
      - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid *(Entry 27)*
    - **High Fe/Hf**: 
      - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid *(Entry 29)*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing ether linkages (–O–) within the backbone, especially when combined with terminal functional groups like amino (–NH₂) or carboxyl (–COOH) groups, tend to result in high Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Ether oxygen atoms can act as additional coordination sites. Their presence, along with terminal functional groups, facilitates chelation with Fe ions, enhancing Fe incorporation.
  - *Examples*: 
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid *(Entry 11)*
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid *(Entry 32)*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing aromatic rings influence Fe/Hf values based on the nature of the aromatic ring. Amino acids with benzene rings lead to high Fe/Hf values, while those with heteroaromatic rings result in low Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Benzene rings can enhance π–π stacking and coordination with Fe ions. Heteroaromatic rings may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorable electronic environments that reduce effective Fe coordination.
  - *Examples*: 
    - **High Fe/Hf**: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid *(Entry 13)*
    - **Low Fe/Hf**: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid *(Entry 15)*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with functional groups capable of chelation, such as ketones adjacent to aromatic rings or sulfur-containing groups, tend to result in high Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Chelating groups can form more stable and multidentate complexes with Fe ions, enhancing metal incorporation through stronger binding affinity.
  - *Examples*: 
    - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid *(Entry 25)*
    - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid *(Entry 17)*

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with electron-poor aromatic rings due to electron-withdrawing substituents enhance Fe coordination, resulting in high Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Electron-poor rings increase the acidity and electrophilicity of adjacent functional groups, facilitating better coordination with Fe ions.
  - *Examples*: 
    - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid *(Entry 1)*
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid *(Entry 21)*

    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Revised Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing both carboxylic acid groups and terminal primary amino groups on linear aliphatic chains of five or more carbons tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: The carboxylate and amino groups act as bidentate ligands, coordinating with Fe ions to form stable chelate complexes. The extended carbon chain allows for optimal spatial arrangement and flexibility, enhancing metal-ligand interactions.

  - *Examples*:
    - 5-aminopentanoic acid *(Entry 3)*
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid *(Entry 31)*
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid *(Entry 34)*
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid *(Entry 33)*

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers containing sulfur-functional groups such as sulfhydryl (–SH) or thioether (–S–R) groups, especially when combined with carboxylic acid groups, tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Sulfur atoms, being soft Lewis bases with available lone pairs, can form strong coordinate covalent bonds with Fe ions (a soft Lewis acid). This enhances Fe incorporation through stable metal-sulfur complexes.

  - *Examples*:
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid *(Entry 10)*
    - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid *(Entry 18)*
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]-4-methylsulfanylbutanoic acid *(Entry 23)*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) such as nitro (–NO₂) or halogens (e.g., –Br) directly attached to an aromatic ring at the para position relative to a carboxyl group tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid by stabilizing the negative charge on the carboxylate anion. Enhanced deprotonation facilitates stronger coordination with Fe ions.

  - *Examples*:
    - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid *(Entry 1)*
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid *(Entry 21)*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing aromatic rings with electron-donating groups (EDGs) such as amino (–NH₂) or hydroxy (–OH) groups directly attached to the ring tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, making it less likely to deprotonate and coordinate effectively with Fe ions. Additionally, these groups can engage in hydrogen bonding or steric interactions that hinder metal coordination.

  - *Examples*:
    - 4-aminobenzoic acid *(Entry 4)*
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid *(Entry 7)*
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid *(Entry 30)*
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid *(Entry 26)*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**, whereas introducing polar groups like amino (–NH₂) or hydroxyl (–OH) at appropriate positions can increase Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Simple aliphatic acids offer limited coordination sites (primarily the carboxylate). Introducing polar functional groups increases the number of potential binding sites for Fe ions, enhancing coordination.

  - *Examples*:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - Octanoic acid *(Entry 5)*
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid *(Entry 29)*
      - 7-aminoheptanoic acid *(Entry 31)*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen-containing heterocycles separated by a linker (an aliphatic chain or another aromatic ring) from the carboxyl group tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**, while those directly attached to the carboxyl group tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: A linker reduces steric hindrance and electronic repulsion, allowing better spatial orientation for coordination. Direct attachment may impede Fe coordination due to unfavorable interactions.

  - *Examples*:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid *(Entry 12)*
      - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid *(Entry 24)*
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid *(Entry 22)*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (polyols) on aliphatic chains or sugar acid derivatives tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Multiple hydroxyl groups can engage in internal hydrogen bonding or compete with carboxylate groups for coordination with Fe ions. This reduces the availability and effectiveness of coordination sites for Fe incorporation.

  - *Examples*:
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid *(Entry 9)*
    - 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid *(Entry 6)*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with simple aromatic side chains tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**, whereas those with bulky or heteroaromatic side chains may result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to steric hindrance.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Simple aromatic side chains can facilitate π–π interactions without significantly hindering the accessibility of the amino and carboxylate groups for metal coordination. Bulky or heteroaromatic side chains can block these sites.

  - *Examples*:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid *(Entry 13)*
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid *(Entry 15)*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing ether linkages (–O–), especially when combined with amino groups, tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Ether oxygen atoms and amino groups can both coordinate with Fe ions. The combination creates multidentate ligands that enhance metal-ligand stability and increase Fe incorporation.

  - *Examples*:
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid *(Entry 32)*
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid *(Entry 11)*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing adjacent chelating groups, such as hydroxyl and carbonyl groups in ortho positions on aromatic rings, can enhance Fe/Hf values by forming stable chelate complexes with Fe ions, resulting in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Chelating ligands form ring structures upon coordinating with a metal ion, which increases the stability of the complex due to the chelate effect. This promotes greater Fe incorporation.

  - *Examples*:
    - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid *(Entry 17)*
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid *(Entry 8)*

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde groups adjacent to carboxylic acids on aromatic rings tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to potential steric hindrance and lack of additional coordination sites.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Aldehyde groups may not effectively participate in metal coordination and can introduce steric bulk near the carboxylate, hindering its ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  - *Examples*:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid *(Entry 20)*
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid *(Entry 19)*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated aliphatic chains tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms, which decreases the basicity of coordinating atoms.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Fluorine's high electronegativity withdraws electron density from potential coordinating sites (like oxygen), reducing their ability to donate electrons to Fe ions for coordination.

  - *Example*:
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid *(Entry 14)*

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are diketone acids or contain keto groups conjugated with carboxylic acids tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values** unless additional chelating groups are present to stabilize Fe coordination.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Keto groups adjacent to carboxylic acids can lead to resonance stabilization of the carboxylate, reducing its availability for coordination. Without additional chelating sites, Fe incorporation is less favorable.

  - *Examples*:
    - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid *(Entry 27)* (Low Fe/Hf)
    - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid *(Entry 25)* (High Fe/Hf due to methoxy groups donating electron density)

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with both amino and hydroxyl groups on the same aliphatic chain tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values** due to the increased number of coordination sites.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: The presence of both amino and hydroxyl groups provides multiple sites for Fe coordination, enhancing the formation of stable complexes.

  - *Example*:
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid *(Entry 0)*

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing cyclic nitrogen heterocycles without additional coordinating groups tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to limited coordination capability.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Nitrogen in aromatic heterocycles (like pyrazole) may not be sufficiently basic or accessible to effectively coordinate with Fe ions, especially without additional coordinating groups.

  - *Example*:
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid *(Entry 16)*

---

**End of Revised Rules**

---

These revised rules have been crafted to:

- **Combine multiple substructures**: Each rule considers combinations of functional groups (e.g., amino and carboxyl groups, sulfur groups with carboxylic acids).

- **Reflect underlying physicochemical properties**: The chemical explanations provide insights into how electronic effects, coordination chemistry, and steric factors influence Fe/Hf values.

- **Provide clear predictions**: Each rule specifies whether modifiers fitting the description tend to result in high or low Fe/Hf values.

- **Balance coverage and complexity**: The rules range from broad (e.g., the impact of electron-withdrawing groups on aromatic rings) to specific (e.g., the effect of perfluorinated chains), covering a wide spectrum of the dataset.

- **Abandon ineffective rules**: By refining and reorganizing the rules, we have ensured they are relevant and based on sound chemical reasoning, discarding any that were less predictive or redundant.

These rules serve as a predictive framework for assessing new molecular modifiers based on their structural features, aiding in the optimization and control of Fe/Hf values in the catalyst system.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic amino acids with terminal primary amino groups on carbon chains of five or more carbons tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: The primary amino group can coordinate with Fe ions, and the flexible aliphatic chain allows for optimal spatial arrangement, enhancing metal-ligand interactions through chelation.

  - *Examples*:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid** *(Entry 3)*
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(Entry 31)*
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(Entry 34)*
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(Entry 33)*

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers containing sulfur functional groups, such as thiol (–SH) or thioether (–S–R) groups, especially when combined with carboxylic acid groups, tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Sulfur atoms have lone pairs that strongly coordinate with Fe ions, forming stable complexes that enhance Fe incorporation.

  - *Examples*:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** *(Entry 10)*
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(Entry 18)*
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]-4-methylsulfanylbutanoic acid** *(Entry 23)*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) such as nitro (–NO₂) or halogens attached to an aromatic ring, particularly at the para position relative to a carboxyl group, tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid by stabilizing the carboxylate anion, enhancing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  - *Examples*:
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** *(Entry 1)*
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(Entry 21)*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing aromatic rings with strong electron-donating groups (EDGs) such as amino (–NH₂) or hydroxy (–OH) groups directly attached to the ring tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid by destabilizing the carboxylate anion, reducing its coordinating ability with Fe ions.

  - *Examples*:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** *(Entry 4)*
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** *(Entry 7)*
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** *(Entry 30)*
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** *(Entry 26)*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**; introducing polar groups like amino (–NH₂) or hydroxy (–OH) can increase Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Simple aliphatic acids have limited coordination sites. Adding polar functional groups provides additional coordination points for Fe ions, enhancing metal-ligand interactions.

  - *Examples*:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - **Octanoic acid** *(Entry 5)*
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(Entry 29)*
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(Entry 31)*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles separated by a linker (an aliphatic chain or aromatic ring) from the carboxyl group tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**; those where the heterocycle is directly attached may result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: A linker allows better spatial orientation of coordinating sites, facilitating Fe ion coordination. Direct attachment may hinder effective coordination due to steric and electronic factors.

  - *Examples*:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(Entry 12)*
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** *(Entry 24)*
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(Entry 22)*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups (polyols) on aliphatic chains or sugar acid derivatives tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Multiple hydroxyl groups can form hydrogen bonds, reducing the availability of these groups and the carboxylate for coordination with Fe ions.

  - *Examples*:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(Entry 9)*
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** *(Entry 6)*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with simple aromatic side chains tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**, whereas those with bulky or heteroaromatic side chains may result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to steric hindrance.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Simple aromatic side chains allow effective metal coordination without significant steric obstruction. Bulky side chains may hinder access to coordinating sites.

  - *Examples*:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(Entry 13)*
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(Entry 15)*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing ether linkages (–O–) along with carboxylic acid and amino groups tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values** due to increased flexibility and multiple coordination sites.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Ether oxygen atoms and amino groups provide additional lone pairs for coordination with Fe ions. The flexibility allows optimal positioning for metal-ligand interactions.

  - *Examples*:
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** *(Entry 32)*
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(Entry 11)*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with electron-deficient aromatic rings containing electron-withdrawing substituents adjacent to carboxylic acid groups tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to reduced electron density on coordinating atoms.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Strong electron-withdrawing groups can decrease the donor ability of the carboxylate oxygen, weakening coordination with Fe ions.

  - *Examples*:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(Entry 20)*
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** *(Entry 19)*

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing perfluorinated aliphatic chains tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms, which decreases the coordinating ability of the carboxylate group.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Fluorine atoms withdraw electron density, reducing the basicity and donor strength of the carboxylate oxygen atoms, hindering Fe coordination.

  - *Example*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(Entry 14)*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with keto and carboxylic acid groups separated by a short aliphatic chain tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values** unless additional coordinating groups are present.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: The keto group may engage in resonance with the carboxyl group, delocalizing electron density and reducing coordination with Fe ions.

  - *Examples*:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** *(Entry 27)*
    - **High Fe/Hf** (due to additional coordinating groups):
      - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** *(Entry 25)*

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing both amino and hydroxyl groups on the same aliphatic chain tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values** due to increased coordination sites and potential chelation.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: The combination provides multiple coordination points for Fe ions, forming stable chelate complexes.

  - *Example*:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(Entry 0)*

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing adjacent chelating groups, such as hydroxyl and carbonyl groups in close proximity on aromatic rings, tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values** by forming stable chelate complexes with Fe ions.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Chelating ligands form ring structures upon coordination, increasing the stability of the metal complex through the chelate effect.

  - *Examples*:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** *(Entry 17)*
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** *(Entry 8)*

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing small nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to carboxylic acid groups may result in **variable Fe/Hf values** depending on the electronic properties of the heterocycle.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Nitrogen heterocycles can coordinate with Fe ions through nitrogen lone pairs. However, factors such as ring electron density and substituents influence their coordinating ability.

  - *Examples*:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** *(Entry 16)*
    - **Variable Fe/Hf**:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(Entry 22)*

---

**End of Rules**

---

**Notes:**

- **Chemical Insights**: The rules consider electronic effects (electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups), coordination chemistry (multidentate ligands, chelation), and steric factors that influence Fe incorporation.

- **Balance of Coverage**: The rules aim to cover a broad range of the dataset, balancing simple rules with higher coverage and more specific rules that capture nuanced relationships.

- **Application**: Each rule provides clear criteria to predict whether a modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value, aiding in the rational design of new modifiers to control the Fe/Hf ratio.

---

I hope these rules provide a comprehensive understanding of how molecular modifiers influence the Fe/Hf ratio in your catalyst system. If you have any questions or need further clarification on any of the rules or their chemical explanations, please feel free to ask.---------------------------------------------------------------

    **Analysis and Generation of Rules:**

Based on the dataset provided and using chemical insights, I have analyzed the relationships between the molecular modifiers and the Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value. Below are the generated rules that describe these relationships.

---

**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing primary amino groups attached to aliphatic chains with carboxylic acid groups tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Primary amino groups can coordinate with Fe ions through lone pair electrons on nitrogen. When combined with carboxylic acid groups, these modifiers can act as bidentate ligands, enhancing metal coordination through chelation.

  - **Examples**:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid** *(Entry 3)*
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(Entry 31)*
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(Entry 34)*
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(Entry 33)*

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers containing sulfur functional groups, such as thiol (–SH) or thioether (–S–R) groups, especially when combined with carboxylic acid groups, tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Sulfur atoms have readily available lone pairs that can strongly coordinate with transition metals like Fe, forming stable complexes and enhancing Fe incorporation.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** *(Entry 10)*
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(Entry 18)*
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]-4-methylsulfanylbutanoic acid** *(Entry 23)*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) on aromatic rings, particularly at the para position relative to a carboxyl group, tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid by stabilizing the negative charge on the carboxylate anion. This enhances the ability of the carboxylate group to coordinate with Fe ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** *(Entry 1)*
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(Entry 21)*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with electron-donating groups (EDGs) on aromatic rings, such as amino (–NH₂) or hydroxy (–OH) groups, particularly at the para position relative to a carboxyl group, tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid by destabilizing the carboxylate anion. This reduces the carboxylate's ability to coordinate with Fe ions, leading to lower Fe incorporation.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** *(Entry 4)*
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** *(Entry 7)*
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** *(Entry 30)*
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** *(Entry 26)*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**; introducing coordinating groups like amino (–NH₂) or hydroxy (–OH) can increase Fe/Hf values.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Simple aliphatic acids have limited coordination sites. Adding functional groups with lone pairs (e.g., amino or hydroxy groups) provides additional coordination points for Fe ions, enhancing metal-ligand interactions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - **Octanoic acid** *(Entry 5)*
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(Entry 29)*
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(Entry 31)*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles separated by a linker (an aliphatic chain or aromatic ring) from the carboxyl group tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**; those where the heterocycle is directly attached may result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: A linker allows better spatial orientation of coordinating sites, facilitating Fe ion coordination. Direct attachment may hinder effective coordination due to steric hindrance or electronic factors.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(Entry 12)*
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** *(Entry 24)*
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(Entry 22)*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups (polyols) on aliphatic chains or sugar acid derivatives tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can form internal hydrogen bonds or engage in extensive solvation. They may also compete with carboxylate groups for metal coordination, reducing Fe incorporation.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(Entry 9)*
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** *(Entry 6)*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing ether linkages (–O–) along with carboxylic acid and amino groups tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values** due to increased flexibility and multiple coordination sites.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Ether oxygen atoms can act as coordination sites with lone pairs. The flexibility provided by ether linkages allows the molecule to adopt conformations that facilitate coordination with Fe ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(Entry 11)*
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** *(Entry 32)*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing sulfur-containing amino acids or dipeptides tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values** due to multiple coordination sites including sulfur and amino groups.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Sulfur and amino groups provide multiple coordination sites, enhancing Fe binding through chelation and multidentate interactions.

  - **Example**:
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]-4-methylsulfanylbutanoic acid** *(Entry 23)*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with bulky or sterically hindered aromatic side chains may result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to steric hindrance affecting Fe coordination.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Bulky side chains can interfere with the approach of Fe ions to coordination sites, reducing Fe incorporation.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(Entry 15)*
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** *(Entry 17)*

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing strong electron-withdrawing groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid group without additional coordinating sites tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to decreased electron density on coordinating atoms.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Strong EWGs can withdraw electron density from the carboxylate oxygen, decreasing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(Entry 20)*
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** *(Entry 19)*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated aliphatic chains tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to strong electron-withdrawing effects decreasing coordinating ability.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Fluorine atoms are highly electronegative and withdraw electron density from the carboxylate group, reducing its donor ability towards Fe ions.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(Entry 14)*

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing both amino and hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values** due to potential chelation and multiple coordination sites.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: The presence of both amino and hydroxyl groups allows for the formation of stable chelate rings with Fe ions, enhancing coordination.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(Entry 0)*

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxylic acid group, especially small rings like pyrazole, may result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to electronic and steric factors.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Direct attachment may lead to resonance delocalization or steric hindrance, reducing the effectiveness of coordination with Fe ions.

  - **Example**:
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** *(Entry 16)*

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are keto acids (containing both ketone and carboxylic acid functionalities) with separation between functional groups may result in **low Fe/Hf values** unless additional coordinating groups are present.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Keto groups can engage in tautomerism or resonance, which might affect the availability of coordination sites. Additional coordinating groups can counteract this effect.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** *(Entry 27)*
    - **High Fe/Hf** (with additional coordinating groups):
      - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** *(Entry 25)*

---

**End of Rules**

---

**Notes:**

- **Chemical Insights**: These rules are based on the presence of functional groups such as amino, hydroxyl, sulfur-containing groups, and heterocycles, as well as electronic effects from substituents that influence the ability of the modifiers to coordinate with Fe ions.

- **Balance of Coverage**: The rules cover a broad range of modifiers in the dataset, balancing between simple rules with higher coverage (e.g., presence of primary amino groups) and more complex rules with lower coverage (e.g., impact of bulky side chains).

- **Application**: Each rule provides criteria to predict whether a modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value, aiding in the selection or design of modifiers to control the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst system.

---

I hope these rules provide a clear understanding of how molecular modifiers influence the Fe/Hf ratio in your catalyst system. If you have any questions or need further clarification on any of the rules or their chemical explanations, please feel free to ask.---------------------------------------------------------------

    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal primary amino group (–NH₂) tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: The primary amino group and carboxylate can coordinate simultaneously with Fe ions, forming stable chelate rings that enhance Fe incorporation.

  - **Examples**:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (Entry 3)
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Entry 31)
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Entry 34)

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Lacking extra donor atoms, these modifiers have limited coordination ability with Fe ions, resulting in lower Fe incorporation.

  - **Example**:
    - **Octanoic acid** (Entry 5)

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: EWGs like nitro (–NO₂) or halogens increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid and enhance the ability of the carboxylate to coordinate with Fe ions. They may also participate directly in coordination.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Entry 21)
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Entry 1)
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Entry 10)

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: EDGs like amino (–NH₂) or hydroxy (–OH) decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, reducing its ability to deprotonate and coordinate with Fe ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Entry 4)
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30)
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Entry 7)

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles linked to a carboxylic acid via a flexible aliphatic chain tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: The flexible linker allows both the nitrogen atom in the heterocycle and the carboxylate group to coordinate with Fe ions simultaneously, enhancing binding strength.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** (Entry 24)

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxylic acid without a flexible linker tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: The rigid structure may prevent effective simultaneous coordination of both the heterocycle and the carboxylate to Fe ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Entry 22)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 16)

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with short side chains, such as aspartic acid, tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**, whereas those with longer side chains, like glutamic acid, tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Shorter side chains facilitate the formation of stable chelate rings with Fe ions, enhancing coordination, while longer side chains may introduce steric hindrance.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)** (Entry 2)
    - **Low Fe/Hf**: **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)** (Entry 0)

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains adjacent to coordinating groups tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to steric hindrance.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Bulky groups near coordination sites can impede the approach and binding of Fe ions.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)** (Entry 15)

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (polyols) on aliphatic chains or sugar acids tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Extensive hydrogen bonding with solvent molecules or within the modifier can reduce the availability of hydroxyl groups to coordinate with Fe ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)** (Entry 9)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (Entry 6)

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to strong electron-withdrawing effects that decrease coordination ability.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Highly electronegative fluorine atoms withdraw electron density from potential donor atoms, weakening their ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Entry 14)

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with ether linkages and terminal amino groups tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Ether oxygen atoms and amino groups provide multiple coordination sites. The flexibility of ether linkages facilitates effective chelation with Fe ions.

  - **Example**:
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32)

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing thiol groups (–SH) directly attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**, whereas aliphatic thiol modifiers may result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Aromatic thiols can strongly coordinate with Fe ions due to the delocalization of electron density, while aliphatic thiols may not coordinate as effectively.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Entry 10)
    - **Low Fe/Hf**: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 18)

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with carbonyl groups (aldehydes or ketones) adjacent to the carboxylic acid without additional coordinating groups tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Adjacent carbonyl groups can delocalize electron density through resonance, decreasing the availability of lone pairs on the carboxylate oxygen for coordination with Fe ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 20)
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Entry 27)

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with electron-donating groups on aliphatic chains that are not adjacent to the carboxylate group can still result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Electron-donating groups increase the electron density on coordinating atoms without causing steric hindrance, enhancing Fe binding.

  - **Example**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Entry 29)

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with additional coordinating groups, such as acetamido groups, tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Additional donor atoms provide more coordination sites, forming stable chelate complexes with Fe ions.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 33)

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules illustrate the relationship between the structural features of molecular modifiers and their influence on the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst. By considering the presence and position of functional groups such as amino, hydroxyl, thiol, and heterocyclic rings, as well as the length and flexibility of the molecular backbone, we can predict whether a modifier will lead to high or low Fe incorporation.

When designing new modifiers, applying these rules can aid in selecting functional groups that promote the desired Fe/Hf ratio, thus optimizing the catalyst's performance in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction of aliphatic alcohols.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Target Name: Fe/Hf
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal primary amino group (–NH₂) tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: The presence of both the amino group and the carboxylate allows for bidentate coordination with Fe ions. This dual coordination enhances Fe incorporation into the catalyst by forming stable chelate complexes.

  - **Examples**:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (Entry 3)
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Entry 31)
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Entry 34)

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Without extra donor atoms, these modifiers have limited sites for Fe coordination. The carboxylate alone provides weaker binding, leading to lower Fe incorporation.

  - **Example**:
    - **Octanoic acid** (Entry 5)

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: EWGs like nitro (–NO₂) or halogens increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing deprotonation and the carboxylate's ability to coordinate with Fe ions. They may also introduce additional coordination sites.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Entry 21)
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Entry 1)

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: EDGs like amino (–NH₂) or hydroxy (–OH) decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, reducing the carboxylate's ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Entry 4)
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30)

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing thiol groups (–SH) tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values** due to strong coordination with Fe ions.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Thiol groups are soft Lewis bases that form strong bonds with Fe ions. The high affinity between sulfur and iron enhances Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Entry 10)
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 18)

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups (polyols) on aliphatic chains tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can engage in extensive hydrogen bonding with solvents or intramolecularly, reducing their availability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Entry 9)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (Entry 6)

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing ether linkages and amino groups tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Ether oxygen atoms and amino groups provide multiple coordination sites. The flexibility of ether linkages allows the molecule to adopt conformations favorable for chelation with Fe ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 11)
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32)

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with bulky aromatic side chains adjacent to coordinating groups tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to steric hindrance.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Bulky groups near coordination sites can impede the approach and binding of Fe ions, reducing the effectiveness of coordination.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)** (Entry 15)

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with pyridine rings linked via flexible aliphatic chains tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: The pyridine nitrogen acts as a strong coordination site. When connected through a flexible linker, both the nitrogen and carboxylate can simultaneously coordinate with Fe ions, enhancing Fe incorporation.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** (Entry 24)

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers where nitrogen heterocycles are directly attached to the carboxylate tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to rigidity.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Direct attachment limits flexibility, which may hinder the ability of both the heterocyclic nitrogen and carboxylate to coordinate effectively with Fe ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Entry 22)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 16)

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to strong electron-withdrawing effects.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Fluorine atoms are highly electronegative and withdraw electron density, decreasing the donor ability of coordinating groups like carboxylates.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Entry 14)

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with hydroxyl groups on long aliphatic chains tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values** due to additional coordination sites and flexibility.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: The hydroxyl group provides an extra site for Fe coordination. The flexibility of the long chain allows the modifier to adopt conformations that favor simultaneous coordination by multiple groups.

  - **Example**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Entry 29)

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with small side chains tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**, whereas those with bulky side chains or additional acidic groups tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Small side chains reduce steric hindrance, allowing both the amino and carboxylate groups to coordinate effectively with Fe ions. Bulky side chains or extra acidic groups may hinder coordination or introduce competing interactions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)** (Entry 13)
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)** (Entry 2)
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)** (Entry 0)
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)** (Entry 15)

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with carbonyl groups (aldehydes or ketones) adjacent to the carboxylic acid tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Adjacent carbonyl groups can engage in resonance with the carboxylate, delocalizing electron density and reducing the availability of lone pairs for Fe coordination.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 20)
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Entry 27)

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing both an aromatic ring and additional coordinating groups on the ring tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Additional coordinating groups like keto or hydroxyl groups on the aromatic ring enhance the overall coordination capacity with Fe ions.

  - **Example**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Entry 17)

---

**End of Rules**

These rules illustrate the relationship between the structural features of molecular modifiers and their influence on the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst. By combining multiple substructures—such as amino groups, thiol groups, ether linkages, and heterocycles—and considering their positions and electronic effects, we can predict whether a modifier will lead to high or low Fe incorporation.

When designing new modifiers, applying these rules can aid in selecting functional groups that promote the desired Fe/Hf ratio, thereby optimizing the catalyst's performance in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction of aliphatic alcohols.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic amino acids with a terminal primary amino group (–NH₂) and a carboxylate group, possessing carbon chains of 5 to 8 carbons, tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: The flexible aliphatic chain allows the amino and carboxylate groups to effectively coordinate with Fe ions, forming stable chelate complexes. This bidentate interaction enhances Fe incorporation into the catalyst by stabilizing the Fe coordination environment.

  - **Examples**:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (Entry 3)
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Entry 31)
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Entry 34)
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 33)

  - **Counterexamples**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Entry 0) – The presence of two carboxylate groups may lead to less effective coordination due to rigidity or unfavorable binding geometry, resulting in a **low Fe/Hf value**.
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Entry 4) – The aromatic ring introduces rigidity, reducing flexibility for effective chelation, leading to a **low Fe/Hf value**.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: EWGs, such as nitro or bromo groups, increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid by stabilizing the negative charge on the carboxylate anion through resonance or inductive effects. This enhanced acidity facilitates deprotonation and improves the ability of the carboxylate to coordinate with Fe ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Entry 1)
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Entry 21)

  - **Counterexamples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 20) – Although an aldehyde is an EWG, it may engage in side reactions or reduce effective coordination, leading to a **low Fe/Hf value**.
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 8) – The positioning of the EWG may not favor coordination, resulting in a **low Fe/Hf value**.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: EDGs, such as amino or hydroxy groups, decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid by destabilizing the carboxylate anion. This reduced acidity hinders deprotonation and weakens the ability of the carboxylate to coordinate with Fe ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Entry 4)
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Entry 7)
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30)
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Entry 26)

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing heterocyclic aromatic rings with nitrogen atoms positioned to coordinate (e.g., pyridine rings at the 4-position relative to the carboxylate) tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocyclic rings can act as Lewis bases, providing additional coordination sites for Fe ions. When the nitrogen is positioned appropriately, it can participate in chelation alongside the carboxylate group, enhancing Fe incorporation.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 12)
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** (Entry 24)

  - **Counterexample**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Entry 22) – The nitrogen atom is adjacent to the carboxylate, potentially causing steric hindrance or unfavorable geometry, leading to a **low Fe/Hf value**.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal hydroxy groups (–OH) tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: The terminal hydroxy group introduces an additional coordination site. The flexibility of the aliphatic chain allows both the carboxylate and hydroxy groups to simultaneously coordinate with Fe ions, forming chelate rings that stabilize the Fe complex.

  - **Example**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Entry 29)

  - **Counterexample**:
    - **Octanoic acid** (Entry 5) – Lacks the hydroxy group and thus offers fewer coordination sites, resulting in a **low Fe/Hf value**.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with multiple coordinating functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxy, ether linkages) in flexible aliphatic chains tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Multiple coordinating groups increase the possibilities for chelation, enhancing the stability of the Fe complex. Ether linkages add flexibility, allowing coordinating groups to align favorably with Fe ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32)
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 11)
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Entry 2)

  - **Counterexample**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Entry 9) – Although it has multiple hydroxy groups, the rigidity from multiple hydroxylation may hinder effective coordination, leading to a **low Fe/Hf value**.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing sulfur atoms in functional groups such as thiol (–SH) or thioether (–S–) tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Sulfur is a soft Lewis base that can coordinate strongly with Fe ions. The presence of sulfur-containing groups enhances the overall coordination capacity of the modifier, facilitating Fe incorporation.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Entry 10)
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 18)
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (Entry 23)

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing perfluorinated alkyl chains tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Perfluorinated groups are highly electronegative and can withdraw electron density from coordinating groups, diminishing their ability to bind with Fe ions. Additionally, the hydrophobic nature of fluorinated chains may reduce solubility and interaction with the catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Entry 14)

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on rigid or bulky aliphatic chains tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can lead to intramolecular hydrogen bonding or increased hydrophilicity, which may interfere with coordination to Fe ions. Bulky structures can also introduce steric hindrance.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Entry 9)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (Entry 6)

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with bulky or rigid aromatic structures without additional coordinating groups tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to steric hindrance and limited coordination sites.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Rigid aromatic rings limit the flexibility required for effective coordination with Fe ions. Without additional coordinating groups, these modifiers cannot form strong interactions with Fe.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Entry 15)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 16)

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are dicarboxylic acids with adjacent carbonyl groups (e.g., α-keto diacids) tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: The presence of adjacent carbonyl groups may delocalize electron density away from the carboxylate oxygens, weakening their ability to coordinate with Fe ions. Additionally, these structures may adopt conformations unfavorable for chelation.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Entry 27)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Entry 0)

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy groups on the aromatic ring tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**, especially when additional coordinating groups are present.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Methoxy groups, while electron-donating, can participate in resonance, potentially enhancing the coordination ability of neighboring groups. In combination with other functional groups, they can facilitate Fe binding.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (Entry 25)

  - **Counterexample**:
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 19) – Despite methoxy-like groups, the presence of aldehyde and hydroxy groups may interfere with coordination, leading to a **low Fe/Hf value**.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with aldehyde groups adjacent to carboxylic acids on aromatic rings tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Aldehyde groups are susceptible to oxidation and may engage in side reactions. They can also withdraw electron density from the carboxylate, reducing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 20)
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 19)

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing flexible ether linkages with terminal coordinating groups (e.g., amino or carboxylate) tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Ether linkages increase molecular flexibility, allowing terminal coordinating groups to effectively align and interact with Fe ions. This enhances the formation of stable complexes through chelation.

  - **Examples**:
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32)
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 11)

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with fused aromatic systems containing additional carbonyl groups may have varying effects, but certain structures can result in **high Fe/Hf values** when they facilitate coordination.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Fused rings with carbonyl groups can create unique electronic environments that, in some cases, enhance coordination with Fe ions. The overall molecular geometry and electron distribution play crucial roles.

  - **Example**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Entry 17)

  - **Note**: Due to the complexity of these structures, predictions may require case-by-case analysis.

**End of Rules**

---

These rules aim to illustrate the relationship between structural features of molecular modifiers and their impact on the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst. By focusing on combinations of functional groups, chain length, electronic effects, and molecular flexibility, we can predict whether a modifier will lead to **high** or **low Fe/Hf values**.

**Key Takeaways for Designing Modifiers**:

- **Enhanced Coordination**: Incorporate multiple coordinating groups (e.g., –NH₂, –OH, –SH) in flexible chains to promote chelation with Fe ions.

- **Electronic Effects**: Utilize strong EWGs to increase carboxylic acid acidity, enhancing Fe coordination.

- **Avoid Steric Hindrance**: Minimize bulky or rigid structures without additional coordinating sites, as they impede effective interaction with Fe ions.

- **Balance Hydrophilicity**: Be cautious with highly hydrophilic modifiers (e.g., multiple –OH groups) that may not coordinate well due to solvent interactions.

By applying these principles, researchers can tailor molecular modifiers to achieve desired Fe/Hf ratios, optimizing catalyst performance for remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reactions.---------------------------------------------------------------
