**Start of Rules**

1. **Modifiers with Terminal Amino Groups on Aliphatic Chains (ω-Amino Acids)**: Modifiers that are **linear aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal or near-terminal amino group** tend to result in **Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = True**. The amino group provides an additional coordination site for Fe ions, enhancing Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

   - **Examples**:
     - 5-aminopentanoic acid (**True**)
     - 7-aminoheptanoic acid (**True**)
     - 8-aminooctanoic acid (**True**)
     - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (**True**)
     - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid (**True**)

2. **Modifiers Containing Sulfur-Containing Functional Groups (Thiol or Thioether Groups)**: Modifiers with **thiol groups (-SH) or thioether linkages** tend to result in **Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = True**. Sulfur atoms coordinate strongly with Fe ions due to their soft Lewis base character and high polarizability.

   - **Examples**:
     - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid (**True**)
     - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid (**True**)

3. **Modifiers with Strong Electron-Withdrawing Groups (EWGs) on Aromatic Rings**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with strong EWGs** such as **nitro (-NO₂)** or **halomethyl (-CH₂X)** groups at the para position tend to result in **Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = True**. EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

   - **Examples**:
     - 4-nitrobenzoic acid (**True**)
     - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid (**True**)

4. **Modifiers with Additional Coordinating Groups Attached via Flexible Aliphatic Linkers**: Modifiers containing **additional coordinating groups** (e.g., pyridine rings, carbonyl groups) connected to the carboxylic acid group through **flexible aliphatic chains** tend to result in **Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = True**. The flexibility allows effective coordination without steric hindrance.

   - **Examples**:

6. **Modifiers with Hydroxyl Groups Distant from the Carboxylate Group on Aliphatic Chains**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups located far from the carboxylate group** tend to result in **Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = True**. The distant hydroxyl group can act as an additional coordination site without interfering with the carboxylate's binding to Fe ions.

   - **Example**:
     - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid (**True**)

7. **Modifiers with Multiple Carboxylate Groups and Short Aliphatic Chains (Dicarboxylic Acids with Short Chains)**: Modifiers that are **dicarboxylic acids with short aliphatic chains (four carbons or fewer)** tend to result in **Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = True**. The proximity of carboxylate groups facilitates chelation with Fe ions.

   - **Example**:
     - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (**True**)

8. **Modifiers Without Additional Strong Coordinating Groups (Simple Carboxylic Acids)**: Modifiers that are **simple aliphatic or aromatic carboxylic acids lacking other strong coordinating functional groups** tend to result in **Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False**.

     - 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (**False**)
     - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid (**False**)

10. **Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups Near the Carboxylate (Polyols)**: Modifiers containing **multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxylate group** tend to result in **Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False**. The hydroxyl groups may engage in hydrogen bonding or sterically hinder coordination with Fe ions, reducing Fe incorporation.

      - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid (**False**)
      - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid (**False**)

12. **Modifiers with Electron-Rich Aromatic Rings (e.g., Indole Rings) Attached to Amino Acids**: Modifiers containing **electron-rich aromatic rings**, such as **indole rings**, attached to amino acids tend to result in **Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False**. The electron-rich nature may reduce the coordination ability of adjacent functional groups.

    - **Example**:
      - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (**False**)

13. **Modifiers with Heavily Fluorinated Aliphatic Chains**: Modifiers with **perfluorinated carbon chains** tend to result in **Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms decreases the electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening Fe coordination.

    - **Example**:
      - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid (**False**)

14. **Modifiers with Carbonyl Groups Adjacent to the Carboxylate Group (α-Keto Acids)**: Modifiers that have a **carbonyl group adjacent to the carboxylate** tend to result in **Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False**. The adjacent carbonyl may delocalize electron density, reducing the availability of the carboxylate for coordination with Fe ions.

    - **Examples**:
      - 4-formylbenzoic acid (**False**)
      - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid (**False**)

15. **Modifiers with Trifluoroacetyl Groups**: Modifiers containing **trifluoroacetyl groups** tend to result in **Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False** due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect negatively impacting coordination ability with Fe ions.

    - **Example**:
      - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid (**False**)

**End of Rules**

---

**Explanation and Justification**

1. **Rule 1**: Terminal amino groups on aliphatic chains provide lone pairs for coordination with Fe ions. Their flexibility allows them to effectively interact with Fe, enhancing incorporation into the catalyst.

2. **Rule 2**: Sulfur atoms in thiols and thioethers are soft Lewis bases with high polarizability, forming strong coordination bonds with Fe ions.

3. **Rule 3**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, promoting deprotonation and stronger coordination with Fe ions. This effect enhances Fe incorporation.

4. **Rule 4**: Additional coordinating groups attached via flexible linkers can approach Fe ions without steric hindrance, facilitating coordination and increasing Fe incorporation.

5. **Rule 5**: Polyether chains with donor atoms (e.g., ether oxygens, amino groups) offer multiple coordination sites, effectively enhancing Fe binding.

6. **Rule 6**: Hydroxyl groups distant from the carboxylate can act as additional coordination sites without interfering with the carboxylate's ability to bind Fe ions.

7. **Rule 7**: Short-chain dicarboxylic acids can chelate Fe ions through their carboxylate groups, increasing Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

8. **Rule 8**: Simple carboxylic acids lacking additional coordinating groups have limited ability to interact with Fe ions, resulting in lower Fe/Hf ratios.

9. **Rule 9**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid and may interfere with effective coordination, leading to lower Fe incorporation.

10. **Rule 10**: Multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxylate may compete for coordination or create steric hindrance, reducing Fe incorporation.

11. **Rule 11**: Rigid heteroaromatic rings directly attached to the carboxylate may prevent effective coordination due to steric hindrance or unfavorable electronic interactions.

12. **Rule 12**: Electron-rich aromatic rings can delocalize electron density, reducing the availability of lone pairs on adjacent atoms for coordination with Fe ions.

13. **Rule 13**: Fluorinated chains withdraw electron density from coordinating atoms, weakening the interaction with Fe ions and resulting in lower Fe/Hf ratios.

14. **Rule 14**: Carbonyl groups adjacent to the carboxylate can delocalize electron density, diminishing the carboxylate's ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

15. **Rule 15**: Trifluoroacetyl groups are strong electron-withdrawing groups that can overly decrease electron density on coordinating atoms, reducing coordination with Fe ions.

**Coverage and Balance**

- **Broad Coverage**: The rules collectively cover the majority of the dataset, accounting for modifiers with varying functional groups and structural features.

- **Balance Between Simplicity and Complexity**:
  - **Simple Rules with High Coverage**: Rules 1, 8, and 9 provide straightforward criteria based on common functional groups and have broad applicability.
  - **Complex Rules for Specific Cases**: Rules 4, 5, 11, and 12 address more intricate interactions involving less common functional groups or structural arrangements.

---

**Terrible Rules Abandoned**

- **Previous Rule on Long-Chain Hydroxy Acids**: The prior rule regarding modifiers with hydroxyl groups on long aliphatic chains was too narrow and inconsistent. It has been refined in **Rule 6** to specify that hydroxyl groups distant from the carboxylate tend to enhance Fe incorporation.

- **Previous Rule on Keto Groups Adjacent to Aromatic Rings**: This rule had limited examples and conflicting data. It has been addressed in **Rule 14**, recognizing that carbonyl groups adjacent to carboxylates generally reduce Fe incorporation.
