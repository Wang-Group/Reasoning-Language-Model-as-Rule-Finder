Based on the analysis of the dataset and considering the underlying chemical properties, here are the rules that describe the relationship between molecular modifiers and the relative high or low Fe/Hf values.

---

**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing non-α terminal amino groups on aliphatic chains will have **high** Fe/Hf values.**

  - **Explanation**: Terminal amino groups on aliphatic chains act as strong ligands for Fe ions, enhancing coordination and increasing Fe incorporation into the catalyst. The distance from the carboxylic acid group allows for effective Fe binding without significant steric hindrance.
  - **Predicts**: High Fe/Hf.
  - **Examples**:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (Entry 3)
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Entry 31)
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Entry 34)
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 33)
  - **Counterexample**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Entry 0, an α-amino acid) – Low Fe/Hf.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers containing sulfur atoms (thiol or thioether groups) in combination with amino or carboxylic acid groups will have **high** Fe/Hf values.**

  - **Explanation**: Sulfur atoms are soft Lewis bases and have a high affinity for transition metals like Fe. When combined with amino or carboxylic acid groups, they offer multiple coordination sites, enhancing Fe binding.
  - **Predicts**: High Fe/Hf.
  - **Examples**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 18)
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Entry 10)
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (Entry 24)

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position will have **high** Fe/Hf values.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromo) increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid group, enhancing its ability to donate electrons and coordinate with Fe ions.
  - **Predicts**: High Fe/Hf.
  - **Examples**:
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Entry 1)
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Entry 21)
  - **Counterexamples**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 23, methyl is electron-donating) – Low Fe/Hf.
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Entry 4, amino is electron-donating) – Low Fe/Hf.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing pyridine rings where the nitrogen atom is positioned to coordinate with Fe ions will have **high** Fe/Hf values.**

  - **Explanation**: The nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring acts as a strong Lewis base, readily coordinating with Fe ions. The position of the nitrogen relative to other functional groups affects coordination efficiency.
  - **Predicts**: High Fe/Hf.
  - **Examples**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 12)
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** (Entry 25)
  - **Counterexample**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Entry 22, nitrogen meta to carboxyl group) – Low Fe/Hf.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with flexible ether linkages and terminal coordinating groups (such as amino or methoxy groups) will have **high** Fe/Hf values.**

  - **Explanation**: Ether linkages provide molecular flexibility, allowing the terminal coordinating groups to effectively interact with Fe ions. The combination of flexibility and coordination sites enhances Fe incorporation.
  - **Predicts**: High Fe/Hf.
  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 11)
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32)

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are polyhydroxylated compounds (contain multiple hydroxyl groups) will have **low** Fe/Hf values.**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can form strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds, reducing their availability to coordinate with Fe ions. Additionally, they may compete with carboxylate groups for Fe binding.
  - **Predicts**: Low Fe/Hf.
  - **Examples**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Entry 9)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (Entry 6)

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position will have **low** Fe/Hf values.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, amino, hydroxyl) decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid group, reducing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions.
  - **Predicts**: Low Fe/Hf.
  - **Examples**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 23)
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Entry 4)
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Entry 7)
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30)

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with highly electronegative perfluorinated alkyl chains will have **low** Fe/Hf values.**

  - **Explanation**: Perfluorinated alkyl chains withdraw electron density from coordinating groups, reducing their ability to bind Fe ions. The increased hydrophobicity may also hinder interaction with Fe.
  - **Predicts**: Low Fe/Hf.
  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Entry 14)

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups will have **low** Fe/Hf values.**

  - **Explanation**: Without supplementary coordination sites (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, sulfur groups), the carboxylate group alone provides limited Fe binding, resulting in lower Fe incorporation.
  - **Predicts**: Low Fe/Hf.
  - **Example**:
    - **Octanoic acid** (Entry 5)

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde groups adjacent to carboxylic acids on aromatic rings will have **low** Fe/Hf values.**

  - **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups can engage in side reactions and may reduce the electron density of the carboxylic acid, decreasing its coordination ability with Fe ions.
  - **Predicts**: Low Fe/Hf.
  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 20)
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 19)

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with rigid fused aromatic systems containing carbonyl groups will have **high** Fe/Hf values.**

  - **Explanation**: Fused aromatic systems with electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups provide multiple coordination sites in a rigid framework, enhancing Fe binding efficiency.
  - **Predicts**: High Fe/Hf.
  - **Example**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Entry 17)

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids without additional coordinating side chains will have **low** Fe/Hf values.**

  - **Explanation**: In α-amino acids, the amino group is adjacent to the carboxyl group, leading to potential internal stabilization (zwitterion formation) and reduced availability for Fe coordination.
  - **Predicts**: Low Fe/Hf.
  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Entry 0)
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Entry 15)
  - **Counterexample**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Entry 13, aromatic side chain enhances coordination) – High Fe/Hf.

**Application**:

To predict the Fe/Hf value for a new modifier:

1. **Identify Functional Groups**: Look for amino groups, sulfur atoms, pyridine rings, ether linkages, electron-withdrawing or electron-donating substituents, and multiple coordination sites.
2. **Assess Electronic Effects**: Determine if the modifier contains electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups and their positions relative to functional groups.
3. **Evaluate Molecular Structure**: Consider chain length, flexibility, presence of rigid fused rings, and the potential for chelation or multiple coordination.
4. **Apply Relevant Rules**: Match the modifier's features with the applicable rules to predict high or low Fe/Hf values.
5. **Consider Multiple Factors**: If a modifier fits multiple rules, weigh the contributing factors to make a prediction. For example, a modifier with both an electron-donating group and a strong coordinating sulfur atom may require deeper analysis.

*These rules provide a framework for predicting whether a molecular modifier will result in high or low Fe/Hf values based on their structural features and underlying chemical properties. By applying these rules, chemists can design modifiers that optimize the Fe/Hf ratio for improved catalytic performance in the radical-mediated δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.*---------------------------------------------------------------
