**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal primary amino group (–NH₂) result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: The primary amino group can coordinate strongly with Fe ions, enhancing Fe incorporation into the metal-organic layer. The flexible aliphatic chain allows for optimal coordination geometry without significant steric hindrance.
  - **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *5-aminopentanoic acid*
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*
  - **Counterexamples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *Octanoic acid* (lacks amino group)
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid* (amino group attached to an aromatic ring, reducing availability due to resonance stabilization)

---

- **Rule 2**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position result in **high Fe/Hf values**; those with electron-donating substituents result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halogens) increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions. Electron-donating groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, methyl) decrease acidity and may hinder coordination due to increased electron density and resonance effects.
  - **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *4-nitrobenzoic acid*
    - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid*
  - **Counterexamples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid*
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid*
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing thiol groups (–SH) along with carboxylic acids result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: Thiol groups have a high affinity for metal ions due to their polarizable sulfur atoms, forming strong coordinate bonds with Fe ions and enhancing Fe incorporation.
  - **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with polyether chains (e.g., ethylene glycol units) connected to a terminal carboxylic acid result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: The ether oxygen atoms along the chain can act as additional coordination sites for Fe ions, increasing the overall binding affinity and promoting higher Fe loading.
  - **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with small or unbranched side chains result in **high Fe/Hf values**; those with bulky or complex side chains result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: The amino and carboxylate groups in α-amino acids can chelate Fe ions effectively. Small side chains reduce steric hindrance, allowing better coordination. Bulky side chains can hinder coordination due to increased steric bulk.
  - **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (aspartic acid)
  - **Counterexamples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (glutamic acid; longer side chain)
    - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (tryptophan; bulky indole ring)

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, methoxy) on the aromatic ring result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups increase the electron density on the aromatic ring, decreasing the acidity of the carboxylic acid and its ability to coordinate with Fe ions. Additionally, resonance effects may delocalize electron density away from coordination sites.
  - **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid*
    - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially on aliphatic chains or sugar moieties, result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase steric hindrance and promote extensive hydrogen bonding, which can interfere with effective coordination of Fe ions.
  - **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (gluconic acid)
    - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing perfluorinated aliphatic chains result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: Perfluorinated chains are highly electronegative, withdrawing electron density from the carboxylate group and reducing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions.
  - **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with aldehyde groups attached to aromatic rings result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups can engage in side reactions or oxidize, leading to instability. They also withdraw electron density, reducing the effectiveness of the carboxylate group in coordinating with Fe ions.
  - **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles (e.g., pyridine) with available nitrogen atoms for coordination result in **high Fe/Hf values** when connected via flexible linkers; direct attachment to the carboxylic acid may result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles can serve as coordination sites for Fe ions. Flexible linkers allow for favorable coordination geometry, enhancing Fe incorporation. Direct attachment may limit flexibility and hinder coordination.
  - **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid* (flexible linker)
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (aromatic spacer with some flexibility)
  - **Counterexamples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (nicotinic acid; direct attachment reduces flexibility)

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with internal ketone groups within aliphatic chains result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: Internal ketone groups can introduce steric hindrance and act as additional electron-withdrawing groups, reducing the coordinating ability of nearby functional groups with Fe ions.
  - **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing ether-functionalized aliphatic chains with terminal amino groups result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: Ether oxygen atoms and terminal amino groups provide multiple coordination sites, enhancing the ability to chelate Fe ions effectively.
  - **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: Without extra functional groups to provide additional coordination sites, these modifiers have limited ability to chelate Fe ions effectively.
  - **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *Octanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing sulfur in side chains as thioethers or sulfides result in **high Fe/Hf values** due to enhanced coordination with Fe ions.**

  - **Explanation**: Sulfur atoms in thioethers or sulfides can coordinate with Fe ions via lone pairs, increasing Fe incorporation.
  - **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid* (contains a methylthio group)
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* (thiol group)

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with bulky aromatic side chains may result in **high Fe/Hf values** if the side chains contribute to coordination; otherwise, they result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to steric hindrance.**

  - **Explanation**: Bulky aromatic side chains can either hinder Fe coordination due to steric effects or enhance it if they contain coordinating functional groups (e.g., methoxy groups) that interact with Fe ions.
  - **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid* (methoxy groups can coordinate)
    - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (phenylalanine; phenyl ring may assist in coordination)
  - **Counterexamples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (tryptophan; bulky indole ring without effective coordination)
