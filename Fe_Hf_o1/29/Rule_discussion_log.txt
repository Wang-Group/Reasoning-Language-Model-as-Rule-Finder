Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**:

  **Rule 1** is clear and allows for straightforward identification of modifiers fitting its criteria. The rule provides property insight by linking terminal amino groups on long aliphatic chains to high Fe/Hf values, likely due to increased coordination with iron ions. It combines functional groups and chain length, adding appropriate complexity. With at least four supporting examples (e.g., 5-aminopentanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid), it meets the coverage criterion and balances complexity with coverage effectively.

- **Comment 2**:

  **Rule 2** is clear and identifies modifiers containing sulfur functional groups as having high Fe/Hf values. The property insight is solid, as sulfur's affinity for iron is well-known in coordination chemistry. The rule focuses on specific functional groups, maintaining simplicity while providing adequate complexity. It is supported by multiple data points (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid, 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid), satisfying the coverage requirement and achieving a good balance.

- **Comment 3**:

  **Rule 3** clearly states that aromatic rings with strong electron-withdrawing groups lead to high Fe/Hf values. This provides property insight into how substituents affect metal coordination. The rule combines aromatic systems with specific substituents, adding complexity. With examples like 4-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, it meets the minimum coverage, though additional examples would strengthen it. Overall, the rule is balanced and effective.

- **Comment 4**:

  **Rule 4** identifies modifiers with ether linkages and coordinating end groups as having high Fe/Hf values. The rule is clear but somewhat complex, combining multiple functional groups. The property insight is reasonable, considering how ether linkages and coordinating groups can influence metal binding. Supported by two examples (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid), it meets the coverage criterion but would benefit from more data points. The rule strikes a fair balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 5**:

  **Rule 5** is clear, indicating that electron-donating groups on aromatic rings lead to low Fe/Hf values. The property insight aligns with the impact of substituents on coordination ability. The rule incorporates complexity by considering both ring systems and substituent types. With several supporting examples (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-methylbenzoic acid), it has strong coverage and achieves a good balance.

- **Comment 6**:

  **Rule 6** clearly states that multiple hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains or cyclic structures result in low Fe/Hf values. The property insight is sound, considering steric hindrance and hydrogen bonding potential interfering with metal coordination. With two examples (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), it meets the coverage requirement. The rule maintains simplicity while offering adequate complexity and balance.

- **Comment 7**:

  **Rule 7** suggests that pyridine rings linked to aromatic systems result in high Fe/Hf values. The rule is clear but could be more specific about the nature of the linkage. The property insight is valid, given pyridine's ability to coordinate with iron. Supported by two examples (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid), it meets the minimum coverage. The rule offers sufficient complexity and balance.

- **Comment 8**:

  **Rule 8** is clear in stating that straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups lead to low Fe/Hf values. The property insight makes sense, as lack of coordinating groups reduces metal binding. However, the coverage is limited to a single example (octanoic acid), falling short of the minimum requirement. This limits the rule's reliability and balance.

- **Comment 9**:

  **Rule 9** clearly identifies modifiers with aldehyde-substituted aromatic rings as having low Fe/Hf values. The property insight is acceptable, considering aldehydes' limited coordinating ability. With two examples (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid), it meets the coverage criterion. The rule maintains a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 10**:

  **Rule 10** states that bulky aromatic heterocyclic rings lead to low Fe/Hf values. The rule is clear, and the property insight is logical due to steric hindrance. Supported by multiple examples (e.g., (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid), it satisfies the coverage requirement. The rule effectively balances complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 11**:

  **Rule 11** identifies perfluorinated aliphatic chains as resulting in low Fe/Hf values. While clear, the rule is supported by only one example (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), which is insufficient for coverage. This limits the rule's strength and balance despite reasonable property insight.

- **Comment 12**:

  **Rule 12** indicates that aromatic rings with hydroxyl groups linked via amide bonds to aliphatic chains have low Fe/Hf values. The rule is clear but complex. It lacks sufficient coverage with only one supporting example (2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid). This undermines its reliability and balance, despite acceptable property insight.

**Explanation and Considerations:**

- **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:
  - **Coordination Ability**: Functional groups like amino, thiol, and pyridine rings can coordinate strongly with iron ions, enhancing Fe loading.
  - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups (EWGs)**: EWGs on aromatic rings can stabilize coordination complexes with iron, increasing Fe/Hf ratios.
  - **Steric Effects**: Bulky substituents or multiple hydroxyl groups can hinder coordination with iron, leading to lower Fe/Hf values.

- **High Fe/Hf Value Modifiers**:
  - **Rules 1-4, 7, and 13** highlight modifiers with functional groups capable of strong coordination with iron or enhancing iron loading due to chelation effects.
    - Terminal amines on long chains provide flexible ligands.
    - Sulfur-containing groups (thiols, thioethers) form strong bonds with metal ions.
    - Electron-withdrawing groups (excluding aldehydes) facilitate better orbital overlap with iron.
    - Ether linkages with coordinating end groups create multidentate ligands.
    - Pyridine rings contribute lone pair electrons for coordination.
    - Long aliphatic chains with hydroxyl groups can act as ligands while maintaining solubility.

- **Low Fe/Hf Value Modifiers**:
  - **Rules 5-6 and 8-12** focus on modifiers that lack strong coordinating groups or possess functionalities that hinder iron coordination.
    - Electron-donating groups without additional coordinating groups may compete with iron binding.
    - Multiple hydroxyl groups can lead to steric hindrance or form hydrogen bonds that prevent coordination.
    - Straight-chain acids without functional groups lack sites for coordination.
    - Aldehydes and perfluorinated chains do not effectively coordinate with iron.
    - Bulky heterocycles without coordinating groups may sterically block metal access.

- **Exceptions and Refinements**:
  - **Rule 5** accounts for exceptions where additional coordinating groups override the effect of electron-donating substituents.
  - **Rule 10** acknowledges that the presence of strong coordinating groups (like keto groups) on heterocycles can increase Fe/Hf values despite steric bulk.

- **Coverage and Balance**:
  - The rules cover a broad range of the dataset, with modifiers categorized based on combinations of functional groups.
  - There is a balance between simple rules with high coverage (e.g., Rules 1, 2, and 8) and more complex rules that explain exceptions (e.g., Rules 5 and 10).

By applying these refined rules, researchers can predict whether a given molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low Fe/Hf value, aiding in the rational design and optimization of catalysts for the target radical-mediated δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

**Note**: These rules are derived from the provided dataset and are intended to guide future modifier selection by highlighting key structural features that influence iron incorporation into the catalyst. When evaluating new modifiers, consider both the presence of strong coordinating groups and possible steric or electronic effects that may affect iron binding.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**:
  Rule 1 is clear and allows for unambiguous determination of a high Fe/Hf value when a modifier matches the structural description of containing terminal amino groups (-NH₂) on aliphatic chains longer than four carbons. It provides adequate physical-chemical insight by highlighting that longer aliphatic chains with terminal amino groups can coordinate strongly with iron ions, enhancing Fe loading. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures (chain length and functional group), adding appropriate complexity. It is well-supported by multiple data points (e.g., 5-aminopentanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid), satisfying the coverage criterion. The balance between complexity and coverage is excellent.

- **Comment 2**:
  Rule 2 is clear in specifying that modifiers containing sulfur functional groups such as thiols (-SH) or thioethers (-S-) tend to have a high Fe/Hf value. It offers sufficient physical-chemical insight, acknowledging that sulfur-containing groups form strong bonds with metal ions like iron. The rule combines different sulfur functional groups, adding complexity beyond a single group. It is supported by multiple data points (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid, 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid, 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid), ensuring good coverage. The balance between complexity and coverage is maintained effectively.

- **Comment 3**:
  Rule 3 clearly differentiates between modifiers with aromatic rings bearing strong electron-withdrawing groups, leading to high Fe/Hf values, and those with aldehyde groups (-CHO), leading to low Fe/Hf values. The physical-chemical insight is solid, as electron-withdrawing groups like nitro and bromoalkyl can stabilize coordination complexes with iron, while aldehyde groups do not favor coordination. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures and distinguishes between different electron-withdrawing groups, adding appropriate complexity. It is well-supported by multiple data points on both sides (e.g., high Fe/Hf with 4-nitrobenzoic acid, low Fe/Hf with 4-formylbenzoic acid), satisfying the coverage criterion. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 4**:
  Rule 4 is clear in stating that modifiers containing ether linkages (-O-) combined with terminal amino groups (-NH₂) or methoxy groups (-OCH₃) tend to have a high Fe/Hf value. The physical-chemical insight is adequate, suggesting that such combinations can create multidentate ligands that enhance iron coordination. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures (ether linkages with coordinating groups), adding complexity. It is supported by at least two data points (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid), meeting the coverage requirement. The balance between complexity and coverage is well achieved.

- **Comment 5**:
  Rule 5 is clear in indicating that modifiers with aromatic rings substituted only with electron-donating groups tend to have a low Fe/Hf value, but if additional coordinating functional groups are present, the Fe/Hf value may be high. The physical-chemical insight is sufficient, explaining how electron-donating groups can hinder iron coordination unless overridden by strong coordinating groups. The rule adds complexity by considering exceptions and combinations of functional groups. It is supported by multiple data points (e.g., low Fe/Hf with 4-aminobenzoic acid, high Fe/Hf with 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), satisfying the coverage criterion. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 6**:
  Rule 6 is clear in stating that modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) on aliphatic chains or cyclic structures tend to have a low Fe/Hf value. The physical-chemical insight is adequate, suggesting that multiple hydroxyl groups can lead to steric hindrance or form hydrogen bonds that prevent coordination with iron. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures, adding complexity. It is supported by at least two data points (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid, 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid), meeting the coverage requirement. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 7**:
  Rule 7 is clear and allows for determining whether the Fe/Hf value is high or low based on the presence and linkage of pyridine or other nitrogen-containing heterocyclic rings. The physical-chemical insight is robust, explaining how the coordination ability of the nitrogen atom depends on its accessibility, which is affected by the linkage to other groups. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures (type of heterocycle and bonding), adding appropriate complexity. It is supported by multiple data points (e.g., high Fe/Hf with 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, low Fe/Hf with pyridine-3-carboxylic acid), satisfying the coverage criterion. The balance between complexity and coverage is good.

- **Comment 8**:
  Rule 8 is clear in stating that straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups tend to have a low Fe/Hf value. The physical-chemical insight is acceptable, indicating that the lack of coordinating groups results in minimal interaction with iron. However, the rule has limited complexity, considering only a single functional group, and coverage is minimal with only one supporting data point (octanoic acid). According to the criteria, a rule should be supported by at least two data points; thus, Rule 8 lacks sufficient coverage. The balance between simplicity and coverage is not optimal.

- **Comment 9**:
  Rule 9 is clear and specifies that modifiers containing aromatic rings substituted with aldehyde groups (-CHO) tend to have a low Fe/Hf value. The physical-chemical insight is adequate, as aldehyde groups can act as deactivating groups and do not facilitate coordination with iron. The rule is simple but considers specific functional groups on aromatic systems. It is supported by multiple data points (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid), satisfying the coverage requirement. However, this rule partly overlaps with Rule 3, which also addresses the effect of aldehydes, suggesting potential redundancy. The balance between simplicity and coverage is acceptable, but combining this rule with Rule 3 could enhance clarity.

- **Comment 10**:
  Rule 10 is clear and explains that modifiers with bulky heterocyclic aromatic rings without additional coordinating groups tend to have a low Fe/Hf value, but the presence of strong coordinating groups like keto groups can lead to high Fe/Hf values. The physical-chemical insight is solid, highlighting how steric hindrance and the presence of coordinating groups affect iron binding. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures and exceptions, adding appropriate complexity. It is supported by multiple data points (e.g., low Fe/Hf with (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid, high Fe/Hf with 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid), satisfying coverage. The balance between complexity and coverage is well managed.

- **Comment 11**:
  Rule 11 is clear in stating that modifiers containing perfluorinated aliphatic chains tend to have a low Fe/Hf value. The physical-chemical insight is acceptable, as perfluorinated chains can reduce coordination due to their electron-withdrawing nature and steric effects. However, the rule is simple and focuses on a specific sub-structure. Coverage is minimal, with only one supporting data point (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), which does not meet the criterion of at least two data points. Consequently, Rule 11 lacks sufficient coverage, affecting the balance between simplicity and coverage.

- **Comment 12**:
  Rule 12 is clear in specifying that modifiers with aromatic rings substituted with hydroxyl groups (-OH) linked via amide bonds to aliphatic chains tend to have a low Fe/Hf value. The physical-chemical insight is moderate, suggesting that such structures do not favor coordination with iron. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures, adding complexity. However, it is supported by only one data point (2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid), failing to meet the coverage requirement. The balance between complexity and coverage is not optimal due to insufficient data support.

- **Comment 13**:
  Rule 13 is clear in indicating that modifiers containing long aliphatic chains (≥7 carbons) with a hydroxyl group (-OH) tend to have a high Fe/Hf value. The physical-chemical insight is acceptable, as longer chains with hydroxyl groups may enhance coordination and solubility. The rule considers combinations of chain length and functional groups, adding complexity. However, it is supported by only one data point (7-hydroxyheptanoic acid), not meeting the coverage criterion of at least two data points. Therefore, the balance between complexity and coverage is insufficient.

**Explanation and Considerations:**

- **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:
  - **Coordination Chemistry**: Functional groups such as amino groups, sulfur-containing groups, pyridine rings, and ketones can act as ligands, coordinating with Fe ions and increasing the Fe/Hf ratio.
    - **Amino Groups (-NH₂)**: Provide lone pairs for coordination with metal ions.
    - **Sulfur Groups (-SH, -S-)**: Sulfur has a larger atomic radius and a lone pair, offering strong coordination.
    - **Pyridine Rings**: Nitrogen atom in the ring can coordinate with metals.
    - **Ketone Groups (-C=O)**: Oxygen can act as a ligand due to its lone pairs.
  - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups (EWGs)**:
    - EWGs like nitro, bromo, and pyridyl groups withdraw electron density, stabilizing the metal–ligand complex through π-backbonding.
  - **Electron-Donating Groups (EDGs)**:
    - EDGs like hydroxyl, amino, and methyl groups donate electron density, potentially reducing metal coordination due to increased electron repulsion.
  - **Steric Effects**:
    - Bulky substituents or multiple hydroxyl groups can hinder the approach of metal ions, decreasing Fe coordination.

- **Applicability of Rules**:
  - **High Fe/Hf Value Modifiers**:
    - **Rules 1-4, 9, 12-13** highlight modifiers that effectively coordinate with Fe ions due to suitable functional groups, leading to higher Fe incorporation.
      - These modifiers often have donor atoms (N, S, O) that can form coordinate bonds.
    - **Rule 9** distinguishes between direct attachment (less favorable) and linkers (more favorable) for nitrogen heterocycles.
  - **Low Fe/Hf Value Modifiers**:
    - **Rules 5-8, 10-11** identify modifiers lacking strong coordinating groups or having features that hinder coordination.
      - For example, perfluorinated chains (Rule 10) are highly electronegative and do not coordinate well with metals.
      - Bulky aromatic rings without coordinating groups (Rule 11) can sterically block metal access.

- **Coverage and Balance**:
  - The rules cover a broad range of structural motifs found in the dataset.
  - There is a balance between simple rules with broad coverage (e.g., Rule 5 on straight-chain acids) and more detailed rules addressing specific functional group combinations (e.g., Rule 9 on nitrogen heterocycles).

- **Exceptions and Refinements**:
  - **Rule 6** accounts for exceptions where additional coordinating groups can override the effects of EDGs.
  - **Rule 11** notes that the presence of strong coordinating groups can change the expected Fe/Hf value despite steric bulk.

- **Use of Examples**:
  - Examples are provided for each rule to illustrate how specific modifiers fit the rules, enhancing clarity and aiding in application to new compounds.

---

By applying these rules, researchers can predict whether a given molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low Fe/Hf value. This insight aids in the rational design and optimization of catalysts for the target radical-mediated δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

- **For High Fe/Hf Value**:
  - Consider modifiers with functional groups capable of strong coordination with Fe ions, such as terminal amino groups on long aliphatic chains, sulfur-containing groups, ketones adjacent to aromatic rings, and electron-withdrawing substituents on aromatic rings.
  - Utilize modifiers that have linkers between nitrogen-containing heterocycles and the carboxylic acid group to enhance coordination.

- **For Low Fe/Hf Value**:
  - Avoid modifiers lacking strong coordinating groups or those with steric hindrance due to bulky substituents.
  - Be cautious with modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups or perfluorinated chains, as they tend to decrease Fe incorporation.

**Note**: These rules are based on the provided dataset and are meant to guide future selection of molecular modifiers. When evaluating new modifiers, consider both the functional groups present and their potential impacts on Fe coordination, keeping in mind the balance between electronic effects and steric factors.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**:

  **Rule 1** demonstrates high **clarity** by specifying that modifiers containing a terminal amino group (-NH₂) on an aliphatic chain of five or more carbons tend to have a high Fe/Hf value. This structural description is explicit, allowing for clear determination of whether a modifier fits the rule. The **property insight** is strong, as terminal amino groups can act as ligands coordinating with Fe ions, and longer aliphatic chains may enhance flexibility and accessibility for coordination. The rule exhibits appropriate **complexity** by considering the combination of a functional group and chain length, rather than a single feature. In terms of **coverage**, the rule is supported by multiple data points—5-aminopentanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid, and (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid—all showing high Fe/Hf values. The rule achieves a good **balance** between specificity and applicability.

- **Comment 2**:

  **Rule 2** is clear in stating that modifiers containing sulfur-functional groups such as thiols (-SH) or thioethers (-S-) tend to have a high Fe/Hf value. This allows for straightforward identification of applicable modifiers. The **property insight** is solid; sulfur atoms have lone pairs that can coordinate strongly with Fe ions, enhancing metal-ligand interactions. The rule has reasonable **complexity**, focusing on specific functional groups known for their coordinating ability. **Coverage** is adequate, with examples like 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid, 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid, and 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid supporting the rule. The **balance** between simplicity and coverage is well-maintained.

- **Comment 3**:

  **Rule 3** provides clear criteria by identifying modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) on an aromatic ring, such as nitro (-NO₂), bromo (-Br), or pyridyl (-C₅H₄N) substituents, as having a high Fe/Hf value. The **property insight** is meaningful; EWGs can stabilize metal complexes through electron delocalization and π-backbonding. The rule's **complexity** is moderate, considering both the type of substituent and its position on the aromatic ring. **Coverage** is strong, with several modifiers like 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, and 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid fitting the rule and showing high Fe/Hf values. The rule strikes a good **balance** between complexity and broad applicability.

- **Comment 4**:

  **Rule 4** is clear in stating that modifiers with multiple ether linkages (-O-), especially when combined with terminal amino groups (-NH₂) or methoxy groups (-OCH₃), tend to have a high Fe/Hf value. The **property insight** is reasonable; ether linkages may increase solubility and flexibility, while amino and methoxy groups provide coordination sites for Fe ions. The **complexity** is higher due to the combination of multiple functional groups, but this adds specificity. **Coverage** includes modifiers like 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid and 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid, supporting the rule. The **balance** between specificity and coverage is acceptable, though additional examples could strengthen it.

- **Comment 5**:

  **Rule 5** clearly states that straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups tend to have a low Fe/Hf value. This simplicity aids in **clarity**. The **property insight** is sound; lacking coordinating groups, these modifiers are less likely to interact strongly with Fe ions. The **complexity** is low, focusing on the absence of functional groups, which is appropriate for this rule. **Coverage** is sufficient with examples like octanoic acid demonstrating low Fe/Hf values. The rule maintains a good **balance** by being simple yet effective.

- **Comment 6**:

  **Rule 6** indicates that modifiers with aromatic rings substituted with electron-donating groups (EDGs) such as hydroxyl (-OH), amino (-NH₂), or methyl (-CH₃) groups tend to have a low Fe/Hf value unless they contain additional strong coordinating groups. The rule offers **clarity**, with clear distinctions and noted exceptions. The **property insight** is strong; EDGs increase electron density, potentially reducing metal coordination. The **complexity** is moderate, considering both the presence of EDGs and additional coordinating groups. **Coverage** is good, including low Fe/Hf examples like 4-aminobenzoic acid and 4-methylbenzoic acid, and accounting for exceptions like 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid. The rule achieves a **balance** between specificity and generality.

- **Comment 7**:

  **Rule 7** is clear in stating that modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) on aliphatic chains or sugar moieties tend to have a low Fe/Hf value. The **property insight** lies in the potential for steric hindrance and intramolecular hydrogen bonding, which can reduce coordination with Fe ions. The rule's **complexity** is moderate, involving both functional groups and chain types. **Coverage** includes examples like gluconic acid and 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid, supporting the rule. The **balance** is acceptable, effectively covering relevant modifiers.

- **Comment 8**:

  **Rule 8** states that modifiers with aromatic aldehyde groups (-CHO) tend to have a low Fe/Hf value. The rule is **clear**, focusing on a specific functional group. The **property insight** could be expanded; aldehyde groups may be less effective in coordinating with Fe ions due to their electrophilic nature or potential for side reactions. The **complexity** is low but appropriate. **Coverage** is supported by examples like 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid, which show low Fe/Hf values. The rule maintains a good **balance** between simplicity and applicability.

- **Comment 9**:

  **Rule 9** distinguishes between modifiers containing nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly attached to the carboxylic acid group, which tend to have a low Fe/Hf value, and those with an intervening linkage, which tend to have a high Fe/Hf value. This rule has high **clarity** and provides detailed structural distinctions. The **property insight** is strong; linkers may enhance the ability of the heterocycle to coordinate with Fe by providing flexibility and proper spatial arrangement. The **complexity** is higher but justified by the nuanced distinctions. **Coverage** includes low Fe/Hf examples like nicotinic acid and pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, and high Fe/Hf examples like 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid and 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid. The rule achieves a commendable **balance** between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 10**:

  **Rule 10** clearly states that modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains tend to have a low Fe/Hf value. The **property insight** is that highly electronegative fluorinated chains do not readily coordinate with metal ions. The **complexity** is low, focusing on a specific and identifiable structural feature. **Coverage** is limited to one example—2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid—but given the rarity of such compounds in the dataset, the coverage is acceptable. The rule maintains a good **balance** between specificity and necessity.

- **Comment 11**:

  **Rule 11** indicates that modifiers containing bulky aromatic rings without strong coordinating groups tend to have a low Fe/Hf value unless they possess additional functional groups capable of chelation. The rule offers **clarity** with noted exceptions. The **property insight** is solid; steric hindrance from bulky rings can impede coordination unless mitigated by strong coordinating groups. The **complexity** is moderate, considering both steric effects and functional group presence. **Coverage** includes low Fe/Hf examples like (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (L-phenylalanine) and (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (L-tryptophan), and a high Fe/Hf example like 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid. The rule balances complexity and coverage effectively.

- **Comment 12**:

  **Rule 12** is clear in stating that modifiers with ketone functional groups adjacent to aromatic rings tend to have a high Fe/Hf value. The **property insight** is that ketone oxygen atoms can coordinate with Fe ions, and the adjacent aromatic ring may stabilize the metal complex. The **complexity** is moderate, focusing on specific functional group arrangements. **Coverage** is somewhat limited, primarily supported by 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid. While additional examples would strengthen the rule, it remains valid and maintains an acceptable **balance**.

- **Comment 13**:

  **Rule 13** states that modifiers containing hydroxyl groups (-OH) on long aliphatic chains (≥7 carbons) tend to have a high Fe/Hf value. The **clarity** is good, with clear criteria for chain length and functional group. The **property insight** may involve the hydroxyl group acting as a coordinating site and the long chain providing flexibility for effective interaction with Fe ions. The **complexity** is moderate, combining chain length with functional group presence. **Coverage** includes 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid as an example with a high Fe/Hf value. While the rule could benefit from more data points, it maintains a reasonable **balance**.

**Explanation and Considerations:**

- **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:

  - **Coordination Ability**:
    - Functional groups like **amino (-NH₂)**, **thiol (-SH)**, **thioether (-S-)**, **pyridine nitrogen**, and **ketone oxygen** can act as ligands, coordinating with Fe ions and increasing the Fe/Hf ratio.

  - **Electron-Withdrawing vs. Electron-Donating Groups**:
    - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups (EWGs)**, such as **nitro (-NO₂)** and **halogens (-Br)**, enhance metal coordination by stabilizing the metal-ligand complex.
    - **Electron-Donating Groups (EDGs)**, like **hydroxyl (-OH)** and **amino (-NH₂)** on aromatic rings, can reduce metal coordination due to increased electron density and potential steric hindrance.

  - **Steric Effects**:
    - Bulky substituents or multiple hydroxyl groups can hinder the approach of metal ions, decreasing Fe incorporation.

  - **Chain Length and Flexibility**:
    - Longer aliphatic chains with coordinating end groups increase flexibility and availability for metal coordination.

- **Applicability of Rules**:

  - **High Fe/Hf Value Modifiers**:
    - **Rules 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 10, 11, and 15** identify modifiers with functional groups capable of strong coordination with Fe ions, leading to higher Fe incorporation.
    - These modifiers often combine multiple coordinating groups, enhancing their ability to bind Fe.

  - **Low Fe/Hf Value Modifiers**:
    - **Rules 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, and 14** highlight modifiers lacking strong coordinating groups or having features that hinder coordination, resulting in lower Fe/Hf values.

- **Coverage and Balance**:

  - The rules cover a broad range of structural motifs and functional group combinations present in the dataset.
  - There is a balance between simple rules with higher coverage (e.g., Rule 5 on straight-chain acids) and more complex rules with lower coverage that consider multiple functional groups (e.g., Rule 11 combining ether linkages and terminal groups).

- **Combination of Functional Groups**:

  - Many rules emphasize the combined effect of multiple functional groups on Fe/Hf values.
    - **Rule 2** combines sulfur-containing groups with carboxylic acids.
    - **Rule 11** considers both ether linkages and terminal groups.
    - **Rule 15** involves both sulfur-containing groups and amino groups within an amino acid framework.

---

**Application of Rules:**

- **For High Fe/Hf Value Modifiers**:

  - Select modifiers with functional groups known to coordinate strongly with Fe ions.
  - Look for combinations of coordinating groups (e.g., amino and thiol groups) and structural features that enhance metal binding.

- **For Low Fe/Hf Value Modifiers**:

  - Avoid modifiers with strong coordinating groups or those with steric hindrance.
  - Opt for modifiers with electron-donating substituents on aromatic rings or multiple hydroxyl groups that may impede metal coordination.

---

**Conclusion:**

By applying these rules, researchers can predict whether a given molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low Fe/Hf value. This knowledge aids in the rational design and optimization of catalysts for the target radical-mediated δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. The rules emphasize the importance of combining multiple functional groups and considering both electronic and steric factors to achieve the desired Fe/Hf ratio.

**Explanation and Considerations:**

- **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:

  - **Coordination Ability**:
    - Functional groups like **amino (-NH₂)**, **thiol (-SH)**, **thioether (-S-)**, and **pyridine nitrogen** can coordinate with Fe ions, increasing the Fe/Hf ratio.
    - Combining multiple coordinating groups enhances metal binding, leading to higher Fe incorporation.

  - **Electron-Withdrawing vs. Electron-Donating Groups**:
    - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups (EWGs)**, such as **nitro (-NO₂)** and **halogens (-Br)**, stabilize metal-ligand complexes, promoting higher Fe/Hf values.
    - **Electron-Donating Groups (EDGs)**, like **hydroxyl (-OH)** and **amino (-NH₂)** on aromatic rings, may reduce Fe coordination due to increased electron density and potential steric hindrance.

  - **Steric Effects and Chain Length**:
    - Longer aliphatic chains with terminal coordinating groups increase flexibility and accessibility for Fe coordination.
    - Bulky groups or multiple hydroxyls can hinder metal approach, reducing Fe incorporation.

- **Applicability of Rules**:

  - **High Fe/Hf Value Modifiers**:
    - **Rules 1–7** identify modifiers with strong coordinating groups and structural features that enhance Fe binding.
    - These modifiers often combine multiple functional groups (e.g., amino and thiol groups) to increase coordination.

  - **Low Fe/Hf Value Modifiers**:
    - **Rules 8–13** highlight modifiers lacking strong coordinating groups or having features that impede Fe coordination.
    - Modifiers with EDGs, steric hindrance, or electron-rich environments tend to have lower Fe/Hf values.

- **Coverage and Balance**:

  - The rules cover a wide range of structural motifs and functional group combinations present in the dataset.
  - There is a balance between simple rules with broader coverage (e.g., Rule 8 on straight-chain acids) and complex rules with narrower focus (e.g., Rule 7 on ether-linked chains with terminal groups).

**Conclusion:**

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a given molecular modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value. This aids in the rational design and optimization of catalysts for the target radical-mediated δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. The rules emphasize the importance of combining multiple functional groups and considering both electronic and steric factors to achieve the desired Fe/Hf ratio.

    - **Ether linkages** can influence the solubility and flexibility of the modifier, potentially facilitating better interaction with metal centers.

  - **Electron-Withdrawing vs. Electron-Donating Groups**:
    - **EWGs** decrease electron density on the ligand, strengthening metal-ligand coordination.
    - **Electron-donating groups (EDGs)**, such as hydroxyl and amino groups on aromatic rings, may compete with metal coordination or create steric hindrance, resulting in lower Fe incorporation.

  - **Steric Effects and Chain Length**:
    - Longer aliphatic chains with terminal coordinating groups (Rule 1) provide flexibility and reduce steric hindrance, enhancing Fe coordination.
    - Bulky groups or multiple hydroxyls (Rule 8) can hinder effective metal approach and binding.

- **Applicability of Rules**:

  - **High Fe/Hf Value Modifiers**:
    - **Rules 1–5** focus on modifiers with functional groups that enhance Fe coordination through multiple binding sites or favorable electronic properties.

  - **Low Fe/Hf Value Modifiers**:
    - **Rules 6–10** identify modifiers lacking strong coordinating groups or possessing features that reduce metal-binding efficiency.

- **Coverage and Balance**:

  - The rules cover a broad spectrum of functional groups and structural motifs present in the dataset.
  - There is a balance between:
    - **Simple rules with broad coverage** (e.g., Rule 6 on simple aliphatic acids).
    - **Complex rules with narrower focus** (e.g., Rule 5 on ether-linked chains with terminal groups).

---

**Conclusion:**

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a given molecular modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value based on its structural features. This understanding aids in the rational design and selection of modifiers to optimize the catalyst for the target radical-mediated δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. The rules emphasize the importance of specific functional groups and their combinations in influencing metal coordination and incorporation within the catalyst structure.

**Explanation and Considerations:**

- **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:

  - **Coordination Ability**:
    - Functional groups like **amino (-NH₂)**, **thiol (-SH)**, and **ether linkages (-O-)** can serve as coordination sites for Fe ions, enhancing metal-binding capability and leading to higher Fe/Hf ratios.
    - **Electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)** increase metal-binding affinity by stabilizing the negative charge developed during coordination.
    - **Sulfur-containing groups** have a strong affinity for transition metals due to their soft donor characteristics.

  - **Electron-Withdrawing vs. Electron-Donating Groups**:
    - **EWGs** (e.g., nitro, halogens) enhance metal coordination by withdrawing electron density, making the ligand more effective at binding metal ions.
    - **Electron-donating groups (EDGs)** (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) can reduce metal-binding efficiency due to increased electron density and potential steric hindrance.

  - **Steric Effects and Chain Length**:
    - Longer aliphatic chains with terminal coordinating groups (Rule 1) provide flexibility and reduce steric hindrance, facilitating Fe coordination.
    - Bulky side chains or multiple hydroxyl groups (Rule 8, Rule 12) can hinder effective metal approach and binding.

  - **Structural Connectivity**:
    - The presence of linkers and specific positioning of functional groups (e.g., pyridine rings connected via linkers in Rule 4) affects the modifier's ability to chelate metals effectively.

- **Applicability of Rules**:

  - **High Fe/Hf Value Modifiers**:
    - **Rules 1–5, 11, 13** focus on modifiers with functional groups that enhance Fe coordination through multiple binding sites or favorable electronic properties.

  - **Low Fe/Hf Value Modifiers**:
    - **Rules 6–10, 12** identify modifiers lacking strong coordinating groups or possessing features that reduce metal-binding efficiency.

- **Coverage and Balance**:

  - The rules cover a broad range of functional groups and structural motifs present in the dataset.
  - There is a balance between:
    - **Simple rules with broad coverage** (e.g., Rule 6 on simple aliphatic acids).
    - **Complex rules with narrower focus** (e.g., Rule 11 on sulfur-containing amino acids).

---

**Conclusion:**

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a given molecular modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value based on its structural features. This facilitates the rational design and selection of modifiers to optimize the catalyst for the target radical-mediated δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. The rules emphasize the importance of specific functional groups and their combinations in influencing metal coordination and incorporation within the catalyst structure.

    - Bulky side chains or multiple hydroxyl groups (Rule 8) can hinder effective metal approach and binding.

  - **Structural Connectivity**:
    - The presence of linkers and specific positioning of functional groups affects the modifier's ability to chelate metals effectively (Rules 7, 10, 11).

- **Applicability of Rules**:

  - **High Fe/Hf Value Modifiers**:
    - **Rules 1–3, 6, 7, 11–13, 15** focus on modifiers with functional groups that enhance Fe coordination through multiple binding sites or favorable electronic properties.

  - **Low Fe/Hf Value Modifiers**:
    - **Rules 4, 5, 8–10, 14** identify modifiers lacking strong coordinating groups or possessing features that reduce metal-binding efficiency.

- **Coverage and Balance**:
  - The rules cover a broad range of functional groups and structural motifs present in the dataset.
  - There is a balance between:
    - **Simple rules with broad coverage** (e.g., Rule 5 on simple aliphatic acids).
    - **Complex rules with narrower focus** (e.g., Rule 12 on sulfur-containing amino acids).

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows for straightforward identification of modifiers with high Fe/Hf values based on specific structural features (aliphatic amino acids with terminal amino and carboxylic acid groups separated by at least three carbon atoms). The rule provides good physical-chemical insight by emphasizing the importance of chain length and the positioning of functional groups for effective Fe coordination. It considers combinations of substructures, adding necessary complexity. The rule is well-supported by at least three data points (5-aminopentanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid), achieving a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear in identifying modifiers containing both a thiol group and a carboxylic acid group resulting in high Fe/Hf values. The physical-chemical insight is strong, as thiol groups are known for their excellent metal-binding properties due to the sulfur atom's lone pairs. The rule combines two coordinating functional groups, providing appropriate complexity. It is supported by at least two data points (3-sulfanylpropanoic acid, 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid), and the balance between specificity and coverage is effective.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 clearly describes modifiers with aromatic rings substituted by strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) and a carboxylic acid group leading to high Fe/Hf values. The rule offers solid physical-chemical insight, as EWGs can enhance metal-ligand interactions by stabilizing negative charges during coordination. It involves combinations of substructures, adding complexity. The rule is supported by at least two data points (4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid). However, exceptions like 4-formylbenzoic acid (which shows a low Fe/Hf value despite fitting the rule) indicate that additional factors may influence the outcome, suggesting room for refinement.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear and effective in identifying modifiers with aromatic rings substituted by electron-donating groups (EDGs) and a carboxylic acid group, leading to low Fe/Hf values. The physical-chemical reasoning aligns with the understanding that EDGs can decrease metal-binding efficiency by increasing electron density and causing potential repulsion. The rule considers combinations of substructures and is supported by at least three data points (4-aminobenzoic acid, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid), achieving a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear in stating that simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional strong coordinating groups tend to have low Fe/Hf values. The physical-chemical insight is appropriate, as the lack of coordinating functional groups reduces the metal-binding capability. While the rule is simple, focusing on a single functional group, it effectively covers the relevant cases, supported by at least two data points (octanoic acid, 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid). The simplicity is justified by the adequate coverage, maintaining a balance.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 clearly identifies modifiers with multiple ether linkages and terminating coordinating groups like carboxylic acids as having high Fe/Hf values. The physical-chemical insight is sound, considering ether oxygen atoms can coordinate with metal ions, enhancing metal binding. The rule involves combinations of substructures (ether linkages and coordinating groups), adding necessary complexity. It is supported by at least two data points (2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid), balancing complexity and coverage effectively.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear in specifying that modifiers featuring a pyridine ring connected via an aliphatic linker to a carboxylic acid group tend to have high Fe/Hf values. The physical-chemical reasoning is solid, as the pyridine nitrogen can serve as a strong coordinating site for Fe ions. The rule involves multiple substructures, providing appropriate complexity. It is supported by at least two data points (4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid), achieving a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 clearly identifies modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain or cyclic structure, without additional strong coordinating groups, resulting in low Fe/Hf values. The physical-chemical insight is acceptable, as multiple hydroxyl groups may not effectively enhance metal coordination due to their weaker coordinating ability compared to other groups like amines or thiols. The rule considers combinations of substructures, adding complexity. It is supported by at least two data points ((2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid, 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid), maintaining a balance.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 provides a nuanced distinction between modifiers that are amino acids with bulky electron-rich aromatic side chains having low Fe/Hf values and those with less electron-rich aromatic rings showing high Fe/Hf values. The physical-chemical insight is valuable, considering that electron-rich rings might hinder metal coordination due to electron repulsion or steric factors. The rule is complex, involving both the nature of the aromatic ring and its electron properties, but it is justified. It is supported by at least two data points ((2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid with low Fe/Hf value, (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid with high Fe/Hf value), achieving a balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear in identifying modifiers with nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly attached to a carboxylic acid group, resulting in low Fe/Hf values. The physical-chemical reasoning is acceptable, as the lack of an aliphatic linker may reduce flexibility and hinder effective metal coordination. The rule combines multiple structural features, adding complexity. It is supported by at least two data points (pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid), balancing complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 describes modifiers with an aromatic ring fused to a lactone structure and containing a carboxylic acid group as having high Fe/Hf values. While the rule is clear and offers specific physical-chemical insight, its complexity is high, and it is supported by only one data point (1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid). The low coverage limits the robustness of the rule, suggesting that it may be too specific. Enhancing coverage with additional data points would improve its validity.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 identifies modifiers that have both a terminal amino group and internal sulfur-containing groups as tending to have high Fe/Hf values. The physical-chemical reasoning is plausible, considering the strong coordinating ability of both amines and sulfur-containing groups. However, the rule is highly specific and supported by only one data point (2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid), limiting its general applicability. Additional supporting data would strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 specifies that modifiers containing long aliphatic chains with terminal hydroxyl and carboxylic acid groups tend to have high Fe/Hf values. The rule is clear and provides reasonable physical-chemical insight, as the terminal groups may facilitate coordination through flexibility and multiple binding sites. However, it is only supported by one data point (7-hydroxyheptanoic acid), which reduces its robustness. Broader data coverage would enhance the rule's applicability.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 is clear in identifying modifiers with electron-rich aromatic rings connected via an amide linkage to a carboxylic acid group as having low Fe/Hf values. The physical-chemical insight is acceptable, as electron-rich rings may decrease metal-binding efficiency, and the amide linkage could impact coordination. The rule is complex, considering multiple structural features, but is supported by only one data point (2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid), limiting its generality. Additional data would improve the rule's validity.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 identifies modifiers containing ether linkages, terminal amino groups, and carboxylic acid groups as tending to have high Fe/Hf values. The physical-chemical reasoning is solid, combining multiple coordinating sites that could enhance metal binding. While the rule is clear and appropriately complex, it is only supported by one data point (3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid), which limits its robustness. Increased coverage with more data points would strengthen the rule.

It demonstrates property insight by explaining how EWGs enhance acidity and Fe coordination. The rule's complexity is appropriate, considering the combination of aromatic rings, EWGs, and carboxylic acids. It is well-supported with at least two data points (4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid), providing good coverage.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is detailed yet clear, identifying modifiers with multiple ether linkages in an aliphatic chain ending with a carboxylic acid group, possibly with additional amino groups, as those that lead to a high Fe/Hf value. It shows strong property insight by acknowledging the coordination abilities of ether oxygens and amino groups. The rule demonstrates complexity by integrating multiple sub-structures. With at least two supporting data points (2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid), the rule has sufficient coverage.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 clearly identifies modifiers featuring a pyridine ring connected to a carboxylic acid group, either directly or via an aliphatic linker, as resulting in a high Fe/Hf value. It provides property insight into the coordinating ability of the nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring with Fe ions. The rule combines structural features of aromatic heterocycles and carboxylic acids, indicating appropriate complexity. It is supported by at least two data points (4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid), ensuring adequate coverage.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 specifies that amino acids with aromatic side chains, such as phenylalanine derivatives, tend to have a high Fe/Hf value. While the rule is clear and combines amino acid structures with aromatic side chains, the property insight could be expanded to explain how the aromatic side chain contributes to Fe coordination. The rule's complexity is acceptable. However, it is supported by only one data point ((2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid), indicating limited coverage. Additional data points would strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is straightforward and clear, indicating that simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups result in a low Fe/Hf value. The property insight is solid, recognizing that the absence of coordinating groups limits Fe binding. The rule is simple but effective, with sufficient coverage provided by at least two data points (octanoic acid, 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid). It balances simplicity and coverage well.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 clearly states that modifiers with an aromatic ring substituted with electron-donating groups (EDGs) like hydroxyl or amino groups, along with a carboxylic acid group, tend to have a low Fe/Hf value. It offers good property insight by explaining how EDGs decrease acidity and hinder Fe coordination. The rule combines multiple sub-structures, showing appropriate complexity. It has strong coverage with at least three supporting data points (4-aminobenzoic acid, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid).

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 identifies modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain or cyclic structure, without additional strong coordinating groups, as resulting in a low Fe/Hf value. The rule is clear and provides property insight into why hydroxyl groups alone may not enhance Fe coordination significantly. The complexity is appropriate. However, coverage is limited to one data point ((2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid). More data points are needed to strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 clearly specifies that modifiers containing nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly attached to a carboxylic acid group without an aliphatic linker tend to have a low Fe/Hf value. The property insight suggests that the lack of a linker may hinder coordination due to steric factors. The rule's complexity is suitable, combining heterocyclic structures with carboxylic acids. It has adequate coverage with two supporting data points (pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid).

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 states that modifiers with aliphatic chains terminated with both a hydroxyl group and a carboxylic acid group result in a high Fe/Hf value. The rule is clear and offers some property insight into how terminal functional groups may enhance Fe coordination. The complexity is appropriate. However, it is supported by only one data point (7-hydroxyheptanoic acid), indicating limited coverage.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 clearly identifies amino acids with additional coordinating side chain functional groups, such as sulfide or amide groups, as modifiers that lead to a high Fe/Hf value. It demonstrates solid property insight by recognizing the enhanced coordination from these functional groups. The rule combines multiple sub-structures, showing appropriate complexity. With at least two supporting data points ((2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid), the rule has adequate coverage.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 specifies that modifiers containing both amino groups and ether linkages in an aliphatic chain tend to have a high Fe/Hf value. The rule is clear and provides property insight into the coordinating abilities of amino and ether groups. The complexity is appropriate. Coverage is limited to one data point (3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid), which is also mentioned in Rule 4. Additional data points would enhance the rule's robustness.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 identifies modifiers featuring a conjugated ketone group adjacent to an aromatic ring and a carboxylic acid group as resulting in a high Fe/Hf value. The rule is clear but describes a specific structural motif. It offers property insight into how conjugation may enhance coordination. The rule shows appropriate complexity but is supported by only one data point (1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid), indicating limited coverage.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 clearly states that amino acids with an indole ring in the side chain tend to have a low Fe/Hf value. It provides some property insight, suggesting possible steric hindrance or lack of coordination ability from the indole ring. The rule's complexity is appropriate. However, coverage is limited to one data point ((2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid). More data points would strengthen the validity of the rule.

      - **Amino Groups (-NH₂)**: Nitrogen atoms donate electron density to Fe ions, enhancing coordination (Rules 1, 6, 12).

      - **Ether Linkages (-O-)**: Oxygen atoms can coordinate with Fe due to lone pairs (Rules 4 and 12).

      - **Pyridine Rings**: Nitrogen in the aromatic ring coordinates with Fe (Rules 5 and 11).

      - **Nitro Groups (-NO₂)**: Strong electron-withdrawing groups increase acidity, facilitating deprotonation and coordination (Rule 3).

    - **Impeding Fe Coordination:**

      - **Electron-Donating Groups (EDGs)**: Decrease acidity of the carboxylic group, reducing Fe coordination (Rule 8).

      - **Steric Hindrance**: Bulky groups near coordinating sites hinder coordination (Rule 15).

      - **Direct Attachment of Heterocycles without Linkers**: May not position coordinating atoms favorably (Rule 10).

  - **Chain Length and Flexibility:**

    - **Long Aliphatic Chains**: Increase flexibility, allowing better interaction with Fe ions (Rules 1 and 14).

    - **Aliphatic Linkers**: Provide spatial separation to position coordinating groups effectively (Rules 5 and 12).

- **Applicability of Rules:**

  - **High Fe/Hf Value Predictors**:

    - **Rules 1–6, 11–14** identify modifiers with functional groups that enhance Fe coordination.

    - **Key Factors**: Presence of multiple coordinating sites, flexible chains, electron-withdrawing substituents.

  - **Low Fe/Hf Value Predictors**:

    - **Rules 7–10, 15** identify modifiers lacking strong coordinating groups or containing features that impede Fe binding.

**Explanation and Considerations:**

- **Coordination Chemistry Principles:**

  - **Functional Groups that Enhance Fe Coordination:**
    - **Amino Groups (-NH₂)**: Nitrogen atoms can donate lone pairs to Fe³⁺ ions, enhancing coordination (Rules 1, 6, 13).
    - **Thiol Groups (-SH)**: Sulfur has a high affinity for transition metals, promoting strong coordination (Rule 2).
    - **Ether Linkages (-O-)**: Oxygen atoms with lone pairs can coordinate with Fe ions (Rule 4).
    - **Pyridine Rings**: Nitrogen in aromatic systems can participate in metal coordination (Rules 5, 11).
    - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups (EWGs)**: Such as **-NO₂**, increase the acidity of adjacent groups, facilitating deprotonation and coordination (Rule 3).

  - **Functional Groups that Impede Fe Coordination:**
    - **Electron-Donating Groups (EDGs)**: Such as **-OH** and **-NH₂** on aromatic rings can decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, reducing its ability to coordinate with Fe (Rule 8).
    - **Steric Hindrance**: Bulky groups near potential coordinating sites can physically block metal access (Rule 14).
    - **Multiple Hydroxyl Groups without Additional Coordinating Atoms**: May not effectively coordinate with Fe due to lack of strong binding sites (Rule 9).
    - **Direct Attachment of Heterocycles without Linkers**: May not optimally orient coordinating atoms toward Fe ions (Rule 10).

- **Chain Length and Flexibility:**

  - **Long Aliphatic Chains**: Provide flexibility, allowing coordinating groups to effectively interact with Fe ions (Rules 1, 12).
  - **Aliphatic Linkers**: Space out functional groups to reduce steric hindrance and enhance coordination (Rule 5).

- **Modifiers with Dual Functionalities:**

  - **Combinations of Coordinating Groups**: Presence of multiple types of coordinating atoms (e.g., N, S, O) can enhance coordination (Rule 13).

- **Exceptions and Refinements:**

  - **Rule 15**: While electron-deficient aromatic rings can enhance coordination, specific structural arrangements may negate this effect. For instance, in 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid, the keto group may participate in intramolecular hydrogen bonding, reducing availability for coordination.

---

**Conclusion:**

By analyzing the dataset and applying principles of coordination chemistry, these rules help predict whether a molecular modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value based on its structural features. Understanding the interactions between functional groups and Fe ions is crucial for designing modifiers that optimize catalyst performance in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

The generated rules balance coverage and specificity, aiming to encompass a broad range of modifiers while accounting for nuanced chemical behaviors. This approach facilitates the rational selection and design of modifiers to achieve desired catalytic outcomes.

  **Rule 12** asserts that modifiers with an **aliphatic chain** terminating with both a **hydroxyl group (-OH)** and a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**, with a chain length of **six or more carbons**, tend to result in a **high Fe/Hf value**. The rule is clear and involves the combination of chain length and functional groups, addressing complexity. The property insight recognizes that additional hydroxyl groups may enhance coordination with Fe ions. Coverage is limited to **one data point** (7-hydroxyheptanoic acid). More supporting data would improve the rule's robustness.

- **Comment 13**:

  **Rule 13** indicates that modifiers which are **amino acids** containing a **sulfur atom** within the side chain, such as **methionine derivatives**, tend to result in a **high Fe/Hf value**. The rule is clear and combines functional groups with specific elements, satisfying complexity. The property insight is strong, acknowledging sulfur's affinity for Fe ions. Coverage is limited to **one data point** (2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid). Additional examples would enhance confidence in the rule.

- **Comment 14**:

  **Rule 14** proposes that modifiers with **bulky aromatic groups** or **sterically hindered substituents** near coordinating sites tend to yield a **low Fe/Hf value**. The rule is clear and considers steric effects, addressing complexity. The property insight is reasonable, as steric hindrance can impede metal coordination. Coverage is inconsistent; while (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan) supports the rule with a **low Fe/Hf value**, 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid contradicts it with a **high Fe/Hf value**. This inconsistency suggests the rule may need refinement or that other factors influence the outcome.

- **Comment 15**:

  **Rule 15** suggests that modifiers containing **electron-deficient aromatic rings** connected to a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)** may enhance Fe coordination, resulting in a **high Fe/Hf value**. The rule lacks clarity due to contradictions. The example provided, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid, actually results in a **low Fe/Hf value**, opposing the rule. The property insight may be insufficient or overshadowed by other molecular factors. Coverage is poor, and the rule requires significant refinement to be reliable.

**Explanation and Considerations:**

- **Coordination Chemistry Principles:**

  - **Functional Groups that Enhance Fe Coordination:**

    - **Terminal Amino Groups (-NH₂)**: Nitrogen atoms can donate lone pairs to Fe³⁺ ions, enhancing coordination. Longer aliphatic chains offer flexibility, allowing the amino group to effectively interact with Fe ions (Rule 1).

    - **Thiol Groups (-SH)**: Sulfur has a high affinity for transition metals like Fe, promoting strong coordination. Both aromatic and aliphatic thiols can facilitate Fe binding (Rule 2).

    - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups (EWGs)**: Substituents like **-NO₂** and **-CH₂Br** increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid group, making it easier to deprotonate and coordinate with Fe ions (Rule 3).

    - **Pyridine Rings**: Nitrogen in pyridine can act as a Lewis base, donating electron density to Fe ions. An aliphatic linker provides flexibility for effective coordination (Rule 4).

    - **Multiple Ether Linkages with Donor Termini**: Ether oxygens can coordinate with Fe ions. Terminal donor groups like **-NH₂** or **-OCH₃** enhance this interaction, especially when combined with a carboxylic acid group (Rule 5).

    - **Hydrophobic Amino Acids with Aromatic or Sulfur-Containing Side Chains**: Side chains like phenyl or methylthio groups may enhance Fe coordination through hydrophobic interactions and additional coordination sites (Rule 6).

    - **Terminal Hydroxyl Groups on Long Aliphatic Chains**: Hydroxyl groups can coordinate with Fe ions, and longer chains provide flexibility for effective binding (Rule 11).

  - **Functional Groups that Impede Fe Coordination:**

    - **Electron-Donating Groups (EDGs)**: Substituents like **-OH** and **-NH₂** on aromatic rings can decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, reducing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions (Rule 8).

    - **Multiple Hydroxyl Groups**: While hydroxyl groups can coordinate with metals, too many may lead to intramolecular hydrogen bonding or solvation effects, reducing their availability for coordination (Rule 9).

    - **Bulky, Electron-Rich Heterocycles**: Bulky groups like indole rings can introduce steric hindrance, and electron-rich systems may not favor coordination with Fe³⁺ ions (Rule 10).

    - **Simple Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids without Additional Functional Groups**: Lack of strong coordinating groups beyond the carboxylic acid limits Fe binding. Fluorinated chains are hydrophobic and may not interact favorably with Fe ions (Rule 7).

- **Chain Length and Flexibility:**

  - **Longer Aliphatic Chains**: Chains of five or more carbons offer flexibility, allowing terminal functional groups to effectively coordinate with Fe ions (Rules 1 and 11).

  - **Aliphatic Linkers**: Aliphatic chains connecting functional groups can reduce steric hindrance and improve the orientation of coordinating atoms toward Fe ions (Rule 4).

- **Modifiers with Dual Functionalities:**

  - **Combinations of Coordinating Groups**: Modifiers that combine multiple functional groups capable of coordinating with Fe (e.g., amino, thiol, ether linkages) can enhance overall binding affinity (Rules 5 and 6).

- **Exceptions and Refinements:**

  - Some modifiers may not fit neatly into these rules due to additional factors like steric hindrance, intramolecular interactions, or competing functional groups.

  - For instance, modifiers with electron-deficient aromatic rings may not always result in high Fe/Hf values if other structural factors impede coordination.

---

**Conclusion:**

By analyzing the dataset and applying principles of coordination chemistry, these rules help predict whether a molecular modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value based on its structural features. The key factors influencing Fe coordination include the presence of strong donor atoms (e.g., nitrogen, sulfur, oxygen), the electronic nature of substituents (electron-withdrawing vs. electron-donating), chain length, and the flexibility of the molecule.

Understanding these interactions is crucial for designing modifiers that optimize catalyst performance in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. The generated rules strike a balance between coverage and specificity, encompassing a broad range of modifiers while accounting for nuanced chemical behaviors. This approach facilitates the rational selection and design of modifiers to achieve desired catalytic outcomes.

   - *Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid.

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **no additional functional groups** beyond the **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** tend to result in a **low Fe/Hf value**, as they lack additional sites for strong coordination with iron.

   - *Examples*: Octanoic acid, 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid.

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** substituted with **electron-donating groups (EDGs)** such as **hydroxyl (-OH)** or **amino (-NH₂)** groups, particularly at the **para position**, tend to result in a **low Fe/Hf value**. These groups can reduce the acidity of the carboxylic acid, diminishing coordination with iron.

   - *Examples*: 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, 4-methylbenzoic acid.

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers with an **aromatic ring** connected to an **aliphatic chain bearing a hydroxyl group (-OH)**, along with a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**, tend to result in a **low Fe/Hf value**. The hydroxyl group may engage in intramolecular hydrogen bonding, reducing its availability to coordinate with iron.

   - *Examples*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid.

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **amino acids** with **bulky side chains containing electron-rich heterocycles**, such as **indole rings**, tend to result in a **low Fe/Hf value**. The steric hindrance and electron-rich nature of these groups may impede effective coordination with iron.

    - *Example*: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers containing **multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH)** on an **aliphatic chain**, without other strong coordinating groups, tend to result in a **low Fe/Hf value**. The abundance of hydroxyl groups may lead to intramolecular hydrogen bonding, reducing their ability to coordinate with iron.

    - *Example*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with an **aldehyde group (-CHO)** at the **para or ortho position** tend to result in a **low Fe/Hf value**. The aldehyde group can engage in resonance with the aromatic ring, reducing the acidity and coordinating ability of the carboxylic acid.

    - *Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **electron-deficient aromatic heterocycles** (such as **pyridine or pyrazole rings**) where the **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)** is directly attached to the ring tend to result in a **low Fe/Hf value**. The nitrogen atom's lone pair is delocalized into the ring, making it less available for coordination.

    - *Examples*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid.

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers containing a **terminal hydroxyl group (-OH)** on an **aliphatic chain of seven or more carbons**, with a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)** at the other end, tend to result in a **high Fe/Hf value**. The hydroxyl and carboxyl groups can cooperatively coordinate with iron.

    - *Example*: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid.

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **cyclic anhydrides or lactones** derived from **aromatic carboxylic acids**, possessing additional **carbonyl groups**, tend to result in a **high Fe/Hf value**. The multiple carbonyl oxygens provide strong coordination sites for iron.

    - *Example*: 1,3-Dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid.

These rules have been generated by analyzing the provided dataset and considering the underlying physicochemical principles affecting Fe/Hf ratios. The rules aim to:

- Combine multiple substructures and functional groups to explain the observed Fe/Hf values.
- Emphasize functional groups known for strong metal coordination (e.g., amino, thiol, pyridine nitrogen, ether oxygens).
- Reflect the influence of electron-withdrawing and electron-donating substituents on metal coordination.
- Cover a broad range of the dataset while maintaining a balance between breadth and specificity.

### Highlights and Improvements:

- **Rule Refinement**: Rules have been refined to focus on the coordination chemistry of iron with the modifiers, emphasizing functional groups that can act as ligands.
  
- **Combination of Functional Groups**: The rules combine features like chain length, presence of specific functional groups, and their positions to provide a more comprehensive prediction.

- **Physicochemical Considerations**: The coordination ability of functional groups, the electronic influence of substituents, and steric factors have been considered to rationalize the Fe/Hf values.

- **Broad Coverage**: The rules have been designed to cover as many compounds in the dataset as possible while maintaining clarity and predictive power.

- **Simplification**: Overlapping or less impactful rules from the previous set have been consolidated or discarded to streamline the rule set.

### Application:

These rules can be used to predict whether a new modifier is likely to result in a high or low Fe/Hf value based on its structural features. When evaluating a new modifier:

1. Identify the key functional groups and structural motifs present.
2. Compare these features to the rules above.
3. Determine if the modifier fits within one or more rules predicting a high or low Fe/Hf value.
4. Use the rules to make an informed prediction about the modifier's effect on the Fe/Hf ratio.

**Note**: While these rules are based on the provided dataset, experimental validation is recommended for new modifiers to confirm their effect on the Fe/Hf ratio.
