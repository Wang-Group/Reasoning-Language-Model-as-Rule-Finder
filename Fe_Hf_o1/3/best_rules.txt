---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains result in a low Fe/Hf value.**

These rules collectively describe the relationship between specific functional groups or substructures in molecular modifiers and their effect on the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst. By considering combinations of functional groups and their chemical properties, these rules can predict whether a given modifier is likely to result in a high or low Fe/Hf value.---------------------------------------------------------------
