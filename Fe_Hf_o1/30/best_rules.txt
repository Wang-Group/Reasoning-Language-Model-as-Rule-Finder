**Notes and Justifications:**

- **Coordination Ability**:
  - Functional groups with lone pairs (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, thiol, pyridine nitrogen) enhance the ability of modifiers to coordinate with Fe ions.
  - Presence of multiple coordination sites increases the likelihood of Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

- **Electronic Effects**:
  - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups**:
    - Increase the acidity of the carboxyl group.
    - Enhance the ability of the carboxylate to coordinate with Fe ions (Rules 2, 3).
  - **Electron-Donating Groups**:
    - Decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group.
    - Reduce Fe coordination ability (Rule 7).

- **Sulfur-Containing Groups**:
  - Sulfur has a high affinity for transition metals like Fe.
  - Thiol and thioether groups contribute significantly to Fe coordination (Rule 3).

- **Steric Factors**:
  - Bulky substituents can hinder coordination due to steric hindrance.
  - Modifiers with less steric hindrance around coordinating sites are more effective (considered in Rule 1).

- **Ether Linkages**:
  - Oxygen atoms in ether linkages can act as coordination sites.
  - When combined with terminal amino or hydroxyl groups, coordination ability is enhanced (Rule 5).

- **Hydroxyl Groups**:
  - Multiple hydroxyl groups may engage in intramolecular hydrogen bonding.
  - This can reduce their availability for coordination with Fe ions (Rule 8).

- **Dataset Coverage**:
  - The rules collectively cover a broad range of modifiers in the dataset.
  - They prioritize combinations of functional groups, as recommended.
  - Balance is maintained between simple, high-coverage rules and more specific, lower-coverage rules.

**Conclusion:**

These rules establish a clear relationship between the structural features of molecular modifiers and the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst Hf-TPY-MOL(Fe). By considering combinations of functional groups and underlying physicochemical properties, the rules predict whether a modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value. This understanding aids in selecting and designing modifiers to optimize the catalyst's performance in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

**Recommendations for Modifier Design:**

- **To Achieve High Fe/Hf Value**:
  - **Incorporate Coordinating Groups**: Use modifiers with functional groups that can coordinate with Fe ions, such as amino groups, thiol groups, and pyridine rings.
  - **Electron-Withdrawing Substituents**: Incorporate strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halogens) to enhance the coordinating ability of the carboxylate group.
  - **Combine Functionalities**: Modifiers that combine multiple coordinating features (e.g., ether linkages with terminal amino groups) are particularly effective.

- **To Achieve Low Fe/Hf Value**:
  - **Avoid Coordinating Groups**: Use modifiers lacking additional coordinating functional groups besides the carboxylate.
  - **Electron-Donating Substituents**: Incorporate electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxyl) which decrease the coordinating ability.
  - **Steric Hindrance**: Introduce bulky substituents near potential coordination sites to hinder Fe binding.
  - **Multiple Hydroxyl Groups**: Utilize polyhydroxy acids that may reduce coordination due to intramolecular hydrogen bonding.

By applying these rules, researchers can better predict and manipulate the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst by selecting appropriate molecular modifiers, ultimately optimizing the yield of the desired remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.
