**Start of Rules**

---

**Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing both amino (**–NH₂**) and carboxyl (**–COOH**) groups, particularly in α-amino acids or amino acids with aliphatic side chains, result in a **High Fe/Hf** value (**True**)**.

- **Chemical Rationale**: The amino and carboxyl groups act as bidentate ligands, effectively chelating iron ions. This strong coordination enhances iron incorporation into the metal-organic layer (MOL), increasing the Fe/Hf ratio.

- **Examples**:
  - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (**True**)
  - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (**True**)
  - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (**True**)
  - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (**True**)
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (**True**)

---

**Rule 2**: **Modifiers containing sulfur-functional groups—such as thiol (**–SH**) or thioether (**–S–**) groups—especially when combined with carboxyl (**–COOH**) groups, result in a **High Fe/Hf** value (**True**)**.

- **Chemical Rationale**: Sulfur atoms have lone pairs that can form strong coordination bonds with transition metals like iron. The combination with carboxyl groups provides multiple coordination sites, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and promoting iron incorporation.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (**True**)
  - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (**True**)
  - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (**True**)

---

**Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (**EWGs**) attached to the aromatic ring—such as nitro (**–NO₂**), halogens (e.g., bromo), or pyridyl rings—result in a **High Fe/Hf** value (**True**)**.

- **Chemical Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group by stabilizing the negative charge upon deprotonation. This enhanced acidity facilitates deprotonation and strengthens coordination with iron ions through the carboxylate oxygen.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (**True**)
  - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (**True**)
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (**True**)
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** (**True**)

---

**Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing flexible polyether chains (ethylene glycol units) terminated with a coordinating group such as carboxyl (**–COOH**) or amino (**–NH₂**) result in a **High Fe/Hf** value (**True**)**.

- **Chemical Rationale**: The ether oxygen atoms can coordinate with iron ions, and the flexibility of the polyether chain allows for multiple coordination points. This multidentate binding enhances metal incorporation into the MOL.

- **Examples**:
  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (**True**)
  - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (**True**)

---

**Rule 5**: **Modifiers that combine multiple strong coordinating groups within the same molecule—such as amino (**–NH₂**), carboxyl (**–COOH**), amide (**–CONH–**), or hydroxyl (**–OH**) groups—result in a **High Fe/Hf** value (**True**)**.

- **Chemical Rationale**: Multiple coordinating sites enable chelation, forming more stable complexes with iron ions. This increases the likelihood of iron being incorporated into the MOL structure.

- **Examples**:
  - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (**True**)
  - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (**True**)
  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (**True**)
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (**True**)

---

**Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids lacking additional strong coordinating groups result in a **Low Fe/Hf** value (**False**)**.

- **Chemical Rationale**: Simple aliphatic carboxylic acids have limited coordination capacity due to the presence of only one carboxyl group without other coordinating functionalities. This results in less effective iron incorporation.

- **Examples**:
  - **Octanoic acid** (**False**)
  - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (**False**)

---

**Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (**EDGs**) attached to the aromatic ring—such as amino (**–NH₂**), hydroxyl (**–OH**), or methyl (**–CH₃**) groups—result in a **Low Fe/Hf** value (**False**)**.

- **Chemical Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group by destabilizing the negative charge upon deprotonation. This reduced acidity weakens coordination with iron ions, leading to lower Fe incorporation.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (**False**)
  - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (**False**)
  - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (**False**)
  - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (**False**)

---

**Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl (**–OH**) groups on aliphatic chains (polyols) result in a **Low Fe/Hf** value (**False**)**.

- **Chemical Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase hydrophilicity and can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds. This can hinder effective coordination with iron ions by occupying potential coordination sites or by stabilizing conformations that are less favorable for metal binding.

- **Examples**:
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (**False**)
  - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (**False**)

---

**Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing fluorinated alkyl chains or multiple fluorine atoms result in a **Low Fe/Hf** value (**False**)**.

- **Chemical Rationale**: Fluorine's high electronegativity withdraws electron density from nearby atoms, reducing the coordinating ability of functional groups like carboxylates. Additionally, fluorinated compounds may have decreased solubility or compatibility within the reaction medium.

- **Examples**:
  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (**False**)
  - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** (**False**)

---

**Rule 10**: **Modifiers with conjugated carbonyl groups adjacent to carboxyl groups—such as keto or aldehyde groups on aromatic rings—result in a **Low Fe/Hf** value (**False**)**.

- **Chemical Rationale**: Conjugation with carbonyl groups can delocalize the electron density of the carboxylate, reducing its ability to coordinate effectively with iron ions.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (**False**)
  - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (**False**)
  - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (**False**)

---

**Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group result in a **Low Fe/Hf** value (**False**), whereas if the heterocycle is connected via a spacer (e.g., methylene group), they result in a **High Fe/Hf** value (**True**)**.

- **Chemical Rationale**:
  - **Direct Attachment**: Nitrogen's lone pair participates in the aromatic system, reducing its availability for coordination with iron. Steric hindrance may also impede effective binding.
  - **With Spacer**: A spacer separates the heterocycle from the carboxyl group, reducing steric and electronic hindrance, allowing both the nitrogen and carboxylate to coordinate with iron ions.

- **Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf (False)**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (**False**)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (**False**)
  - **High Fe/Hf (True)**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** (**True**)
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (**True**)

---

**Rule 12**: **Modifiers with bulky aromatic side groups that may cause steric hindrance result in a **Low Fe/Hf** value (**False**)**, even if they contain coordinating groups.

- **Chemical Rationale**: Bulky groups can obstruct the approach of iron ions to the coordinating sites due to steric clashes, reducing the effectiveness of coordination and thus iron incorporation.

- **Examples**:
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (**False**)
  - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (**False**): The additional carboxylate may introduce steric or electronic factors that hinder coordination.
  - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (**True**): Exception due to the planar structure facilitating coordination.
