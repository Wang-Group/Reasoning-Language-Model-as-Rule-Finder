**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids**

  - **1a**: **Para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halogen, sulfanyl, pyridyl) result in a high Fe/Hf ratio** (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value == True`).

    - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid and enhance its ability to coordinate with metal centers, promoting higher Fe incorporation.

    - *Examples from dataset*:
      - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
      - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

  - **1b**: **Para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., amino, hydroxy, methyl, methoxy) result in a low Fe/Hf ratio** (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value == False`).

    - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, reducing coordination with metal centers and leading to lower Fe incorporation.

    - *Examples from dataset*:
      - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
      - **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

---

- **Rule 2**: **Nitrogen-Containing Functional Groups**

  - **2a**: **Molecules with amino groups located three or more carbons away from a carboxylic acid group result in a high Fe/Hf ratio**.

    - *Rationale*: The spatial separation allows the amino group to act independently as a coordination site, enhancing metal binding and Fe incorporation.

    - *Examples from dataset*:
      - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

  - **2b**: **Molecules with pyridine rings attached via alkyl or aryl linkers to carboxylic acid groups result in a high Fe/Hf ratio**.

    - *Rationale*: The pyridine nitrogen serves as a strong coordinating site when not sterically hindered by direct attachment to the carboxylic acid.

    - *Examples from dataset*:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**

  - **2c**: **Molecules with pyridine rings directly attached to carboxylic acid groups result in a low Fe/Hf ratio**.

    - *Rationale*: Direct attachment may cause steric hindrance or resonance stabilization that reduces the nitrogen's availability to coordinate with metals.

    - *Example from dataset*:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)

---

- **Rule 3**: **Thiol (-SH) Containing Molecules Result in a High Fe/Hf Ratio**

  - *Rationale*: Thiol groups have a high affinity for metal ions due to their lone pair of electrons on the sulfur atom, enhancing Fe binding to the catalyst.

  - *Examples from dataset*:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

---

- **Rule 4**: **Hydroxyl-Rich Molecules (Polyols) Result in a Low Fe/Hf Ratio**

  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups may engage in intramolecular hydrogen bonding or interactions with the solvent, decreasing their ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  - *Examples from dataset*:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**

---

- **Rule 5**: **Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids with Additional Functional Groups**

  - **5a**: **Molecules with ether linkages connected to terminal carboxylic acid groups result in a high Fe/Hf ratio**.

    - *Rationale*: Ether oxygens act as additional coordination sites, promoting higher Fe loading through chelation.

    - *Examples from dataset*:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

  - **5b**: **Molecules with terminal hydroxy groups on aliphatic chains result in a high Fe/Hf ratio**.

    - *Rationale*: Terminal hydroxyl groups can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing Fe incorporation.

    - *Example from dataset*:
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

  - **5c**: **Simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups result in a low Fe/Hf ratio**.

    - *Rationale*: Lack of functional groups for coordination leads to poor interaction with Fe ions.

    - *Examples from dataset*:
      - **Octanoic acid**
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

---

- **Rule 6**: **Aromatic Molecules with Carbonyl Groups Adjacent to the Ring Result in a Low Fe/Hf Ratio**

  - *Rationale*: Carbonyl groups attached to aromatic rings may participate in resonance, reducing their ability to coordinate with metal ions.

  - *Examples from dataset*:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 7**: **Perfluorinated Alkyl Chains Result in a Low Fe/Hf Ratio**

  - *Rationale*: Perfluorinated chains are highly electron-withdrawing but also very hydrophobic, which can inhibit effective coordination with metal ions.

  - *Example from dataset*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 8**: **Amino Acids with Aromatic Side Chains**

  - **8a**: **Amino acids with non-polar aromatic side chains (e.g., phenyl groups) result in a high Fe/Hf ratio**.

    - *Rationale*: Non-polar aromatic rings can facilitate π-π stacking and coordinate with metal centers.

    - *Example from dataset*:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

  - **8b**: **Amino acids with polar aromatic side chains (e.g., indole, hydroxyphenyl) result in a low Fe/Hf ratio**.

    - *Rationale*: Polar side chains may preferentially engage in hydrogen bonding or interactions with the solvent, reducing metal coordination.

    - *Examples from dataset*:
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 9**: **Molecules with Ether and Amino Functionalities**

  - *Rationale*: The combination of ether linkages and amino groups can create multiple coordination sites, resulting in a high Fe/Hf ratio.

  - *Examples from dataset*:
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

---

- **Rule 10**: **Molecules Lacking Strong Coordinating Groups Result in a Low Fe/Hf Ratio**

  - *Rationale*: Molecules without functional groups capable of strong metal coordination (e.g., simple aliphatic acids, molecules without donor atoms) show reduced Fe incorporation.

  - *Examples from dataset*:
    - **Octanoic acid**
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

**End of Rules**

---

**Summary and Justification**:

- The rules were refined to improve clarity and coverage while adhering to the stipulated requirements.
- Redundant or overlapping rules were combined to create a more cohesive set.
- Each rule focuses on specific functional groups and their impact on Fe/Hf ratios, grounded in physical-chemical principles.
- Examples from the dataset illustrate each rule, demonstrating their applicability.
- The rules balance simplicity and complexity, covering a broad range of modifiers in the dataset.

**Abandoned Rules and Rationale**:

- Some rules were merged or removed due to overlap or lack of distinct applicability. For instance, rules concerning hydroxyl groups and polar side chains were combined to streamline the set.
- Rules that were too narrow in scope or did not significantly contribute to predicting Fe/Hf ratios were omitted to maintain focus on the most impactful factors.
