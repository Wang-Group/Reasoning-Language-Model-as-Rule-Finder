**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Aliphatic Amino Acids with Medium-Length Chains Lead to a High Fe/Hf Ratio**

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers that are aliphatic amino acids with carbon chains ranging from 4 to 8 carbons, containing both amino (-NH₂) and carboxyl (-COOH) groups, will result in a **high Fe/Hf ratio**.

  - **Rationale**: The amino and carboxyl groups can act as bidentate ligands, effectively chelating iron ions and enhancing their incorporation into the catalyst. The medium chain length provides flexibility without significant steric hindrance.

  - **Examples from dataset**:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (True)
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (True)
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (True)

  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **Octanoic acid** (False) *[Lacks amino group]*
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (False) *[Additional carboxyl group may introduce coordination competition]*

---

- **Rule 2**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Strong Electron-Withdrawing Groups at the Para Position Result in a High Fe/Hf Ratio**

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) such as nitro (-NO₂), bromomethyl (-CH₂Br), or pyridyl rings at the para (4-) position will exhibit a **high Fe/Hf ratio**.

  - **Rationale**: EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxyl group and enhance its ability to coordinate with metal ions by stabilizing the negative charge on the carboxylate anion. This promotes stronger binding with iron ions.

  - **Examples from dataset**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (True)
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (True)
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (True)

  - **Counter-Examples**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (False) *[Methyl group is electron-donating]*
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (False) *[Amino group is electron-donating]*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers with Both Carboxyl and Thiol Groups Lead to a High Fe/Hf Ratio**

  - **Prediction**: Molecules containing both a carboxyl group (-COOH) and a thiol group (-SH) will result in a **high Fe/Hf ratio**.

  - **Rationale**: Thiol groups have a strong affinity for metal ions due to the soft base character of sulfur. The presence of both thiol and carboxyl groups provides multiple coordination sites, enhancing chelation with iron ions.

  - **Examples from dataset**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (True)
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (True)

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups Near the Carboxyl Group Result in a Low Fe/Hf Ratio**

  - **Prediction**: Molecules possessing two or more hydroxyl groups (-OH) in close proximity to the carboxyl group will have a **low Fe/Hf ratio**.

  - **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups may engage in intramolecular hydrogen bonding or form stable internal structures that inhibit coordination with metal ions. This reduces the availability of the carboxylate group for effective metal binding.

  - **Examples from dataset**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (False)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (False)

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with Ether Linkages and Terminal Carboxyl Groups Lead to a High Fe/Hf Ratio**

  - **Prediction**: Molecules featuring ether linkages (-O-) within the chain and terminating with a carboxyl group (-COOH) will result in a **high Fe/Hf ratio**.

  - **Rationale**: Ether oxygen atoms can act as additional coordination sites or increase the solubility and flexibility of the molecule, enhancing its ability to interact with iron ions. The flexibility of ether linkages allows better spatial alignment for coordination.

  - **Examples from dataset**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (True)
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (True)

---

- **Rule 6**: **Simple Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Without Additional Functional Groups Result in a Low Fe/Hf Ratio**

  - **Prediction**: Straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids lacking other metal-binding groups such as amino, thiol, or hydroxyl groups will exhibit a **low Fe/Hf ratio**.

  - **Rationale**: A single carboxyl group provides limited coordination capability. Without additional functional groups to aid in metal binding, the iron incorporation into the catalyst is reduced.

  - **Example from dataset**:
    - **Octanoic acid** (False)

---

- **Rule 7**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Electron-Donating Groups Lead to a Low Fe/Hf Ratio**

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) such as amino (-NH₂), methyl (-CH₃), or hydroxyl (-OH) groups at the para position will result in a **low Fe/Hf ratio**.

  - **Rationale**: EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing its ability to form strong coordination bonds with metal ions. This weakens metal-ligand interactions, leading to lower iron incorporation into the catalyst.

  - **Examples from dataset**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (False)
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (False)
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (False)
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (False)

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with Aldehyde Groups Adjacent to Carboxyl Groups Lead to a Low Fe/Hf Ratio**

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids possessing aldehyde groups (-CHO) on the ring will exhibit a **low Fe/Hf ratio**.

  - **Rationale**: Aldehyde groups can participate in competing reactions or reduce the electron density on the carboxylate group, decreasing its ability to coordinate with metal ions. This leads to weaker metal-ligand interactions.

  - **Examples from dataset**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (False)
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (False)

---

- **Rule 9**: **Amino Acids with Bulky Aromatic Side Chains May Result in a Low Fe/Hf Ratio**

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers that are amino acids with large aromatic side chains, such as indole rings, may result in a **low Fe/Hf ratio**.

  - **Rationale**: Bulky side chains introduce steric hindrance, potentially impeding effective coordination of the amino and carboxyl groups with metal ions. This reduces the incorporation of iron into the catalyst.

  - **Example from dataset**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (False)

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with Conjugated Carbonyl Systems Adjacent to Carboxyl Groups Lead to a High Fe/Hf Ratio**

  - **Prediction**: Molecules that have carboxyl groups conjugated with additional carbonyl groups (e.g., ketones, lactones) within an extended conjugated system will result in a **high Fe/Hf ratio**.

  - **Rationale**: Conjugation with carbonyl groups increases electron delocalization, stabilizing the negative charge on the carboxylate and enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal ions. This promotes stronger binding with iron ions.

  - **Examples from dataset**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (True)
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (True)

  - **Counter-Example**:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (False) *[Aliphatic chain without extended conjugation]*

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with Heavily Fluorinated Aliphatic Chains Result in a Low Fe/Hf Ratio**

  - **Prediction**: Molecules containing heavily fluorinated aliphatic chains near the carboxyl group will exhibit a **low Fe/Hf ratio**.

  - **Rationale**: Fluorine atoms are highly electronegative and can withdraw electron density from the carboxylate group, reducing its ability to coordinate with metal ions. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine diminishes metal-ligand interaction strength.

  - **Example from dataset**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (False)

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with Sulfur-Containing Amino Acids Lead to a High Fe/Hf Ratio**

  - **Prediction**: Amino acids containing sulfur atoms, such as methionine analogs or cysteine derivatives, will result in a **high Fe/Hf ratio**.

  - **Rationale**: Sulfur atoms provide additional coordination sites due to their ability to donate lone pairs to metal ions. This enhances the chelation effect with iron ions.

  - **Example from dataset**:
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (True)

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with Terminal Hydroxyl and Carboxyl Groups on Medium-Length Aliphatic Chains Lead to a High Fe/Hf Ratio**

  - **Prediction**: Aliphatic carboxylic acids with a chain length of 5 to 7 carbons, featuring a terminal hydroxyl group (-OH) and a terminal carboxyl group (-COOH) on opposite ends, will result in a **high Fe/Hf ratio**.

  - **Rationale**: The hydroxyl and carboxyl groups can act as bidentate ligands, providing multiple points of coordination with iron ions. The chain length allows adequate flexibility for effective chelation.

  - **Example from dataset**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (True)

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with Multiple Carboxyl Groups on Short Chains Result in a Low Fe/Hf Ratio**

  - **Prediction**: Molecules containing multiple carboxyl groups separated by short aliphatic chains (e.g., dicarboxylic acids with chains of 2 to 3 carbons) will exhibit a **low Fe/Hf ratio**.

  - **Rationale**: The proximity of multiple carboxyl groups may lead to repulsion between negatively charged carboxylates after deprotonation, reducing effective metal coordination.

  - **Example from dataset**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (False)

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with Nitrogen Heterocycles Adjacent to the Carboxyl Group Result in a Low Fe/Hf Ratio**

  - **Prediction**: Pyridinecarboxylic acids where the nitrogen atom is adjacent to the carboxyl group (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid) will have a **low Fe/Hf ratio**.

  - **Rationale**: The lone pair on the pyridine nitrogen adjacent to the carboxyl group can delocalize into the ring, decreasing the electron density available for coordination with metal ions. Additionally, steric hindrance may impede effective binding.

  - **Example from dataset**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (False)
