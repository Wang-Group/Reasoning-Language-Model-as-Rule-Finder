**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal primary amino group (-NH₂) or sulfhydryl group (-SH) tend to have a high Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = True`).**

  *Rationale*: Terminal amino and sulfhydryl groups act as strong coordinating sites for Fe(III), enhancing its incorporation into the catalyst.

  *Examples*:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

  *Counter-example*:
    - **Octanoic acid** (lacks terminal -NH₂ or -SH; `Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`)

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position, such as nitro (-NO₂), bromomethyl (-CH₂Br), or sulfhydryl (-SH), tend to have a high Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = True`).**

  *Rationale*: EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxyl group and enhance the molecule's ability to coordinate with Fe(III).

  *Examples*:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

  *Counter-examples*:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (electron-donating methyl group; `Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`)
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (electron-donating amino group; `Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`)

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing aromatic nitrogen heterocycles capable of coordinating with metals, especially when connected via flexible linkers to a carboxylic acid, tend to have a high Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = True`).**

  *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles like pyridine can coordinate with Fe(III), and flexible linkers allow optimal positioning for binding.

  *Examples*:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

  *Counter-example*:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (rigid attachment; `Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`)

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are carboxylic acids with flexible polyether chains (e.g., containing ethylene glycol units) and additional coordinating groups (e.g., amino groups) tend to have a high Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = True`).**

  *Rationale*: Ether oxygen atoms and amino groups can coordinate with Fe(III), and flexible chains enhance the interaction with the catalyst.

  *Examples*:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

  *Counter-example*:
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (polyol without amino groups; `Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`)

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with small to moderate-sized hydrophobic or aromatic side chains tend to have a high Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = True`), while those with bulky or highly polar side chains may have a low Fe/Hf value.**

  *Rationale*: The amino and carboxyl groups provide coordination sites, and suitable side chains facilitate effective interaction with Fe(III). Bulky or polar side chains may hinder coordination due to steric or electronic effects.

  *Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine)

  *Counter-examples*:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan; bulky indole ring; `Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid; additional carboxyl group; `Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`)

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position, such as amino (-NH₂), hydroxy (-OH), or methyl (-CH₃), tend to have a low Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`).**

  *Rationale*: EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group and reduce the molecule's ability to coordinate with Fe(III).

  *Examples*:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (polyhydroxy compounds), especially in aliphatic chains or side chains, tend to have a low Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`).**

  *Rationale*: Excessive hydroxylation increases hydrophilicity and steric hindrance, hindering effective coordination with Fe(III).

  *Examples*:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid)
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl chains tend to have a low Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`).**

  *Rationale*: Strong electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms reduce the coordinating ability of the carboxylate group with Fe(III), and the bulky perfluoroalkyl group may cause steric hindrance.

  *Example*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups tend to have a low Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`).**

  *Rationale*: Lack of extra coordination sites limits interaction with Fe(III).

  *Example*:
    - **Octanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing multiple electron-withdrawing groups within a conjugated system tend to have a high Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = True`).**

  *Rationale*: Multiple EWGs enhance the molecule's ability to coordinate with Fe(III) by increasing acidity and providing resonance-stabilized sites.

  *Example*:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with carbonyl groups (aldehyde or ketone) conjugated to the aromatic ring but not directly at the coordination site tend to have a low Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`).**

  *Rationale*: Carbonyl groups may compete with the carboxylate for coordination or reduce the overall coordination ability due to steric or electronic factors.

  *Examples*:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic hydroxy acids with a single hydroxyl group on a medium-length carbon chain tend to have a high Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = True`).**

  *Rationale*: The combination of a carboxyl group and a single hydroxyl group provides multiple coordination sites without excessive steric hindrance.

  *Example*:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

  *Counter-example*:
    - **Gluconic acid** (multiple hydroxyl groups; `Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`)

**End of Rules**

These rules illustrate how combinations of functional groups and structural features influence the Fe/Hf ratio by affecting the coordination of Fe(III) within the catalyst system. By considering underlying physical-chemical properties such as acidity, coordination sites, steric factors, and electronic effects, the rules provide predictive insights into the relationship between molecular modifiers and the Fe/Hf value.---------------------------------------------------------------
