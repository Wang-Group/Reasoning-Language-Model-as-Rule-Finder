**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal primary amino group (-NH₂) and without additional carboxyl groups** tend to have a high Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = True`).**

  *Rationale*: The terminal amino group provides a strong coordination site for Fe(III), enhancing metal binding. The absence of additional carboxyl groups prevents potential negative interference with coordination.

  *Examples* (high Fe/Hf value):
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (`True`)
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (`True`)
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (`True`)
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (`True`)

  *Counter-example* (low Fe/Hf value):
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (has an extra carboxyl group; `False`)

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers containing **sulfur functional groups** (-SH or thioethers) along with a carboxylic acid group tend to have a high Fe/Hf value (`True`).**

  *Rationale*: Sulfur atoms coordinate strongly with Fe(III) due to their lone pair electrons and polarizability, enhancing metal binding through soft base-hard acid interactions.

  *Examples* (high Fe/Hf value):
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (`True`)
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (`True`)
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (`True`)

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position** (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) tend to have a high Fe/Hf value (`True`).**

  *Rationale*: EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid group, promoting deprotonation and enhancing the carboxylate's ability to coordinate with Fe(III).

  *Examples* (high Fe/Hf value):
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (`True`)
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (`True`)

  *Counter-examples* (low Fe/Hf value):
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (aldehyde group is a moderate EWG; `False`)

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with **flexible polyether chains** terminating with coordinating groups (e.g., carboxyl or amino groups) tend to have a high Fe/Hf value (`True`).**

  *Rationale*: Ether oxygen atoms offer multiple coordination sites, and the flexibility of the chain allows for effective multidentate binding with Fe(III), enhancing coordination strength.

  *Examples* (high Fe/Hf value):
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (`True`)
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (`True`)

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups** tend to have a low Fe/Hf value (`False`).**

  *Rationale*: The lack of extra coordination sites limits the molecule's ability to bind effectively with Fe(III), resulting in lower metal incorporation.

  *Examples* (low Fe/Hf value):
    - **Octanoic acid** (`False`)
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (`False`)

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position** tend to have a low Fe/Hf value (`False`).**

  *Rationale*: EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid group, reducing the tendency of the carboxylate to coordinate with Fe(III).

  *Examples* (low Fe/Hf value):
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (`False`)
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (`False`)

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with phenolic hydroxyl groups** tend to have a low Fe/Hf value (`False`).**

  *Rationale*: Phenolic hydroxyl groups can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds with the carboxyl group, decreasing the availability of the carboxylate oxygen for Fe(III) coordination.

  *Examples* (low Fe/Hf value):
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (`False`)
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (`False`)
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (`False`)

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy aliphatic acids** (with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups) tend to have a low Fe/Hf value (`False`).**

  *Rationale*: Multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups increase hydrophilicity and introduce steric hindrance, which can interfere with effective coordination to Fe(III).

  *Examples* (low Fe/Hf value):
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (`False`)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (`False`)

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with pyridyl groups in positions favorable for coordination** tend to have a high Fe/Hf value (`True`).**

  *Rationale*: The pyridine nitrogen provides an additional coordination site for Fe(III), enhancing metal binding.

  *Examples* (high Fe/Hf value):
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (`True`)
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** (`True`)

  *Counter-example* (low Fe/Hf value):
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (pyridine nitrogen not favorably positioned; `False`)

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal hydroxyl group (-OH) and no additional hydroxyl or carboxyl groups** tend to have a high Fe/Hf value (`True`).**

  *Rationale*: The terminal hydroxyl group offers an additional coordination site, allowing for chelation with Fe(III) through both the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups.

  *Example* (high Fe/Hf value):
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (`True`)

  *Counter-example* (low Fe/Hf value):
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (multiple hydroxyl groups; `False`)

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids fused with oxygen-containing heterocycles** tend to have a high Fe/Hf value (`True`).**

  *Rationale*: Additional heteroatoms in the fused ring system provide more coordination sites, promoting stronger chelation with Fe(III).

  *Example* (high Fe/Hf value):
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (`True`)

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are **amino acids with hydrophobic side chains** tend to have a high Fe/Hf value (`True`), whereas those with polar or bulky aromatic side chains tend to have a low Fe/Hf value (`False`).**

  *Rationale*: Hydrophobic side chains do not interfere with metal coordination, while polar or bulky side chains can introduce steric hindrance or compete for coordination.

  *Examples*:
    - High Fe/Hf value:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (`True`)
    - Low Fe/Hf value:
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (`False`)

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing **perfluorinated chains** tend to have a low Fe/Hf value (`False`).**

  *Rationale*: The strong electron-withdrawing effect of perfluoroalkyl groups reduces the electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, diminishing its ability to coordinate with Fe(III).

  *Example* (low Fe/Hf value):
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (`False`)

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules describe how specific combinations of functional groups and structural features in the molecular modifiers influence the Fe/Hf ratio by affecting the coordination of Fe(III) within the catalyst system.

**Coverage and Balance**:

- **Coverage**: The rules encompass a broad range of modifiers in the dataset, focusing on common functional groups like amino groups, sulfur-containing groups, hydroxyl groups, ethers, electron-withdrawing and electron-donating substituents, and heterocyclic systems. This allows for the prediction of the Fe/Hf value for most modifiers based on their structural features.

- **Balance**: A suitable balance is maintained between simple rules with higher coverage (e.g., **Rule 5** on aliphatic acids without additional functional groups) and more complex rules with lower coverage (e.g., **Rule 11** on modifiers fused with oxygen-containing heterocycles). This balance facilitates general predictions while capturing specific cases where unique structural features significantly impact Fe(III) coordination.

**Applicability**:

- Each rule clearly predicts whether a modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value based on its structural description, making them useful for evaluating new modifiers in future research.

**Rationale**:

- The rules are grounded in fundamental principles of coordination chemistry and physical-organic chemistry. Functional groups known to coordinate effectively with Fe(III)—such as amino, sulfur-containing, hydroxyl, ether, and pyridine nitrogen groups—are associated with high Fe/Hf values. Electron-withdrawing and electron-donating effects influence the acidity and coordination ability of carboxylic acids, impacting Fe(III) binding. Steric factors and intramolecular interactions (like hydrogen bonding) are also considered, as they can hinder effective coordination.

By applying these rules, researchers can better understand how to design and select molecular modifiers to control the Fe/Hf ratio, ultimately optimizing the yield of the remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

**Note**: These rules have been refined to improve clarity and accuracy based on the dataset provided and underlying chemical principles. They aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of how different structural features influence Fe(III) coordination.---------------------------------------------------------------
