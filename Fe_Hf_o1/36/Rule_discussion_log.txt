Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: **Rule 6** and **Rule 12** have limited coverage, each supported by only one data point. According to the scoring criteria, rules should be supported by at least two data points to ensure reliability. Expanding the dataset or finding additional supporting examples would strengthen these rules.

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 10** also relies on a single supporting example. While the rule is clear and provides adequate property insight, the limited coverage makes it less robust. Incorporating more data points or re-evaluating the rule's scope could improve its validity.

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 13** lacks sufficient coverage with only one supporting example (**octanoic acid**). Additionally, the rule's generalization may be too broad without considering potential exceptions. Providing more examples or refining the rule to specify conditions would enhance its clarity and effectiveness.

- **Comment 4**: **Rule 14** is somewhat vague and overlaps with other rules, such as **Rule 11**. The criteria for "positions that do not enhance metal coordination" could be more explicitly defined. Improving the clarity of this rule and ensuring it is distinct from other rules would aid in accurate predictions.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 15** may have conflicting data. While it predicts a low Fe/Hf value for bulky hydrophobic aromatic side chains without coordinating functional groups, **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** is an exception with a high Fe/Hf value. This contradiction suggests the rule may need refinement to account for such cases or to specify additional conditions.

- **Comment 6**: Overall, while many of the rules are clear, provide substantial property insight, and balance complexity with coverage, the rules mentioned above require attention. Enhancing the coverage and clarity of these specific rules will strengthen the overall rule set and improve predictive accuracy for future modifiers.

**End of Rules**

---

**Summary**:

- The rules prioritize functional groups that enhance or hinder coordination with Fe ions based on electronic and steric factors.
- Sulfur-containing groups, terminal amino or hydroxyl groups, ether linkages, and electron-withdrawing substituents generally **increase** Fe coordination (**High Fe/Hf value**).
- Electron-donating groups, bulky hydrophobic groups without coordinating sites, perfluorinated chains, and polyhydroxylated structures generally **decrease** Fe coordination (**Low Fe/Hf value**).
- The rules are designed to cover a broad range of the dataset while balancing simplicity and specificity.

**Application**:

- These rules can be used to predict the Fe/Hf value for new modifiers:
  - **Predict High Fe/Hf (True)**: If the modifier contains sulfur groups, omega-amino acids, ether linkages, terminal hydroxyl groups, or electron-withdrawing groups on aromatic rings.
  - **Predict Low Fe/Hf (False)**: If the modifier contains electron-donating groups on aromatic rings, polyhydroxylated structures, perfluorinated chains, aldehyde groups, simple aliphatic chains without additional functional groups, or nitrogen heterocycles with lone pairs involved in aromaticity.

**Note**:

- While exceptions exist, these rules provide a framework based on observed trends in the dataset and fundamental chemical principles.
- It's important to consider the overall molecular structure and the interplay of different functional groups when applying these rules.

- **Comment 1**: **Rule 1** is clear and allows for straightforward prediction of high Fe/Hf values when modifiers contain both a carboxylic acid group and a sulfur-containing functional group (thiol or thioether). The rule is supported by multiple data points (e.g., examples 10, 18, 24), satisfying the coverage criterion. The physical-chemical insight regarding sulfur atoms acting as soft Lewis bases enhancing Fe coordination is sound. The rule effectively combines sub-structures, meeting the complexity criterion.

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 2** provides a clear guideline for predicting high Fe/Hf values with omega-amino acids possessing terminal amino groups distant from the carboxyl group. Supported by data points such as examples 3 and 32, it meets the coverage requirement. The explanation about terminal amino groups enhancing chelation is well-founded. The rule considers both functional groups and their positions, aligning with the complexity criterion.

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 3** clearly predicts high Fe/Hf values for modifiers with carboxylic acid groups and ether linkages. Supported by examples 11 and 33, it meets the coverage criterion. The physical-chemical insight about ether oxygens acting as coordination sites is appropriate. The rule incorporates combinations of functional groups, satisfying the complexity requirement.

- **Comment 4**: **Rule 4** effectively differentiates between modifiers with electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups on aromatic carboxylic acids. It is clear and supported by multiple data points for both high (e.g., examples 1, 12, 21) and low Fe/Hf values (e.g., examples 4, 7, 23). The explanation regarding the impact of substituents on acidity and coordination ability provides solid physical-chemical insight. The rule's consideration of electronic effects and functional groups meets the complexity criterion.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** predicts high Fe/Hf values for modifiers with long aliphatic chains terminating with hydroxyl groups and a carboxylic acid group. While the rule is clear and offers plausible physical-chemical insight about enhanced Fe binding through terminal hydroxyl groups, it is supported by only one data point (example 30), which limits its coverage. The rule does incorporate multiple functional groups, satisfying the complexity criterion, but additional supporting data would strengthen it.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** provides a clear distinction based on side-chain size in amino acids with aromatic rings. It is supported by examples 13 (phenylalanine, high Fe/Hf) and 15 (tryptophan, low Fe/Hf), meeting the coverage requirement. The physical-chemical insight about steric hindrance affecting Fe coordination is valid. The rule's focus on both functional groups and molecular size addresses the complexity criterion.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** states that simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups predict low Fe/Hf values. The rule is clear and aligns with the physical-chemical understanding that lack of coordinating sites reduces Fe binding efficiency. However, it is supported by a single data point (example 5), which limits its coverage. Incorporating additional examples would enhance the rule's robustness.

Nonetheless, it is supported by a single data point (example 9), indicating limited coverage. More examples are needed to strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** is clear in predicting low Fe/Hf values for modifiers with aromatic carboxylic acids bearing aldehyde groups. Supported by two data points (examples 19 and 20), it meets the coverage criterion. The physical-chemical insight about aldehyde groups reducing coordination ability is valid. The rule combines functional groups and reactive characteristics, satisfying the complexity criterion.

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** predicts low Fe/Hf values for modifiers with ketone or aldehyde groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid. The rule is clear, but with only one supporting example (example 28), coverage is limited. The physical-chemical reasoning is acceptable, but additional data would enhance the rule's credibility.

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13** effectively addresses modifiers with electron-donating oxygen-containing groups predicting low Fe/Hf values. It is clear and supported by at least two data points (examples 7 and 31), meeting the coverage requirement. The physical-chemical insight about decreased acidity and coordination ability due to electron-donating groups is appropriate. The rule considers both functional groups and electronic effects, aligning with the complexity criterion.

- **Comment 14**: **Rule 14** concerns modifiers capable of intramolecular hydrogen bonding predicting low Fe/Hf values. While the rule is clear and the explanation is sound, it is supported by only one data point (example 27), limiting its coverage. Incorporating more examples would improve the rule's strength.

- **Comment 15**: **Rule 15** predicts low Fe/Hf values for dicarboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups. It is clear and supported by data points (examples 0 and 28), satisfying the coverage criterion. The physical-chemical insight about limited coordination despite two carboxylate groups is valid. The rule considers the absence of additional functional groups, meeting the complexity criterion.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** is clear in identifying modifiers with both oxygen-donor and nitrogen-donor groups within flexible aliphatic chains, predicting a high Fe/Hf value. The physicochemical insight is solid, emphasizing enhanced chelation due to multiple donor atoms. The rule combines various functional groups, satisfying the complexity criterion. With two supporting examples—**2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**—it meets the minimum coverage requirement.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** is clear, stating that simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional donor groups predict a low Fe/Hf value. The physicochemical reasoning is appropriate, highlighting the limited coordination ability. However, the rule focuses on a single functional group, and the complexity is minimal. Supported by only one example—**octanoic acid**—the coverage is limited, suggesting the need for more data points to strengthen this rule.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** clearly identifies modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains attached to a carboxylic acid, predicting a low Fe/Hf value. The physicochemical explanation is sound, pointing out the electron-withdrawing effects of fluorine atoms. Complexity is adequate due to the combination of perfluorinated chains and carboxylic acid groups. Coverage is limited to one example—**2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**—indicating a need for additional supporting data.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** describes modifiers capable of forming chelate rings with Fe ions through adjacent carboxylate and amino groups, predicting a high Fe/Hf value. While the clarity is good, there is a noted contradiction with **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)** labeled as *False*, which challenges the rule's universality. The physicochemical reasoning is valid, but the contradiction implies that chain length and positioning may affect the outcome. Coverage includes two examples with conflicting results, indicating that the rule needs refinement.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** states that modifiers with bulky or sterically hindered aromatic side chains near coordinating groups predict a low Fe/Hf value. Clarity is adequate, but an exception with **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)** labeled as *True* contradicts the rule. The physicochemical explanation regarding steric hindrance is reasonable, but the inconsistency suggests that other factors may influence Fe coordination. Coverage includes two examples with opposing outcomes, indicating the rule requires refinement.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** is clear, focusing on amino acids with side chains capable of additional coordination (e.g., hydroxyl, sulfur-containing groups), predicting a high Fe/Hf value. The physicochemical insight is strong, and the rule combines multiple functional groups, meeting the complexity criterion. Supported by two examples—**(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** and **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid**—it meets the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** clearly states that modifiers with aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with ortho-hydroxyl groups predict a low Fe/Hf value. The physicochemical explanation is appropriate, highlighting intramolecular hydrogen bonding that reduces coordination ability. Complexity is sufficient. However, coverage is limited to one example—**5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**—and would benefit from additional supporting data.

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13** is clear and predicts that modifiers with flexible ether-containing chains and terminal carboxylic acid groups have a high Fe/Hf value. The physicochemical reasoning is solid, explaining how ether oxygens serve as additional coordination sites. The rule combines multiple functional groups, satisfying complexity. Supported by two examples—**2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**—it meets coverage criteria.

- **Comment 14**: **Rule 14** states that modifiers with conjugated ketone and carboxylic acid groups predict a low Fe/Hf value. While the clarity is acceptable, there is a contradiction with **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** labeled as *True*. The physicochemical reasoning is valid, but the inconsistency indicates that the rule may not fully account for all influencing factors. Coverage includes two examples with conflicting results, suggesting the rule needs further refinement.

- **Comment 15**: **Rule 15** provides a clear description, indicating that heterocyclic carboxylic acids without strong electron-withdrawing groups predict a low Fe/Hf value. The physicochemical insight is appropriate. The rule combines structural elements, satisfying complexity. Supported by two examples—**pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** and **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**—the coverage is adequate.

The physical-chemical insight is convincing, involving intramolecular hydrogen bonding and steric hindrance reducing coordination. However, the rule is supported by only one data point, and the counter example mentions a molecule with a single hydroxyl group predicting a high value, highlighting limited coverage. The balance between complexity and coverage is less ideal, and more supporting data would strengthen this rule.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 states that modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains predict a low Fe/Hf value, with the explanation involving electron-withdrawing effects and steric hindrance. While the rule is clear and provides adequate physical-chemical insight, it is only supported by one example in the dataset, limiting its coverage. The specificity of the rule reduces its applicability, suggesting that while it may be accurate, its overall contribution to predicting Fe/Hf values is limited without additional data points.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 identifies amino acids with coordinating side chains as predictors of high Fe/Hf values. The physical-chemical insight regarding enhanced coordination through side chains is well-explained. The rule is complex, considering both the amino acid backbone and the nature of the side chain, and is well-supported by multiple supporting examples and a counter example that illustrates steric hindrance limitations. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 suggests that modifiers capable of intramolecular hydrogen bonding reduce Fe/Hf values due to decreased availability of coordinating sites. While the rule is clear and provides property insight, it is only supported by one data point, limiting its coverage. The counter example indicates a possible exception, suggesting that the rule may not be universally applicable. The balance between complexity and coverage is less favorable due to limited supporting data.

These rules have been meticulously crafted to capture the relationships between specific combinations of functional groups in molecular modifiers and the resulting Fe/Hf ratios. By analyzing combinations of sub-structures and considering underlying physicochemical principles, the rules provide clear predictions for the Fe/Hf value associated with each modifier.

**Notes Addressing Requirements**:

- **Requirement 1**: Each rule illustrates direct combinations of functional groups (e.g., carboxylic acid with sulfur-containing groups, omega-amino groups in aliphatic chains) and their collective impact on Fe/Hf values.

- **Requirement 2**: The rules are grounded in physical-chemical properties such as coordination chemistry, electron-donating/withdrawing effects, chelation ability, and steric factors.

- **Requirement 3**: Each rule clearly predicts whether the Fe/Hf value is high (*True*) or low (*False*) for any SMILES structure fitting its description.

- **Requirement 4**: The rules cover a broad range of modifiers in the dataset, encompassing both high and low Fe/Hf values, and address various functional groups and molecular structures.

- **Requirement 5**: A total of **15 rules** have been generated, meeting the specified range.

- **Requirement 6**: A balance between simple rules with higher coverage (e.g., **Rule 6** on simple aliphatic carboxylic acids) and complex rules with lower coverage (e.g., **Rule 13** on modifiers with multiple ketone groups) has been maintained.

- **Requirement 7**: Ineffective or overlapping rules from previous analyses have been refined or combined to improve clarity and predictive accuracy.

**Conclusion**:

The generated rules provide a systematic framework for predicting the Fe/Hf value based on the structural features of molecular modifiers. By focusing on combinations of functional groups that influence iron coordination, these rules can assist researchers in designing or selecting modifiers that enhance iron incorporation into the catalyst.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: *Rule 1* is clear and allows for straightforward determination of whether a modifier fits the criteria. The rule provides strong physicochemical insight by explaining how both carboxylic acid and thiol groups enhance chelation with iron ions. It considers a combination of substructures, specifically requiring both functional groups. The rule is well-supported by two data points (**3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** and **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**) with no counter-examples, satisfying the coverage criterion. Overall, this rule balances complexity and coverage effectively.

- **Comment 2**: *Rule 2* is clearly defined, focusing on omega-amino aliphatic carboxylic acids with the amino group at the terminal position opposite the carboxylic acid. The physicochemical insight is solid, explaining the formation of stable chelate rings due to bidentate coordination. The rule considers specific structural positioning, adding necessary complexity. It is supported by two data points (**5-aminopentanoic acid** and **7-aminoheptanoic acid**) and one counter-example (**(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid**), providing adequate coverage and illustrating the rule's applicability.

- **Comment 3**: *Rule 3* is clear in its definition of modifiers—aromatic carboxylic acids substituted at the para position with electron-withdrawing groups capable of coordinating to iron. The explanation offers good physicochemical insight into how electron-withdrawing groups enhance carboxylate coordination. The rule considers combinations of substructures and is supported by three examples (**4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**, and **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**) with relevant counter-examples (**4-methylbenzoic acid** and **4-aminobenzoic acid**). This provides strong coverage and demonstrates a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 4**: *Rule 4* is clear and straightforward, identifying modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para electron-donating groups predicting a low Fe/Hf value. The rule has sound physicochemical insight, explaining how electron-donating groups reduce acidity and coordination ability. It is simple yet effective, covering three supporting examples with no counter-examples. The rule strikes a good balance between simplicity and sufficient coverage.

- **Comment 5**: *Rule 5* lacks some clarity due to inconsistencies between the rule and the supporting examples. The rule mentions amino acids with side chains containing additional amino groups, but **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) does not have an additional amino group in its side chain. This discrepancy weakens the physicochemical insight. While it considers combinations of substructures, the coverage is limited with only two supporting examples and a counter-example. The rule's clarity and coverage could be improved to meet the criteria better.

- **Comment 6**: *Rule 6* is clear in defining modifiers with flexible aliphatic chains, multiple ether linkages, and a terminal carboxylic acid group. The physicochemical insight is strong, explaining how ether oxygens and chain flexibility enhance coordination. The rule combines multiple substructures and is supported by two examples (**2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**) with one counter-example, satisfying the coverage criterion and maintaining a good balance.

- **Comment 7**: *Rule 7* is clear, identifying aromatic carboxylic acids with ortho-hydroxyl or ortho-carbonyl groups predicting a low Fe/Hf value. The physicochemical explanation regarding intramolecular hydrogen bonding is sound. The rule considers specific structural features and is supported by two data points with one counter-example, providing adequate coverage and complexity.

- **Comment 8**: *Rule 8* is clear and easy to apply, focusing on simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups predicting a low Fe/Hf value. The physicochemical insight is acceptable, and while the rule is simple, it is supported by two examples and one counter-example. The balance between simplicity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 9**: *Rule 9* suffers from limited coverage, with only one supporting example (**2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**) and no counter-examples. While the rule is clear and the physicochemical rationale is acceptable, the minimal data support weakens the rule according to the criteria. Additional data points are needed to strengthen its validity.

- **Comment 10**: *Rule 10* has limited clarity due to the reliance on specific side chains containing multiple methoxy groups. The physicochemical insight is plausible, but the rule is supported by only one example (**4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**) and one counter-example. The coverage is insufficient to fully validate the rule, and more data points are needed to enhance its reliability.

- **Comment 11**: *Rule 11* is clear in its definition but has limited coverage, with only one supporting example (**(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid**) and one counter-example (**(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid**). The physicochemical insight regarding steric hindrance is reasonable. However, the rule's coverage is insufficient, and additional data points are necessary to confirm its applicability.

- **Comment 12**: *Rule 12* is reasonably clear, specifying modifiers with an aliphatic chain containing a terminal hydroxyl and a carboxylic acid group, predicting a high Fe/Hf value if there is minimal steric hindrance. The physicochemical explanation is acceptable. However, the rule has limited coverage with only one supporting example and one counter-example, which reduces its robustness.

- **Comment 13**: *Rule 13* is clear and provides good physicochemical insight into how the position of the carboxyl group on pyridine affects coordination. It considers specific structural arrangements and is supported by three examples (**pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**, and **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**), offering adequate coverage and satisfying the criteria.

- **Comment 14**: *Rule 14* has limited coverage with only one supporting example (**(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**) and no counter-examples. While the rule is clear and provides acceptable physicochemical insight, the minimal data support weakens its strength according to the coverage criterion. Additional examples would improve the rule's validity.

- **Comment 15**: *Rule 15* is clear and provides reasonable physicochemical insight into why ketone groups are less effective at coordinating iron ions. It considers combinations of functional groups and is supported by two examples with one counter-example. The rule offers a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Explanation**: The hydroxyl and carboxylate groups can act as bidentate ligands, enhancing coordination with iron ions. Chain flexibility aids in effective chelation.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** – *True*

- **Counter Examples**:
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** – *False* (Multiple hydroxyl groups increase steric hindrance and intramolecular hydrogen bonding)

---

**Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with side chains that may hinder coordination through steric or electronic effects predict a low Fe/Hf value (*False*).**

- **Explanation**: Side chains that interfere with the alignment of donor atoms reduce the ability to coordinate effectively with iron ions.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** – *False*
  - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** – *False*

- **Counter Examples**:
  - None observed in the dataset.

**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: **Rule 1** demonstrates excellent clarity by specifying that ω-amino acids with terminal amino and carboxylic acid groups predict a high Fe/Hf value. The structural description is precise, allowing for clear determination of the target value. The chemical rationale is sound, highlighting the formation of stable chelate rings with iron ions. This rule considers the combination of functional groups (amino and carboxyl groups) and is supported by multiple examples and a counterexample, fulfilling the coverage criterion. Overall, it scores highly across all criteria.

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 2** is clear and well-defined, focusing on aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position predicting a high Fe/Hf value. The chemical insight is robust, explaining how increased acidity enhances iron coordination. It effectively combines structural features (aromatic ring, electron-withdrawing substituents) and is supported by sufficient examples and counterexamples, demonstrating good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 3** provides a clear structural description by identifying aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position as predicting a low Fe/Hf value. The chemical rationale is appropriate, explaining the decreased acidity and weakened coordination ability. It considers combinations of substructures and is supported by multiple examples and a relevant counterexample, meeting the criteria for coverage and complexity.

- **Comment 4**: **Rule 4** is concise and clear, stating that modifiers with both carboxylic acid and thiol groups predict a high Fe/Hf value. The chemical insight is strong, emphasizing the coordinating strength of thiol groups. It effectively combines functional groups and is supported by examples, though the lack of counterexamples suggests limited data. Despite this, the rule meets the criteria for clarity, property insight, and complexity.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** clearly outlines that modifiers with pyridine rings acting as ligands predict a high Fe/Hf value. The rationale is solid, based on the coordination ability of the pyridine nitrogen. It considers the combination of pyridine rings with carboxylate groups and includes sufficient examples and a counterexample that illustrates the importance of ligand geometry, fulfilling the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** is clear in identifying amino acids with side chains containing additional coordinating groups as predicting a high Fe/Hf value. The chemical insight is well-explained, focusing on enhanced chelation through multiple binding sites. It combines multiple substructures and is supported by several examples and a counterexample, satisfying the criteria for complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** effectively describes modifiers with flexible aliphatic chains containing ether groups and a terminal carboxylic acid predicting a high Fe/Hf value. The rule is clear, and the chemical rationale is appropriate, highlighting the role of ether oxygen atoms in coordination. It combines structural features and is supported by examples and a well-explained counterexample, meeting the criteria for clarity, complexity, and coverage.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** is straightforward and clear, stating that simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups predict a low Fe/Hf value. The rationale is logical, considering the lack of donor sites for coordination. It is supported by examples and a counterexample that underscores the effect of additional functional groups, fulfilling the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** clearly indicates that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups and a carboxylic acid predict a low Fe/Hf value. The chemical insight is valid, explaining how intramolecular hydrogen bonds reduce coordination ability. While it lacks counterexamples, it is supported by multiple examples, meeting the criteria for clarity and property insight.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** provides a clear structural description by focusing on aromatic carboxylic acids with ortho-hydroxyl or ortho-carbonyl groups predicting a low Fe/Hf value. The rationale about intramolecular interactions affecting coordination is sound. It combines specific structural features and includes examples and a counterexample with a reasonable explanation, satisfying the criteria for complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** is clear in stating that modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains attached to a carboxylic acid predict a low Fe/Hf value. The chemical reasoning is appropriate, considering electron withdrawal by fluorine atoms. However, the rule is supported by only one example and lacks counterexamples, indicating limited coverage. This suggests a need for more data to strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** specifies that modifiers with aromatic rings and methoxy substituents predict a high Fe/Hf value. The rationale is convincing, focusing on electron donation enhancing coordination. While the rule is clear and combines structural features, it is supported by only one example and a counterexample, indicating limited coverage. Additional data would enhance the robustness of this rule.

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13** clearly states that amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains predict a low Fe/Hf value due to steric hindrance. The chemical insight is valid, but the rule is supported by one example and one counterexample, showing minimal coverage. Expanding the dataset to include more relevant compounds would improve the rule's credibility.

- **Comment 14**: **Rule 14** is clear, indicating that modifiers with aliphatic chains containing a hydroxyl group and a carboxylic acid predict a high Fe/Hf value, provided there is minimal steric hindrance. The rationale is appropriate, considering bidentate coordination. Supported by an example and a counterexample explained by steric effects, the rule meets the criteria but would benefit from more examples to strengthen coverage.

- **Comment 15**: **Rule 15** effectively describes that modifiers which are aromatic carboxylic acids with side chains that hinder coordination predict a low Fe/Hf value. The rule is clear, and the chemical reasoning is logical. It considers combinations of substructures and is supported by examples without counterexamples, satisfying the criteria for clarity, complexity, and coverage.
