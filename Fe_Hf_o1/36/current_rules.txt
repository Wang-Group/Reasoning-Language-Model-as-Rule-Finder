**Start of Rules**

---

**Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are ω-amino acids (aliphatic chains with terminal amino and carboxylic acid groups) predict a high Fe/Hf value (*True*).**

- **Explanation**: The terminal amino and carboxyl groups can chelate iron ions by forming stable five- or six-membered rings, enhancing iron incorporation into the catalyst.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **5-aminopentanoic acid** – *True*
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** – *True*
  - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** – *True*

- **Counter Examples**:
  - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** – *False* (Amino group is at the α-position, reducing chelation efficiency)

---

**Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted at the para position with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) predict a high Fe/Hf value (*True*).**

- **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid and enhance the ability of the carboxylate anion to coordinate with iron ions.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** – *True*
  - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** – *True*

- **Counter Examples**:
  - **4-methylbenzoic acid** – *False* (Methyl group is electron-donating)
  - **4-aminobenzoic acid** – *False* (Amino group is electron-donating)

---

**Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted at the para position with electron-donating groups (e.g., amino, methyl, hydroxy) predict a low Fe/Hf value (*False*).**

- **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, weakening its ability to coordinate with iron ions and reducing iron incorporation.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **4-aminobenzoic acid** – *False*
  - **4-methylbenzoic acid** – *False*
  - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** – *False*

---

**Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing both a carboxylic acid group and a thiol group (–SH) predict a high Fe/Hf value (*True*).**

- **Explanation**: Thiol groups are strong coordinating ligands for iron ions. The combination of thiol and carboxylate groups enhances chelation, leading to increased iron incorporation.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** – *True*
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** – *True*

- **Counter Examples**:
  - None observed in the dataset.

---

**Rule 5**: **Modifiers with pyridine rings that can act as ligands predict a high Fe/Hf value (*True*).**

- **Explanation**: The lone pair on the pyridine nitrogen can coordinate with iron ions. When combined with a carboxylate group, the modifier acts as a bidentate ligand, enhancing iron binding.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** – *True*
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** – *True*

- **Counter Examples**:
  - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** – *False* (Carboxyl group position affects chelation geometry)

---

**Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing additional coordinating groups (e.g., amino, thiol, methoxy) predict a high Fe/Hf value (*True*).**

- **Explanation**: Side chains with extra coordinating groups provide multiple binding sites for iron ions, enhancing chelation and iron incorporation.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid) – *True*
  - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Lysine derivative) – *True*
  - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (Methionine derivative) – *True*

- **Counter Examples**:
  - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid) – *False* (Side chain geometry affects coordination)

---

**Rule 7**: **Modifiers with flexible aliphatic chains containing ether groups and a terminal carboxylic acid predict a high Fe/Hf value (*True*).**

- **Explanation**: Ether oxygen atoms can coordinate with iron ions, and the flexibility of the chain allows for optimal alignment of donor atoms, enhancing chelation.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** – *True*
  - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** – *True*

- **Counter Examples**:
  - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]-2-oxoacetic acid** – *False* (Steric hindrance from multiple hydroxyl groups reduces coordination)

---

**Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups predict a low Fe/Hf value (*False*).**

- **Explanation**: The absence of extra donor sites limits the ability of the modifier to coordinate effectively with iron ions, resulting in lower iron incorporation.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Octanoic acid** – *False*
  - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** – *False*

- **Counter Examples**:
  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** – *True* (Hydroxyl group provides an additional coordination site)

---

**Rule 9**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups and a carboxylic acid predict a low Fe/Hf value (*False*).**

- **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds, reducing the availability of donor atoms for coordination with iron ions and decreasing iron incorporation.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** – *False*
  - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]-2-oxoacetic acid** – *False*

- **Counter Examples**:
  - None observed in the dataset.

---

**Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with ortho-hydroxyl or ortho-carbonyl groups predict a low Fe/Hf value (*False*).**

- **Explanation**: Ortho substituents can engage in intramolecular hydrogen bonding or resonance stabilization, reducing the ability of donor atoms to coordinate with iron ions.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** – *False*
  - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** – *False*

- **Counter Examples**:
  - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** – *True* (Rigid structure may facilitate coordination)

---

**Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing perfluorinated alkyl chains attached to a carboxylic acid predict a low Fe/Hf value (*False*).**

- **Explanation**: Highly electronegative fluorine atoms withdraw electron density from the carboxylate group, weakening its ability to coordinate with iron ions.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** – *False*

- **Counter Examples**:
  - None observed in the dataset.

---

**Rule 12**: **Modifiers with aromatic rings and methoxy substituents predict a high Fe/Hf value (*True*).**

- **Explanation**: Methoxy groups donate electron density through resonance, enhancing coordination ability with iron ions via the aromatic system.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** – *True*

- **Counter Examples**:
  - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** – *False* (Hydroxyl group may not enhance coordination as effectively due to hydrogen bonding)

---

**Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains (e.g., indole from tryptophan) predict a low Fe/Hf value (*False*).**

- **Explanation**: Bulky side chains introduce steric hindrance, limiting the ability of the amino acid to coordinate with iron ions effectively.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan) – *False*

- **Counter Examples**:

---

**Rule 14**: **Modifiers with aliphatic chains containing a hydroxyl group and a carboxylic acid predict a high Fe/Hf value (*True*), provided there is minimal steric hindrance.**

- **Explanation**: The hydroxyl and carboxylate groups can act as bidentate ligands, enhancing coordination with iron ions. Chain flexibility aids in effective chelation.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** – *True*

- **Counter Examples**:
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** – *False* (Multiple hydroxyl groups increase steric hindrance and intramolecular hydrogen bonding)

---

**Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with side chains that may hinder coordination through steric or electronic effects predict a low Fe/Hf value (*False*).**

- **Explanation**: Side chains that interfere with the alignment of donor atoms reduce the ability to coordinate effectively with iron ions.
