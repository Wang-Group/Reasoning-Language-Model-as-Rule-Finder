**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing both a carboxylic acid group and a thiol group (–SH) result in a high Fe/Hf value.**

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers that possess both a carboxylic acid group and a thiol functional group will have a **high Fe/Hf** value.
  - **Rationale**: Thiol groups are strong ligands for Fe ions due to the soft Lewis base character of sulfur, enhancing Fe coordination. The carboxylic acid group anchors the modifier to the Hf-TPY-MOL framework.
  - **Examples**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Entry 9) – High Fe/Hf
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 17) – High Fe/Hf

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers with flexible aliphatic chains containing a primary amino group (–NH₂) and a carboxylic acid group result in a high Fe/Hf value.**

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers featuring aliphatic chains with both a primary amino group and a carboxylic acid group will have a **high Fe/Hf** value.
  - **Rationale**: The primary amino group acts as a strong ligand for Fe ions, and the flexibility of the aliphatic chain allows effective coordination without steric hindrance.
  - **Examples**:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Entry 31) – High Fe/Hf
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Entry 34) – High Fe/Hf
  - **Counter-Example**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid, Entry 0) – Low Fe/Hf (Additional carboxylate group may chelate Hf centers or compete with Fe coordination.)

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles connected via a linker to a carboxylic acid group result in a high Fe/Hf value.**

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers with nitrogen-containing heterocycles (e.g., pyridine rings) connected through a spacer (alkyl chain or phenyl ring) to a carboxylic acid will have a **high Fe/Hf** value.
  - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles serve as good Lewis bases and coordinate effectively with Fe ions. The linker reduces steric hindrance, facilitating coordination.
  - **Examples**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 11) – High Fe/Hf
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** (Entry 24) – High Fe/Hf
  - **Counter-Example**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid, Entry 21) – Low Fe/Hf (Direct attachment without a linker may hinder effective coordination due to steric constraints.)

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups on aromatic rings adjacent to carboxylic acids result in a high Fe/Hf value.**

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers possessing strong electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., nitro, halogens) on aromatic rings bearing carboxylic acid groups will have a **high Fe/Hf** value.
  - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid and enhance the ability of the aromatic ring to participate in coordination by stabilizing the Fe ion.
  - **Examples**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Entry 20) – High Fe/Hf
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Entry 1) – High Fe/Hf
  - **Counter-Example**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19) – Low Fe/Hf (The aldehyde group is a moderate electron-withdrawing group but may not sufficiently enhance Fe coordination.)

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with polyether chains and terminal coordinating groups result in a high Fe/Hf value.**

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers with polyether chains (–(OCH₂CH₂)_n–) and terminal functional groups capable of coordinating with Fe ions (e.g., amino or carboxylic acid groups) will have a **high Fe/Hf** value.
  - **Rationale**: Ether oxygen atoms provide additional coordination sites, and the flexible chain allows effective spatial accommodation for Fe coordination.
  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 10) – High Fe/Hf
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32) – High Fe/Hf

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with simple aromatic side chains result in a high Fe/Hf value.**

  - **Prediction**: Amino acids containing simple aromatic side chains (e.g., phenyl group) without substantial steric bulk will have a **high Fe/Hf** value.
  - **Rationale**: The amino group and the aromatic ring offer multiple coordination sites for Fe ions. Minimal steric hindrance facilitates effective interaction.
  - **Example**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine, Entry 12) – High Fe/Hf
  - **Counter-Example**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan, Entry 14) – Low Fe/Hf (Bulky indole ring may impede coordination due to steric hindrance.)

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers lacking strong Fe-coordinating groups other than the carboxylic acid result in a low Fe/Hf value.**

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers that have only a carboxylic acid group without other strong coordinating groups (e.g., amino, thiol, nitrogen heterocycles) will have a **low Fe/Hf** value.
  - **Rationale**: Limited coordination sites reduce the ability to incorporate Fe ions into the catalyst, leading to lower Fe/Hf ratios.
  - **Examples**:
    - **Octanoic acid** (Entry 4) – Low Fe/Hf
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 22) – Low Fe/Hf
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30) – Low Fe/Hf

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with electron-donating groups on aromatic rings directly attached to carboxylic acids result in a low Fe/Hf value.**

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers featuring electron-donating substituents (e.g., hydroxyl, amino, methoxy) on benzene rings directly connected to carboxylic acid groups will have a **low Fe/Hf** value.
  - **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid and reduce the ability of the aromatic ring to coordinate with Fe ions, diminishing Fe incorporation.
  - **Examples**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Entry 3) – Low Fe/Hf
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Entry 6) – Low Fe/Hf
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid, Entry 8) – Low Fe/Hf

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups (polyols) and a carboxylic acid group result in a low Fe/Hf value.**

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups along with a carboxylic acid will have a **low Fe/Hf** value.
  - **Rationale**: Hydroxyl groups may preferentially chelate Hf centers or interfere with Fe coordination, reducing Fe incorporation.
  - **Examples**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid, Entry 8) – Low Fe/Hf
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]-2-oxoacetic acid** (Entry 5) – Low Fe/Hf

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains and a carboxylic acid group result in a low Fe/Hf value.**

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains will have a **low Fe/Hf** value.
  - **Rationale**: Fluorination increases steric bulk and decreases electron density, hindering coordination with Fe ions.
  - **Examples**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Entry 13) – Low Fe/Hf
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** (Entry 28) – Low Fe/Hf

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing sulfur-containing groups in aliphatic chains and a carboxylic acid result in a high Fe/Hf value.**

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers that have sulfur-containing functional groups (e.g., thioethers) attached to aliphatic chains along with a carboxylic acid will have a **high Fe/Hf** value.
  - **Rationale**: Sulfur atoms act as strong Lewis bases and coordinate well with Fe ions, enhancing Fe incorporation.
  - **Example**:
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (Entry 23) – High Fe/Hf

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with long aliphatic chains containing both amino and amide groups result in a high Fe/Hf value.**

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers with long aliphatic chains bearing both amino and amide functionalities will have a **high Fe/Hf** value due to multiple coordination sites.
  - **Rationale**: The combination of amino and amide groups increases the overall coordination capacity with Fe ions.
  - **Example**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 33) – High Fe/Hf

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with bulky or sterically hindered groups may result in inconsistent Fe/Hf values and require case-by-case analysis.**

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers with large steric bulk or rigid structures may have variable Fe/Hf values, and the effect of steric hindrance on Fe coordination should be considered individually.
  - **Rationale**: Steric hindrance can inhibit effective coordination, but other factors such as strong coordinating groups may counteract steric effects.
  - **Examples**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan, Entry 14) – Low Fe/Hf (Bulky indole group may hinder coordination)
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Entry 16) – High Fe/Hf (Despite rigid structure, may coordinate Fe effectively)

**End of Rules**

---

These rules are designed to predict whether a given molecular modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value based on its structural features, considering underlying physical and chemical principles:

- **Coordination Ability**: Presence of strong Fe-coordinating groups such as thiols, primary amines, nitrogen-containing heterocycles, and sulfur-containing functional groups enhances Fe incorporation.

- **Steric Factors**: Bulky groups or lack of flexibility can hinder coordination with Fe ions, but the effect may vary depending on other functional groups present.

- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups enhance coordination potential by increasing acidity and stabilizing coordination sites, while electron-donating groups may reduce it.

- **Functional Group Synergy**: The combination of certain functional groups (e.g., amino and amide groups) can have a synergistic effect on Fe coordination.

- **Chain Flexibility**: Flexible aliphatic chains enable optimal spatial arrangement for coordination without steric clashes.

By applying these rules, one can predict the Fe/Hf outcome for new modifiers based on their structural characteristics, aiding in the selection or design of modifiers that optimize the catalyst's performance in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------
