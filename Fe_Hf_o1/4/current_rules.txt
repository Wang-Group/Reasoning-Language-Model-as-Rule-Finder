**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic amino acids with side chains containing an amino or acetamido group (with six or more carbons) result in a high Fe/Hf value.**

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers fitting this description will have a **high Fe/Hf** value.
  - **Chemical Basis**: The presence of multiple amino groups provides additional coordination sites for Fe ions, and the extended chain length allows for flexible chelation, enhancing Fe incorporation into the catalyst.
  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** – High Fe/Hf
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** – High Fe/Hf
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** – High Fe/Hf

---

- **Rule 2**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halogens, acyl, bromomethyl) at the para position result in a high Fe/Hf value.**

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers matching this description will have a **high Fe/Hf** value.
  - **Chemical Basis**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing deprotonation and coordination with Fe ions via the carboxylate group. This facilitates stronger binding of Fe ions to the modifier.
  - **Examples**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** – High Fe/Hf
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** – High Fe/Hf
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** – High Fe/Hf

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing both a thiol (-SH) group and a carboxylic acid group result in a high Fe/Hf value.**

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers with both -SH and -COOH groups will have a **high Fe/Hf** value.
  - **Chemical Basis**: Thiol groups are strong ligands capable of coordinating to Fe ions. The combination of thiol and carboxylate groups allows for chelation, effectively increasing Fe incorporation into the catalyst.
  - **Examples**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** – High Fe/Hf
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** – High Fe/Hf

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with pyridine rings attached via the para position to a carboxylic acid group result in a high Fe/Hf value.**

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers where a pyridine ring is connected to a carboxylic acid group at the para position will have a **high Fe/Hf** value.
  - **Chemical Basis**: The nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring acts as a strong coordination site for Fe ions. The para arrangement allows simultaneous coordination of both the pyridine nitrogen and the carboxylate oxygen, enhancing Fe binding.
  - **Examples**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** – High Fe/Hf
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** – High Fe/Hf

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with flexible polyether chains terminating with a carboxylic acid or amino group result in a high Fe/Hf value.**

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers containing polyether chains (–(OCH₂CH₂)ₙ–) ending with –COOH or –NH₂ groups will have a **high Fe/Hf** value.
  - **Chemical Basis**: Ether oxygen atoms along the chain can coordinate with Fe ions, and the flexibility of the polyether chain allows for multiple coordination interactions. This enhances Fe incorporation into the catalyst.
  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** – High Fe/Hf
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** – High Fe/Hf

---

- **Rule 6**: **Aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length (C₇–C₈) chains and terminal hydroxyl or amino groups result in a high Fe/Hf value.**

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers that are straight-chain C₇–C₈ carboxylic acids with a terminal –OH or –NH₂ group will have a **high Fe/Hf** value.
  - **Chemical Basis**: The additional functional group at the end of the chain provides extra coordination sites, while the chain length allows for flexible binding to Fe ions, facilitating chelation and enhancing Fe incorporation.
  - **Examples**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** – High Fe/Hf
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** – High Fe/Hf

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with small or non-coordinating side chains result in a low Fe/Hf value.**

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains not capable of additional coordination will have a **low Fe/Hf** value.
  - **Chemical Basis**: Lack of additional coordination sites beyond the primary amine and carboxylic acid groups limits the ability to bind Fe ions effectively, resulting in lower Fe incorporation.
  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid) – Low Fe/Hf
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan) – Low Fe/Hf

---

- **Rule 8**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents at the para position result in a low Fe/Hf value.**

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers with electron-donating groups (e.g., amino, hydroxy, methoxy) on an aromatic ring will have a **low Fe/Hf** value.
  - **Chemical Basis**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, reducing its ability to deprotonate and coordinate with Fe ions. This weakens Fe binding and lowers Fe incorporation.
  - **Examples**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** – Low Fe/Hf
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid** – Low Fe/Hf
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** – Low Fe/Hf

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (polyols) without strong coordinating groups result in a low Fe/Hf value.**

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers with several hydroxyl groups but lacking strong ligands like amino or thiol groups will have a **low Fe/Hf** value.
  - **Chemical Basis**: Hydroxyl groups are weaker ligands for Fe coordination. Without stronger coordinating groups, such modifiers do not effectively enhance Fe binding, leading to lower Fe incorporation.
  - **Examples**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** – Low Fe/Hf
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** – Low Fe/Hf

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with aldehyde groups adjacent to carboxylic acids result in a low Fe/Hf value.**

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers with aldehyde groups near or conjugated with the carboxylic acid will have a **low Fe/Hf** value.
  - **Chemical Basis**: Aldehyde groups may form stable internal interactions or undergo side reactions, reducing the availability of coordination sites for Fe ions. This diminishes Fe binding and lowers Fe incorporation.
  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** – Low Fe/Hf
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** – Low Fe/Hf

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers lacking strong coordinating groups and containing perfluoroalkyl chains result in a low Fe/Hf value.**

  - **Prediction**: Modifiers with perfluoroalkyl chains will have a **low Fe/Hf** value.
  - **Chemical Basis**: Perfluoroalkyl chains are highly electronegative but lack lone pairs for coordination and are hydrophobic, reducing their ability to interact with Fe ions. This leads to lower Fe incorporation into the catalyst.
  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** – Low Fe/Hf

**End of Rules**

These rules provide a systematic understanding of how specific combinations of functional groups in molecular modifiers influence the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst:

- **Strong Coordinating Functional Groups Enhance Fe Incorporation**: Modifiers with additional coordinating sites such as amino, thiol, pyridine nitrogen, or flexible chains with ether oxygen atoms can chelate Fe ions more effectively, leading to higher Fe/Hf values.

- **Electronic Effects Drive Coordination Capacity**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase acid strength and promote deprotonation, enhancing coordination with Fe ions. Electron-donating groups have the opposite effect, reducing coordination ability.

- **Molecular Flexibility and Chain Length Matter**: Longer chains allow for flexible binding, and terminal functional groups can coordinate with Fe ions, improving Fe incorporation.

- **Absence of Strong Ligands Limits Fe Coordination**: Modifiers lacking potent coordinating groups, or those with functional groups that do not favor coordination (e.g., multiple hydroxyls without additional ligands), result in lower Fe/Hf values.

By applying these rules, researchers can predict the Fe/Hf outcome for new molecular modifiers and design catalysts with optimized performance for the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. The balance between electronic effects, coordination potential, steric factors, and molecular flexibility is crucial in determining the effectiveness of a modifier in incorporating Fe ions into the catalyst structure.
