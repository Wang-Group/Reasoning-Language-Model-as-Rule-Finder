- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 has high clarity as it specifically defines aliphatic amino acids with carbon chains of five or more. There is strong property insight since longer aliphatic chains may enhance Fe coordination. The rule is moderately complex, considering both chain length and amino acid functionality. It is well-supported with at least four data points matching the rule and showing high Fe/Hf values, thus coverage is good.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear in identifying modifiers with sulfur functional groups like thiols or thioethers. The property insight is solid, as sulfur atoms can coordinate with metal ions like Fe. The complexity is appropriate, focusing on specific functional groups. The rule is well-supported by at least three data points exhibiting high Fe/Hf values, indicating good coverage.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 provides clear criteria by specifying aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position. The property insight is sound because electron-withdrawing groups can affect the electron density and metal coordination ability. The complexity is appropriate, involving both structural features and substituent effects. The rule is backed by at least three data points with high Fe/Hf values, showing good coverage.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 lacks sufficient coverage, as only one data point matches (2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid). While the clarity is acceptable, and there is some property insight regarding polyether chains, the limited data support reduces its reliability. The complexity is moderate but may need more data points to strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 also has limited coverage with only one data point (7-hydroxyheptanoic acid). The rule is clear and offers property insight into how long aliphatic chains with hydroxyl groups may impact Fe/Hf values. However, due to the low number of supporting data points, the rule's validity is questionable despite appropriate complexity.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear in its description of amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains leading to low Fe/Hf values. The property insight is reasonable, suggesting steric hindrance may reduce Fe coordination. The complexity is suitable, but coverage is low with only one supporting data point (tryptophan), limiting confidence in the rule.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear and provides good property insight into how electron-donating groups at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids influence Fe/Hf values. The complexity is appropriate, and the rule is supported by multiple data points showing low Fe/Hf values, indicating good coverage.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 clearly identifies modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups or polyol structures leading to low Fe/Hf values. The property insight is logical as multiple hydroxyl groups may affect metal coordination. The complexity is adequate, and there are at least two supporting data points, providing reasonable coverage.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear about modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains resulting in low Fe/Hf values. The property insight considers the electron-withdrawing nature of fluorine atoms affecting coordination. The complexity is acceptable, and the rule is supported by at least two data points, ensuring sufficient coverage.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 offers clear criteria by focusing on aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups, leading to low Fe/Hf values. The property insight is valid, considering how aldehyde groups may impact coordination. The complexity is appropriate, and the rule is backed by at least two data points, providing good coverage.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear in describing modifiers with heterocyclic aromatic rings other than pyridine at non-para positions resulting in low Fe/Hf values. The property insight is reasonable, and the complexity is suitable. With at least two supporting data points, the rule has acceptable coverage.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 has low coverage, with only one supporting data point (1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid). The rule is clear and provides property insight into how ketone groups adjacent to aromatic rings may influence Fe/Hf values. The complexity is adequate, but the limited data support weakens the rule.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 suffers from low coverage, with only one data point (3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid). The rule is clear and offers some property insight regarding ether linkages in aliphatic chains. The complexity is moderate, but more supporting data points are needed to validate the rule.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 is somewhat unclear due to inconsistency in data support. While it cites short-chain amino acids or dicarboxylic acids leading to low Fe/Hf values, one data point ((2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid) supports the rule, but another ((2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid) does not, leading to ambiguity. The property insight and complexity are reasonable, but coverage is inconsistent.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 has low coverage with only one supporting data point (5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid). The rule is clear and offers property insight into the effect of hydroxyl group positions on Fe/Hf values. The complexity is acceptable, but the limited data support reduces confidence in the rule.

**Explanation and Chemical Insights:**

These rules are derived from analyzing the structural features of the modifiers and their impact on the Fe/Hf ratio. The underlying chemical principles are considered as follows:

- **Coordination Ability:** Functional groups like amino, thiol, and ether linkages can coordinate with metal centers. Modifiers with strong coordinating groups may enhance Fe incorporation into the catalyst, leading to higher Fe/Hf values.

- **Electronic Effects:** Electron-withdrawing groups on aromatic rings (e.g., nitro, bromo, pyridyl) can enhance the interaction with metal centers due to increased electrophilicity, resulting in higher Fe/Hf values. Conversely, electron-donating groups (e.g., amino, methyl, hydroxyl) can decrease this interaction.

- **Steric Factors:** Bulky groups or multiple substituents can hinder coordination to the metal center, affecting the Fe/Hf ratio. For example, multiple hydroxyl groups may create steric hindrance or introduce competing interactions.

- **Chain Length and Functional Group Density:** The length of the carbon chain and the density of functional groups (e.g., carboxyl groups in dicarboxylic acids) influence the spatial arrangement and binding affinity to the metal clusters.

By combining structural features with chemical reasoning, these rules aim to predict the Fe/Hf value based on the molecular structure of the modifiers.

**Explanation and Chemical Insights:**

These rules are formulated based on the structural features of the modifiers and their influence on the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst. The key chemical principles considered include:

- **Coordination Ability:** Functional groups like amino, thiol, and ether linkages can coordinate with metal centers. Modifiers with strong coordinating groups enhance Fe incorporation into the catalyst, leading to higher Fe/Hf values.

- **Electronic Effects:**
  - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups (EWGs):** Substituents such as nitro, bromo, or pyridyl groups withdraw electron density from the aromatic ring, increasing electrophilicity and enhancing interaction with metal centers. This can result in higher Fe/Hf values.
  - **Electron-Donating Groups (EDGs):** Groups like amino, methyl, or hydroxyl donate electron density, reducing the electrophilicity of the ring and decreasing interaction with metal centers, leading to lower Fe/Hf values.

- **Steric Factors:** Bulky substituents or multiple functional groups may hinder coordination to the metal center due to steric hindrance, affecting the Fe/Hf ratio.

- **Chain Length and Functional Groups:** The length of carbon chains and the presence of specific functional groups (e.g., carboxyl, hydroxyl) influence the spatial orientation and binding affinity to metal clusters. Longer aliphatic chains with coordinating groups can enhance metal interaction.

- **Hydrophobicity and Hydrophilicity:** The balance between hydrophobic and hydrophilic characteristics of the modifiers affects their interaction with the catalyst. For example, modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups (hydrophilic) may interact differently compared to those with hydrophobic alkyl chains.

- **Aromaticity and Conjugation:** The presence of aromatic rings and conjugated systems can influence electron distribution and the overall reactivity of the modifier with the metal center.

By integrating these chemical principles, the rules aim to predict the Fe/Hf outcome based on the molecular structure of the modifiers. This understanding can guide the selection or design of modifiers to optimize the catalyst's performance in the target reaction.

**Explanation and Chemical Insights:**

These rules have been carefully formulated to reflect the relationship between the structural features of modifiers and their impact on the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst. The key chemical principles considered include:

- **Coordination Ability:** Functional groups such as amino, thiol, and ether linkages have a strong ability to coordinate with metal centers. Modifiers possessing these groups can enhance iron incorporation into the catalyst, leading to higher Fe/Hf values.

- **Electronic Effects:**
  - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups (EWGs):** Substituents like nitro, halogens, and pyridyl groups withdraw electron density, increasing the electrophilicity of the aromatic ring. This can enhance interactions with metal centers and result in higher Fe/Hf values.

- **Steric Factors:** The size and position of functional groups affect the ability of the modifier to coordinate with the metal center. Bulky groups or multiple substituents can create steric hindrance, impacting the Fe/Hf ratio.

- **Chain Length and Flexibility:** Longer aliphatic chains with coordinating functional groups can enhance the flexibility and reach of the modifier, improving interactions with the metal clusters.

- **Aromaticity and Conjugation:** The presence of aromatic rings and conjugated systems influences electron distribution and the overall reactivity of the modifier with metal centers.

- **Hydrophobicity and Hydrophilicity:** The balance between hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions in the modifier affects its solubility and interaction with the catalyst. Modifiers with hydrophilic groups (e.g., multiple hydroxyls) may interact differently compared to those with hydrophobic characteristics.

By integrating these chemical principles, the rules provide a predictive framework for determining whether a given modifier is likely to result in a high or low Fe/Hf value based on its molecular structure. This understanding can guide the selection or design of modifiers to optimize the catalyst's performance in the target radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

---

**Note on Rule Refinements:**

- **Rule 3** has been refined to focus on specific electron-withdrawing groups that consistently result in high Fe/Hf values, excluding groups like aldehydes (formyl) which did not align with the pattern.

- **Rule 4** highlights the unique behavior of pyridyl-substituted aromatic acids, which tend to increase Fe/Hf values due to the strong coordinating ability of the pyridine nitrogen.

- **Rule 6** and **Rule 12** distinguish between amino acids with different side chains, recognizing that those with plain aromatic groups favor high Fe/Hf values, while those with heteroatoms in the ring lead to low Fe/Hf values due to potential coordination that competes with iron incorporation.

- **Rule 14** addresses modifiers where electron-donating groups are not at the para position, noting that their presence can still influence the Fe/Hf ratio, typically resulting in lower values.

These refinements ensure that the rules are both accurate and applicable to a broad range of modifiers within the dataset, providing a useful tool for predicting and optimizing catalyst performance.

  - **Functional Groups:** Amino (-NH₂), thiol (-SH), thioether (-S-), and polyether chains have a strong ability to coordinate with metal ions like Fe³⁺. Modifiers possessing these groups can enhance iron incorporation into the catalyst, leading to higher Fe/Hf values.
  - **Chain Length and Flexibility:** Longer aliphatic chains with coordinating functional groups provide flexibility, improving interactions with metal clusters.

- **Electronic Effects:**
  - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups (EWGs):** Substituents such as nitro (-NO₂), halogens (-Br), and pyridyl groups withdraw electron density, increasing the electrophilicity of the aromatic ring. This can enhance interactions with metal centers, resulting in higher Fe/Hf values.
  - **Electron-Donating Groups (EDGs):** Groups like hydroxyl (-OH), amino (-NH₂), and methyl (-CH₃) donate electron density, reducing the electrophilicity of the ring. This decreases interactions with metal centers, leading to lower Fe/Hf values.

- **Steric Factors:** Bulky substituents or branching can create steric hindrance, affecting the ability of the modifier to coordinate with the metal center and influencing the Fe/Hf ratio.

- **Aromaticity and Heterocycles:**
  - **Position of Substituents:** The position of substituents on aromatic rings impacts electronic distribution and coordination behavior. Para-substituted EWGs enhance metal interactions, while meta or ortho EDGs may not facilitate coordination as effectively.
  - **Heteroatoms in Rings:** Heterocyclic compounds with multiple heteroatoms can chelate metal ions differently, sometimes reducing Fe incorporation due to competing interactions.

- **Hydrophobicity and Hydrophilicity:** Modifiers with hydrophilic polyol structures or multiple hydroxyl groups may interact differently with the catalyst surface, possibly hindering iron incorporation and resulting in lower Fe/Hf values.

By integrating these chemical insights, the rules provide a predictive framework for determining whether a given modifier is likely to result in a high or low Fe/Hf value based on its molecular structure. This understanding can guide the selection or design of modifiers to optimize the catalyst's performance in the target radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

**Note on Rule Refinements:**

- **Rule 3:** Emphasizes the role of strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position in aromatic carboxylic acids, refining the focus to nitro, halogens, and pyridyl groups, which consistently result in high Fe/Hf values.

- **Rule 7 and Rule 9:** Clarify the impact of electron-donating groups on aromatic rings, specifying that para-substituted EDGs lead to low Fe/Hf values due to decreased metal affinity.

- **Rule 11 and Rule 15:** Differentiate between heterocyclic modifiers based on the position of heteroatoms, recognizing that certain positions may hinder iron incorporation due to steric or electronic factors.

- **Rule 14:** Introduces the effect of conjugated keto groups, which can enhance coordination with metal centers, leading to higher Fe/Hf values.

These refinements ensure that the rules are accurate, cover a broad range of the dataset, and are based on underlying chemical principles. They provide valuable guidelines for predicting the Fe/Hf ratio and optimizing the catalyst system.

**Explanation and Chemical Insights:**

The rules above have been developed by analyzing the structural features of the molecular modifiers and their observed impact on the Fe/Hf ratio. Key chemical principles considered include:

- **Coordination Ability**:
  - **Functional Groups with Lone Pairs**: Amino (-NH₂), thiol (-SH), and ether (-O-) groups have lone pairs capable of coordinating with Fe³⁺ ions. Modifiers with these groups enhance iron incorporation into the catalyst, leading to higher Fe/Hf values (Rules 1, 2, 4).
  - **Chain Length and Flexibility**: Longer aliphatic chains with terminal functional groups offer better flexibility and accessibility for coordination (Rule 1).

- **Electronic Effects**:
  - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups (EWGs)**: Substituents like nitro (-NO₂), bromo (-Br), and pyridyl rings withdraw electron density, increasing the electrophilicity of the aromatic ring and enhancing metal interactions (Rule 3).
  - **Electron-Donating Groups (EDGs)**: Groups such as hydroxyl (-OH), amino (-NH₂), and methyl (-CH₃) donate electron density, reducing the electrophilicity and decreasing metal affinity (Rule 7).

- **Steric Factors**:
  - Bulky substituents or branching can hinder coordination with metal centers, affecting Fe incorporation (considered in Rule 6).

- **Hydrophobicity and Hydrophilicity**:
  - **Polyols and Multiple Hydroxyl Groups**: Increase hydrophilicity and may hinder interaction with the hydrophobic regions of the catalyst, leading to lower Fe/Hf values (Rule 8).

- **Fluorination**:
  - **Fluorinated Chains**: Highly electronegative fluorine atoms decrease electron density on the chain, reducing coordination ability (Rule 9).

- **Heterocyclic Structures**:
  - **Position and Nature of Heteroatoms**: Influence the ability to interact with metal centers. Heterocycles with multiple heteroatoms may have reduced coordination due to competing interactions or steric hindrance (Rule 11).

- **Amino Acids with Specific Side Chains**:
  - **Nonpolar Aromatic Side Chains**: Favorable for metal interaction due to hydrophobic pi-stacking or coordination (Rule 5).
  - **Polar or Heterocyclic Side Chains**: May not coordinate as effectively, leading to lower Fe/Hf values (Rule 13).

- **Functional Group Combinations**:
  - **Modifiers with Both Hydroxyl and Aldehyde Groups**: Can lead to complexation or intramolecular interactions that reduce availability for metal coordination (Rule 14).

These rules prioritize broad coverage of the dataset while combining multiple sub-structures to explain the observed trends. They integrate chemical insights to predict whether a given modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value, aiding in the rational design of modifiers to optimize catalyst performance.

**Explanation and Chemical Insights:**

The refined rules above have been developed to align closely with the provided dataset, ensuring consistency and predictive accuracy. Key chemical principles and observations underlying these rules include:

- **Coordination Ability and Chelation**:
  - **Amino and Carboxyl Groups**: Modifiers with both amino (-NH₂) and carboxyl (-COOH) groups, such as unbranched amino acids, can act as bidentate ligands, effectively chelating Fe ions, resulting in higher Fe/Hf values (**Rules 1** and **5**).
  - **Sulfur Functionalities**: Sulfur-containing groups like thiols and thioethers have a strong affinity for transition metals due to their soft Lewis base character, enhancing Fe incorporation (**Rule 2**).

- **Electronic Effects of Substituents**:
  - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups (EWGs)**: Substituents like nitro, bromo, and pyridyl rings increase the electrophilicity of the aromatic ring and the acidity of the carboxyl group, facilitating stronger interactions with Fe ions, leading to high Fe/Hf ratios (**Rule 3**).
  - **Electron-Donating Groups (EDGs)**: Groups such as hydroxyl, amino, and methyl increase electron density on the aromatic ring, reducing the ability to coordinate with Fe ions, resulting in lower Fe/Hf values (**Rule 6**).

- **Steric and Structural Factors**:
  - **Polyether Chains**: Flexible polyether backbones with terminal functional groups can wrap around Fe ions, acting as multidentate ligands and enhancing Fe incorporation (**Rule 4**).
  - **Hydroxyl-Rich Aliphatic Chains**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can form hydrogen bonds, possibly hindering Fe coordination due to steric hindrance or intramolecular interactions (**Rule 7**).

- **Hydrophobicity and Pi-Interactions**:
  - **Nonpolar Aromatic Side Chains**: Amino acids like phenylalanine provide hydrophobic environments and can engage in pi-stacking interactions with Fe centers, promoting higher Fe/Hf values (**Rule 5**).
  - **Long Aliphatic Chains**: Modifiers with extended aliphatic chains and terminal hydroxyl groups may increase the hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst surface, enhancing Fe incorporation (**Rule 15**).

- **Heteroatom Effects**:
  - **Fluorinated Chains**: Highly electronegative fluorine atoms withdraw electron density, reducing the ligand's ability to donate electrons to Fe ions, leading to lower Fe/Hf values (**Rule 8**).
  - **Heterocyclic Aromatics with Multiple Heteroatoms**: These structures may have competing coordination sites or steric hindrance, decreasing effective Fe binding (**Rule 10**).

- **Functional Group Combinations**:
  - **Aldehyde and Hydroxyl Groups**: Proximity of these groups can lead to internal hydrogen bonding or chelation, which may reduce the availability of coordination sites for Fe ions, resulting in lower Fe/Hf ratios (**Rule 9** and **Rule 12**).
  - **Gamma-Keto and Dicarboxylic Acids**: These functional groups can form stable chelate rings or zwitterionic structures, decreasing their propensity to coordinate with Fe ions (**Rule 13**).

- **Substituent Positioning**:
  - **Methoxy Groups in Non-Para Positions**: Methoxy groups that are not at the para position may not significantly interfere with Fe coordination, especially if other structural features favor Fe binding, leading to higher Fe/Hf values (**Rule 14**).

**Explanation and Chemical Insights:**

The rules above are formulated by analyzing the dataset and identifying patterns between the molecular structures of modifiers and their corresponding Fe/Hf ratios. By combining multiple substructures and considering physicochemical properties, these rules aim to predict whether a modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value.

**Key Observations and Underlying Principles:**

1. **Coordination Ability and Chelation:**
   - **Unbranched Aliphatic Amino Acids (Rule 1):** Linear amino acids with terminal amino and carboxyl groups can act as effective bidentate ligands, coordinating strongly with Fe ions. Longer carbon chains increase flexibility, enhancing chelation.
   - **Modifiers with Sulfur Functionalities (Rule 3):** Sulfur-containing groups such as thiols and thioethers are soft nucleophiles that have a high affinity for transition metals like iron, promoting higher Fe incorporation.

2. **Electronic Effects of Substituents:**
   - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups (EWGs) (Rule 2):** EWGs at the para position enhance the acidity of the carboxyl group and increase the ligand's ability to coordinate with Fe ions, leading to higher Fe/Hf values.
   - **Electron-Donating Groups (EDGs) (Rule 6):** EDGs donate electron density, reducing the acidity of the carboxyl group and diminishing coordination with Fe ions, resulting in lower Fe/Hf values.

3. **Steric and Structural Considerations:**
   - **Bulky Side Chains (Rule 11):** Amino acids with large or heterocyclic side chains may hinder effective coordination due to steric hindrance.
   - **Polyether Chains (Rule 4):** Flexible polyether backbones can wrap around Fe ions, facilitating multidentate coordination and increasing Fe incorporation.

4. **Functional Group Combinations:**
   - **Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups (Rule 7):** Polyhydroxy compounds can engage in extensive hydrogen bonding, which may interfere with Fe coordination.
   - **Fluorinated Chains (Rule 8):** Highly electronegative fluorine atoms withdraw electron density, weakening the ligand's ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

5. **Specific Functional Group Positions:**
   - **Aldehyde Groups at Para Position (Rule 9):** The presence of an aldehyde group adjacent to the carboxyl group may lead to intramolecular interactions, reducing availability for Fe coordination.
   - **Heteroatoms in Aromatic Rings (Rule 10):** Multiple heteroatoms can create competing coordination sites or electronic environments unfavorable for Fe binding.

6. **Combination of Methoxy and Keto Groups (Rule 13):** The presence of methoxy and keto groups can enhance electron delocalization, potentially increasing the ligand's ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

7. **Long Aliphatic Chains with Acetamido Groups (Rule 14):** Additional acetamido groups provide extra coordinating sites, improving Fe binding through multiple interactions.

8. **Modifiers with Adjacent Hydroxyl and Aldehyde Groups (Rule 15):** Such combinations may form stable intramolecular hydrogen bonds, reducing the ligand's propensity to coordinate with Fe ions.

  - Include flexible polyether chains to allow multidentate coordination (Rule 4).
  - Employ modifiers that do not introduce significant steric hindrance.

- **To Decrease Fe/Hf Ratio:**
  - Avoid bulky or highly functionalized side chains that may hinder coordination (Rule 11).
  - Limit the use of modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups or fluorination that reduce electron density (Rules 7 and 8).
  - Be cautious with modifiers that may form stable intramolecular interactions (Rules 9 and 15).

By tailoring the molecular structure of modifiers according to these rules, you can effectively control the Fe/Hf ratio and optimize the catalyst's performance for the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

5. **Positioning of Functional Groups:**
   - **Aldehyde Groups (Rule 9):** Aldehyde groups at strategic positions can interfere with coordination by engaging in resonance or forming hydrogen bonds.
   - **Heterocycles with Nitrogen (Rule 10):** Nitrogen atoms in specific positions may act as coordinating sites or interfere with Fe binding due to their lone pair electrons.

6. **Specific Molecular Structures:**
   - **Aromatic Amino Acids (Rule 5):** Phenylalanine enhances Fe coordination without steric hindrance due to its aromatic side chain.

**Explanation and Chemical Insights:**

The rules above are derived from analyzing the dataset and understanding the structural features that influence the Fe/Hf ratio. By considering the combined effects of functional groups and their physicochemical properties, these rules can predict whether a modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value.

**Key Observations and Rationales:**

1. **Coordination Ability and Electronic Effects:**

   - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups (Rules 2 & 15):** EWGs such as nitro, bromo, or pyridyl groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group and enhance the ligand's ability to coordinate with Fe ions. Pyridyl rings can also directly coordinate with Fe due to the lone pair on nitrogen.
   - **Electron-Donating Groups (Rule 6):** EDGs like hydroxyl, amino, or methyl groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing its coordinating ability with Fe ions.

2. **Functional Groups Enhancing Coordination:**

   - **Sulfur-Containing Groups (Rule 3):** Sulfur atoms are soft Lewis bases and can form strong coordination bonds with transition metals like Fe, increasing the Fe/Hf ratio.
   - **Polyether Chains (Rule 4):** The lone pairs on ether oxygen atoms can coordinate with metal ions, facilitating increased Fe incorporation.

3. **Steric Factors and Side Chain Effects:**

   - **Bulky Side Chains (Rule 10):** Modifiers with bulky heterocyclic rings or side chains can cause steric hindrance, preventing effective coordination with Fe ions and resulting in lower Fe/Hf ratios.
   - **Chain Length and Flexibility (Rules 1 & 11):** Longer unbranched aliphatic chains with terminal amino groups enhance flexibility and coordination with Fe ions (high Fe/Hf), whereas long dicarboxylic acids may lead to chelation with Hf clusters or steric hindrance (low Fe/Hf).

4. **Multiple Functional Groups:**

   - **Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups (Rule 7):** Multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups can engage in intramolecular hydrogen bonding or increase polarity, reducing the modifier's ability to coordinate with Fe ions.
   - **Perfluorinated Chains (Rule 8):** Fluorine atoms are highly electronegative and can withdraw electron density, weakening the ligand's coordinating ability with Fe ions.

5. **Specific Structural Features:**

   - **Aldehyde Substituents (Rule 9):** Aldehyde groups adjacent to carboxyl groups on aromatic rings may engage in resonance or intramolecular interactions, decreasing availability for coordination with Fe ions.
   - **Modifiers Containing Ketones (Rule 14):** Ketone groups conjugated to aromatic rings can delocalize electron density, potentially enhancing coordination with Fe ions.

6. **Amphoteric Amino Acids (Rules 1 & 5):**

   - **Simple Amino Acids:** Amino acids with unbranched side chains and without additional interfering groups tend to coordinate well with Fe ions, leading to higher Fe/Hf ratios.
   - **Amino Acids with Interfering Groups (Rule 11):** Amino acids with additional carboxyl groups or bulky side chains may interfere with coordination due to steric hindrance or competing interactions.

**Conclusion:**

These rules offer a systematic approach to predict the impact of molecular modifiers on the Fe/Hf ratio based on their structural features. By combining multiple substructures and considering their physicochemical properties, researchers can design modifiers to control the Fe/Hf ratio, optimizing catalytic performance for the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

**Explanation and Chemical Insights:**

The rules above are formulated based on the structural features of the modifiers and their impact on the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst **Hf-TPY-MOL(Fe)**. Key factors influencing the Fe/Hf value include the ability of the modifier to coordinate with Fe ions, steric hindrance, electronic effects of substituents, and the presence of functional groups that either promote or inhibit metal coordination.

---

**Key Observations and Rationales:**

1. **Coordination Ability and Electronic Effects:**

   - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups (EWGs) Enhance Fe Incorporation (Rule 2):**
     - EWGs such as nitro, bromo, or pyridyl groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group and enhance the ligand's ability to coordinate with Fe ions.
     - *Example*: 4-nitrobenzoic acid has a nitro group that withdraws electron density, facilitating stronger coordination with Fe.

   - **Electron-Donating Groups (EDGs) Reduce Fe Incorporation (Rule 6):**
     - EDGs like hydroxyl, amino, or methyl groups donate electron density to the aromatic ring, decreasing the acidity of the carboxyl group and weakening coordination with Fe ions.
     - *Example*: 4-hydroxybenzoic acid has a hydroxyl group that donates electron density, resulting in a lower Fe/Hf ratio.

2. **Functional Groups Promoting Coordination:**

   - **Terminal Amino Groups and Unbranched Aliphatic Chains (Rule 1):**
     - Primary amino groups can coordinate with Fe ions, and unbranched chains minimize steric hindrance.
     - *Example*: 5-aminopentanoic acid has a terminal amino group and a straight chain, enhancing Fe coordination.

   - **Sulfur-Containing Groups (Rule 3):**
     - Sulfur atoms are soft Lewis bases and can form strong coordination bonds with Fe ions.
     - *Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid contains a thiol group that enhances Fe binding.

   - **Polyether Chains with Terminal Coordinating Groups (Rule 4):**
     - Ether oxygen atoms provide lone pairs for coordination, and flexible chains can wrap around metal centers.
     - *Example*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid has ether linkages that facilitate Fe coordination.

3. **Steric Factors and Side Chain Effects:**

   - **Hydrophobic Side Chains in Amino Acids (Rule 5):**

     - *Example*: Phenylalanine has a benzyl side chain that does not hinder Fe binding.

   - **Bulky Heterocyclic Rings Causing Steric Hindrance (Rule 10):**
     - Large rings or side chains can prevent effective interaction with Fe ions.
     - *Example*: Tryptophan's indole ring introduces steric bulk, reducing Fe incorporation.

4. **Multiple Functional Groups and Polarity:**

   - **Polyhydroxylated Acids Reduce Fe Coordination (Rule 7):**
     - Multiple hydroxyl groups increase polarity and hydrogen bonding, which can compete with metal coordination.
     - *Example*: Gluconic acid's several hydroxyl groups hinder Fe binding.

   - **Perfluorinated Chains Withdraw Electron Density (Rule 8):**
     - Fluorine atoms are highly electronegative and reduce the electron density available for coordination.
     - *Example*: Nonafluoropentanoic acid is less effective at coordinating with Fe due to its fluorinated chain.

5. **Specific Structural Features Affecting Coordination:**

   - **Aldehyde Substituents Decrease Fe Incorporation (Rule 9):**
     - Aldehyde groups can participate in resonance, reducing the electron density on the carboxylate oxygen.
     - *Example*: 4-formylbenzoic acid's aldehyde group affects its coordination ability with Fe.

   - **Unbranched Aliphatic Amino Acids (Rule 1):**
     - Modifiers with **terminal amino** and **carboxyl groups** can effectively **chelate Fe ions** due to available lone pairs and minimal steric hindrance.
     - *Examples*: **5-aminopentanoic acid** and **7-aminoheptanoic acid** readily coordinate with Fe through their amino and carboxyl groups.

   - **Sulfur-Containing Groups (Rule 3):**
     - **Thiol** and **thioether** groups are soft Lewis bases that form strong interactions with Fe ions.
     - *Examples*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** and **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** enhance Fe incorporation due to sulfur coordination.

   - **Flexible Ether Chains (Rule 4):**

3. **Steric Effects and Side Chain Influence:**

   - **Hydrophobic Side Chains in Amino Acids (Rule 5):**
     - Amino acids with hydrophobic side chains and without interfering functional groups allow effective Fe coordination.
     - *Example*: **Phenylalanine** has a hydrophobic benzyl side chain conducive to Fe binding.

     - Multiple adjacent **hydroxyl groups** increase intramolecular hydrogen bonding and can compete with Fe coordination.
     - *Example*: **Gluconic acid** has numerous hydroxyl groups that decrease its effectiveness in binding Fe.

5. **Effect of Chain Length and Positioning of Functional Groups:**

   - **Distant Hydroxyl Groups (Rule 11):**
     - Hydroxyl groups located away from the carboxyl group may not interfere with Fe coordination and can enhance solubility.
     - *Example*: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** results in high Fe/Hf values due to minimal interference.

   - **Position of Substituents on Aromatic Rings (Rule 14):**
     - The position of substituents affects electronic distribution and steric hindrance.
     - *Examples*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (para substitution) promotes Fe coordination, while **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (meta substitution) does not.

6. **Multiple Carboxyl Groups Affecting Coordination (Rule 13):**

   - **Dicarboxylic Acids Reduce Fe Binding:**
     - Additional carboxyl groups can lead to chelation with competing metal centers or intramolecular interactions that reduce available sites for Fe coordination.
     - *Examples*: **Glutamic acid** and **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** tend to result in low Fe/Hf values.

7. **Fluorinated Chains Reducing Fe Binding (Rule 10):**

   - **Perfluoroalkyl Chains:**
     - The high electronegativity of **fluorine atoms** decreases electron density on coordinating atoms, diminishing Fe binding.
     - *Example*: **Nonafluoropentanoic acid** shows low Fe incorporation due to its perfluoroalkyl chain.

These rules correlate specific structural features of the modifiers with the Fe/Hf ratio, considering electronic effects and coordination abilities. Modifiers that can effectively coordinate with Fe ions through electron-withdrawing groups or flexible chains tend to increase Fe incorporation, resulting in high Fe/Hf values. In contrast, modifiers with electron-donating groups or steric hindrance reduce Fe coordination, leading to low Fe/Hf values.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: **Rule 1** scores highly across all criteria. It is clear and allows one to determine the Fe/Hf value based on the presence of a terminal primary amino group and a carboxyl group on an unbranched aliphatic chain. The rule has strong property insight, as such structures promote effective coordination with Fe ions, increasing Fe/Hf values. It considers a combination of functional groups, and is supported by multiple data points (e.g., 5-aminopentanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid), achieving a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 2** excels in clarity and property insight. It clearly states that electron-withdrawing groups at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids increase Fe/Hf values, likely due to enhanced Fe ion coordination. It involves a combination of substructures (aromatic ring, carboxyl group, electron-withdrawing substituents) and is supported by multiple data points (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid), showing a strong balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 3** is clear and provides good property insight, attributing high Fe/Hf values to modifiers with sulfur functional groups attached to carboxylic acids. Sulfur atoms can coordinate with Fe ions, enhancing Fe incorporation. The rule considers combinations of functional groups and is well-supported by data points like 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid and 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid, achieving a solid balance.

- **Comment 4**: **Rule 4** meets all criteria effectively. It clearly indicates that electron-donating groups at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids result in low Fe/Hf values, possibly due to decreased electron affinity hindering Fe coordination. It combines substructures and is supported by several data points (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-methylbenzoic acid), ensuring good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** is clear and offers reasonable property insight by associating multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain with low Fe/Hf values, which may be due to steric hindrance or competing coordination sites. It considers combinations of functional groups and is supported by at least two data points (e.g., pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), though coverage is moderate. The rule maintains an acceptable balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** has moderate clarity but could be improved. While it states that heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen attached directly to the carboxyl group result in low Fe/Hf values, there are exceptions (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid has high Fe/Hf values). The property insight is reasonable, suggesting that such rings may interfere with Fe coordination. It considers specific substructures and is supported by data points like pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid. However, refining the rule to specify positional context could enhance clarity and coverage.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** lacks sufficient coverage and clarity. While it suggests that amino acids with aromatic side chains yield low Fe/Hf values, data shows that (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine) results in a high Fe/Hf value, contradicting the rule. Property insight is limited, and the rule does not account for such exceptions. It needs re-evaluation to improve its accuracy and coverage.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** performs well across all criteria. It is clear that modifiers with flexible ether linkages ending with a carboxyl group lead to high Fe/Hf values, likely due to the flexibility and coordination ability of ether linkages. The rule considers combinations of functional groups and is supported by data points like 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid and 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid, achieving a strong balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** has good clarity and property insight but limited coverage. It states that long aliphatic chains with a terminal hydroxyl group and a carboxyl group yield high Fe/Hf values, potentially due to effective Fe ion coordination along the chain. However, it is supported by only one data point (7-hydroxyheptanoic acid), which weakens its coverage and balance. Incorporating additional data points would strengthen this rule.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** is clear and offers solid property insight, linking multiple carboxyl groups to low Fe/Hf values, possibly due to over-coordination hindering Fe incorporation. It considers combinations of functional groups and is supported by data points like (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid and 4-oxoheptanedioic acid, achieving a good balance between complexity and coverage.

These rules aim to capture the relationships between specific structural features of the molecular modifiers and the observed Fe/Hf ratios in the catalyst. The rules consider electronic effects, steric factors, and coordination chemistry principles:

- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups enhance the ability of the modifier to coordinate with Fe ions by stabilizing positive charges, leading to higher Fe/Hf values (Rules 2 and 13). Electron-donating groups have the opposite effect (Rule 4).

- **Steric Factors**: Bulky groups or multiple coordination sites can hinder effective Fe incorporation due to steric hindrance or over-coordination (Rules 7, 14, and 15).

- **Coordination Abilities**: Functional groups that can form strong coordinate bonds with Fe ions, such as thiols and flexible ether chains, promote higher Fe/Hf ratios (Rules 3 and 8).

- **Chain Length and Flexibility**: Unbranched aliphatic chains with terminal functional groups provide an optimal geometry for Fe coordination (Rules 1 and 9). Short chains with multiple carboxyl groups may lead to chelate formation that disfavors Fe incorporation (Rule 10).

- **Hydrophobicity**: Highly hydrophobic modifiers like perfluorinated acids may not interact effectively with Fe ions, resulting in lower Fe/Hf values (Rule 12).

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a given molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low Fe/Hf ratio based on its structural features. These predictions can guide the selection and design of modifiers to optimize the catalyst performance for the target reaction.

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and specific, allowing for straightforward classification of modifiers matching the structural description, leading to high Fe/Hf values. The rule considers a combination of structural features (unbranched aliphatic chain with terminal amino and carboxyl groups) and is supported by multiple data points (at least 4 examples in the dataset). While the physical-chemical insight could be expanded (e.g., explaining how the amino group facilitates Fe coordination), overall, the rule effectively aids in predicting high Fe/Hf values.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear and specifies the structural criteria (aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position) leading to high Fe/Hf values. The rule has adequate physical-chemical insight, acknowledging that electron-withdrawing groups enhance the carboxyl group's ability to coordinate with Fe ions. It accounts for combinations of substructures and is supported by at least two data points, making it a valuable and robust rule.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear and effectively correlates the presence of thiol groups attached to alkyl or aryl backbones with high Fe/Hf values, reflecting the known propensity of thiols to coordinate with metal ions. The rule combines substructural features and is supported by two data points, providing a good balance between specificity and applicability.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 clearly links aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position to low Fe/Hf values.

Additional data points would strengthen the rule's applicability.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 identifies amino acids with large aromatic side chains as resulting in low Fe/Hf values due to steric hindrance. The rule is conceptually sound and clear but is only supported by a single data point, limiting its overall impact. Additional examples would enhance its validity and coverage.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 effectively identifies modifiers with flexible ether linkages ending with a carboxyl group as leading to high Fe/Hf values. The rule is clear, considers combined structural features, and is supported by two data points, making it a useful rule with good balance between specificity and coverage.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 provides a clear and insightful distinction on how the position of the carboxyl group with respect to a heteroaromatic ring affects Fe/Hf values. It effectively uses multiple data points to support both scenarios (high and low Fe/Hf values), demonstrates complex structural considerations, and offers solid physical-chemical insight, making it a strong and valuable rule.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear in its structural description but is supported by only one data point, limiting its general applicability. While it introduces an interesting structural motif, additional examples are needed to confirm its validity. The physical-chemical reasoning could be elaborated to strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 1**:

  Rule 1 is clear and allows us to confidently determine whether a modifier will result in a high Fe/Hf value based on the specified structural features. It provides physical-chemical insight by relating the presence of a linear aliphatic chain with terminal amino and carboxyl groups (and chain length of five or more) to enhanced Fe coordination due to fewer steric hindrances and optimal spacing for coordination. The rule considers a combination of sub-structures (chain length, terminal functional groups, absence of additional groups), adding to its complexity. It is well-supported by multiple data points, such as 5-aminopentanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, and 8-aminooctanoic acid, all showing high Fe/Hf values.

- **Comment 2**:

  Rule 2 is clear in defining modifiers that lead to high Fe/Hf values, specifying aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position. It provides adequate physical-chemical insight by explaining that electron-withdrawing groups can stabilize Fe coordination through increased electrophilicity. The rule combines sub-structures (aromatic ring, para-positioned electron-withdrawing groups), adding complexity. It is supported by data points like 4-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, which exhibit high Fe/Hf values.

- **Comment 3**:

  Rule 3 clearly indicates that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position result in low Fe/Hf values. The physical-chemical insight is adequate, as electron-donating groups decrease electrophilicity, hindering Fe coordination. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures (aromatic ring, electron-donating groups at specific positions), increasing complexity. It is supported by data such as 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and 4-aminobenzoic acid, both showing low Fe/Hf values.

- **Comment 4**:

  Rule 4 is clear and specifies that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain lead to low Fe/Hf values. The physical-chemical insight is reasonable, as multiple hydroxyl groups may result in excessive hydrogen bonding or steric hindrance, interfering with Fe coordination. The rule's complexity lies in combining the aliphatic chain with multiple hydroxyl groups. It is supported by data like (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid, which has a low Fe/Hf value.

- **Comment 5**:

  Rule 5 clearly identifies that bulky aromatic side chains in amino acids cause low Fe/Hf values due to steric hindrance affecting Fe coordination. The physical-chemical insight is strong, connecting steric effects with coordination efficiency. The rule involves complex sub-structures (amino acids with bulky side chains), enhancing complexity. It is supported by data such as (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan), which shows a low Fe/Hf value.

- **Comment 6**:

  Rule 6 is clear in stating that polyether acids with flexible ether linkages ending in a carboxyl group result in high Fe/Hf values. The physical-chemical insight is adequate, suggesting that ether oxygen atoms facilitate Fe coordination by acting as additional coordination sites. The rule combines multiple sub-structures (flexible ether linkages, terminal carboxyl group), adding complexity. It is supported by data points like 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid and 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid, both displaying high Fe/Hf values.

- **Comment 7**:

  Rule 7 clearly differentiates the impact of the carboxyl group's attachment position to heteroaromatic rings on Fe/Hf values. The physical-chemical insight is strong, as the flexibility afforded by an alkyl linker can enhance coordination with Fe ions. The rule's complexity comes from considering both the ring structure and the presence or absence of a linker. It is supported by data like 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid (high Fe/Hf) versus pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (low Fe/Hf).

- **Comment 8**:

  Rule 8 is clear, stating that long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal hydroxyl group tend to result in high Fe/Hf values. The physical-chemical insight is adequate, as the hydroxyl group may provide additional coordination sites for Fe ions. The rule combines chain length with functional groups, increasing complexity. It is supported by data such as 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, which has a high Fe/Hf value.

- **Comment 9**:

  Rule 9 clearly explains that modifiers with multiple carboxyl groups on a short aliphatic chain lead to low Fe/Hf values, potentially due to over-chelation inhibiting effective Fe incorporation. The physical-chemical insight is reasonable, highlighting the negative effect of excessive chelation. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures (multiple carboxyl groups, chain length), adding complexity. It is supported by data like (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid and 4-oxoheptanedioic acid, both showing low Fe/Hf values.

- **Comment 10**:

  Rule 10 is clear in identifying that perfluorinated alkyl chains or highly fluorinated groups result in low Fe/Hf values due to hydrophobicity and steric hindrance. The physical-chemical insight is adequate, as fluorinated groups can resist interaction with Fe ions. The rule focuses on specific sub-structures (perfluorinated chains), contributing to complexity. It is supported by data such as 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid, which exhibits a low Fe/Hf value.

**Explanation and Application of the Rules:**

These rules are formulated based on the structural features of the modifiers and their observed impact on the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst. When applying these rules to predict the Fe/Hf value for a new modifier:

- **Identify functional groups**: Examine the modifier's structure for key functional groups such as amino, carboxyl, hydroxyl, thiol, ether, fluorinated chains, or aromatic rings with substituents.
- **Assess chain length and flexibility**: Consider the length of aliphatic chains and the presence of linkers that provide flexibility versus rigid structures.
- **Evaluate electronic effects**: Determine if substituents on aromatic rings are electron-withdrawing or electron-donating, influencing the acidity of functional groups.
- **Consider steric factors**: Analyze the size and bulkiness of side chains or substituents that could hinder coordination with Fe ions.
- **Apply the relevant rule(s)**: Match the identified features with the corresponding rule(s) to predict whether the modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value.

By following these steps, one can utilize the rules to make informed predictions about new modifiers in the context of optimizing the catalyst's performance for the targeted reaction.

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 2** is clear and specifies that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position result in high Fe/Hf values. The property insight is solid, linking increased acidity due to EWGs with stronger Fe coordination. The complexity is balanced, involving both the aromatic structure and the position-specific substituents. Coverage is good, with examples like 4-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid supporting the rule. This rule meets all the criteria effectively.

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 3** clearly states that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position lead to low Fe/Hf values. The property insight is sound, as EDGs decrease acidity and coordination ability. Complexity is adequate, focusing on substituent effects on aromatic rings. Coverage is strong, with multiple data points such as 4-aminobenzoic acid and 4-methylbenzoic acid confirming the rule. This rule performs well across all criteria.

- **Comment 4**: **Rule 4** is clear in describing modifiers with flexible ether linkages and a terminal carboxyl group resulting in high Fe/Hf values. The property insight explains how ether oxygen atoms add coordination sites. The complexity is reasonable, combining chain flexibility with functional groups. Coverage is acceptable, with at least two supporting examples like 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid and 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid. This rule meets the criteria adequately.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** provides a clear description of modifiers containing thiol groups leading to high Fe/Hf values. The property insight is strong, highlighting sulfur's affinity for Fe ions. Complexity is moderate, encompassing both aromatic and aliphatic thiol-containing acids. Coverage is sufficient, supported by examples such as 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid and 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid. This rule scores well on all criteria.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** states that polyhydroxy aliphatic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group result in low Fe/Hf values due to steric hindrance. Clarity is acceptable, though the term "polyhydroxy" could be more specific. The property insight is logical. However, complexity is high, and coverage is limited, with only one supporting example, (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid. This rule lacks sufficient data support.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** is clear in describing modifiers with highly fluorinated alkyl chains resulting in low Fe/Hf values. The property insight connects electron-withdrawing effects and hydrophobicity with reduced coordination. Complexity is low, focusing on a single structural feature. Coverage is minimal, with only one example, 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid. This rule scores low on coverage.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** clearly explains that modifiers with carboxyl groups directly attached to heteroaromatic rings without alkyl linkers result in low Fe/Hf values, while those with flexible linkers yield high values. The property insight regarding rigidity and coordination geometry is solid. Complexity is appropriate, considering both structural types and their effects. Coverage is good, with examples like pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid supporting both aspects of the rule. This rule meets the criteria well.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** indicates that amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains like indole rings lead to low Fe/Hf values due to steric hindrance. Clarity is acceptable, though "bulky" could be quantified. The property insight is reasonable. Complexity is moderate. Coverage is limited, with only one supporting example, tryptophan, and a counterexample with phenylalanine. This rule needs more data points for stronger support.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** describes long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with additional functional groups leading to high Fe/Hf values. Clarity is good, and the property insight is solid, focusing on chain flexibility and multiple donor sites. Complexity is acceptable. Coverage is sufficient, with examples like 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid and (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid. This rule scores well across the criteria.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** clearly states that modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxyl group result in low Fe/Hf values. The property insight about interference with coordination is sound. Complexity is low to moderate. Coverage is acceptable, with examples like 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid. This rule meets the criteria satisfactorily.

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** reiterates part of Rule 8, focusing on aromatic carboxylic acids linked via flexible alkyl linkers to heteroaromatic rings leading to high Fe/Hf values. Clarity is good, but the rule is somewhat redundant. The property insight mirrors that of Rule 8. Complexity is acceptable. Coverage is adequate with examples like 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid. This rule could be merged with Rule 8 for conciseness.

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13** suggests that modifiers with bulky substituents on aromatic rings connected through flexible linkers result in high Fe/Hf values. Clarity is moderate; "sterically hindered or bulky substituents" is vague. The property insight is plausible but lacks specificity. Complexity is high. Coverage is limited, with only one supporting example, 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid. This rule requires more data and clearer definitions.

- **Comment 14**: **Rule 14** states that keto acids with ketone groups within a flexible chain result in low Fe/Hf values if lacking other coordinating groups. Clarity is acceptable. The property insight is logical. Complexity is moderate. Coverage is minimal, with only one example, 4-oxoheptanedioic acid. This rule lacks sufficient data support.

- **Comment 15**: **Rule 15** indicates that modifiers with amide linkages adjacent to the carboxyl group, especially with hydroxyl groups, lead to low Fe/Hf values. Clarity is acceptable. The property insight about hydrogen bonding is sound. Complexity is moderate. Coverage is limited to one example, 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid. More data points are needed for better support.

These rules have been carefully formulated by analyzing the dataset and considering the underlying physicochemical properties that influence Fe/Hf values. They combine multiple sub-structures and functional groups to predict whether a modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value. The rules aim to cover a broad range of the dataset while striking a balance between simplicity and complexity.

**Notes on the Rules:**

- **Removed Rule 12**: The previous Rule 12, which suggested that amino acids with aromatic side chains tend to result in high Fe/Hf values, has been removed due to conflicting data. While phenylalanine ((2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid) results in a high Fe/Hf value, tryptophan ((2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid) results in a low Fe/Hf value. This indicates that not all amino acids with aromatic side chains lead to high Fe/Hf values, and additional data is required to establish a reliable rule in this category.

- **Merged Rule 13**: The previous Rule 13 has been incorporated into **Rule 11** to highlight the combined effect of amino and sulfur-containing groups in enhancing Fe ion coordination. This consolidation improves the clarity and generality of the rules.

- **Refined Rule 11**: Emphasized the synergistic effect of amino and sulfur-containing groups, recognizing that multiple coordinating atoms enhance Fe ion binding through cooperative interactions.

- **General Adjustments**: Minor revisions have been made to some rules for clarity and to ensure they align closely with the data provided. Examples have been reviewed to confirm their support for each rule.

**Application of the Rules:**

These rules can be used to predict the Fe/Hf outcome for other modifiers based on their structural features:

- **High Fe/Hf Prediction**: Modifiers fitting the descriptions in Rules 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 11 are likely to yield high Fe/Hf values. These features include aliphatic amino acids with long chains, aromatic acids with strong EWGs, thiol groups, multiple ether linkages, flexible linkers to heteroaromatic rings, and combinations of amino and sulfur groups.

- **Low Fe/Hf Prediction**: Modifiers fitting the descriptions in Rules 3, 6, 8, 9, and 10 are likely to yield low Fe/Hf values. These features include aromatic acids with EDGs, multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl, carboxyl groups directly attached to heteroaromatic rings, fluorinated groups, and additional carbonyl groups near the carboxyl group.

By applying these rules, chemists can design or select molecular modifiers that will favor either high or low Fe/Hf values, depending on the desired outcome for the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

---

**Note for Future Considerations:**

- **Data Limitations**: Some rules are based on limited examples due to the dataset size. As more data become available, these rules may need to be refined or expanded to improve their accuracy and applicability.

- **Steric and Electronic Factors**: The balance between steric hindrance and electronic effects is crucial in determining Fe ion coordination. Modifiers with bulky groups near coordination sites may reduce Fe/Hf values despite containing potentially coordinating functional groups.

- **Synergistic Effects**: The presence of multiple functional groups capable of coordinating with Fe ions can have a synergistic effect, enhancing Fe/Hf values beyond what might be predicted by considering each group independently.

---

These refined rules provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the relationship between modifier structures and Fe/Hf values, aligning with the requirements for generating rules and considering the underlying physicochemical properties.

The rule combines sub-structures (aliphatic chain, carboxyl group, terminal hydroxyl group), adding complexity. Coverage is limited to one data point (**7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**), weakening support for the rule. The balance between complexity and coverage could be enhanced with more examples.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear and allows us to predict high Fe/Hf values for amino acids with small or non-bulky side chains. The property insight is sound, noting that reduced steric hindrance allows better Fe coordination. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures (amino acid backbone, side chain size), contributing to complexity. Coverage is good, with at least two data points (**(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid**, **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid**) supporting the rule. The balance between complexity and coverage is well-achieved.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 clearly indicates that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position tend to result in low Fe/Hf values. The property insight is valid, as EDGs decrease acidity, hindering Fe coordination. The rule combines sub-structures (aromatic ring, carboxyl group, EDG at para position), adding complexity. Coverage is adequate with at least two data points (**4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-methylbenzoic acid**) supporting the rule. The balance is appropriate.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear, stating that modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group tend to result in low Fe/Hf values. The property insight is logical, explaining that intramolecular hydrogen bonds reduce availability for Fe coordination. The rule considers specific sub-structures, adding complexity. Coverage is limited to one data point (**(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**), which weakens its support. The balance could be improved with additional supporting data.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear in predicting low Fe/Hf values for modifiers with carbonyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group. The property insight is valid, suggesting that additional carbonyl groups may compete for coordination or introduce steric hindrance. The rule combines sub-structures (adjacent carbonyl and carboxyl groups), adding complexity. Coverage is adequate with at least two supporting data points (**4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**). The balance is acceptable.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 clearly states that modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups tend to result in low Fe/Hf values. The property insight is appropriate, as electronegative fluorine atoms reduce coordination efficiency. The rule focuses on specific functional groups, providing necessary complexity. Coverage is sufficient with at least two data points (**2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**, **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**) supporting the rule. The balance between complexity and coverage is good.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear and predicts low Fe/Hf values for modifiers where the carboxyl group is directly attached to a rigid heteroaromatic ring. The property insight is sound, indicating that rigidity and steric factors limit effective Fe binding. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures, adding complexity. Coverage is adequate with two data points (**pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**) supporting the rule. The balance is satisfactory.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 lacks consistency and clarity due to conflicting data. While it states that amino acids with bulky or heteroatom-containing side chains tend to result in low Fe/Hf values, the data shows inconsistency. **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan) aligns with the rule by showing a low Fe/Hf value. However, **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** contradicts the rule by showing a high Fe/Hf value. The property insight is plausible but not consistently supported by the data. Coverage is insufficient and includes contradictory examples, weakening the rule's validity. The balance between complexity and coverage is poor.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear in predicting low Fe/Hf values for modifiers containing aromatic hydroxyl groups. The property insight is valid, noting that phenolic hydroxyl groups can engage in hydrogen bonding, interfering with Fe coordination. The rule focuses on specific sub-structures, adding appropriate complexity. Coverage is sufficient with multiple data points (**5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**, **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**, **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**) supporting the rule. The balance between complexity and coverage is well-maintained.

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal primary amino group (–NH₂) and a carbon chain length of four or more carbons tend to result in high Fe/Hf values.** The combination of the amino and carboxyl groups allows for effective bidentate coordination with Fe ions, enhancing metal incorporation.

  - *Examples*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**.
  - *Prediction*: Modifiers fitting this description will likely yield a **high Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 2**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position, such as nitro (–NO₂), bromomethyl (–CH₂Br), or pyridyl rings, tend to result in high Fe/Hf values.** EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  - *Examples*: **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**, **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Prediction*: Such modifiers will likely yield a **high Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing both thiol groups (–SH) and carboxylic acid groups tend to result in high Fe/Hf values.** Sulfur atoms in thiol groups have lone pairs that coordinate strongly with Fe ions, while the carboxyl group provides additional binding sites.

  - *Examples*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**, **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Prediction*: Modifiers with both thiol and carboxyl groups will likely yield a **high Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with ether linkages in the backbone and terminal amino groups tend to result in high Fe/Hf values.** The ether oxygens and amino groups offer multiple coordination sites, facilitating Fe incorporation.

  - *Examples*: **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**, **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.
  - *Prediction*: Such modifiers will likely yield a **high Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 5**: **Aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal hydroxyl groups (–OH) on a carbon chain of six or more carbons tend to result in high Fe/Hf values.** The hydroxyl group provides an additional coordination site without significant steric hindrance.

  - *Example*: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**.
  - *Prediction*: Modifiers fitting this description will likely yield a **high Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 6**: **Amino acids with small to medium-sized side chains that can participate in coordination tend to result in high Fe/Hf values.** These side chains allow for multiple binding interactions without excessive steric hindrance.

  - *Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid), **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine).
  - *Prediction*: Such amino acids will likely yield a **high Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position, such as amino (–NH₂), methyl (–CH₃), or hydroxyl (–OH), tend to result in low Fe/Hf values.** EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  - *Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
  - *Prediction*: Such modifiers will likely yield a **low Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group tend to result in low Fe/Hf values.** The presence of multiple hydroxyls can lead to intramolecular hydrogen bonding, making the carboxyl group less available for metal coordination.

  - *Example*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid).
  - *Prediction*: Modifiers with clustered hydroxyl groups will likely yield a **low Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing additional carbonyl groups (aldehyde or ketone) adjacent to the carboxyl group tend to result in low Fe/Hf values.** These carbonyl groups may compete with the carboxyl group for coordination or introduce electron-withdrawing effects that reduce binding affinity.

  - *Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**, **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**.
  - *Prediction*: Such modifiers will likely yield a **low Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups tend to result in low Fe/Hf values.** The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms decreases the electron density on the carboxyl group, hindering effective coordination with Fe ions.

  - *Examples*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**, **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**.
  - *Prediction*: Such modifiers will likely yield a **low Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers where the carboxyl group is directly attached to a rigid heteroaromatic ring without additional coordinating groups tend to result in low Fe/Hf values.** The rigidity and lack of flexible binding sites reduce the ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  - *Examples*: **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**, **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**.
  - *Prediction*: Such modifiers will likely yield a **low Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 12**: **Amino acids with bulky or heterocyclic side chains tend to result in low Fe/Hf values.** Bulky side chains introduce steric hindrance, and heterocycles may not effectively participate in coordination due to electron delocalization.

  - *Examples*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan), **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
  - *Prediction*: Such amino acids will likely yield a **low Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing aromatic hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group tend to result in low Fe/Hf values.** Phenolic hydroxyl groups can form strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds or engage in competing interactions, reducing coordination efficiency with Fe ions.

  - *Examples*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**, **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**, **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**.
  - *Prediction*: Such modifiers will likely yield a **low Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with saccharide or polyol structures tend to result in low Fe/Hf values.** Multiple hydroxyl groups in sugars can form extensive hydrogen-bonding networks, limiting the availability of coordination sites for Fe ions.

  - *Example*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid).
  - *Prediction*: Modifiers with sugar-like structures will likely yield a **low Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids containing both ether linkages and bulky substituents tend to result in low Fe/Hf values.** The ether oxygen may not be in an optimal position for coordination, and bulky groups can hinder access to the carboxyl group.

  - *Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.
  - *Prediction*: Such modifiers will likely yield a **low Fe/Hf value**.
