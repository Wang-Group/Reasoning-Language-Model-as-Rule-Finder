**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal primary amino group (–NH₂) and a carbon chain length of four or more carbons tend to result in high Fe/Hf values.** The combination of the amino and carboxyl groups allows for effective bidentate coordination with Fe ions, enhancing metal incorporation.

  - *Examples*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**.
  - *Prediction*: Modifiers fitting this description will likely yield a **high Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 2**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position, such as nitro (–NO₂), bromomethyl (–CH₂Br), or pyridyl rings, tend to result in high Fe/Hf values.** EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  - *Examples*: **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**, **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Prediction*: Such modifiers will likely yield a **high Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing both thiol groups (–SH) and carboxylic acid groups tend to result in high Fe/Hf values.** Sulfur atoms in thiol groups have lone pairs that coordinate strongly with Fe ions, while the carboxyl group provides additional binding sites.

  - *Examples*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**, **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Prediction*: Modifiers with both thiol and carboxyl groups will likely yield a **high Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with ether linkages in the backbone and terminal amino groups tend to result in high Fe/Hf values.** The ether oxygens and amino groups offer multiple coordination sites, facilitating Fe incorporation.

  - *Examples*: **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**, **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.
  - *Prediction*: Such modifiers will likely yield a **high Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 5**: **Aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal hydroxyl groups (–OH) on a carbon chain of six or more carbons tend to result in high Fe/Hf values.** The hydroxyl group provides an additional coordination site without significant steric hindrance.

  - *Example*: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**.
  - *Prediction*: Modifiers fitting this description will likely yield a **high Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 6**: **Amino acids with small to medium-sized side chains that can participate in coordination tend to result in high Fe/Hf values.** These side chains allow for multiple binding interactions without excessive steric hindrance.

  - *Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid), **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine).
  - *Prediction*: Such amino acids will likely yield a **high Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position, such as amino (–NH₂), methyl (–CH₃), or hydroxyl (–OH), tend to result in low Fe/Hf values.** EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  - *Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
  - *Prediction*: Such modifiers will likely yield a **low Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group tend to result in low Fe/Hf values.** The presence of multiple hydroxyls can lead to intramolecular hydrogen bonding, making the carboxyl group less available for metal coordination.

  - *Example*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid).
  - *Prediction*: Modifiers with clustered hydroxyl groups will likely yield a **low Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing additional carbonyl groups (aldehyde or ketone) adjacent to the carboxyl group tend to result in low Fe/Hf values.** These carbonyl groups may compete with the carboxyl group for coordination or introduce electron-withdrawing effects that reduce binding affinity.

  - *Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**, **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**.
  - *Prediction*: Such modifiers will likely yield a **low Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups tend to result in low Fe/Hf values.** The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms decreases the electron density on the carboxyl group, hindering effective coordination with Fe ions.

  - *Examples*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**, **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**.
  - *Prediction*: Such modifiers will likely yield a **low Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers where the carboxyl group is directly attached to a rigid heteroaromatic ring without additional coordinating groups tend to result in low Fe/Hf values.** The rigidity and lack of flexible binding sites reduce the ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  - *Examples*: **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**, **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**.
  - *Prediction*: Such modifiers will likely yield a **low Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 12**: **Amino acids with bulky or heterocyclic side chains tend to result in low Fe/Hf values.** Bulky side chains introduce steric hindrance, and heterocycles may not effectively participate in coordination due to electron delocalization.

  - *Examples*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan), **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
  - *Prediction*: Such amino acids will likely yield a **low Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing aromatic hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group tend to result in low Fe/Hf values.** Phenolic hydroxyl groups can form strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds or engage in competing interactions, reducing coordination efficiency with Fe ions.

  - *Examples*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**, **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**, **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**.
  - *Prediction*: Such modifiers will likely yield a **low Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with saccharide or polyol structures tend to result in low Fe/Hf values.** Multiple hydroxyl groups in sugars can form extensive hydrogen-bonding networks, limiting the availability of coordination sites for Fe ions.

  - *Example*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid).
  - *Prediction*: Modifiers with sugar-like structures will likely yield a **low Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids containing both ether linkages and bulky substituents tend to result in low Fe/Hf values.** The ether oxygen may not be in an optimal position for coordination, and bulky groups can hinder access to the carboxyl group.

  - *Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.
  - *Prediction*: Such modifiers will likely yield a **low Fe/Hf value**.
