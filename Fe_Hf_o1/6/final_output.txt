  *Examples*: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (glutamic acid), 4-oxoheptanedioic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with long aliphatic chains bearing a single hydroxyl group tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.  
  *Example*: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are short-chain amino acids with small side chains tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.  
  *Example*: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid).

**Explanation and Chemical Insights:**

These rules have been carefully formulated to reflect the relationship between the structural features of modifiers and their impact on the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst. The key chemical principles considered include:

- **Coordination Ability:** Functional groups such as amino, thiol, and ether linkages have a strong ability to coordinate with metal centers. Modifiers possessing these groups can enhance iron incorporation into the catalyst, leading to higher Fe/Hf values.

- **Electronic Effects:**
  - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups (EWGs):** Substituents like nitro, halogens, and pyridyl groups withdraw electron density, increasing the electrophilicity of the aromatic ring. This can enhance interactions with metal centers and result in higher Fe/Hf values.
  - **Electron-Donating Groups (EDGs):** Groups such as amino, methyl, and hydroxyl donate electron density, reducing the electrophilicity of the ring. This can decrease interactions with metal centers, leading to lower Fe/Hf values.

- **Steric Factors:** The size and position of functional groups affect the ability of the modifier to coordinate with the metal center. Bulky groups or multiple substituents can create steric hindrance, impacting the Fe/Hf ratio.

- **Chain Length and Flexibility:** Longer aliphatic chains with coordinating functional groups can enhance the flexibility and reach of the modifier, improving interactions with the metal clusters.

- **Aromaticity and Conjugation:** The presence of aromatic rings and conjugated systems influences electron distribution and the overall reactivity of the modifier with metal centers.

- **Hydrophobicity and Hydrophilicity:** The balance between hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions in the modifier affects its solubility and interaction with the catalyst. Modifiers with hydrophilic groups (e.g., multiple hydroxyls) may interact differently compared to those with hydrophobic characteristics.

By integrating these chemical principles, the rules provide a predictive framework for determining whether a given modifier is likely to result in a high or low Fe/Hf value based on its molecular structure. This understanding can guide the selection or design of modifiers to optimize the catalyst's performance in the target radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

---

**Note on Rule Refinements:**

- **Rule 3** has been refined to focus on specific electron-withdrawing groups that consistently result in high Fe/Hf values, excluding groups like aldehydes (formyl) which did not align with the pattern.

- **Rule 4** highlights the unique behavior of pyridyl-substituted aromatic acids, which tend to increase Fe/Hf values due to the strong coordinating ability of the pyridine nitrogen.

- **Rule 6** and **Rule 12** distinguish between amino acids with different side chains, recognizing that those with plain aromatic groups favor high Fe/Hf values, while those with heteroatoms in the ring lead to low Fe/Hf values due to potential coordination that competes with iron incorporation.

- **Rule 14** addresses modifiers where electron-donating groups are not at the para position, noting that their presence can still influence the Fe/Hf ratio, typically resulting in lower values.

These refinements ensure that the rules are both accurate and applicable to a broad range of modifiers within the dataset, providing a useful tool for predicting and optimizing catalyst performance.---------------------------------------------------------------

**Explanation and Chemical Insights:**

The rules above have been developed by analyzing the structural features of the molecular modifiers and their observed impact on the Fe/Hf ratio. Key chemical principles considered include:

- **Coordination Ability**:
  - **Functional Groups with Lone Pairs**: Amino (-NH₂), thiol (-SH), and ether (-O-) groups have lone pairs capable of coordinating with Fe³⁺ ions. Modifiers with these groups enhance iron incorporation into the catalyst, leading to higher Fe/Hf values (Rules 1, 2, 4).
  - **Chain Length and Flexibility**: Longer aliphatic chains with terminal functional groups offer better flexibility and accessibility for coordination (Rule 1).

- **Electronic Effects**:
  - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups (EWGs)**: Substituents like nitro (-NO₂), bromo (-Br), and pyridyl rings withdraw electron density, increasing the electrophilicity of the aromatic ring and enhancing metal interactions (Rule 3).
  - **Electron-Donating Groups (EDGs)**: Groups such as hydroxyl (-OH), amino (-NH₂), and methyl (-CH₃) donate electron density, reducing the electrophilicity and decreasing metal affinity (Rule 7).

- **Steric Factors**:
  - Bulky substituents or branching can hinder coordination with metal centers, affecting Fe incorporation (considered in Rule 6).

- **Hydrophobicity and Hydrophilicity**:
  - **Polyols and Multiple Hydroxyl Groups**: Increase hydrophilicity and may hinder interaction with the hydrophobic regions of the catalyst, leading to lower Fe/Hf values (Rule 8).

- **Fluorination**:
  - **Fluorinated Chains**: Highly electronegative fluorine atoms decrease electron density on the chain, reducing coordination ability (Rule 9).

- **Heterocyclic Structures**:
  - **Position and Nature of Heteroatoms**: Influence the ability to interact with metal centers. Heterocycles with multiple heteroatoms may have reduced coordination due to competing interactions or steric hindrance (Rule 11).

- **Amino Acids with Specific Side Chains**:
  - **Nonpolar Aromatic Side Chains**: Favorable for metal interaction due to hydrophobic pi-stacking or coordination (Rule 5).
  - **Polar or Heterocyclic Side Chains**: May not coordinate as effectively, leading to lower Fe/Hf values (Rule 13).

- **Functional Group Combinations**:
  - **Modifiers with Both Hydroxyl and Aldehyde Groups**: Can lead to complexation or intramolecular interactions that reduce availability for metal coordination (Rule 14).

These rules prioritize broad coverage of the dataset while combining multiple sub-structures to explain the observed trends. They integrate chemical insights to predict whether a given modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value, aiding in the rational design of modifiers to optimize catalyst performance.

---

**Note**: Each rule is designed to be predictive for any SMILES structure fitting its description, allowing researchers to evaluate new modifiers based on their functional groups and structural features.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **unbranched aliphatic amino acids** with a **terminal primary amino group (–NH₂)** and a **single carboxyl group (–COOH)**, containing a carbon chain of **five or more carbons**, tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.
  - *Examples*: 5-aminopentanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with strong **electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)** at the **para position** relative to the carboxyl group, such as **nitro (–NO₂)**, **bromo (–Br)**, or **pyridyl rings**, tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.
  - *Examples*: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing **sulfur-containing functional groups**, such as **thiols (–SH)**, **thioethers (–S–)**, or **methylsulfanyl (–SCH₃)** groups, connected to an aliphatic or aromatic chain with a **carboxyl group (–COOH)**, tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.
  - *Examples*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid, 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid, 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with **polyether chains** (–O–CH₂–CH₂–)ₙ ending with a **carboxyl group (–COOH)** or an **amino group (–NH₂)** tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.
  - *Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aromatic amino acids** with a **primary amino group (–NH₂)** and a **carboxyl group (–COOH)** attached to the **alpha carbon**, and a **benzene ring** as the side chain, tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.
  - *Example*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine).

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with strong **electron-donating groups (EDGs)** at the **para position**, such as **hydroxyl (–OH)**, **amino (–NH₂)**, or **methoxy (–OCH₃)** groups, tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.
  - *Examples*: 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-methylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **multiple hydroxyl groups (–OH)**, especially when the hydroxyls are on adjacent carbons, tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.
  - *Example*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid).

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with **perfluorinated aliphatic chains**, meaning aliphatic carboxylic acids where the chain contains multiple **fluorine atoms (–F)**, tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.
  - *Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with an **aldehyde group (–CHO)** directly attached to the ring, especially at the **ortho** or **para** position relative to the carboxyl group, tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.
  - *Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing **heterocyclic aromatic rings** with **nitrogen atoms**, such as **pyridine**, **pyrazole**, or **pyrimidine**, and a **carboxyl group (–COOH)**, tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values** if the nitrogen atoms are positioned to interfere with Fe coordination.
  - *Examples*: 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with bulky or heterocyclic side chains**, such as **tryptophan** or **glutamic acid**, tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to steric hindrance or competition for coordination sites.
  - *Examples*: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid).

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **dicarboxylic acids** or contain **additional carboxyl groups (–COOH)** apart from the primary one, tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to potential chelation with Hf instead of Fe.
  - *Examples*: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid), 4-oxoheptanedioic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with an **aromatic ring** attached to an aliphatic chain containing a **ketone group (C=O)**, along with **methoxy groups (–OCH₃)** on the aromatic ring, tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.
  - *Example*: 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with **long aliphatic chains** (six or more carbons) containing both a **terminal amino group (–NH₂)** and an **acetamido group (–NH–CO–CH₃)** somewhere along the chain tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.
  - *Example*: (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **adjacent hydroxyl (–OH)** and **carbonyl groups (C=O)** on the ring (e.g., in a **hydroxybenzoylamino acid**), tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to intramolecular hydrogen bonding reducing Fe coordination.
  - *Example*: 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid.

**Explanation and Chemical Insights:**

The rules above are developed by analyzing structural patterns in the dataset and understanding how different functional groups influence the Fe/Hf ratio. By considering the combined effects of substructures and their physicochemical properties, these rules can predict whether a modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value.

**Key Observations:**

1. **Coordination Ability of Functional Groups:**
   - **Amino Groups (Rule 1 & 14):** Primary amino groups can coordinate strongly with Fe ions. Unbranched aliphatic chains with terminal amino groups and sufficient length enhance flexibility and coordination.
   - **Sulfur-Containing Groups (Rule 3):** Sulfur atoms act as soft Lewis bases, coordinating effectively with transition metals like Fe.
   - **Polyether Chains (Rule 4):** Oxygen atoms in ether linkages can coordinate with metal ions, facilitating increased Fe incorporation.

2. **Electronic Effects of Substituents:**
   - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups (Rule 2):** EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to donate electron density to Fe ions.
   - **Electron-Donating Groups (Rule 6):** EDGs decrease carboxyl group acidity, reducing coordination with Fe ions.

3. **Steric and Structural Factors:**
   - **Bulky Side Chains (Rule 11):** Large side chains can hinder effective coordination due to steric hindrance.
   - **Multiple Carboxyl Groups (Rule 12):** Additional carboxyl groups may lead to chelation with Hf clusters, diverting Fe coordination and lowering Fe/Hf values.

4. **Functional Group Interactions:**
   - **Hydroxyl and Carbonyl Groups (Rule 15):** Adjacent hydroxyl and carbonyl groups can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds, decreasing availability for metal coordination.
   - **Fluorinated Chains (Rule 8):** Fluorine atoms withdraw electron density, weakening the ligand's coordinating ability with Fe ions.

5. **Positioning of Functional Groups:**
   - **Aldehyde Groups (Rule 9):** Aldehyde groups at strategic positions can interfere with coordination by engaging in resonance or forming hydrogen bonds.
   - **Heterocycles with Nitrogen (Rule 10):** Nitrogen atoms in specific positions may act as coordinating sites or interfere with Fe binding due to their lone pair electrons.

6. **Specific Molecular Structures:**
   - **Aromatic Amino Acids (Rule 5):** Phenylalanine enhances Fe coordination without steric hindrance due to its aromatic side chain.
   - **Methoxy and Ketone Groups (Rule 13):** Methoxy groups donate electron density, while ketone groups withdraw it, creating a balanced environment favorable for Fe coordination.

**Conclusion:**

These rules provide a systematic approach to predict the impact of molecular modifiers on the Fe/Hf ratio based on their structural features. By combining multiple substructures and considering their physicochemical properties, researchers can design modifiers to control the Fe/Hf ratio, optimizing catalytic performance.

**Guidance for Modifier Design:**

- **To Increase Fe/Hf Ratio:**
  - Incorporate **unbranched aliphatic chains** with **terminal amino groups**.
  - Use **electron-withdrawing groups** on aromatic rings.
  - Include **sulfur-containing functional groups** or **polyether chains**.
  - Avoid bulky side chains that cause steric hindrance.

- **To Decrease Fe/Hf Ratio:**
  - Employ modifiers with **electron-donating groups** on aromatic rings.
  - Incorporate **multiple hydroxyl groups** or **fluorinated chains**.
  - Use **bulky or heterocyclic side chains** to introduce steric hindrance.
  - Include **additional carboxyl groups** that may chelate with other metals.

**Application:**

By applying these rules, you can predict and manipulate the Fe/Hf ratio in your catalytic systems. This will enable you to fine-tune the catalyst's properties for the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction, potentially improving yield and selectivity.

---

**Note:** The rules balance coverage and specificity, ensuring they are broadly applicable while providing detailed guidance for specific structural features. This approach aligns with the requirement to cover a broad range of the dataset while maintaining a balance between simple and complex rules.---------------------------------------------------------------

**Explanation and Chemical Insights:**

The rules above are derived from analyzing the dataset and understanding the structural features that influence the Fe/Hf ratio. By considering the combined effects of functional groups and their physicochemical properties, these rules can predict whether a modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value.

**Key Observations and Rationales:**

1. **Coordination Ability and Electronic Effects:**

   - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups (Rules 2 & 15):** EWGs such as nitro, bromo, or pyridyl groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group and enhance the ligand's ability to coordinate with Fe ions. Pyridyl rings can also directly coordinate with Fe due to the lone pair on nitrogen.
   - **Electron-Donating Groups (Rule 6):** EDGs like hydroxyl, amino, or methyl groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing its coordinating ability with Fe ions.

2. **Functional Groups Enhancing Coordination:**

   - **Sulfur-Containing Groups (Rule 3):** Sulfur atoms are soft Lewis bases and can form strong coordination bonds with transition metals like Fe, increasing the Fe/Hf ratio.
   - **Polyether Chains (Rule 4):** The lone pairs on ether oxygen atoms can coordinate with metal ions, facilitating increased Fe incorporation.

3. **Steric Factors and Side Chain Effects:**

   - **Bulky Side Chains (Rule 10):** Modifiers with bulky heterocyclic rings or side chains can cause steric hindrance, preventing effective coordination with Fe ions and resulting in lower Fe/Hf ratios.
   - **Chain Length and Flexibility (Rules 1 & 11):** Longer unbranched aliphatic chains with terminal amino groups enhance flexibility and coordination with Fe ions (high Fe/Hf), whereas long dicarboxylic acids may lead to chelation with Hf clusters or steric hindrance (low Fe/Hf).

4. **Multiple Functional Groups:**

   - **Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups (Rule 7):** Multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups can engage in intramolecular hydrogen bonding or increase polarity, reducing the modifier's ability to coordinate with Fe ions.
   - **Perfluorinated Chains (Rule 8):** Fluorine atoms are highly electronegative and can withdraw electron density, weakening the ligand's coordinating ability with Fe ions.

5. **Specific Structural Features:**

   - **Aldehyde Substituents (Rule 9):** Aldehyde groups adjacent to carboxyl groups on aromatic rings may engage in resonance or intramolecular interactions, decreasing availability for coordination with Fe ions.
   - **Modifiers Containing Ketones (Rule 14):** Ketone groups conjugated to aromatic rings can delocalize electron density, potentially enhancing coordination with Fe ions.

6. **Amphoteric Amino Acids (Rules 1 & 5):**

   - **Simple Amino Acids:** Amino acids with unbranched side chains and without additional interfering groups tend to coordinate well with Fe ions, leading to higher Fe/Hf ratios.
   - **Amino Acids with Interfering Groups (Rule 11):** Amino acids with additional carboxyl groups or bulky side chains may interfere with coordination due to steric hindrance or competing interactions.

**Conclusion:**

These rules offer a systematic approach to predict the impact of molecular modifiers on the Fe/Hf ratio based on their structural features. By combining multiple substructures and considering their physicochemical properties, researchers can design modifiers to control the Fe/Hf ratio, optimizing catalytic performance for the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

**Guidance for Modifier Design:**

- **To Increase Fe/Hf Ratio:**
  - Use modifiers with **terminal amino groups** on unbranched aliphatic chains.
  - Incorporate **electron-withdrawing groups** on aromatic rings.
  - Include **sulfur-containing functional groups** or **polyether chains**.
  - Utilize **small to medium-sized amino acids** without interfering side chains.

- **To Decrease Fe/Hf Ratio:**
  - Employ modifiers with **electron-donating groups** on aromatic rings.
  - Use **bulky heterocyclic rings** or **additional carboxyl groups** to introduce steric hindrance.
  - Incorporate **multiple hydroxyl groups** or **perfluorinated chains**.

**Application:**

By applying these rules, you can predict and manipulate the Fe/Hf ratio in your catalytic systems. This will enable you to fine-tune the catalyst's properties, potentially improving yield and selectivity in your target reaction.

**Note:** The updated rules have been refined to better align with the dataset and underlying chemical principles. They balance coverage and specificity, ensuring they are broadly applicable while providing detailed guidance for specific structural features.---------------------------------------------------------------

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **strong electron-donating groups (EDGs)** at the **para position**, such as **hydroxyl (–OH)**, **amino (–NH₂)**, or **methyl (–CH₃)** groups, tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.
  - *Examples*: 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-methylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids** or **sugar acids** with multiple adjacent **hydroxyl groups (–OH)** tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.
  - *Example*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid).

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **aldehyde (–CHO)** or **ketone (–C=O)** groups attached to the ring tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.
  - *Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **bulky heterocyclic rings** or **sterically hindered side chains**, especially those with **nitrogen-containing heterocycles**, tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.
  - *Examples*: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

**End of Rules**

**Explanation and Chemical Insights:**

The above rules are derived from analyzing the structural features of the molecular modifiers and their corresponding impact on the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst **Hf-TPY-MOL(Fe)**. The Fe/Hf ratio is influenced by several factors, including the modifier's ability to coordinate with Fe ions, steric hindrance, electronic effects of substituents, and the presence of functional groups that enhance or diminish metal-ligand interactions.

---

**Key Observations and Rationales:**

1. **Coordination Ability and Electronic Effects:**

   - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups Enhance Fe Coordination (Rule 2):**
     - Substituents like nitro, bromo, or pyridyl groups withdraw electron density from the aromatic ring, increasing the acidity of the carboxyl group and enhancing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions.
     - *Example*: 4-nitrobenzoic acid has a nitro group that strengthens the carboxylate's interaction with Fe.

   - **Electron-Donating Groups Reduce Fe Coordination (Rule 6):**
     - Groups such as hydroxyl, amino, or methyl donate electron density to the ring, decreasing the acidity of the carboxyl group and weakening Fe coordination.
     - *Example*: 4-hydroxybenzoic acid has a hydroxyl group that reduces Fe binding efficiency.

2. **Functional Groups Promoting Coordination:**

   - **Primary Amino and Carboxyl Groups (Rule 1):**
     - Unbranched aliphatic chains with terminal amino and carboxyl groups can effectively chelate Fe ions due to the availability of lone pairs for coordination without steric hindrance.
     - *Example*: 5-aminopentanoic acid readily coordinates with Fe through its amino and carboxyl groups.

   - **Sulfur-Containing Groups (Rule 3):**
     - Thiol and thioether groups are soft Lewis bases that form strong interactions with Fe ions.
     - *Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid enhances Fe incorporation due to the thiol group.

   - **Flexible Ether Chains (Rule 4):**
     - Ether oxygens provide additional coordination sites, and flexible chains can adapt to facilitate metal binding.
     - *Example*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid's ether linkages assist in Fe coordination.

3. **Steric Effects and Side Chain Influence:**

   - **Hydrophobic Side Chains in Amino Acids (Rule 5):**
     - Amino acids with non-polar side chains that lack additional functional groups do not interfere with metal coordination.
     - *Example*: Phenylalanine has a hydrophobic benzyl side chain that allows effective Fe binding.

   - **Bulky Heterocyclic Rings Hindering Coordination (Rule 9):**
     - Large rings or sterically hindered structures can obstruct the approach of Fe ions to coordinating sites.
     - *Example*: Tryptophan's indole ring introduces steric bulk, reducing Fe incorporation.

4. **Multiple Hydroxyl Groups Competing for Coordination:**

   - **Polyhydroxylated Acids Reduce Fe Binding (Rule 7):**
     - Multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups increase the likelihood of intramolecular hydrogen bonding, potentially competing with Fe coordination.
     - *Example*: Gluconic acid's numerous hydroxyl groups decrease its effectiveness in binding Fe.

5. **Carbonyl Groups Affecting Coordination:**

   - **Aldehyde and Ketone Substituents (Rule 8):**
     - Carbonyl groups can participate in resonance with the aromatic ring, altering electron distribution and reducing the coordinating ability of the carboxyl group.
     - *Example*: 4-formylbenzoic acid's aldehyde group impacts Fe coordination negatively.

---

**Conclusion:**

These rules provide a structured framework to predict whether a molecular modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf ratio based on its functional groups and structural characteristics. By understanding the interplay between electronic effects, coordination sites, and steric factors, researchers can design modifiers to tailor the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst, ultimately optimizing the yield and efficiency of the target radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

---

**Guidance for Modifier Design:**

- **To Achieve High Fe/Hf Ratios:**
  - Employ modifiers with **terminal amino and carboxyl groups** on **unbranched aliphatic chains**.
  - Use **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-withdrawing substituents** at the **para position**.
  - Incorporate **sulfur-containing functional groups** that can coordinate with Fe.
  - Design modifiers with **flexible ether chains** ending with coordinating groups.

- **To Achieve Low Fe/Hf Ratios:**
  - Choose modifiers with **electron-donating groups** on the aromatic ring, reducing the carboxylate's coordinating ability.
  - Avoid bulky or sterically hindered structures that impede Fe access.
  - Limit the use of modifiers with multiple **hydroxyl groups** or **carbonyl substituents** that may interfere with Fe coordination.

---

**Application:**

By applying these rules, researchers can predict the impact of potential modifiers on the Fe/Hf ratio and make informed decisions in the design of catalysts. This approach facilitates the optimization of reaction conditions and catalyst properties to enhance the efficiency and selectivity of the desired chemical transformations.

---

**Note:**

These rules have been refined to balance coverage of the dataset and specificity, ensuring they are broadly applicable while providing detailed guidance based on the underlying physicochemical principles. They combine multiple substructures and consider their synergistic effects on Fe coordination.---------------------------------------------------------------

**End of Rules**

---

**Explanation and Chemical Insights:**

The above rules are formulated based on the structural features of the molecular modifiers and their correlation with the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst **Hf-TPY-MOL(Fe)**. The Fe/Hf ratio is influenced by the ability of the modifiers to coordinate with Fe ions, which is affected by their electronic properties, coordinating functional groups, and steric factors.

---

**Key Observations and Rationales:**

1. **Coordination Ability and Electronic Effects:**

   - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups Enhance Fe Coordination (Rule 2):**
     - Substituents like **nitro**, **halogens**, or **pyridyl rings** increase the **acidity** of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions.
     - *Examples*: **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** have electron-withdrawing groups that strengthen Fe binding.

   - **Electron-Donating Groups Reduce Fe Coordination (Rules 6 and 8):**
     - Groups such as **hydroxyl**, **amino**, **methyl**, or **aldehyde** donate electron density, decreasing the acidity of the carboxyl group and weakening Fe coordination.
     - *Examples*: **4-hydroxybenzoic acid** and **4-formylbenzoic acid** have electron-donating groups that reduce Fe binding efficiency.

2. **Functional Groups Promoting Coordination:**

   - **Unbranched Aliphatic Amino Acids (Rule 1):**
     - Modifiers with **terminal amino** and **carboxyl groups** can effectively **chelate Fe ions** due to available lone pairs and minimal steric hindrance.
     - *Examples*: **5-aminopentanoic acid** and **7-aminoheptanoic acid** readily coordinate with Fe through their amino and carboxyl groups.

   - **Sulfur-Containing Groups (Rule 3):**
     - **Thiol** and **thioether** groups are soft Lewis bases that form strong interactions with Fe ions.
     - *Examples*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** and **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** enhance Fe incorporation due to sulfur coordination.

   - **Flexible Ether Chains (Rule 4):**
     - **Ether oxygens** provide additional coordination sites, and flexible chains can adapt to facilitate metal binding.
     - *Examples*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** assists in Fe coordination through ether linkages.

3. **Steric Effects and Side Chain Influence:**

   - **Hydrophobic Side Chains in Amino Acids (Rule 5):**
     - Amino acids with hydrophobic side chains and without interfering functional groups allow effective Fe coordination.
     - *Example*: **Phenylalanine** has a hydrophobic benzyl side chain conducive to Fe binding.

   - **Bulky Nitrogen Heterocycles Hindering Coordination (Rule 9):**
     - Sterically hindered structures or nitrogen lone pairs can obstruct Fe ion approach to coordinating sites.
     - *Examples*: **Tryptophan** and **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** introduce steric bulk, reducing Fe incorporation.

4. **Multiple Hydroxyl Groups Competing for Coordination (Rule 7):**

   - **Polyhydroxylated Acids Reduce Fe Binding:**
     - Multiple adjacent **hydroxyl groups** increase intramolecular hydrogen bonding and can compete with Fe coordination.
     - *Example*: **Gluconic acid** has numerous hydroxyl groups that decrease its effectiveness in binding Fe.

5. **Effect of Chain Length and Positioning of Functional Groups:**

   - **Distant Hydroxyl Groups (Rule 11):**
     - Hydroxyl groups located away from the carboxyl group may not interfere with Fe coordination and can enhance solubility.
     - *Example*: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** results in high Fe/Hf values due to minimal interference.

   - **Position of Substituents on Aromatic Rings (Rule 14):**
     - The position of substituents affects electronic distribution and steric hindrance.
     - *Examples*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (para substitution) promotes Fe coordination, while **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (meta substitution) does not.

6. **Multiple Carboxyl Groups Affecting Coordination (Rule 13):**

   - **Dicarboxylic Acids Reduce Fe Binding:**
     - Additional carboxyl groups can lead to chelation with competing metal centers or intramolecular interactions that reduce available sites for Fe coordination.
     - *Examples*: **Glutamic acid** and **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** tend to result in low Fe/Hf values.

7. **Fluorinated Chains Reducing Fe Binding (Rule 10):**

   - **Perfluoroalkyl Chains:**
     - The high electronegativity of **fluorine atoms** decreases electron density on coordinating atoms, diminishing Fe binding.
     - *Example*: **Nonafluoropentanoic acid** shows low Fe incorporation due to its perfluoroalkyl chain.

---

**Conclusion:**

These rules provide a predictive framework for determining whether a molecular modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf ratio based on its structural features. By understanding how electronic properties, coordination potential, and steric factors influence Fe incorporation, researchers can design modifiers to optimize the catalyst's performance in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

---

**Guidance for Modifier Design:**

- **To Achieve High Fe/Hf Ratios:**
  - Utilize modifiers with **terminal amino and carboxyl groups** on **unbranched aliphatic chains**.
  - Select **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-withdrawing groups** at the **para position**.
  - Incorporate **sulfur-containing functional groups** or **flexible ether chains** ending with coordinating groups.
  - Consider amino acids with **hydrophobic side chains** lacking interfering functional groups.

- **To Achieve Low Fe/Hf Ratios:**
  - Avoid modifiers with **strong electron-donating groups** on the aromatic ring that reduce coordinating ability.
  - Limit the use of modifiers with **bulky nitrogen-containing heterocycles** or multiple **hydroxyl groups**.
  - Be cautious with modifiers bearing **additional carboxyl groups** or **fluorinated chains** that may diminish Fe coordination.

---

**Application:**

By applying these rules, chemists can predict the impact of potential modifiers on the Fe/Hf ratio and make informed choices in catalyst design. This strategy facilitates the optimization of reaction conditions and catalyst properties to enhance the efficiency and selectivity of desired chemical transformations.

---

**Note:**

These rules have been carefully formulated to balance coverage of the dataset and specificity. They combine multiple substructures and consider their synergistic effects on Fe coordination, providing detailed guidance based on underlying physicochemical principles. Experimental validation is recommended to confirm the predicted outcomes for new modifiers.---------------------------------------------------------------

  - *Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **perfluorinated alkyl chains** tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**, possibly due to **hydrophobicity** and **steric effects** hindering interaction with Fe ions.
  - *Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with small aromatic side chains**, such as **phenylalanine**, tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**, likely due to favorable coordination with Fe ions.
  - *Example*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers containing **bulky substituents** or **multiple functional groups** capable of **chelating Fe ions** may result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to **steric hindrance** or **over-coordination** which can prevent effective incorporation of Fe into the catalyst.
  - *Example*: 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with **methoxy groups (–OCH₃)** on an **aromatic ring**, especially when combined with additional functional groups on an aliphatic chain, tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**, possibly due to increased electronic interactions facilitating Fe coordination.
  - *Example*: 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.

    Target Name: Fe/Hf
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **linear aliphatic amino acids** with a **terminal primary amino group (–NH₂)** at one end and a **terminal carboxyl group (–COOH)** at the other end, possessing a **carbon chain length of five or more (n ≥ 5)**, tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**. The extended chain length increases flexibility, allowing effective coordination with Fe ions.
  - *Examples*: 5-aminopentanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid.
  - *Counterexamples*: Short-chain amino acids or those with additional carboxyl groups may not follow this rule (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid).

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)** such as **nitro (–NO₂)**, **halogens (e.g., –Br)**, or **thiol groups (–SH)** at the **para position** relative to the carboxyl group tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**. EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions.
  - *Examples*: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-donating groups (EDGs)** such as **amino (–NH₂)**, **hydroxyl (–OH)**, or **methyl (–CH₃)** at the **para position** tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**. EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing its coordination strength with Fe ions.
  - *Examples*: 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers containing **thiol groups (–SH)** tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**. Thiol groups are strong ligands that effectively coordinate with Fe ions, enhancing metal incorporation into the catalyst.
  - *Examples*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid, 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with **flexible polyether chains** ending with a **carboxyl group**, and possibly containing **amino groups**, tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**. The **ether oxygen atoms** and any amino groups provide multiple coordination sites for Fe ions, facilitating strong binding.
  - *Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy acids**, such as **sugar acids** with **multiple hydroxyl groups (–OH)** on an **aliphatic chain**, tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**. The abundance of hydroxyl groups can lead to steric hindrance or over-chelation, hindering effective coordination with Fe ions.
  - *Example*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with aromatic side chains** tend to result in:
  - **High Fe/Hf values** if the side chain is not overly bulky, allowing effective Fe coordination.
    - *Example*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine).
  - **Low Fe/Hf values** if the side chain is bulky, causing steric hindrance that impedes Fe coordination.
    - *Example*: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan).

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **perfluorinated alkyl chains** or **heavily fluorinated groups** tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**. The hydrophobic nature and steric bulk of fluorinated chains reduce the modifier's ability to coordinate with Fe ions.
  - *Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **dicarboxylic acids** (having two **–COOH** groups) without additional coordination-enhancing groups tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**. The presence of two carboxyl groups may lead to chelation competition or reduced flexibility, hindering effective Fe coordination.
  - *Examples*: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (glutamic acid), 4-oxoheptanedioic acid.

- **Rule 10**: The **attachment manner** of a **heteroaromatic ring** to the **carboxyl group** influences Fe/Hf values:
  - **High Fe/Hf values**: Modifiers where the **heteroaromatic ring** is connected to the **carboxyl group** via an **alkyl linker**, providing flexibility for better coordination with Fe ions.
    - *Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.
  - **Low Fe/Hf values**: Modifiers where the **carboxyl group** is **directly attached** to the **heteroaromatic ring**, resulting in rigidity that may hinder effective Fe coordination.
    - *Examples*: pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with **aldehyde (–CHO)** or **ketone (>C=O)** groups **adjacent** to the **carboxyl group** tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**. These carbonyl groups can participate in intramolecular interactions or reduce the availability of coordination sites for Fe ions.
  - *Example*: 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **long aliphatic chains** bearing **additional functional groups** such as **hydroxyl (–OH)** or **amino (–NH₂)** groups tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**. The combination of chain flexibility and multiple coordination sites enhances Fe incorporation into the catalyst.
  - *Examples*: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aromatic acids** with **electron-rich aromatic systems** directly attached to the **carboxyl group**, lacking electron-withdrawing substituents, tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**. The high electron density reduces the acidity of the carboxyl group, hindering coordination with Fe ions.
  - *Examples*: 4-methylbenzoic acid, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with significant **steric bulk** or **multiple polar groups**, leading to **steric hindrance** or **over-chelation**, tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**. Excessive coordination sites or bulky side chains can impede effective Fe incorporation.
  - *Examples*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

**End of Rules**

---

**Explanation and Application of the Rules:**

These rules are formulated based on the structural features of the modifiers and their observed impact on the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst. When applying these rules to predict the Fe/Hf value for a new modifier:

- **Identify functional groups**: Examine the modifier's structure for key functional groups such as amino, carboxyl, hydroxyl, thiol, ether, fluorinated chains, or aromatic rings with substituents.
- **Assess chain length and flexibility**: Consider the length of aliphatic chains and the presence of linkers that provide flexibility versus rigid structures.
- **Evaluate electronic effects**: Determine if substituents on aromatic rings are electron-withdrawing or electron-donating, influencing the acidity of functional groups.
- **Consider steric factors**: Analyze the size and bulkiness of side chains or substituents that could hinder coordination with Fe ions.
- **Apply the relevant rule(s)**: Match the identified features with the corresponding rule(s) to predict whether the modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value.

By following these steps, one can utilize the rules to make informed predictions about new modifiers in the context of optimizing the catalyst's performance for the targeted reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Target Name: Fe/Hf
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)** at the **para position** tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**. EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing coordination with Fe ions.
  - *EWGs include*: nitro (–NO₂), bromo (–Br), and sulfanyl (–SH) groups.
  - *Examples*: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-donating groups (EDGs)** at the **para position** tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**. EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions.
  - *EDGs include*: amino (–NH₂), hydroxyl (–OH), and methyl (–CH₃) groups.
  - *Examples*: 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, 4-methylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with a **terminal amino group (–NH₂)** tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**, especially when the carbon chain is **four carbons or longer**. The amino group acts as an additional coordination site for Fe ions.
  - *Examples*: 5-aminopentanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers containing **thiol groups (–SH)**, whether attached to an **aromatic ring** or an **aliphatic chain**, tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**. Sulfur has a strong affinity for Fe ions, enhancing coordination.
  - *Examples*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid, 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with **flexible ether linkages (–O–)** in their structure, especially those ending with a **carboxyl group (–COOH)**, tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**. Ether oxygen atoms provide additional coordination sites for Fe ions.
  - *Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **amino acids** with **small side chains** or **non-bulky aromatic side chains** tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**. The lack of steric hindrance allows effective coordination with Fe ions.
  - *Examples*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine), (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid).

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **amino acids** with **bulky aromatic side chains**, such as an **indole ring**, tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**. Steric hindrance from bulky groups impedes coordination with Fe ions.
  - *Example*: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan).

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **multiple hydroxyl groups (–OH)** adjacent to the **carboxyl group** tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**. Excessive hydroxyl groups can lead to steric hindrance and intramolecular hydrogen bonding, reducing coordination efficiency.
  - *Example*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **highly fluorinated alkyl chains** tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect and increased hydrophobicity reduce the ligand's ability to coordinate with Fe ions.
  - *Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers where the **carboxyl group** is directly attached to a **heteroaromatic ring** without a **flexible linker** tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**. The rigidity and unfavorable geometry hinder effective coordination with Fe ions.
  - *Examples*: pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a **flexible linker** between the **carboxyl group** and a **heteroaromatic ring** or additional coordinating groups tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**. The flexibility allows the ligand to adopt favorable geometries for coordination.
  - *Examples*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers containing **carbonyl groups (aldehyde –CHO or ketone >C=O)** adjacent to the **carboxyl group**, without other coordinating groups, tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**. These groups may interfere with coordination or reduce ligand effectiveness.
  - *Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** (with a chain length of **six carbons or more**) featuring additional **functional groups** such as **hydroxyl (–OH)**, **amino (–NH₂)**, or **amide (–CONH₂)** groups tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**. The chain flexibility and multiple donor sites enhance coordination with Fe ions.
  - *Examples*: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with a **terminal amino group (–NH₂)** and a **carbon chain of five or more carbons** tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**. The extended flexible chain and amino group enhance coordination with Fe ions.
  - *Examples*: 5-aminopentanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with an **electron-withdrawing group (EWG)** at the **para position** tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**. EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxyl group and improve coordination with Fe ions.
  - *EWGs include*: nitro (–NO₂), bromo (–Br), sulfanyl (–SH) groups.
  - *Examples*: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with an **electron-donating group (EDG)** at the **para position** tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**. EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing Fe ion coordination.
  - *EDGs include*: amino (–NH₂), hydroxyl (–OH), methyl (–CH₃) groups.
  - *Examples*: 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, 4-methylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with a **terminal hydroxyl group (–OH)** and a **carbon chain of seven or more carbons** tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**. The hydroxyl group and flexible chain facilitate Fe ion coordination.
  - *Example*: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing **multiple ether linkages (–O–)** ending with a **carboxyl group**, and possibly incorporating an **amino group (–NH₂)**, tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**. Ether oxygens and amino groups offer additional coordination sites for Fe ions.
  - *Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **amino acids** with **small or non-bulky side chains** tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**. Minimal steric hindrance allows effective coordination with Fe ions.
  - *Examples*: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid), (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine).

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **amino acids** with **bulky side chains**, particularly those containing an **indole ring**, tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**. Steric hindrance from bulky groups impedes Fe ion coordination.
  - *Example*: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan).

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **multiple hydroxyl groups (–OH)** near the **carboxyl group** tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**. Multiple hydroxyls can cause intramolecular hydrogen bonding and steric hindrance, reducing coordination efficiency.
  - *Examples*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid, 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]-2-oxoacetic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **thiol groups (–SH)**, either in **aliphatic chains** or **aromatic rings**, tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**. Sulfur atoms have a strong affinity for Fe ions, enhancing coordination.
  - *Examples*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid, 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a **heteroaromatic ring** connected via a **flexible linker** to a **carboxyl group** tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**. The flexible linker allows the heteroatom to coordinate effectively with Fe ions.
  - *Examples*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers where the **carboxyl group** is directly attached to a **heteroaromatic ring** without a flexible linker tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**. Rigidity and unfavorable geometry hinder Fe ion coordination.
  - *Examples*: pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **carbonyl groups** (aldehydes or ketones) adjacent to the **carboxyl group** tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**. These groups can withdraw electron density, reducing coordination ability.
  - *Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers containing **fluorinated alkyl chains** or **trifluoromethyl groups** tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**. Strong electron-withdrawing effects and increased hydrophobicity reduce Fe ion coordination.
  - *Examples*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid, 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with **bulky substituents** near the **carboxyl group**, such as **multiple hydroxyl groups** or large **aromatic rings**, tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**. Steric hindrance limits access to coordination sites.
  - *Examples*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (glutamic acid).

    Target Name: Fe/Hf
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with a **terminal amino group (–NH₂)** and a **carbon chain of five or more carbons** tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**. The extended carbon chain provides flexibility, and the amino group enhances coordination with Fe ions.
  - *Examples*: 5-aminopentanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid, (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid.
  - *Prediction*: Any aliphatic carboxylic acid with a terminal –NH₂ and a chain length of five or more carbons will likely yield a **high Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)** at the **para position**, such as **nitro (–NO₂)**, **bromomethyl (–CH₂Br)**, or **sulfhydryl (–SH)**, tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**. EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing coordination with Fe ions.
  - *Examples*: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.
  - *Prediction*: Aromatic carboxylic acids with strong EWGs at the para position will likely yield a **high Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-donating groups (EDGs)** at the **para position**, such as **amino (–NH₂)** or **methyl (–CH₃)**, tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**. EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing coordination efficiency with Fe ions.
  - *Examples*: 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-methylbenzoic acid.
  - *Prediction*: Aromatic carboxylic acids with EDGs at the para position will likely yield a **low Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers containing **thiol groups (–SH)**, whether in **aliphatic chains** or **aromatic rings**, tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**. Sulfur atoms have a strong affinity for Fe ions, enhancing coordination and binding.
  - *Examples*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid, 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.
  - *Prediction*: Modifiers with thiol groups will likely yield a **high Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing **multiple ether linkages (–O–)** ending with a **carboxyl group** tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**. Ether oxygen atoms provide additional coordination sites for Fe ions, enhancing binding efficiency.
  - *Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid.
  - *Prediction*: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages terminating in a carboxyl group will likely yield a **high Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing **multiple hydroxyl groups (–OH)** near the **carboxyl group** tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**. The presence of multiple –OH groups can lead to intramolecular hydrogen bonding and steric hindrance, reducing coordination efficiency with Fe ions.
  - *Examples*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid, 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]-2-oxoacetic acid.
  - *Prediction*: Modifiers with several –OH groups near the carboxyl group will likely yield a **low Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with **heteroaromatic rings** connected via a **flexible linker** to a **carboxyl group** tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**. The flexible linker allows optimal positioning for Fe ion coordination, enhancing binding efficiency.
  - *Examples*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.
  - *Prediction*: Modifiers where a heteroaromatic ring is linked flexibly to a carboxyl group will likely yield a **high Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers where the **carboxyl group** is directly attached to a **heteroaromatic ring** without a flexible linker tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**. The rigidity and potential steric hindrance hinder Fe ion coordination.
  - *Examples*: pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid.
  - *Prediction*: Modifiers with carboxyl groups directly attached to heteroaromatic rings will likely yield a **low Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **fluorinated alkyl chains** or **trifluoromethyl groups (–CF₃)** tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect and hydrophobic nature of fluorinated groups reduce Fe ion coordination efficiency.
  - *Examples*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid, 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.
  - *Prediction*: Modifiers with fluorinated chains or –CF₃ groups will likely yield a **low Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing **additional carbonyl groups (–C=O)** adjacent to the **carboxyl group**, such as **aldehyde** or **ketone** functions, tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**. The additional carbonyl group may compete for coordination or introduce steric hindrance, interfering with Fe ion binding.
  - *Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid, 4-oxoheptanedioic acid.
  - *Prediction*: Modifiers with carbonyl groups near the carboxyl group will likely yield a **low Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers containing both **amino groups (–NH₂)** and **sulfur-containing groups**, such as **methylsulfanyl (–SCH₃)**, tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**. The presence of multiple coordinating atoms (nitrogen and sulfur) enhances Fe ion binding through synergistic interactions.
  - *Examples*: 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid.
  - *Prediction*: Modifiers with both amino and sulfur-containing groups will likely yield a **high Fe/Hf value**.

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been carefully formulated by analyzing the dataset and considering the underlying physicochemical properties that influence Fe/Hf values. They combine multiple sub-structures and functional groups to predict whether a modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value. The rules aim to cover a broad range of the dataset while striking a balance between simplicity and complexity.

**Notes on the Rules:**

- **Removed Rule 12**: The previous Rule 12, which suggested that amino acids with aromatic side chains tend to result in high Fe/Hf values, has been removed due to conflicting data. While phenylalanine ((2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid) results in a high Fe/Hf value, tryptophan ((2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid) results in a low Fe/Hf value. This indicates that not all amino acids with aromatic side chains lead to high Fe/Hf values, and additional data is required to establish a reliable rule in this category.

- **Merged Rule 13**: The previous Rule 13 has been incorporated into **Rule 11** to highlight the combined effect of amino and sulfur-containing groups in enhancing Fe ion coordination. This consolidation improves the clarity and generality of the rules.

- **Refined Rule 11**: Emphasized the synergistic effect of amino and sulfur-containing groups, recognizing that multiple coordinating atoms enhance Fe ion binding through cooperative interactions.

- **General Adjustments**: Minor revisions have been made to some rules for clarity and to ensure they align closely with the data provided. Examples have been reviewed to confirm their support for each rule.

**Application of the Rules:**

These rules can be used to predict the Fe/Hf outcome for other modifiers based on their structural features:

- **High Fe/Hf Prediction**: Modifiers fitting the descriptions in Rules 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 11 are likely to yield high Fe/Hf values. These features include aliphatic amino acids with long chains, aromatic acids with strong EWGs, thiol groups, multiple ether linkages, flexible linkers to heteroaromatic rings, and combinations of amino and sulfur groups.

- **Low Fe/Hf Prediction**: Modifiers fitting the descriptions in Rules 3, 6, 8, 9, and 10 are likely to yield low Fe/Hf values. These features include aromatic acids with EDGs, multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl, carboxyl groups directly attached to heteroaromatic rings, fluorinated groups, and additional carbonyl groups near the carboxyl group.

By applying these rules, chemists can design or select molecular modifiers that will favor either high or low Fe/Hf values, depending on the desired outcome for the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

---

**Note for Future Considerations:**

- **Data Limitations**: Some rules are based on limited examples due to the dataset size. As more data become available, these rules may need to be refined or expanded to improve their accuracy and applicability.

- **Steric and Electronic Factors**: The balance between steric hindrance and electronic effects is crucial in determining Fe ion coordination. Modifiers with bulky groups near coordination sites may reduce Fe/Hf values despite containing potentially coordinating functional groups.

- **Synergistic Effects**: The presence of multiple functional groups capable of coordinating with Fe ions can have a synergistic effect, enhancing Fe/Hf values beyond what might be predicted by considering each group independently.

---

These refined rules provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the relationship between modifier structures and Fe/Hf values, aligning with the requirements for generating rules and considering the underlying physicochemical properties.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Target Name: Fe/Hf
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with a **terminal (omega) functional group** capable of coordinating with Fe ions—such as **primary amino (–NH₂)**, **hydroxyl (–OH)**, or **thiol (–SH)** groups—tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**. The terminal functional group enhances coordination with Fe ions by providing additional binding sites.
  - *Examples*: 5-aminopentanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.
  - *Prediction*: Aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal functional groups capable of Fe coordination are likely to yield a **high Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)** at the **para position**, such as **nitro (–NO₂)**, **bromomethyl (–CH₂Br)**, or **sulfhydryl (–SH)**, tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**. These EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxyl group and enhance coordination with Fe ions.
  - *Examples*: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.
  - *Prediction*: Aromatic carboxylic acids with strong EWGs at the para position will likely yield a **high Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-donating groups (EDGs)** at the **para position**, such as **amino (–NH₂)**, **methyl (–CH₃)**, or **hydroxyl (–OH)**, tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**. EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing coordination efficiency with Fe ions.
  - *Examples*: 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives.
  - *Prediction*: Aromatic carboxylic acids with EDGs at the para position will likely yield a **low Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers containing **multiple ether linkages (–O–)** ending with a **carboxyl group** tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**. Ether oxygen atoms provide additional coordination sites for Fe ions, enhancing binding efficiency.
  - *Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid.
  - *Prediction*: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages terminating in a carboxyl group will likely yield a **high Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing **multiple hydroxyl groups (–OH)** near the **carboxyl group** tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**. The presence of multiple –OH groups can lead to intramolecular hydrogen bonding and steric hindrance, reducing coordination efficiency with Fe ions.
  - *Examples*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid, 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]-2-oxoacetic acid.
  - *Prediction*: Modifiers with several –OH groups near the carboxyl group will likely yield a **low Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with **heteroaromatic rings** connected via a **flexible linker** to a **carboxyl group** tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**. The flexible linker allows optimal positioning for Fe ion coordination, enhancing binding efficiency.
  - *Examples*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.
  - *Prediction*: Modifiers where a heteroaromatic ring is linked flexibly to a carboxyl group will likely yield a **high Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers where the **carboxyl group** is directly attached to a **heteroaromatic ring** without a flexible linker tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**. The rigidity and potential steric hindrance hinder Fe ion coordination.
  - *Examples*: pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid.
  - *Prediction*: Modifiers with carboxyl groups directly attached to heteroaromatic rings will likely yield a **low Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **fluorinated alkyl chains** or **trifluoromethyl groups (–CF₃)** tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect and hydrophobic nature of fluorinated groups reduce Fe ion coordination efficiency.
  - *Examples*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid, 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.
  - *Prediction*: Modifiers with fluorinated chains or –CF₃ groups will likely yield a **low Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **additional carbonyl groups (–C=O)** adjacent to the **carboxyl group**, such as **aldehyde** or **ketone** functions, tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**. The additional carbonyl group may compete for coordination or introduce steric hindrance, interfering with Fe ion binding.
  - *Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid, 4-oxoheptanedioic acid.
  - *Prediction*: Modifiers with carbonyl groups near the carboxyl group will likely yield a **low Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing both **amino groups (–NH₂)** and **sulfur-containing groups** like **methylsulfanyl (–SCH₃)** tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**. The presence of multiple coordinating atoms (nitrogen and sulfur) enhances Fe ion binding through synergistic interactions.
  - *Examples*: 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid.
  - *Prediction*: Modifiers with both amino and sulfur-containing groups will likely yield a **high Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 1 Emphasis**: The focus on terminal coordinating groups (–NH₂, –OH, –SH) accounts for increased Fe ion binding due to the availability of donor atoms at the chain end, minimizing steric hindrance.

- **Rule 2 Clarification**: Strong EWGs like nitro, bromomethyl, and sulfhydryl significantly increase carboxyl acidity, promoting Fe coordination. Moderate EWGs or those introducing steric hindrance (like formyl groups) may not have the same effect.

- **Rule 3 Expansion**: Including hydroxyl groups (–OH) as EDGs captures additional examples like 4-hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives, which also result in low Fe/Hf values.

- **Rule 5 Justification**: Multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl can form internal hydrogen bonds or create steric bulk, both of which can impede Fe ion access to the coordination site.

- **Rule 6 and 7 Distinction**: The flexibility of the linker in Rule 6 allows the heteroaromatic ring to adjust for optimal Fe coordination, unlike the rigid attachment in Rule 7, which can prevent effective binding due to spatial constraints.

- **Rule 8 Consideration**: Fluorinated groups, while electron-withdrawing, are also highly hydrophobic and can disrupt the interaction with Fe ions, leading to low Fe/Hf values.

- **Rule 9 Explanation**: Additional carbonyl groups can either chelate the Fe ion in an unproductive manner or sterically hinder access to the primary coordination site, reducing Fe/Hf values.

- **Rule 10 Specificity**: The combination of amino and sulfur-containing groups provides multiple coordination sites, which can cooperatively enhance Fe binding more than either group alone.

---

**Application of the Rules:**

- **High Fe/Hf Prediction**: Modifiers fitting Rules 1, 2, 4, 6, and 10 are likely to result in **high Fe/Hf values**. Key features include terminal coordinating groups, strong EWGs on aromatic rings, multiple ether linkages, flexible linkers to heteroaromatics, and combined amino and sulfur functionalities.

- **Low Fe/Hf Prediction**: Modifiers fitting Rules 3, 5, 7, 8, and 9 are likely to result in **low Fe/Hf values**. Features include EDGs on aromatic rings, multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl, direct attachment of carboxyl to heteroaromatic rings, fluorinated groups, and additional carbonyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl.

---

**Conclusion:**

The refined rules, grounded in physicochemical principles, provide a robust framework for predicting the Fe/Hf values based on molecular modifiers' structures. By considering combinations of functional groups and their electronic and steric effects on Fe ion coordination, these rules guide the selection and design of modifiers to optimize catalytic performance in the given reaction.

---

**Recommendations for Future Work:**

- **Data Expansion**: Incorporate more modifiers into the dataset to validate and refine the rules further, ensuring they hold across a broader chemical space.

- **Functional Group Interactions**: Investigate how combinations of different functional groups within the same modifier influence Fe/Hf values, potentially leading to new synergistic effects.

- **Computational Modeling**: Utilize computational chemistry tools to model Fe ion coordination with various modifiers, providing deeper insights into the observed trends and aiding in the prediction of Fe/Hf values for novel structures.

By adhering to the guidelines and applying chemical insights, these rules aim to assist researchers in predicting outcomes and making informed decisions in modifier selection for enhanced catalytic activity.---------------------------------------------------------------

    **Analysis and Generation of New Rules Based on the Dataset**

---

After carefully analyzing the dataset and considering the current set of rules, I've identified areas where the rules can be improved for better accuracy and coverage. My goal is to generate rules that effectively relate the molecular structures of the modifiers to the observed high or low Fe/Hf values, while adhering to the provided requirements.

---

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal primary amino group (–NH₂) tend to result in high Fe/Hf values.** The combination of a carboxyl group and a terminal amino group on an aliphatic chain provides bidentate coordination sites, enhancing Fe ion binding.

  - *Examples*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**, **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid**.
  - *Prediction*: Modifiers fitting this description will likely yield a **high Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 2**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position tend to result in high Fe/Hf values.** EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, facilitating stronger coordination with Fe ions.

  - *Examples*: **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**.
  - *Prediction*: Such modifiers will likely yield a **high Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing sulfur groups, such as thiol (–SH) or thioether (–S–) functionalities, tend to result in high Fe/Hf values.** Sulfur atoms are good ligands for Fe ions due to their lone pair electrons.

  - *Examples*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**, **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**, **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**.
  - *Prediction*: Modifiers with sulfur-containing groups will likely yield a **high Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 4**: **Aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal hydroxyl groups (–OH) tend to result in high Fe/Hf values.** The hydroxyl group can act as an additional coordination site for Fe ions.

  - *Examples*: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**.
  - *Prediction*: Such modifiers will likely yield a **high Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with flexible chains connecting aromatic or heteroaromatic rings to a carboxyl group tend to result in high Fe/Hf values.** The flexibility allows optimal positioning for coordination.

  - *Examples*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**, **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.
  - *Prediction*: Modifiers with flexible linkers will likely yield a **high Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with non-bulky side chains tend to result in high Fe/Hf values.** Smaller side chains reduce steric hindrance, promoting better coordination.

  - *Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid), **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine).
  - *Prediction*: Such amino acids will likely yield a **high Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing multiple ether groups (–O–) with terminal coordinating groups tend to result in high Fe/Hf values.** The ether oxygens and terminal groups provide multiple coordination sites.

  - *Examples*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**.
  - *Prediction*: Modifiers with multiple ethers and terminal groups will likely yield a **high Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 8**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position tend to result in low Fe/Hf values.** EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing coordination efficiency.

  - *Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
  - *Prediction*: Such modifiers will likely yield a **low Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with multiple neighboring hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group tend to result in low Fe/Hf values.** These hydroxyl groups can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds, hindering Fe coordination.

  - *Examples*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**, **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]-2-oxoacetic acid**.
  - *Prediction*: Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyls will likely yield a **low Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with additional carbonyl groups (–C=O) adjacent to the carboxyl group tend to result in low Fe/Hf values.** These groups can create steric hindrance or compete for metal coordination.

  - *Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**, **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**.
  - *Prediction*: Such modifiers will likely yield a **low Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups (–CF₃) tend to result in low Fe/Hf values.** The electronegativity and steric bulk of fluorinated groups reduce coordination efficiency.

  - *Examples*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**, **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**.
  - *Prediction*: Such modifiers will likely yield a **low Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers where the carboxyl group is directly attached to a rigid heteroaromatic ring tend to result in low Fe/Hf values.** The rigidity may hinder effective coordination due to steric constraints.

  - *Examples*: **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**.
  - *Prediction*: Such modifiers will likely yield a **low Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 13**: **Amino acids with bulky or heteroatom-containing side chains tend to result in low Fe/Hf values.** Bulky groups introduce steric hindrance, and heteroatoms may interfere with coordination.

  - *Examples*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan), **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
  - *Prediction*: Such modifiers will likely yield a **low Fe/Hf value**.

**End of Rules**

---

**Explanation and Justification of the Rules:**

- **Balance Between Coverage and Specificity**: The above rules are designed to cover a broad range of the dataset while maintaining specificity. For instance, **Rule 1** and **Rule 2** cover aliphatic and aromatic modifiers, respectively, with functional groups that enhance Fe coordination.

- **Combination of Functional Groups**: Each rule combines multiple functional groups or structural features. For example, **Rule 7** involves both ether linkages and terminal coordinating groups, fulfilling the requirement to combine sub-structures.

- **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The rules are grounded in coordination chemistry principles. Functional groups that can donate electron pairs (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, thiol) enhance Fe binding, while groups that hinder coordination (e.g., bulky substituents, electron-donating groups) reduce Fe/Hf values.

- **Simplification and Removal of Redundant Rules**: Compared to the previous set of rules, redundant or overly complex rules have been consolidated for clarity and effectiveness. For example, previous **Rule 15** has been integrated into **Rule 6** and **Rule 13** for amino acids with various side chain sizes.

---

**Application of the New Rules to the Dataset:**

- **Modifiers Predicted to Have High Fe/Hf Values**:

  - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (Rule 1)
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Rule 1)
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Rule 1)

**Conclusion:**

The set of rules above effectively correlate specific structural features of molecular modifiers with their impact on the Fe/Hf ratio. By focusing on key functional groups and their positions within the molecules, these rules can predict the Fe/Hf value (high or low) for modifiers, guiding the selection or design of new modifiers to optimize the catalyst performance.

---

**Recommendations for Future Consideration:**

- **Experimental Validation**: Test new modifiers predicted by these rules to confirm their accuracy.
- **Further Dataset Expansion**: Include more diverse modifiers to refine and enhance the rules.
- **Computational Modeling**: Utilize molecular modeling to visualize and predict coordination interactions.

    Target Name: Fe/Hf
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal primary amino group (–NH₂) and a carbon chain length of four or more carbons tend to result in high Fe/Hf values.** The combination of the amino and carboxyl groups allows for effective bidentate coordination with Fe ions, enhancing metal incorporation.

  - *Examples*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**.
  - *Prediction*: Modifiers fitting this description will likely yield a **high Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 2**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position, such as nitro (–NO₂), bromomethyl (–CH₂Br), or pyridyl rings, tend to result in high Fe/Hf values.** EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  - *Examples*: **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**, **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Prediction*: Such modifiers will likely yield a **high Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing both thiol groups (–SH) and carboxylic acid groups tend to result in high Fe/Hf values.** Sulfur atoms in thiol groups have lone pairs that coordinate strongly with Fe ions, while the carboxyl group provides additional binding sites.

  - *Examples*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**, **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
  - *Prediction*: Modifiers with both thiol and carboxyl groups will likely yield a **high Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with ether linkages in the backbone and terminal amino groups tend to result in high Fe/Hf values.** The ether oxygens and amino groups offer multiple coordination sites, facilitating Fe incorporation.

  - *Examples*: **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**, **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.
  - *Prediction*: Such modifiers will likely yield a **high Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 5**: **Aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal hydroxyl groups (–OH) on a carbon chain of six or more carbons tend to result in high Fe/Hf values.** The hydroxyl group provides an additional coordination site without significant steric hindrance.

  - *Example*: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**.
  - *Prediction*: Modifiers fitting this description will likely yield a **high Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 6**: **Amino acids with small to medium-sized side chains that can participate in coordination tend to result in high Fe/Hf values.** These side chains allow for multiple binding interactions without excessive steric hindrance.

  - *Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid), **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine).
  - *Prediction*: Such amino acids will likely yield a **high Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position, such as amino (–NH₂), methyl (–CH₃), or hydroxyl (–OH), tend to result in low Fe/Hf values.** EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  - *Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
  - *Prediction*: Such modifiers will likely yield a **low Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group tend to result in low Fe/Hf values.** The presence of multiple hydroxyls can lead to intramolecular hydrogen bonding, making the carboxyl group less available for metal coordination.

  - *Example*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid).
  - *Prediction*: Modifiers with clustered hydroxyl groups will likely yield a **low Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing additional carbonyl groups (aldehyde or ketone) adjacent to the carboxyl group tend to result in low Fe/Hf values.** These carbonyl groups may compete with the carboxyl group for coordination or introduce electron-withdrawing effects that reduce binding affinity.

  - *Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**, **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**.
  - *Prediction*: Such modifiers will likely yield a **low Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups tend to result in low Fe/Hf values.** The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms decreases the electron density on the carboxyl group, hindering effective coordination with Fe ions.

  - *Examples*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**, **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**.
  - *Prediction*: Such modifiers will likely yield a **low Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers where the carboxyl group is directly attached to a rigid heteroaromatic ring without additional coordinating groups tend to result in low Fe/Hf values.** The rigidity and lack of flexible binding sites reduce the ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  - *Examples*: **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**, **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**.
  - *Prediction*: Such modifiers will likely yield a **low Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 12**: **Amino acids with bulky or heterocyclic side chains tend to result in low Fe/Hf values.** Bulky side chains introduce steric hindrance, and heterocycles may not effectively participate in coordination due to electron delocalization.

  - *Examples*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan), **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
  - *Prediction*: Such amino acids will likely yield a **low Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing aromatic hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group tend to result in low Fe/Hf values.** Phenolic hydroxyl groups can form strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds or engage in competing interactions, reducing coordination efficiency with Fe ions.

  - *Examples*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**, **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**, **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**.
  - *Prediction*: Such modifiers will likely yield a **low Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with saccharide or polyol structures tend to result in low Fe/Hf values.** Multiple hydroxyl groups in sugars can form extensive hydrogen-bonding networks, limiting the availability of coordination sites for Fe ions.

  - *Example*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid).
  - *Prediction*: Modifiers with sugar-like structures will likely yield a **low Fe/Hf value**.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids containing both ether linkages and bulky substituents tend to result in low Fe/Hf values.** The ether oxygen may not be in an optimal position for coordination, and bulky groups can hinder access to the carboxyl group.

  - *Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.
  - *Prediction*: Such modifiers will likely yield a **low Fe/Hf value**.
