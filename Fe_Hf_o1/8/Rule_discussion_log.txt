This synergistic effect facilitates stronger metal coordination, resulting in higher Fe/Hf ratios.

  - **Prediction**: **High Fe/Hf**

  - **Examples**:
    - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid* (High Fe/Hf)

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: *Rule 1* is generally clear and allows for the prediction of high Fe/Hf ratios when modifiers are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position. The physicochemical rationale is sound, explaining how electron-withdrawing groups increase acidity and enhance coordination with Fe³⁺ ions. The rule is supported by at least four data points (*4-nitrobenzoic acid*, *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid*, *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid*, *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*), demonstrating good coverage. However, the case of *4-formylbenzoic acid*, which has an electron-withdrawing formyl group at the para position but results in low Fe/Hf (False), suggests that the rule may need refinement to specify that only strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, sulfanyl) lead to high Fe/Hf, while weaker ones like formyl may not be sufficient.

- **Comment 2**: *Rule 2* is clear and effective in predicting low Fe/Hf ratios for aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position. The physicochemical rationale is appropriate, highlighting how electron-donating groups decrease acidity and coordination ability. The rule is supported by multiple data points (*4-aminobenzoic acid*, *4-methylbenzoic acid*, *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*, *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*), ensuring good coverage. The balance between complexity and coverage is well-maintained.

- **Comment 3**: *Rule 3* provides clear guidance by predicting high Fe/Hf ratios for aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal amino groups, enabling bidentate coordination. The physicochemical insight is strong, explaining the role of the amino group in chelation. The rule is supported by several data points (*5-aminopentanoic acid*, *7-aminoheptanoic acid*, *8-aminooctanoic acid*, *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid*), indicating good coverage. The rule appropriately considers combinations of functional groups, balancing complexity and coverage effectively.

- **Comment 4**: *Rule 4* is straightforward and clear, predicting low Fe/Hf ratios for straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups. The physicochemical rationale is logical, and the rule is supported by at least two data points (*octanoic acid*, *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*), demonstrating adequate coverage. The simplicity of the rule is justified by its scope and support.

- **Comment 5**: *Rule 5* clearly states that modifiers with ether linkages and terminal amino or hydroxyl groups result in high Fe/Hf ratios. The physicochemical rationale is well-articulated, explaining how ether linkages enhance flexibility and additional functional groups aid in coordination. The rule is supported by three data points (*2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*, *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*, *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*), ensuring good coverage. The rule effectively balances complexity with its coverage.

- **Comment 6**: *Rule 6* is clear in predicting low Fe/Hf ratios for modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups due to potential intramolecular hydrogen bonding and hydrophilicity that hinder coordination with Fe³⁺ ions. The physicochemical insight is adequate. The rule is supported by two data points (*2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*, *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid*), providing sufficient coverage.

- **Comment 7**: *Rule 7* effectively predicts low Fe/Hf ratios for non-aromatic modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups. The physicochemical rationale is solid, detailing how these groups reduce electron density and coordination ability. The rule is supported by two data points (*2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*, *4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid*), demonstrating acceptable coverage with an appropriate balance of complexity.

- **Comment 8**: *Rule 8* generally suggests that modifiers with bulky heterocyclic aromatic side chains result in low Fe/Hf ratios due to steric hindrance. While the rule is clear and the rationale is reasonable, there is an exception with *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*, which results in a high Fe/Hf ratio (True). This contradiction indicates that the rule may need refinement to account for specific heterocycles that do not impede coordination effectiveness. Despite this exception, the rule does cover at least two data points (*1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*, *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid*), but the balance between accuracy and coverage could be improved.

- **Comment 9**: *Rule 9* is clear and well-supported, predicting high Fe/Hf ratios for pyridine carboxylic acids with nitrogen opposite the carboxyl group, facilitating bidentate coordination. The physicochemical insight is strong, and the rule is supported by two data points (*4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*, *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid*), ensuring good coverage.

- **Comment 10**: *Rule 10* effectively addresses amino acids with side chains capable of chelation, resulting in high Fe/Hf ratios. The rule is clear, and the physicochemical rationale explains how additional coordinating groups enhance iron incorporation. The rule is supported by three data points (*(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid*, *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid*, *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid*), demonstrating solid coverage.

- **Comment 11**: *Rule 11* clearly predicts low Fe/Hf ratios for modifiers with multiple carboxylate groups without other chelating functionalities. The physicochemical insight is appropriate, explaining potential competition with hafnium centers. The rule is supported by two data points (*(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid*, *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*), providing adequate coverage.

- **Comment 1**: Some rules overlap or are redundant, such as **Rule 2** and **Rule 6** both addressing thiol-containing modifiers increasing Fe/Hf, and **Rule 8** and **Rule 11** both involving modifiers with aldehyde groups decreasing Fe/Hf. This repetition can cause confusion and reduce clarity.
- **Comment 2**: Several rules lack sufficient coverage, with only one supporting data point. For example, **Rule 10** (7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) and **Rule 14** ((2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid) each have only a single example. According to the scoring criteria, at least two data points are needed to support a rule adequately.
- **Comment 3**: The clarity of applying certain rules is compromised due to overlapping structural descriptions. For instance, modifiers with thiol groups are covered in both **Rule 2** and **Rule 6**, making it unclear which rule takes precedence when predicting Fe/Hf levels.
- **Comment 4**: The complexity and balance of the rules could be improved by combining overlapping rules and ensuring that each rule addresses a distinct set of modifiers with clear structural criteria. This would enhance both the coverage and the ease of application.
- **Comment 5**: Some rules focus on a single functional group without considering combinations of substructures, which might limit their predictive power. Incorporating additional structural features could improve the property insight and applicability of these rules.

It is supported by at least three data points (*phenylalanine*, *methionine derivative*, *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid*), satisfying coverage. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 10**:

  Rule 10 states that modifiers with additional carbonyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl reduce Fe/Hf ratios. The structural description is clear, and the physicochemical rationale is acceptable. The rule considers carbonyl positioning, adding complexity. It is supported by at least three data points (*4-formylbenzoic acid*, *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*, *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*), satisfying coverage. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 11**:

  Rule 11 identifies that modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains decrease Fe/Hf ratios. The physicochemical rationale is acceptable. The rule is relatively simple but is supported by two data points (*nonafluoropentanoic acid*, *trifluoroacetylaminobutanoic acid*), meeting the minimum coverage requirement. The balance between simplicity and coverage is acceptable.

- **Comment 12**:

  Rule 12 states that modifiers with ketone groups on aliphatic chains decrease Fe/Hf ratios. The physicochemical rationale is acceptable, but the rule is simple and lacks complexity. It is supported by only one data point (*4-oxoheptanedioic acid*), which is insufficient for adequate coverage. More data points are needed to confirm the rule's validity.

- **Comment 13**:

  Rule 13 indicates that long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal hydroxyl groups increase Fe/Hf ratios. The structural description is clear, and the physicochemical rationale is reasonable. The rule adds complexity by considering chain length and terminal groups. However, only one data point (*7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*) supports the rule, which is insufficient for adequate coverage. Additional data is needed for validation.

- **Comment 14**:

  Rule 14 suggests that amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains may decrease Fe/Hf ratios due to steric hindrance. The structural description is clear, and the physicochemical rationale is reasonable. The rule adds complexity by considering steric effects. However, only one data point (*tryptophan*) supports the rule, indicating inadequate coverage. Further data is needed to validate this rule.

- **Comment 15**:

  Rule 15 proposes that modifiers with oxygen-containing heterocycles decrease Fe/Hf ratios. However, the provided example (*1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*) results in a High Fe/Hf ratio, contradicting the rule. This contradiction suggests the rule may not hold. Additionally, only one data point, which is an exception, supports the rule, indicating insufficient coverage. The rule requires reevaluation and more data.

  - **Prediction**: **Variable Fe/Hf**

  - **Example**:
    - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid* (High Fe/Hf)  
      *Explanation*: Despite potential electron-withdrawing effects, the overall structure may favor coordination with **Fe³⁺** ions, resulting in higher Fe/Hf ratios.

**End of Rules**

---

These rules illustrate how specific combinations of structural features and functional groups in the molecular modifiers influence the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst. By considering underlying physicochemical properties such as electron-withdrawing and electron-donating effects, coordination capabilities, steric factors, and the presence of additional functional groups, these rules help predict whether a modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value.

**Summary**:

- Modifiers that enhance coordination with **Fe³⁺** ions through additional donor atoms (e.g., amino, thiol, pyridine nitrogen) or electron-withdrawing groups tend to **increase Fe/Hf ratios**.
- Modifiers that hinder coordination due to electron-donating groups, steric hindrance, or electron-withdrawing groups that reduce ligand basicity tend to **decrease Fe/Hf ratios**.
- The overall structure and functional group positioning play crucial roles in determining the modifier's effect on Fe incorporation.

**Recommendations**:

- When selecting modifiers to **increase Fe/Hf ratios**, consider those with additional coordination sites and electron-withdrawing substituents.
- To **decrease Fe/Hf ratios**, choose modifiers with electron-donating groups or structures that hinder coordination with **Fe³⁺** ions.

Please note that while these rules cover a broad range of the dataset, exceptions may occur due to the complex interplay of structural factors. Experimental validation is recommended to confirm these predictions for new modifiers.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: **Rule 1** is clear and allows for easy determination of the Fe/Hf ratio based on the presence of terminal primary amino groups on aliphatic carboxylic acids. The physicochemical rationale is sound, explaining how the amino group enhances Fe³⁺ coordination. It considers combinations of substructures (carboxylic acid with a terminal amino group) and is supported by multiple data points (e.g., *5-aminopentanoic acid*, *7-aminoheptanoic acid*, *8-aminooctanoic acid*), achieving a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 2** is clearly defined, focusing on modifiers containing thiol groups. The rationale adequately explains the high affinity of thiol groups for Fe³⁺ ions, enhancing coordination. The rule considers thiol groups in both aliphatic and aromatic contexts and is supported by examples like *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid* and *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid*. It strikes a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 3** clearly states that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups decrease Fe/Hf ratios. The physicochemical insight about increased hydrophilicity and hydrogen bonding hindering Fe³⁺ coordination is appropriate. Supported by data points such as *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* and *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*, the rule has sufficient coverage and appropriate complexity.

- **Comment 4**: **Rule 4** is clear in describing how electron-withdrawing groups on aromatic carboxylic acids increase Fe/Hf ratios. The physicochemical rationale is solid, explaining enhanced acidity and stronger Fe³⁺ coordination. With multiple supporting examples (*4-nitrobenzoic acid*, *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid*, *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid*), the rule demonstrates good coverage and balances complexity well.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** effectively communicates that electron-donating groups on aromatic carboxylic acids decrease Fe/Hf ratios. The rationale concerning decreased acidity and coordination ability is sound. Examples like *4-aminobenzoic acid*, *4-methylbenzoic acid*, and *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* provide adequate support, ensuring good coverage and appropriate complexity.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** is clear about modifiers with pyridine rings increasing Fe/Hf ratios but includes a counterexample (*pyridine-3-carboxylic acid*). The physicochemical rationale is reasonable, highlighting the pyridine nitrogen's role in coordination. The counterexample suggests that the position of the nitrogen relative to the carboxyl group is crucial, indicating a need for refinement in the rule’s structural description. Coverage includes several examples, but specificity could be improved.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** discusses modifiers with aliphatic ether linkages and terminal polar groups increasing Fe/Hf ratios. The rationale about additional coordination sites is plausible. However, the rule is supported by only two examples (*2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*, *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*), indicating limited coverage. The complexity is acceptable, but more data points would strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** clearly states that straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups decrease Fe/Hf ratios. The straightforward rationale is that lack of additional coordinating groups limits Fe³⁺ interaction. Supported by *octanoic acid*, the rule is simple with limited coverage but aligns with the data.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** effectively explains that amino acids with chelating side chains increase Fe/Hf ratios. The physicochemical insight into additional coordination sites is solid. Examples such as *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* and *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid* provide good coverage. The rule adeptly combines substructures, balancing complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** notes that bulky aromatic side chains in amino acids may decrease Fe/Hf ratios due to steric hindrance. While the rationale is sound, it is supported by only one example (*2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid*), which limits coverage. The rule could be strengthened with additional data points.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** is clear that modifiers with adjacent carbonyl groups decrease Fe/Hf ratios. The rationale about electron withdrawal affecting coordination is appropriate. Multiple examples (*4-formylbenzoic acid*, *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*, *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*) provide good coverage, and the rule balances complexity and coverage effectively.

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** states that fluorinated alkyl chains decrease Fe/Hf ratios due to electron-withdrawing effects and increased hydrophobicity. Supported by two examples (*2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*, *4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid*), coverage is limited. The rule is clear but would benefit from additional supporting data.

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13** indicates that long aliphatic chains with terminal hydroxyl groups increase Fe/Hf ratios. The rationale is logical, but only one example (*7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*) supports the rule, limiting coverage. The rule introduces acceptable complexity but needs more data points for robustness.

- **Comment 14**: **Rule 14** describes modifiers with nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic rings increasing Fe/Hf ratios but acknowledges a counterexample (*1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*). The rule is clear, and the rationale about nitrogen coordination is valid. The counterexample suggests that ring structure and nitrogen position affect coordination, indicating the rule may need refinement. Coverage is adequate but could be improved with more examples.

- **Comment 15**: **Rule 15** explains that modifiers with oxygen-containing heterocycles show variable Fe/Hf ratios based on structure. The physicochemical rationale recognizes the dual role of oxygen in coordination. However, only one example (*1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*) is provided, limiting coverage. The rule introduces complexity but requires more data for validation.

  - **Description**: Modifiers containing additional **carbonyl groups (>C=O)**, such as **aldehyde (-CHO)** or **ketone (>C=O)** groups, adjacent to or near the carboxyl group.

  - **Physicochemical Rationale**: Additional carbonyl groups withdraw electron density through resonance and inductive effects, reducing the availability of lone pairs on the carboxylate oxygen for coordination with **Fe³⁺** ions. This weakens metal-ligand interactions, leading to lower iron incorporation and reduced Fe/Hf ratios.

  - **Prediction**: **Low Fe/Hf**

  - **Examples**:
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid* (Low Fe/Hf)
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid* (Low Fe/Hf)
    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid* (Low Fe/Hf)

---

  - **Description**: Modifiers that include **heteroaromatic rings** with heteroatoms (e.g., **nitrogen**, **oxygen**) capable of coordinating with **Fe³⁺** ions.

  - **Physicochemical Rationale**: Heteroatoms in aromatic rings act as strong Lewis bases and provide additional coordination sites for **Fe³⁺** ions. This enhances metal-ligand interactions, promoting higher iron incorporation into the catalyst framework and resulting in increased Fe/Hf ratios.

  - **Prediction**: **High Fe/Hf**

  - **Example**:
    - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid* (High Fe/Hf)

  - **Counterexample**:
    - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid* (Low Fe/Hf)  
      *Explanation*: The nitrogen atoms may be involved in resonance stabilization or positioned such that they are less available for coordination, resulting in lower Fe/Hf ratios.

These rules illustrate how specific combinations of structural features and functional groups in the molecular modifiers influence the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst. By considering underlying physicochemical properties such as electron-withdrawing and electron-donating effects, coordination capabilities, steric factors, and the presence of additional functional groups, these rules help predict whether a modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value.

**Summary**:

- Modifiers that enhance coordination with **Fe³⁺** ions through additional donor atoms (e.g., amino, thiol, pyridine nitrogen) or electron-withdrawing groups tend to **increase Fe/Hf ratios**.
- Modifiers that hinder coordination due to electron-donating groups, steric hindrance, or structures that reduce ligand basicity tend to **decrease Fe/Hf ratios**.
- The overall structure and functional group positioning play crucial roles in determining the modifier's effect on iron incorporation.

**Recommendations**:

- When selecting modifiers to **increase Fe/Hf ratios**, consider those with additional coordination sites and electron-withdrawing substituents.
- To **decrease Fe/Hf ratios**, choose modifiers with electron-donating groups or structures that hinder coordination with **Fe³⁺** ions.

Please note that while these rules cover a broad range of the dataset, exceptions may occur due to the complex interplay of structural factors. Experimental validation is recommended to confirm these predictions for new modifiers.

With support from two data points (*4-formylbenzoic acid*, *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*), it meets the coverage criterion. The rule balances complexity and coverage effectively.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** is clear but lacks sufficient coverage, supported by only one data point (*1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*). The physicochemical rationale is acceptable, highlighting multiple coordination sites in lactone rings. However, the limited data support affects the coverage and the balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** is clear but has low coverage, with only one supporting data point (*[2S]-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid*). The physicochemical rationale is adequate, attributing increased Fe/Hf ratios to additional amide coordination sites. The rule's specificity limits coverage, impacting the balance.

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13** is clear but lacks coverage, supported by a single data point (*octanoic acid*).
