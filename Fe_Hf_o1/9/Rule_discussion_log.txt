- **Comment 1**: **Rule 1** is clear and allows for easy determination of whether a modifier fits the structural description—straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal primary amino or thiol group result in High Fe/Hf. The physical-chemical insight is solid, explaining that terminal amino or thiol groups enhance coordination with Fe ions. The rule incorporates combinations of sub-structures (aliphatic chain, carboxylic acid, amino/thiol group), adding appropriate complexity. It is well-supported by multiple data points such as 5-aminopentanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid, and 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid, fulfilling the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 2** provides a clear structural criterion: benzoic acid derivatives with an electron-withdrawing group at the para position increase Fe/Hf. The physical insight is adequate, attributing increased acidity and stronger Fe coordination to electron-withdrawing substituents. The rule considers specific functional group positions on an aromatic ring, adding complexity. It is supported by examples like 4-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, meeting the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 3** clearly states that electron-donating groups at the para position of benzoic acid derivatives decrease Fe/Hf. The physical-chemical explanation about decreased acidity and reduced Fe coordination is sound. The rule involves specific sub-structures and functional group positions, satisfying complexity. It is supported by multiple examples such as 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-aminobenzoic acid, and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives, ensuring adequate coverage.

- **Comment 4**: **Rule 4** is clear in identifying modifiers with multiple ether linkages in the aliphatic chain as increasing Fe/Hf. The physical insight regarding enhanced solubility and flexibility facilitating Fe interaction is reasonable. The rule combines sub-structures like ether linkages and aliphatic chains, adding complexity. Supported by examples such as 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid and 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid, the rule meets the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** clearly states that modifiers containing thiol groups increase Fe/Hf. The explanation about thiol groups' high affinity for metal ions is valid. The rule adds complexity by focusing on the presence of thiol groups within the molecular structure. Supported by 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid and 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid, it satisfies the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** specifies that modifiers with fluorinated chains decrease Fe/Hf. The clarity is acceptable, and the physical insight concerning electronegativity and steric hindrance is plausible. However, the rule lacks sufficient coverage, as it is supported only by 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid. With only one data point, the coverage criterion is not fully met.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** indicates that modifiers with hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains increase Fe/Hf if the chain length is seven carbons or longer. While the rule is clear, it is complex due to the specific chain length condition. The physical-chemical insight about increased flexibility aiding metal chelation is logical. However, coverage is insufficient, supported solely by 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** clearly states that modifiers with hydroxyl groups on aromatic rings decrease Fe/Hf. The explanation about hydrogen bonding competing with metal coordination provides solid physical-chemical insight. The rule considers specific functional groups and their positions, adding complexity. It is well-supported by multiple examples like 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid, and 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid, thus satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** clearly defines that modifiers with aldehyde or formyl groups on aromatic rings decrease Fe/Hf. The physical insight related to resonance effects diminishing coordination ability is reasonable. The rule adds complexity by focusing on specific functional groups on aromatic systems. It is supported by examples such as 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid and 4-formylbenzoic acid, meeting the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** states that alpha-amino dicarboxylic acids with the amino group adjacent to the carboxyl decrease Fe/Hf. The rule is clear and suitably complex, considering the specific positioning of functional groups. The physical-chemical insight about intramolecular interactions reducing Fe coordination is sound. However, coverage is inadequate, with support only from (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, failing to meet the minimum data point criterion.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** differentiates between modifiers containing pyridine rings connected via an aromatic linker (increasing Fe/Hf) and those directly attached to the carboxyl group (decreasing Fe/Hf). While the rule is complex, it is clear in its distinction. The physical insight is acceptable, but coverage is limited. High Fe/Hf is supported by 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, and low Fe/Hf by pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, providing only one example for each case, which is insufficient for robust coverage.

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** specifies that modifiers containing electron-rich fused aromatic systems (e.g., indole rings) decrease Fe/Hf. The rule is clear, and the physical-chemical rationale about electron-rich systems engaging in competing interactions is plausible. However, the coverage is poor, supported solely by (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid, thus not meeting the coverage criterion.

These rules have been carefully generated by analyzing the dataset and considering the underlying chemical principles that govern the coordination between modifiers and Fe ions. The rules focus on combinations of functional groups and their positions within the molecular structure, which directly influence the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst.

By prioritizing rules that cover broader aspects of the dataset and combining multiple substructures, the rules aim to provide clear predictions for the Fe/Hf value based on the structural features of any given modifier. The balance between simple and complex rules ensures comprehensive coverage while maintaining specificity.

The rules consider factors such as electron-withdrawing and electron-donating effects, steric hindrance, the presence of coordination sites (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, thiol, pyridine nitrogen), and the impact of molecular flexibility on metal coordination. This approach aligns with the requirements and provides a valuable tool for predicting and optimizing the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalytic system.

**Analysis and Rationale**

In analyzing the dataset of molecular modifiers, we identified patterns correlating specific functional groups and structural features with the Fe/Hf ratio (High or Low). The updated rules aim to accurately capture the relationship between modifiers' chemical structures and their impact on Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

**Key Updates and Improvements:**

- **Refinement of Existing Rules:**
  - **Rule 4:** Combined previous Rules 4 and 10 to encompass all sulfur-containing functional groups, recognizing that both thiol (–SH) and methylsulfanyl groups enhance Fe coordination.
  - **Rule 9 and Rule 10:** Refined these rules to distinguish between nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group (decreasing Fe/Hf) and those connected via a linker (increasing Fe/Hf). This clarification addresses inconsistencies observed in the data.

- **Removal of Less Supported Rules:**
  - Discarded previous rules that lacked sufficient supporting examples or exhibited contradictions within the dataset (e.g., rules related to modifiers with ketone groups adjacent to carboxyl groups or those with fluorinated chains).

**Underlying Physical-Chemical Considerations:**

- **Coordination Sites and Electron Density:**
  - Functional groups containing nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen with lone pair electrons serve as coordination sites for Fe ions. The availability and nucleophilicity of these sites are influenced by electronic and steric factors.
  - Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of coordinating atoms (e.g., carboxyl oxygen), enhancing Fe binding. Conversely, electron-donating groups decrease acidity and reduce coordination ability.

- **Structural Flexibility and Steric Effects:**
  - Flexible linkages (e.g., ether chains) allow coordinating groups to adopt favorable conformations for Fe binding.
  - Bulky substituents or multiple adjacent functional groups can introduce steric hindrance or form intramolecular interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonds), reducing the availability of coordinating sites.

- **Resonance and Delocalization:**
  - Direct attachment of nitrogen heterocycles to carboxyl groups can lead to resonance delocalization of electron density, diminishing the coordinating ability of nitrogen atoms.
  - Separation of functional groups (e.g., via linkers) preserves the nucleophilicity of coordinating atoms.

**Balance Between Coverage and Specificity:**

- The updated rules prioritize broad coverage of the dataset while maintaining specificity. Rules like 1, 2, and 3 address common structural motifs and electronic effects, providing general guidelines applicable to many modifiers.
- More specific rules (e.g., Rules 4, 9, and 10) capture unique interactions involving less common functional groups or structural arrangements.
- The set of 10 rules strikes a balance between simplicity and complexity, ensuring comprehensive coverage without overcomplicating the predictive framework.

**Application of Rules:**

- **Predictive Utility:** Each rule provides a clear prediction of whether a modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf ratio based on its structural features. This aids in the rational design and selection of modifiers to optimize catalyst performance.
- **Guidance for New Modifiers:** By understanding the underlying principles, researchers can design new modifiers with desired properties, facilitating targeted improvements in the catalytic process.

---

By generating these refined rules, we have developed a robust framework that links the structural features of molecular modifiers to their impact on the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst. This framework leverages chemical insights into coordination chemistry, electronic effects, and molecular interactions, providing valuable guidance for optimizing the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Perfluorinated chains are highly electronegative and withdraw electron density from coordinating groups, decreasing their basicity and ability to bind Fe ions. This results in lower Fe incorporation.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with ether linkages and terminal oxygen or nitrogen atoms increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Ether oxygen atoms and terminal amino groups can act as additional coordination sites due to their lone pair electrons, enhancing the ability to coordinate with Fe ions and promoting greater Fe incorporation.

**Analysis and Rationale**

In developing these rules, careful consideration was given to the structural features of the modifiers and their corresponding Fe/Hf ratios as observed in the dataset. The rules focus on combinations of functional groups and their positions within the molecular structure, reflecting the underlying physical-chemical properties that influence Fe coordination.

- **Combining Substructures**: The rules illustrate how specific combinations of functional groups, such as amino groups with appropriate chain lengths, sulfur groups adjacent to aromatic rings, and ether linkages with terminal coordinating atoms, affect Fe incorporation.

- **Physical-Chemical Properties**:

  - **Coordination Sites**: Functional groups with lone pair electrons (amino, thiol, ether oxygen) provide coordination sites for Fe ions. The effectiveness of these sites depends on their accessibility and electronic properties.

  - **Electron Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups enhance the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxyl group, while electron-donating groups can reduce it. Resonance effects and inductive effects play significant roles.

  - **Steric Factors**: Steric hindrance from bulky groups or intramolecular interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonding in polyols) can impede coordination with Fe ions.

  - **Chain Length and Flexibility**: The length of aliphatic chains influences the flexibility and distance between coordinating groups, affecting chelation efficiency.

- **Prediction Clarity**: Each rule clearly predicts whether modifiers fitting its description result in high or low Fe/Hf ratios. Non-examples are provided where necessary to highlight exceptions.

- **Coverage and Balance**: The rules cover a broad spectrum of the dataset, balancing general trends with specific structural considerations. This ensures that the rules are both comprehensive and practical for predicting Fe/Hf outcomes.

**Application of Rules**

Researchers can apply these rules to design new modifiers that will achieve desired Fe/Hf ratios:

- **To Increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf)**:

  - **Incorporate Terminal Amino Groups**: Use aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal primary amino groups and appropriate chain lengths (four to eight carbons).

  - **Add Electron-Withdrawing Groups**: Use aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl, pyridyl).

  - **Include Sulfur-Containing Groups**: Introduce thiol groups adjacent to aromatic rings to enhance Fe coordination.

  - **Utilize Ether Linkages**: Incorporate ether linkages with terminal oxygen or nitrogen atoms to provide additional coordination sites.

  - **Select Appropriate Amino Acids**: Choose amino acids with aromatic side chains that lack additional electron-donating heteroatoms (e.g., phenylalanine).

- **To Decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf)**:

  - **Avoid Additional Coordinating Groups**: Use simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without extra coordinating functional groups.

  - **Use Electron-Donating Substituents**: Introduce electron-donating groups near the carboxylate to decrease acidity and coordination ability.

  - **Incorporate Polyols**: Utilize modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups to reduce Fe coordination due to steric hindrance and hydrogen bonding.

  - **Attach Nitrogen Heterocycles Directly**: Use modifiers where nitrogen heterocycles are directly attached to the carboxyl group to reduce nitrogen's availability for coordination.

  - **Include Perfluorinated Chains**: Employ perfluorinated alkyl chains to decrease the basicity of coordinating groups.

- **Optimize Catalyst Performance**: By strategically selecting modifiers based on these rules, researchers can control the Fe/Hf ratio, tailoring the catalyst's properties to enhance the yield of the target reaction.

By providing these refined and accurate rules, a clear relationship between molecular structure and Fe/Hf ratio is established. This knowledge facilitates the rational design of molecular modifiers, advancing the goals of optimizing and controlling the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ‐C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**:

  Rule 1 exhibits excellent clarity, as it clearly defines modifiers as aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal primary amino group and a chain length of four to eight carbons, predicting a high Fe/Hf ratio. The property insight is strong, explaining that the terminal amino group and appropriate chain length facilitate effective chelation with Fe ions, enhancing Fe incorporation. The rule combines multiple substructures (carboxylic acid, amino group, chain length), fulfilling the complexity criterion. Coverage is robust, supported by three data points (5-aminopentanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid), satisfying the requirement for at least two examples. The balance between specificity and applicability is well-achieved.

- **Comment 2**:

  Rule 2 provides clear criteria by specifying short-chain α-amino dicarboxylic acids with an amino group at the α-position result in a high Fe/Hf ratio. The property insight is adequate, highlighting that the proximity of coordinating groups enhances chelation efficiency with Fe ions. However, the coverage is limited, with only one supporting example ((2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid) and one non-example ((2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid). While the rule meets the complexity criterion by considering combinations of functional groups and chain length, the limited data points suggest a need for additional examples to strengthen its validity and applicability.

- **Comment 3**:

  Rule 3 demonstrates high clarity by defining modifiers as aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups, predicting a high Fe/Hf ratio. The property insight is strong, explaining how electron-withdrawing groups enhance acidity and coordination ability, and may introduce additional coordination sites. The rule effectively combines substructures, satisfying the complexity criterion. Coverage is strong, with three supporting examples (4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid) and a non-example for contrast. The balance between complexity and coverage is well-maintained.

- **Comment 4**:

  Rule 4 has acceptable clarity, identifying modifiers with sulfur-functional groups adjacent to an aromatic ring as leading to a high Fe/Hf ratio. The property insight is reasonable, noting that sulfur atoms coordinate strongly with Fe ions due to their lone pair electrons. However, coverage is weak, with only one supporting example (4-sulfanylbenzoic acid). While the rule meets the complexity criterion by considering the combination of sulfur groups and aromatic rings, additional data points are needed to reinforce the rule's reliability and applicability.

- **Comment 5**:

  Rule 5 provides clear guidance by stating that aliphatic carboxylic acids lacking additional coordinating groups or containing electron-donating substituents result in a low Fe/Hf ratio. The property insight is solid, explaining that the absence of coordinating groups leads to weak interactions with Fe ions. The rule combines multiple aspects (lack of coordinating groups and presence of electron-donating substituents), fulfilling the complexity criterion. Coverage is strong, supported by three examples (octanoic acid, 4-methylbenzoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid), meeting the coverage requirement. The balance between simplicity and applicability is effectively achieved.

- **Comment 6**:

  Rule 6 has acceptable clarity, identifying modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups (polyols) attached to aliphatic chains as leading to a low Fe/Hf ratio. The property insight is adequate, attributing decreased Fe incorporation to steric hindrance and intra-molecular hydrogen bonding from the polyol structure. The rule considers combinations of substructures, satisfying the complexity criterion. Coverage meets the minimum requirement with two examples ((2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid and 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid). While the rule is reasonably balanced, additional examples would enhance its robustness.

- **Comment 7**:

  Rule 7 offers good clarity by specifying that aromatic carboxylic acids with phenolic hydroxyl groups result in a low Fe/Hf ratio. The property insight is sound, explaining that phenolic hydroxyl groups are less nucleophilic, reducing their ability to coordinate with Fe ions. The rule combines substructures (aromatic ring, phenolic hydroxyl), satisfying the complexity criterion. Coverage is strong, supported by three examples (5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid, 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid). The balance between specificity and coverage is well-managed.

- **Comment 8**:

  Rule 8 presents acceptable clarity by indicating that modifiers with nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group lead to a low Fe/Hf ratio. The property insight is logical, noting that resonance delocalization reduces nitrogen's availability for coordination. The rule meets the complexity criterion by combining the presence of nitrogen heterocycles and their attachment to the carboxyl group. Coverage is minimal, with two examples (pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid). Additional data points would improve the rule's reliability.

- **Comment 9**:

  Rule 9 has acceptable clarity, stating that amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking additional electron-donating heteroatoms increase Fe/Hf. The property insight is moderate, suggesting π-Fe interactions enhance Fe incorporation, though the explanation could be expanded. Coverage is limited, with one supporting example ((2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid) and one non-example ((2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid). The rule fulfills the complexity criterion but would benefit from more supporting data to strengthen its applicability.

- **Comment 10**:

  Rule 10 offers good clarity by identifying modifiers containing perfluorinated alkyl chains as leading to a low Fe/Hf ratio. The property insight is adequate, explaining that perfluorinated chains reduce the basicity of coordinating groups due to their electronegativity. However, coverage is weak, with only one supporting example (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid). The rule is relatively simple and would benefit from additional examples to enhance its coverage and reliability.

- **Comment 11**:

  Rule 11 demonstrates good clarity by specifying that modifiers with ether linkages and terminal oxygen or nitrogen atoms increase Fe/Hf. The property insight is solid, noting that ether oxygen atoms and terminal amino groups provide additional coordination sites. The rule meets the complexity criterion by considering combinations of ether linkages and terminal functional groups. Coverage is acceptable, supported by two examples (2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid). The balance between complexity and coverage is satisfactory.
