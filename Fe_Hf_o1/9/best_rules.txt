**Revised Rules**

**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal primary amino group (–NH₂) increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: The terminal amino group serves as a strong coordination site for Fe ions. The flexible aliphatic chain allows the amino and carboxyl groups to effectively chelate Fe ions, enhancing their incorporation into the catalyst.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group and enhance the electrophilicity of the aromatic ring. This facilitates stronger coordination with Fe ions by stabilizing negative charges during coordination.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group and reduce the electrophilicity of the aromatic ring. This diminishes the modifier's ability to coordinate with Fe ions due to a less favorable charge distribution.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing both a carboxyl group and a thiol (–SH) group increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Thiol groups have a strong affinity for Fe ions due to the lone pair electrons on sulfur. The presence of both carboxyl and thiol groups allows for bidentate coordination, enhancing Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages and terminal polar groups (–OH or –NH₂) increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Ether linkages increase molecular flexibility, enabling terminal polar groups to adopt conformations favorable for Fe coordination. The polar groups provide additional coordination sites for Fe ions.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups (polyols) decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf).**

  - **Example supporting this rule**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase steric hindrance and can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds. This reduces the availability of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups to coordinate with Fe ions.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with phenolic hydroxyl groups attached directly to an aromatic ring decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Phenolic hydroxyl groups are resonance-stabilized and less nucleophilic, making them less effective at coordinating with Fe ions. Their involvement in hydrogen bonding further reduces coordination availability.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf).**

  - **Example supporting this rule**:
    - **Octanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Without additional functional groups capable of coordinating with Fe ions, these modifiers have limited interaction with Fe, leading to decreased Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles connected via an aromatic or aliphatic linker to a carboxyl group increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles act as additional coordination sites for Fe ions. The linker provides spatial flexibility, optimizing the coordination environment around the Fe ions.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with sulfur-containing functional groups (e.g., methylsulfanyl, thiol) increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf), especially when combined with amino groups.**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-(methylsulfanyl)propanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Sulfur atoms act as soft Lewis bases with lone pair electrons capable of coordinating with Fe ions. The presence of amino groups enhances chelation by providing additional coordination sites.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with multiple carboxyl groups and an amino group positioned for chelation increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf).**

  - **Example supporting this rule**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid**

  - **Explanation**: The amino group situated between carboxyl groups allows for strong chelation with Fe ions. This tridentate coordination enhances Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with multiple carboxyl groups but lacking other coordinating groups decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf).**

  - **Example supporting this rule**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple carboxyl groups without supportive coordinating groups can lead to intramolecular interactions or steric hindrance, reducing the modifier's ability to coordinate with Fe ions effectively.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with fluorinated aliphatic chains decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf).**

  - **Example supporting this rule**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Fluorine atoms are highly electronegative and withdraw electron density from coordinating atoms, diminishing their ability to interact with Fe ions.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing bulky aromatic groups adjacent to coordinating sites decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf).**

  - **Example supporting this rule**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Bulky groups introduce steric hindrance, obstructing the approach of Fe ions to coordinating sites and reducing Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups on an aliphatic chain increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf) when steric hindrance is minimal.**

  - **Example supporting this rule**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Acylation modifies the electronic properties of the amino group, reducing its basicity while maintaining coordination ability. Minimal steric hindrance allows effective interaction with Fe ions.

**Analysis and Rationale**

In reviewing and refining the rules, I focused on combining multiple functional groups within each rule to illustrate how different sub-structures synergistically affect the Fe/Hf ratio. The rules are designed to predict whether a modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value based on its structural features.

**Key Considerations:**

- **Functional Group Synergy:** Emphasis was placed on how combinations of functional groups, such as carboxyl groups with amino, thiol, or ether linkages, influence Fe coordination.

- **Electronic Effects:** The impact of electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups on the acidity and nucleophilicity of coordinating sites was considered crucial in predicting Fe/Hf outcomes.

- **Steric Factors:** The size and spatial arrangement of substituents were analyzed to understand how steric hindrance affects the accessibility of coordinating groups to Fe ions.

- **Coordination Sites:** The presence of additional coordination sites, such as nitrogen in heterocycles and sulfur-containing groups, was recognized as enhancing Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

**Balance and Coverage:**

- **Broad Coverage:** Rules like 1, 2, and 3 cover common structural motifs found in the dataset, providing guidance applicable to a wide range of modifiers.

- **Specificity:** Rules such as 4, 10, and 14 address specific combinations of functional groups, offering insights into less common but impactful modifiers.

- **Complexity and Simplicity:** The set of rules maintains a balance between simple rules with higher coverage and complex rules that address nuanced interactions, as per the requirements.

**Improvements Made:**

- **Consolidation of Rules:** Redundant or overlapping rules were merged for clarity. For example, sulfur-containing modifiers were grouped into a single rule regardless of the sulfur functional group type.

- **Emphasis on Combinations:** Rules were refined to focus on direct combinations of sub-structures, satisfying the requirement to illustrate how multiple functional groups affect Fe/Hf.

- **Clarity in Predictions:** Each rule clearly states whether the modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value, making the rules practical for predicting outcomes.

**Conclusion**

The revised rules provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the relationship between molecular modifiers and the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst. By considering both the electronic and steric effects of functional group combinations, these rules can guide the design and selection of modifiers to optimize catalyst performance in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------
