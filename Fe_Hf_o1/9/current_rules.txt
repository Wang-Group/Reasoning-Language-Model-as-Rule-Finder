**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal primary amino group (–NH₂) and a chain length of four to eight carbons increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: The terminal primary amino group offers a strong coordination site for Fe ions. The flexible aliphatic chain (containing four to eight carbons) allows for effective chelation between the amino and carboxyl groups, enhancing Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with an amino group at the α-position (α-amino dicarboxylic acids) and a short chain (four carbons) increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf).**

  - **Example supporting this rule**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid**

  - **Non-example**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Short-chain α-amino dicarboxylic acids have coordinating groups in close proximity, allowing for effective chelation with Fe ions. Longer chains may reduce chelation efficiency, decreasing Fe incorporation.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with a para-substituted electron-withdrawing group (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl, pyridyl) increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

  - **Non-example**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups at the para position increase the acidity of the carboxyl group and may introduce additional coordination sites (e.g., nitrogen in pyridine). This enhances the ability to coordinate with Fe ions, promoting greater Fe incorporation.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing sulfur-functional groups (e.g., thiol (–SH)) adjacent to an aromatic ring increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf).**

  - **Example supporting this rule**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Sulfur atoms are soft Lewis bases with lone pair electrons that coordinate strongly with Fe ions. When adjacent to an aromatic ring, they enhance Fe binding due to increased electron density and accessibility.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids lacking additional coordinating functional groups or containing electron-donating substituents decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **Octanoic acid**
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Without additional functional groups capable of coordinating with Fe ions, these modifiers interact weakly with Fe. Electron-donating substituents decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, further reducing coordination ability and Fe incorporation.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups (polyols) attached to aliphatic chains decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds or create steric hindrance, reducing their availability to coordinate with Fe ions. This decreases Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with phenolic hydroxyl groups decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Phenolic hydroxyl groups are resonance-stabilized, making them less nucleophilic and less effective at coordinating with Fe ions. Additionally, steric hindrance from the aromatic ring may impede coordination.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Direct attachment leads to resonance delocalization of the nitrogen's lone pair electrons with the carboxyl group, reducing their availability for Fe coordination and resulting in lower Fe incorporation.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking additional electron-donating heteroatoms increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf).**

  - **Example supporting this rule**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid**

  - **Non-example**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Aromatic side chains without additional electron-donating heteroatoms (like nitrogen in indole) can engage in π-Fe interactions, enhancing Fe incorporation. Presence of electron-donating heteroatoms may interfere with coordination.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing perfluorinated alkyl chains decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf).**

  - **Example supporting this rule**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Perfluorinated chains are highly electronegative and withdraw electron density from coordinating groups, decreasing their basicity and ability to bind Fe ions. This results in lower Fe incorporation.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with ether linkages and terminal oxygen or nitrogen atoms increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Ether oxygen atoms and terminal amino groups can act as additional coordination sites due to their lone pair electrons, enhancing the ability to coordinate with Fe ions and promoting greater Fe incorporation.

**Analysis and Rationale**

In developing these rules, careful consideration was given to the structural features of the modifiers and their corresponding Fe/Hf ratios as observed in the dataset. The rules focus on combinations of functional groups and their positions within the molecular structure, reflecting the underlying physical-chemical properties that influence Fe coordination.

- **Combining Substructures**: The rules illustrate how specific combinations of functional groups, such as amino groups with appropriate chain lengths, sulfur groups adjacent to aromatic rings, and ether linkages with terminal coordinating atoms, affect Fe incorporation.

- **Physical-Chemical Properties**:

  - **Coordination Sites**: Functional groups with lone pair electrons (amino, thiol, ether oxygen) provide coordination sites for Fe ions. The effectiveness of these sites depends on their accessibility and electronic properties.

  - **Electron Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups enhance the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxyl group, while electron-donating groups can reduce it. Resonance effects and inductive effects play significant roles.

  - **Steric Factors**: Steric hindrance from bulky groups or intramolecular interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonding in polyols) can impede coordination with Fe ions.

  - **Chain Length and Flexibility**: The length of aliphatic chains influences the flexibility and distance between coordinating groups, affecting chelation efficiency.

- **Prediction Clarity**: Each rule clearly predicts whether modifiers fitting its description result in high or low Fe/Hf ratios. Non-examples are provided where necessary to highlight exceptions.

- **Coverage and Balance**: The rules cover a broad spectrum of the dataset, balancing general trends with specific structural considerations. This ensures that the rules are both comprehensive and practical for predicting Fe/Hf outcomes.

**Application of Rules**

Researchers can apply these rules to design new modifiers that will achieve desired Fe/Hf ratios:

- **To Increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf)**:

  - **Incorporate Terminal Amino Groups**: Use aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal primary amino groups and appropriate chain lengths (four to eight carbons).

  - **Add Electron-Withdrawing Groups**: Use aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl, pyridyl).

  - **Include Sulfur-Containing Groups**: Introduce thiol groups adjacent to aromatic rings to enhance Fe coordination.

  - **Utilize Ether Linkages**: Incorporate ether linkages with terminal oxygen or nitrogen atoms to provide additional coordination sites.

  - **Select Appropriate Amino Acids**: Choose amino acids with aromatic side chains that lack additional electron-donating heteroatoms (e.g., phenylalanine).

- **To Decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf)**:

  - **Avoid Additional Coordinating Groups**: Use simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without extra coordinating functional groups.

  - **Use Electron-Donating Substituents**: Introduce electron-donating groups near the carboxylate to decrease acidity and coordination ability.

  - **Incorporate Polyols**: Utilize modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups to reduce Fe coordination due to steric hindrance and hydrogen bonding.

  - **Attach Nitrogen Heterocycles Directly**: Use modifiers where nitrogen heterocycles are directly attached to the carboxyl group to reduce nitrogen's availability for coordination.

  - **Include Perfluorinated Chains**: Employ perfluorinated alkyl chains to decrease the basicity of coordinating groups.

- **Optimize Catalyst Performance**: By strategically selecting modifiers based on these rules, researchers can control the Fe/Hf ratio, tailoring the catalyst's properties to enhance the yield of the target reaction.
