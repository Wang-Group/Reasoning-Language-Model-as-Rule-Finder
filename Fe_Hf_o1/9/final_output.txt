    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic monocarboxylic acids with a terminal primary amino group (–NH₂) increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf).**
  - *Examples supporting this rule*:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
  - *Explanation*: The terminal amino group enhances coordination with Fe ions due to its lone pair of electrons. The flexibility of the aliphatic chain allows effective chelation, increasing Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are benzoic acid derivatives with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf).**
  - *Examples supporting this rule*:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**

These rules have been carefully generated by analyzing the dataset and considering the underlying chemical principles that govern the coordination between modifiers and Fe ions. The rules focus on combinations of functional groups and their positions within the molecular structure, which directly influence the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst.

By prioritizing rules that cover broader aspects of the dataset and combining multiple substructures, the rules aim to provide clear predictions for the Fe/Hf value based on the structural features of any given modifier. The balance between simple and complex rules ensures comprehensive coverage while maintaining specificity.

The rules consider factors such as electron-withdrawing and electron-donating effects, steric hindrance, the presence of coordination sites (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, thiol, pyridine nitrogen), and the impact of molecular flexibility on metal coordination. This approach aligns with the requirements and provides a valuable tool for predicting and optimizing the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalytic system.---------------------------------------------------------------

    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Revised Rules**

**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal primary amino group (–NH₂) increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: The terminal amino group serves as a strong coordination site for Fe ions. The flexible aliphatic chain allows the amino and carboxyl groups to effectively chelate Fe ions, enhancing their incorporation into the catalyst.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group and enhance the electrophilicity of the aromatic ring. This facilitates stronger coordination with Fe ions by stabilizing negative charges during coordination.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group and reduce the electrophilicity of the aromatic ring. This diminishes the modifier's ability to coordinate with Fe ions due to a less favorable charge distribution.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing both a carboxyl group and a thiol (–SH) group increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Thiol groups have a strong affinity for Fe ions due to the lone pair electrons on sulfur. The presence of both carboxyl and thiol groups allows for bidentate coordination, enhancing Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages and terminal polar groups (–OH or –NH₂) increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Ether linkages increase molecular flexibility, enabling terminal polar groups to adopt conformations favorable for Fe coordination. The polar groups provide additional coordination sites for Fe ions.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups (polyols) decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf).**

  - **Example supporting this rule**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase steric hindrance and can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds. This reduces the availability of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups to coordinate with Fe ions.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with phenolic hydroxyl groups attached directly to an aromatic ring decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Phenolic hydroxyl groups are resonance-stabilized and less nucleophilic, making them less effective at coordinating with Fe ions. Their involvement in hydrogen bonding further reduces coordination availability.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf).**

  - **Example supporting this rule**:
    - **Octanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Without additional functional groups capable of coordinating with Fe ions, these modifiers have limited interaction with Fe, leading to decreased Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles connected via an aromatic or aliphatic linker to a carboxyl group increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles act as additional coordination sites for Fe ions. The linker provides spatial flexibility, optimizing the coordination environment around the Fe ions.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with sulfur-containing functional groups (e.g., methylsulfanyl, thiol) increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf), especially when combined with amino groups.**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-(methylsulfanyl)propanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Sulfur atoms act as soft Lewis bases with lone pair electrons capable of coordinating with Fe ions. The presence of amino groups enhances chelation by providing additional coordination sites.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with multiple carboxyl groups and an amino group positioned for chelation increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf).**

  - **Example supporting this rule**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid**

  - **Explanation**: The amino group situated between carboxyl groups allows for strong chelation with Fe ions. This tridentate coordination enhances Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with multiple carboxyl groups but lacking other coordinating groups decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf).**

  - **Example supporting this rule**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple carboxyl groups without supportive coordinating groups can lead to intramolecular interactions or steric hindrance, reducing the modifier's ability to coordinate with Fe ions effectively.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with fluorinated aliphatic chains decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf).**

  - **Example supporting this rule**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Fluorine atoms are highly electronegative and withdraw electron density from coordinating atoms, diminishing their ability to interact with Fe ions.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing bulky aromatic groups adjacent to coordinating sites decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf).**

  - **Example supporting this rule**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Bulky groups introduce steric hindrance, obstructing the approach of Fe ions to coordinating sites and reducing Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups on an aliphatic chain increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf) when steric hindrance is minimal.**

  - **Example supporting this rule**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Acylation modifies the electronic properties of the amino group, reducing its basicity while maintaining coordination ability. Minimal steric hindrance allows effective interaction with Fe ions.

**Analysis and Rationale**

In reviewing and refining the rules, I focused on combining multiple functional groups within each rule to illustrate how different sub-structures synergistically affect the Fe/Hf ratio. The rules are designed to predict whether a modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value based on its structural features.

**Key Considerations:**

- **Functional Group Synergy:** Emphasis was placed on how combinations of functional groups, such as carboxyl groups with amino, thiol, or ether linkages, influence Fe coordination.

- **Electronic Effects:** The impact of electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups on the acidity and nucleophilicity of coordinating sites was considered crucial in predicting Fe/Hf outcomes.

- **Steric Factors:** The size and spatial arrangement of substituents were analyzed to understand how steric hindrance affects the accessibility of coordinating groups to Fe ions.

- **Coordination Sites:** The presence of additional coordination sites, such as nitrogen in heterocycles and sulfur-containing groups, was recognized as enhancing Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

**Balance and Coverage:**

- **Broad Coverage:** Rules like 1, 2, and 3 cover common structural motifs found in the dataset, providing guidance applicable to a wide range of modifiers.

- **Specificity:** Rules such as 4, 10, and 14 address specific combinations of functional groups, offering insights into less common but impactful modifiers.

- **Complexity and Simplicity:** The set of rules maintains a balance between simple rules with higher coverage and complex rules that address nuanced interactions, as per the requirements.

**Improvements Made:**

- **Consolidation of Rules:** Redundant or overlapping rules were merged for clarity. For example, sulfur-containing modifiers were grouped into a single rule regardless of the sulfur functional group type.

- **Emphasis on Combinations:** Rules were refined to focus on direct combinations of sub-structures, satisfying the requirement to illustrate how multiple functional groups affect Fe/Hf.

- **Clarity in Predictions:** Each rule clearly states whether the modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value, making the rules practical for predicting outcomes.

**Conclusion**

The revised rules provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the relationship between molecular modifiers and the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst. By considering both the electronic and steric effects of functional group combinations, these rules can guide the design and selection of modifiers to optimize catalyst performance in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------

  - **Example supporting this rule**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds, reducing their availability to coordinate with Fe ions.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with phenolic hydroxyl groups attached directly to an aromatic ring decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Phenolic hydroxyl groups are resonance-stabilized, making them less nucleophilic and less effective at coordinating with Fe ions.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf).**

  - **Example supporting this rule**:
    - **Octanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Without additional functional groups capable of coordinating with Fe ions, these modifiers have limited interaction with Fe, leading to decreased Fe incorporation.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles connected to a carboxyl group increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles act as additional coordination sites for Fe ions, enhancing Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with sulfur-containing functional groups (e.g., methylsulfanyl) increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-(methylsulfanyl)propanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Sulfur atoms provide soft Lewis base sites with lone pair electrons capable of coordinating with Fe ions, enhancing Fe incorporation.

---

  - **Explanation**: Bulky groups introduce steric hindrance, obstructing the approach of Fe ions to coordinating sites and reducing Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with fluorinated aliphatic chains decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf).**

  - **Example supporting this rule**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Fluorine atoms are highly electronegative and withdraw electron density from coordinating atoms, diminishing their ability to interact with Fe ions.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with ketone groups adjacent to carboxyl groups decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf).**

  - **Example supporting this rule**:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Ketone groups may withdraw electron density from nearby oxygen atoms, reducing their ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal hydroxyl group (–OH) increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf).**

  - **Example supporting this rule**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: The terminal hydroxyl group provides an additional coordination site for Fe ions, enhancing Fe incorporation.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups at the ortho or meta position relative to the carboxyl group on aromatic rings increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf).**

  - **Example supporting this rule**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups in these positions can increase the acidity of the carboxyl group and introduce additional coordination sites, facilitating Fe coordination.

**Analysis and Rationale**

In developing these rules, the dataset was meticulously analyzed to identify patterns correlating specific functional groups and structural features of the molecular modifiers with the Fe/Hf ratio (High or Low). The rules aim to capture the interplay between chemical structure and Fe coordination capability.

**Key Considerations:**

- **Coordination Sites:**
  - **Nitrogen and Sulfur Atoms:** Functional groups containing nitrogen (e.g., amino groups, pyridine rings) and sulfur (e.g., thiol, methylsulfanyl) provide lone pair electrons that can coordinate with Fe ions.
  - **Terminal Polar Groups:** Terminal amino and hydroxyl groups in aliphatic chains offer additional coordination sites for Fe ions.

- **Electronic Effects:**
  - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups:** Groups like nitro, bromomethyl, and pyridyl increase the acidity of carboxyl groups, enhancing their ability to coordinate with Fe ions.
  - **Electron-Donating Groups:** Groups like hydroxyl and amino decrease carboxyl group acidity, reducing Fe coordination capability.

- **Steric Factors:**
  - **Bulky Substituents:** Large aromatic groups near coordination sites can hinder Fe access, decreasing Fe/Hf ratios.
  - **Flexibility:** Ether linkages and flexible aliphatic chains enable the molecule to adopt conformations favorable for Fe coordination.

- **Hydrogen Bonding and Intramolecular Interactions:**
  - **Polyols:** Multiple hydroxyl groups can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds, limiting their availability for Fe coordination.
  - **Ketone Groups:** Adjacent ketone groups may reduce electron density on coordinating atoms.

**Balance and Coverage:**

- **Broad Coverage:** Rules 1, 2, and 3 address common structural motifs affecting Fe/Hf ratios, providing guidelines applicable to a wide range of modifiers in the dataset.
- **Specificity:** Rules like 4, 10, and 12 focus on less common but impactful functional groups, offering insights into modifiers with unique coordination properties.
- **Complexity and Simplicity:** The rules strike a balance between encompassing broad trends and detailing specific interactions, aligning with the requirement to balance coverage and complexity.

By applying these rules, researchers can predict the impact of different molecular modifiers on the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst. This predictive capability facilitates the rational design and selection of modifiers to optimize catalyst performance in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

    Target Name: Fe/Hf
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal primary amino group (–NH₂) and a single carboxyl group increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: The terminal amino group provides a strong coordination site for Fe ions. The aliphatic chain offers flexibility, allowing effective chelation between the amino and carboxyl groups. Having a single carboxyl group prevents competition between multiple acidic sites, enhancing Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromo, pyridyl, thiol) at the para position increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions. Additional coordinating atoms (e.g., nitrogen in pyridine, sulfur in thiol) provide extra binding sites, further promoting Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, amino, hydroxyl) at the para position decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions. These groups may also hinder Fe binding due to steric effects or by engaging in competing interactions, leading to lower Fe incorporation.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing sulfur-containing functional groups (e.g., thiol (–SH), methylsulfanyl groups) increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Sulfur atoms act as soft Lewis bases with lone pair electrons that coordinate strongly with Fe ions. The presence of sulfur-containing groups enhances Fe binding and incorporation into the catalyst due to the strong affinity between sulfur and Fe.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages and terminal polar groups (e.g., –OH, –NH₂) increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Ether oxygen atoms and terminal polar groups provide multiple coordination sites for Fe ions. The flexibility of ether linkages allows these groups to adopt favorable conformations, enhancing Fe coordination and incorporation into the catalyst.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups (polyols) decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds or create steric hindrance, reducing their availability to coordinate with Fe ions. This decreases Fe incorporation into the catalyst due to less effective coordination.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with phenolic hydroxyl groups attached directly to an aromatic ring decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Phenolic hydroxyl groups are resonance-stabilized, making them less nucleophilic and less effective at coordinating with Fe ions. This results in lower Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf).**

  - **Example supporting this rule**:
    - **Octanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Without additional functional groups capable of coordinating with Fe ions, these modifiers interact weakly with Fe, leading to decreased Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers where nitrogen heterocycles are attached directly to the carboxyl group decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

  - **Explanation**: When the nitrogen heterocycle is directly attached to the carboxyl group, resonance delocalization reduces the availability of the nitrogen's lone pair electrons for Fe coordination. This results in lower Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers where nitrogen heterocycles are connected via a linker (aryl or aliphatic chain) to the carboxyl group increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: The linker separates the nitrogen heterocycle from the electron-withdrawing effects of the carboxyl group, preserving the lone pair electrons on nitrogen for coordination with Fe ions. This enhances Fe binding and incorporation into the catalyst.

**Analysis and Rationale**

In reviewing the dataset of molecular modifiers and their corresponding Fe/Hf values, we identified patterns that correlate specific structural features with the Fe/Hf ratio. The rules above have been refined to accurately capture these relationships, ensuring they are grounded in chemical principles and supported by the data.

**Key Adjustments and Improvements:**

- **Refinement of Rule 1:**
  - Specified that modifiers must have a single carboxyl group in addition to a terminal primary amino group to increase Fe/Hf. This accounts for exceptions like glutamic acid, which contains two carboxyl groups and exhibits a low Fe/Hf ratio.

- **Consolidation of Sulfur-Containing Modifiers (Rule 4):**
  - Unified sulfur-containing functional groups under a single rule, recognizing their common ability to enhance Fe coordination due to the soft Lewis base character of sulfur.

- **Clarification of Ether Linkage Impact (Rule 5):**
  - Included modifiers with ether linkages and terminal polar groups, emphasizing the role of molecular flexibility and multiple coordination sites in increasing Fe/Hf.

- **Emphasis on Electronically Influenced Coordination (Rules 2 and 3):**
  - Highlighted the impact of electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups on the acidity of the carboxyl group and the overall coordination ability with Fe ions.

**Underlying Physical-Chemical Considerations:**

- **Coordination Sites and Electron Density:**
  - Functional groups with lone pair electrons (amino, hydroxyl, thiol) can coordinate with Fe ions. Their availability and effectiveness depend on electronic effects and steric factors.
  - Electron-withdrawing groups enhance the acidity and coordinating ability of carboxyl groups, while electron-donating groups have the opposite effect.

- **Steric Factors and Molecular Flexibility:**
  - Molecular flexibility allows coordinating groups to adopt favorable conformations for Fe binding. Steric hindrance from bulky groups or rigid structures can impede effective coordination.

- **Resonance and Delocalization Effects:**
  - Resonance delocalization in heterocycles or aromatic systems can reduce the availability of lone pair electrons for Fe coordination, affecting the Fe/Hf ratio.

**Balance Between Coverage and Specificity:**

- The set of 10 rules provides comprehensive coverage of the dataset, with each rule addressing a distinct structural feature or functional group that influences Fe/Hf.
- By combining broader rules with specific ones, we ensure that the rules are both generalizable and detailed enough to account for exceptions.

**Application of Rules:**

- **Predictive Utility:**
  - Researchers can use these rules to predict whether a new modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf ratio based on its structural features.
  - This aids in the rational design and selection of modifiers to optimize the catalyst's performance in the reaction.

- **Guidance for Modifier Design:**
  - Understanding the impact of specific functional groups and molecular structures allows for targeted synthesis of modifiers that enhance Fe incorporation.

By refining these rules, we provide a robust framework that links the chemical structure of molecular modifiers to their effect on the Fe/Hf ratio. This framework is built upon a detailed analysis of the dataset and leverages fundamental chemical principles, offering valuable insights for optimizing the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------

    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal primary amino group (–NH₂) increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: The terminal primary amino group provides a strong coordination site for Fe ions. The flexible aliphatic chain allows effective chelation between the amino and carboxyl groups, enhancing Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halogens, pyridyl, thiol) at the para position increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions. Additional coordinating atoms (e.g., nitrogen in pyridine, sulfur in thiol) provide extra binding sites, further promoting Fe incorporation.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing sulfur-containing functional groups (e.g., thiol (–SH), methylsulfanyl groups) increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Sulfur atoms act as soft Lewis bases with lone pair electrons that coordinate strongly with Fe ions. The presence of sulfur-containing groups enhances Fe binding and incorporation into the catalyst due to the strong affinity between sulfur and Fe.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages and terminal polar groups (e.g., –OH, –NH₂) increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Ether oxygen atoms and terminal polar groups provide multiple coordination sites for Fe ions. The flexibility of ether linkages allows these groups to adopt favorable conformations, enhancing Fe coordination and incorporation into the catalyst.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, amino, hydroxyl) at the para position decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions. These groups may also hinder Fe binding due to steric effects or by engaging in competing interactions, leading to lower Fe incorporation.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups (polyols) decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds or create steric hindrance, reducing their availability to coordinate with Fe ions. This decreases Fe incorporation into the catalyst due to less effective coordination.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf).**

  - **Example supporting this rule**:
    - **Octanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Without additional functional groups capable of coordinating with Fe ions, these modifiers interact weakly with Fe, leading to decreased Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with phenolic hydroxyl groups attached directly to an aromatic ring decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Phenolic hydroxyl groups are resonance-stabilized, making them less nucleophilic and less effective at coordinating with Fe ions. This results in lower Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers where nitrogen heterocycles are connected via a linker (aryl or aliphatic chain) to the carboxyl group increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: The linker separates the nitrogen heterocycle from the electron-withdrawing effects of the carboxyl group, preserving the lone pair electrons on nitrogen for coordination with Fe ions. This enhances Fe binding and incorporation into the catalyst.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers where nitrogen heterocycles are attached directly to the carboxyl group decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

  - **Explanation**: When the nitrogen heterocycle is directly attached to the carboxyl group, resonance delocalization reduces the availability of the nitrogen's lone pair electrons for Fe coordination. This results in lower Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are amino acids containing additional coordinating groups (e.g., carboxyl, amino, sulfanyl) increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid**
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid**
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: The presence of multiple coordinating groups, such as amino and carboxyl groups, enhances the ability to chelate Fe ions. Additional functional groups provide extra coordination sites, increasing Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with electron-withdrawing substituents on aliphatic chains increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf).**

  - **Example supporting this rule**:
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups on aliphatic chains increase the acidity of adjacent functional groups and may introduce additional coordination sites, enhancing Fe binding.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with multiple carboxyl groups and without additional coordinating groups decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid**
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple carboxyl groups can lead to stronger binding with Hf ions in the MOL, reducing available sites for Fe coordination and decreasing Fe incorporation.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf).**

  - **Example supporting this rule**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Perfluorinated chains are highly electronegative and can reduce the overall basicity of coordinating groups, decreasing their ability to bind Fe ions.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing bulky aromatic systems without available coordinating groups decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf).**

  - **Example supporting this rule**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Bulky aromatic systems like indole groups can create steric hindrance and lack available lone pair electrons for effective Fe coordination, leading to lower Fe incorporation.

---

**End of Rules**

**Analysis and Rationale**

In analyzing the dataset, we identified patterns linking specific structural features of the molecular modifiers to their effect on the Fe/Hf ratio. The rules above are designed to:

- **Illustrate Combinations of Substructures**: Each rule combines multiple functional groups or substructures to define modifiers that influence the Fe/Hf ratio.

- **Reflect Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The rules consider coordination chemistry principles, such as Lewis acid-base interactions, electron density, steric factors, and resonance effects.

- **Provide Clear Predictions**: Each rule specifies whether modifiers fitting its description will result in a high or low Fe/Hf ratio, aiding in the prediction of outcomes for new modifiers.

- **Cover a Broad Range of the Dataset**: The rules are crafted to include as many modifiers as possible, ensuring comprehensive coverage while highlighting significant structural distinctions.

- **Balance Simplicity and Complexity**: The set includes both broad rules with high coverage (e.g., Rules 1 and 2) and more specific rules addressing particular cases (e.g., Rules 12 to 15).

**Key Considerations:**

- **Coordination Sites**: Functional groups such as amino, thiol, and ether linkages provide lone pair electrons that can coordinate with Fe ions, enhancing Fe incorporation.

- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity and coordination ability of carboxyl groups, while electron-donating groups decrease it.

- **Steric Factors**: Bulky groups or rigid structures can hinder effective coordination by limiting access to coordinating sites.

- **Resonance Delocalization**: Delocalization of lone pair electrons in aromatic systems or heterocycles can reduce their availability for coordination with Fe ions.

**Application of Rules:**

- **Predictive Utility**: Researchers can apply these rules to anticipate the impact of new modifiers on the Fe/Hf ratio, facilitating the design of effective catalysts.

- **Guidance for Modifier Selection**: Understanding these structural influences allows for the strategic selection or synthesis of modifiers that enhance Fe incorporation, optimizing the catalyst's performance in the target reaction.

---

By formulating these rules, we provide a comprehensive framework that links molecular structure to catalyst composition, grounded in chemical principles and supported by the dataset. This approach aids in the rational design of modifiers to control and optimize the Fe/Hf ratio, advancing the goals of the research program.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Target Name: Fe/Hf
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal primary amino group (–NH₂) increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: The terminal primary amino group offers a strong coordination site for Fe ions. The flexible aliphatic chain facilitates effective chelation between the amino and carboxyl groups, enhancing Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halogens, pyridyl, thiol) at the para position increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group and may introduce additional coordination sites (e.g., nitrogen in pyridine, sulfur in thiol). This enhances the ability to coordinate with Fe ions, promoting greater Fe incorporation.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing sulfur-containing functional groups (e.g., thiol (–SH), methylsulfanyl groups) increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Sulfur atoms act as soft Lewis bases with lone pair electrons that coordinate strongly with Fe ions. The presence of sulfur-containing groups enhances Fe binding due to the strong affinity between sulfur and Fe.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with multiple coordinating groups (e.g., amino, carboxyl) increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid**
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid**
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: The presence of multiple coordinating groups allows for effective chelation with Fe ions. This multi-point binding enhances Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups or with electron-donating substituents decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **Octanoic acid**
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Without additional functional groups capable of coordinating with Fe ions, these modifiers interact weakly with Fe. Electron-donating substituents decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, further reducing coordination ability.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups (polyols) decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds or create steric hindrance, reducing their availability to coordinate with Fe ions. This decreases Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers where nitrogen heterocycles are connected via a linker (aryl or aliphatic chain) to the carboxyl group increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: The linker separates the nitrogen heterocycle from the electron-withdrawing effects of the carboxyl group, preserving the lone pair electrons on nitrogen for coordination with Fe ions. This enhances Fe binding.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers where nitrogen heterocycles are attached directly to the carboxyl group decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Direct attachment leads to resonance delocalization of the nitrogen's lone pair electrons with the carboxyl group, reducing their availability for Fe coordination and resulting in lower Fe incorporation.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with phenolic hydroxyl groups attached directly to an aromatic ring decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Phenolic hydroxyl groups are resonance-stabilized, making them less nucleophilic and less effective at coordinating with Fe ions. Additionally, steric hindrance may impede coordination.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf).**

  - **Example supporting this rule**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Perfluorinated chains are highly electronegative and decrease the basicity of coordinating groups. This reduces their ability to bind Fe ions, leading to lower Fe incorporation.

---

**End of Rules**

---

**Analysis and Rationale**

In analyzing the dataset, the following patterns were identified linking specific structural features of the molecular modifiers to their effect on the Fe/Hf ratio:

- **Combination of Substructures**: The rules illustrate how combinations of functional groups, such as amino groups with carboxyl acids or sulfur-containing groups with aromatic systems, influence Fe incorporation.

- **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:

  - **Coordination Ability**: Functional groups with lone pair electrons (e.g., amino, thiol, pyridyl) can coordinate with Fe ions, enhancing incorporation.
  
  - **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase acidity and coordination potential, while electron-donating groups decrease it.
  
  - **Steric Factors**: Bulky groups or multiple hydroxyl groups can hinder coordination due to steric hindrance.
  
  - **Resonance Delocalization**: Delocalization of lone pair electrons reduces availability for coordination.

- **Prediction Clarity**: Each rule specifies whether the modifiers fitting its description increase (High Fe/Hf) or decrease (Low Fe/Hf) the Fe/Hf ratio.

- **Coverage**: The rules prioritize broader patterns observed in the dataset, ensuring a suitable balance between coverage and specificity.

**Application of Rules**

Researchers can apply these rules to predict the impact of new modifiers on the Fe/Hf ratio:

- **Designing New Modifiers**: By incorporating functional groups that enhance Fe coordination (e.g., amino groups, sulfur-containing groups), modifiers can be tailored to increase Fe incorporation.

- **Avoiding Unfavorable Structures**: Structures known to decrease Fe/Hf (e.g., modifiers with phenolic hydroxyl groups or perfluorinated chains) can be avoided when a high Fe/Hf ratio is desired.

- **Optimizing Catalyst Performance**: Understanding these structure-activity relationships allows for strategic modifications to improve catalyst effectiveness in the target reaction.

---

By formulating these rules, a comprehensive framework is provided that links molecular structure to catalyst composition. This knowledge facilitates the rational design of modifiers to control and optimize the Fe/Hf ratio, advancing the goals of the research program.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Target Name: Fe/Hf
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal primary amino group (–NH₂) and a chain length of four to eight carbons increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: The terminal primary amino group offers a strong coordination site for Fe ions. The flexible aliphatic chain (containing four to eight carbons) allows for effective chelation between the amino and carboxyl groups, enhancing Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with an amino group at the α-position (α-amino dicarboxylic acids) and a short chain (four carbons) increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf).**

  - **Example supporting this rule**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid**

  - **Non-example**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Short-chain α-amino dicarboxylic acids have coordinating groups in close proximity, allowing for effective chelation with Fe ions. Longer chains may reduce chelation efficiency, decreasing Fe incorporation.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with a para-substituted electron-withdrawing group (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl, pyridyl) increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

  - **Non-example**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups at the para position increase the acidity of the carboxyl group and may introduce additional coordination sites (e.g., nitrogen in pyridine). This enhances the ability to coordinate with Fe ions, promoting greater Fe incorporation.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing sulfur-functional groups (e.g., thiol (–SH)) adjacent to an aromatic ring increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf).**

  - **Example supporting this rule**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Sulfur atoms are soft Lewis bases with lone pair electrons that coordinate strongly with Fe ions. When adjacent to an aromatic ring, they enhance Fe binding due to increased electron density and accessibility.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids lacking additional coordinating functional groups or containing electron-donating substituents decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **Octanoic acid**
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Without additional functional groups capable of coordinating with Fe ions, these modifiers interact weakly with Fe. Electron-donating substituents decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, further reducing coordination ability and Fe incorporation.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups (polyols) attached to aliphatic chains decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds or create steric hindrance, reducing their availability to coordinate with Fe ions. This decreases Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with phenolic hydroxyl groups decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Phenolic hydroxyl groups are resonance-stabilized, making them less nucleophilic and less effective at coordinating with Fe ions. Additionally, steric hindrance from the aromatic ring may impede coordination.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Direct attachment leads to resonance delocalization of the nitrogen's lone pair electrons with the carboxyl group, reducing their availability for Fe coordination and resulting in lower Fe incorporation.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking additional electron-donating heteroatoms increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf).**

  - **Example supporting this rule**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid**

  - **Non-example**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Aromatic side chains without additional electron-donating heteroatoms (like nitrogen in indole) can engage in π-Fe interactions, enhancing Fe incorporation. Presence of electron-donating heteroatoms may interfere with coordination.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing perfluorinated alkyl chains decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf).**

  - **Example supporting this rule**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Perfluorinated chains are highly electronegative and withdraw electron density from coordinating groups, decreasing their basicity and ability to bind Fe ions. This results in lower Fe incorporation.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with ether linkages and terminal oxygen or nitrogen atoms increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf).**

  - **Examples supporting this rule**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

  - **Explanation**: Ether oxygen atoms and terminal amino groups can act as additional coordination sites due to their lone pair electrons, enhancing the ability to coordinate with Fe ions and promoting greater Fe incorporation.

**Analysis and Rationale**

In developing these rules, careful consideration was given to the structural features of the modifiers and their corresponding Fe/Hf ratios as observed in the dataset. The rules focus on combinations of functional groups and their positions within the molecular structure, reflecting the underlying physical-chemical properties that influence Fe coordination.

- **Combining Substructures**: The rules illustrate how specific combinations of functional groups, such as amino groups with appropriate chain lengths, sulfur groups adjacent to aromatic rings, and ether linkages with terminal coordinating atoms, affect Fe incorporation.

- **Physical-Chemical Properties**:

  - **Coordination Sites**: Functional groups with lone pair electrons (amino, thiol, ether oxygen) provide coordination sites for Fe ions. The effectiveness of these sites depends on their accessibility and electronic properties.

  - **Electron Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups enhance the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxyl group, while electron-donating groups can reduce it. Resonance effects and inductive effects play significant roles.

  - **Steric Factors**: Steric hindrance from bulky groups or intramolecular interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonding in polyols) can impede coordination with Fe ions.

  - **Chain Length and Flexibility**: The length of aliphatic chains influences the flexibility and distance between coordinating groups, affecting chelation efficiency.

- **Prediction Clarity**: Each rule clearly predicts whether modifiers fitting its description result in high or low Fe/Hf ratios. Non-examples are provided where necessary to highlight exceptions.

- **Coverage and Balance**: The rules cover a broad spectrum of the dataset, balancing general trends with specific structural considerations. This ensures that the rules are both comprehensive and practical for predicting Fe/Hf outcomes.

**Application of Rules**

Researchers can apply these rules to design new modifiers that will achieve desired Fe/Hf ratios:

- **To Increase Fe/Hf (High Fe/Hf)**:

  - **Incorporate Terminal Amino Groups**: Use aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal primary amino groups and appropriate chain lengths (four to eight carbons).

  - **Add Electron-Withdrawing Groups**: Use aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl, pyridyl).

  - **Include Sulfur-Containing Groups**: Introduce thiol groups adjacent to aromatic rings to enhance Fe coordination.

  - **Utilize Ether Linkages**: Incorporate ether linkages with terminal oxygen or nitrogen atoms to provide additional coordination sites.

  - **Select Appropriate Amino Acids**: Choose amino acids with aromatic side chains that lack additional electron-donating heteroatoms (e.g., phenylalanine).

- **To Decrease Fe/Hf (Low Fe/Hf)**:

  - **Avoid Additional Coordinating Groups**: Use simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without extra coordinating functional groups.

  - **Use Electron-Donating Substituents**: Introduce electron-donating groups near the carboxylate to decrease acidity and coordination ability.

  - **Incorporate Polyols**: Utilize modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups to reduce Fe coordination due to steric hindrance and hydrogen bonding.

  - **Attach Nitrogen Heterocycles Directly**: Use modifiers where nitrogen heterocycles are directly attached to the carboxyl group to reduce nitrogen's availability for coordination.

  - **Include Perfluorinated Chains**: Employ perfluorinated alkyl chains to decrease the basicity of coordinating groups.

- **Optimize Catalyst Performance**: By strategically selecting modifiers based on these rules, researchers can control the Fe/Hf ratio, tailoring the catalyst's properties to enhance the yield of the target reaction.

By providing these refined and accurate rules, a clear relationship between molecular structure and Fe/Hf ratio is established. This knowledge facilitates the rational design of molecular modifiers, advancing the goals of optimizing and controlling the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ‐C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------
