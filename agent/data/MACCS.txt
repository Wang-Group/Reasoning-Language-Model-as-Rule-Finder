11 A(-A-A-A) or A-A(-A)-A - atom has at least three single bonds
12 AAAAAA@1 > 2 - atom is in at least two different six-membered rings
13 A($A$A$A) or A$A($A)$A - atom has more than two ring bonds
14 A$A!A$A - atom is at a ring/chain boundary. When a comparison is done with another atom the path passes through the chain bond.
15 Anot%A%Anot%A - atom is at an aromatic/nonaromatic boundary. When a comparison is done with another atom the path passes through the aromatic bond.
16 A!A!A - atom with more than one chain bond
17 A!A$A!A - atom is at a ring/chain boundary. When a comparison is done with another atom the path passes through the ring bond.
18 A%Anot%A%A - atom is at an aromatic/nonaromatic boundary. When a comparison is done with another atom the path passes through the nonaromatic bond.
19 HETEROCYCLE - atom is a heteroatom in a ring.
