Unbranched_alkane groups: [R0;D2][R0;D2][R0;D2][R0;D2] #Only hits alkanes (single-bond chains). Only hits chains of at-least 4 members. All non-(implicit-hydrogen) atoms count as branches (e.g. halide substituted chains count as branched).
Unbranched_chain groups: [R0;D2]~[R0;D2]~[R0;D2]~[R0;D2] #Hits any bond (single, double, triple). Only hits chains of at-least 4 members. All non-(implicit-hydrogen) atoms count as branches (e.g. halide substituted chains count as branched).

Atom_fragment: [!$([#6+0]);!$(C(F)(F)F);!$(c(:[!c]):[!c])!$([#6]=,#[!#6])] #(CLOGP definition) A fragment atom is a not an isolating carbon
Carbon_isolating: [$([#6+0]);!$(C(F)(F)F);!$(c(:[!c]):[!c])!$([#6]=,#[!#6])] #This definition is based on that in CLOGP, so it is a charge-neutral carbon, which is not a CF3 or an aromatic C between two aromati c hetero atoms eg in tetrazole, it is not multiply bonded to a hetero atom.
Rotatable bond: [!$(*#*)&!D1]-!@[!$(*#*)&!D1] # An atom which is not triply bonded and not one-connected i.e.terminal connected by a single non-ring bond to and equivalent atom. Note that logical operators can be applied to bonds ("-&!@"). Here, the overall SMARTS consists of two atoms and one bond. The bond is "site and not ring". *#* any atom triple bonded to any atom. By enclosing this SMARTS in parentheses and preceding with $, this enables us to use $(*#*) to write a recursive SMARTS using that string as an atom primitive. The purpose is to avoid bonds such as c1ccccc1-C#C which wo be considered rotatable without this specification.
Bicyclic: [$([*R2]([*R])([*R])([*R]))].[$([*R2]([*R])([*R])([*R]))] #Bicyclic compounds have 2 bridgehead atoms with 3 arms connecting the bridgehead atoms.

High-precidence "and": [N&X4&+,N&X3&+0] or [NX4+,NX3+0] #High-precidence "and" (&) is the default logical operator. "Or" (,) is higher precidence than & and low-precidence "and" (;) is lower precidence than &.
Any atom w/ at-least 1 H: [*!H0,#1] #In SMILES and SMARTS, Hydrogen is not considered an atom (unless it is specified as an isotope). The hydrogen count is instead consi dered a property of an atom. This SMARTS provides a way to effectively hit Hs themselves.
