exclamation,[!e1],not e1
ampersand,[e1&e2],e1 and e2 (high precedence)
comma,[e1,e2],e1 or e2

[F,Cl,Br,I]: the 1st four halogens

**Recursive SMARTS**
Any SMARTS expression may be used to define an atomic environment by writing a SMARTS starting with the atom of interest in this form:      $(SMARTS)      
*C: atom connected to methyl (or methylene) carbon
*CC: atom connected to ethyl carbon
[$(*C);$(*CC)]: atom in both above environments (matches CCC)
CaaO: C ortho to O
CaaaN: C meta to N
Caa(O)aN: C ortho to O and meta to N (but 2O,3N only)
Ca(aO)aaN: C ortho to O and meta to N (but 2O,5N only)
C[$(aaO);$(aaaN)]: C ortho to O and meta to N (all cases)

**Component-level grouping of SMARTS**
SMARTS,SMILES,Match Behavior
C.C,CCCC,"yes, no component level grouping specified"
(C.C.),CCCC,"yes, both carbons in the query match the same component"
(C).(C),CCCC,"no, the query must match carbons in two different components"
(C).(C),CCCC.CCCC,"yes, the query does match carbons in two different components"
(C).C,CCCC,"yes, both carbons in the query match the same component"
(C).(C).C,CCCC.CCCC,"yes, the first two carbons match different components, the third matches a carbon anywhere"
