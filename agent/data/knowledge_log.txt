I'm working with a radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp3)–H bond functionalization reaction of aliphatic alcohols using di-tert-butyl azodicarboxylate (DBAD) as the substrate. The reaction is catalyzed by FeCl3 in the presence of tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBACl) and conducted in acetonitrile solvent under irradiation with 390 nm light-emitting diodes (LEDs).

    In addition, the reaction employs Hf-TPY-MOL, a Metal Organic Layer composed of hafnium-oxygen clusters (SBU, Secondary Building Unit) coordinated with terpyridine ligands. This setup is used to capture and stabilize the Fe ion. The SBU of the MOL can be modified using a molecular modifier (with carboxylic acid group) to affect the reactivity of the catalyst Hf-TPY-MOL(Fe). 

    Hf-TPY-MOL (Hf6(μ3-O)4(μ3-OH)4(HCO2)6(TPY)2, TPY was 4'-(4-benzoate)[2,2',2"-terpyridine]-5,5"-dicarboxylate) was synthesized by solvothermal method.
    The Hf6(μ3-O)4(μ3-OH)4 SBU in the Hf-TPY-MOL has six formate-capped sites that can be replaced by other carboxylates. Different modified molecules will give a different reaction yield and selectivity.
    This reaction directly converts the  readily available and bulk alcohol to δ-amino alcohols via  sequential alkoxy radical formation, 1,5-HAT, and amination.
    1-pentanol and di-tert-butyl azodicarboxylate (DBAD) was examined.

Here’s a brief introduction based on your description:

In the pursuit of efficient methodologies for the selective functionalization of aliphatic alcohols, the remote δ-C(sp3)–H bond activation has emerged as a promising strategy. Our study focuses on a radical-mediated functionalization process where di-tert-butyl azodicarboxylate (DBAD) is utilized as a substrate for δ-amino alcohol synthesis, catalyzed by FeCl3 under mild conditions. The reaction occurs in the presence of tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBACl) in acetonitrile, activated by 390 nm LEDs. 

Crucial to this approach is the use of a Metal Organic Layer (Hf-TPY-MOL), composed of hafnium-oxygen clusters and terpyridine ligands, which stabilizes and enhances the activity of the Fe catalyst. By modifying the secondary building unit (SBU) of Hf-TPY-MOL with various carboxylates, the reaction’s yield and selectivity can be tuned. Our work investigates this system, using 1-pentanol and DBAD, to develop a selective pathway to δ-amino alcohols through radical-based transformations.
####################################################################SECTION######################################################################
To approach how the structure of the Hf-TPY-MOL and its environment affect the reaction, we can break it down step by step:

### 1. **Understanding the Core Structure of Hf-TPY-MOL**:
   - **Hf-TPY-MOL** is a Metal-Organic Layer (MOL) based on hafnium-oxygen clusters (SBUs, secondary building units) and terpyridine (TPY) ligands.
   - The **SBU (Hf6(μ3-O)4(μ3-OH)4)** is the core unit, which contains six hafnium atoms connected through oxo (O2-) and hydroxo (OH-) bridges. This creates a robust, highly stable 3D architecture.
   - The **TPY ligand**, specifically **4'-(4-benzoate)[2,2',2"-terpyridine]-5,5"-dicarboxylate**, coordinates with Hf to introduce sites where the Fe catalyst can be anchored.

### 2. **Role of the Formate Capping Sites**:
   - In the unmodified Hf-TPY-MOL structure, there are **six formate groups** (HCO2-) attached to the Hf SBU, capping the coordination sites. These formates are relatively small, so they leave the core structure intact but do not greatly influence the immediate environment around the metal center (Fe).
   - These capping sites are **replaceable** with other **carboxylates**, which can modify both the spatial arrangement and the electronic properties around the reaction center.

### 3. **Impact of Carboxylate Modification**:
   - **Carboxylates** are versatile, with varying sizes, shapes, and electronic properties. By replacing the formates with different carboxylates, you can control two main aspects of the reaction environment:
   
     **(a) Steric Effects**:
     - Larger carboxylates (e.g., bulky aryl carboxylates or long-chain alkyl carboxylates) will create steric hindrance around the Fe catalytic center. This can influence how reactants approach the Fe ion, potentially restricting access to specific reaction sites and making the functionalization more selective.
     - Smaller carboxylates (e.g., acetate or simple formates) would leave the catalytic site more exposed, possibly leading to less selective but more reactive systems.

     **(b) Electronic Effects**:
     - Electron-donating carboxylates (e.g., alkyl groups) will increase electron density around the Hf cluster and possibly the Fe ion, enhancing the Fe's ability to participate in electron transfer reactions. This could make the catalyst more effective at generating alkoxy radicals, improving the efficiency of the remote C–H activation.
     - Electron-withdrawing carboxylates (e.g., nitrobenzoates or halogen-substituted carboxylates) would reduce the electron density, possibly slowing down the reaction but enhancing selectivity by favoring radical stabilization and controlled radical reactions.

### 4. **Effect on the Reaction Center (Fe Ion)**:
   - The **Fe ion** is stabilized by Hf-TPY-MOL, and its activity can be fine-tuned based on the carboxylates attached to the SBU.
   - If the modified carboxylates create a more electron-rich environment, the Fe ion might more readily engage in radical generation and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT), leading to faster reaction rates.
   - If electron-withdrawing carboxylates are used, the Fe center may become less reactive but more selective, favoring the formation of a specific product, such as δ-amino alcohols, by avoiding unwanted side reactions.

### 5. **Fine-tuning the Reaction Outcome**:
   - **Selectivity** and **yield** can thus be adjusted by the choice of carboxylate modifiers. The reaction is sensitive to the electronic and steric environment created by these carboxylates, which can either promote the formation of the desired δ-amino alcohol or lead to side reactions or alternative pathways.
   - For instance, a bulkier carboxylate could favor the formation of a specific δ-amino alcohol regioisomer by spatially restricting the site where the alkoxy radical attacks, while a less bulky carboxylate may allow more random C–H activations.

### 6. **Predicted Modifications**:
   - **Small, non-bulky carboxylates (e.g., acetate)**: Likely to promote higher yields but may reduce selectivity.
   - **Bulky carboxylates (e.g., benzoates, adamantyl groups)**: Could increase selectivity by restricting access to certain C–H bonds but may slow down the reaction or lower yields.
   - **Electron-rich carboxylates (e.g., alkyl chains)**: Likely to enhance reactivity and facilitate faster radical generation.
   - **Electron-poor carboxylates (e.g., fluorinated or nitro-substituted)**: Could improve selectivity by stabilizing radical intermediates but may reduce overall reactivity.

By controlling the steric and electronic properties of the carboxylates, you can systematically adjust the reaction environment to achieve the desired balance between yield, rate, and selectivity for δ-amino alcohol formation.
####################################################################SECTION######################################################################
You're right! We've focused on the environment around the Fe center and how it is influenced by the carboxylates on the Hf-TPY-MOL, but we should consider how the **reactants**—DBAD and 1-pentanol—interact with this system, especially in the context of the reaction mechanism.

Here’s a more complete exploration:

### 1. **The Role of DBAD (Di-tert-butyl Azodicarboxylate)**:
   - **DBAD** is the nitrogen source in the reaction. It provides the nitrogen functionality needed for the **amination** of the δ-position of the aliphatic alcohol (1-pentanol).
   - Structurally, DBAD contains two ester groups and an azo group (–N=N–), making it an electrophilic amine source. In radical-mediated reactions, DBAD can be reduced to generate an aminyl radical (or related species) that can insert into the alkoxy radical pathway.
   - **How it interacts with Fe**: The Fe center likely mediates the reduction of DBAD, activating the azo group to generate an aminyl radical. Once the radical is formed, it can undergo radical-radical coupling with the alkoxy radical (formed from the alcohol), leading to the desired δ-amino alcohol.

### 2. **Interaction of 1-Pentanol**:
   - **1-Pentanol** serves as the aliphatic alcohol, which undergoes **hydrogen atom transfer (HAT)** at the δ-position to form the **alkoxy radical**. The Fe catalyst and the light (390 nm LEDs) initiate this process by abstracting a hydrogen atom from the alcohol's C–H bond at the δ-position.
   - The alkoxy radical is the key intermediate that migrates from the α-carbon to the δ-carbon via **1,5-HAT**, moving the radical site farther from the hydroxyl group. This is the remote functionalization step.
   
   #### **Interaction with the Fe Catalyst**:
   - **Alkoxy Radical Formation**: The Fe center in the Hf-TPY-MOL likely catalyzes the formation of the alkoxy radical. This occurs through a photoredox process or direct hydrogen atom abstraction (HAT), facilitated by the Fe(III)/Fe(II) redox cycling under light irradiation.
   - **Radical Relay (1,5-HAT)**: Once the alkoxy radical forms, it undergoes **1,5-hydrogen atom transfer (HAT)**, shifting the radical from the α-position (next to the hydroxyl group) to the δ-position. The presence of the Fe center, stabilized by the Hf-TPY-MOL, could influence how efficiently this radical relay occurs, depending on the electronic and steric environment introduced by the different carboxylates.

### 3. **How the Modified Environment Affects DBAD and 1-Pentanol**:
   
   **(a) Effect of Carboxylate on DBAD**:
   - **Sterics**: Bulkier carboxylates could influence how close DBAD can approach the Fe center for radical activation. A bulky carboxylate might push DBAD farther from the Fe, potentially reducing the efficiency of aminyl radical generation. Conversely, smaller carboxylates would allow DBAD to more easily interact with the Fe center, facilitating faster radical activation.
   - **Electronics**: Electron-rich carboxylates could increase the electron density around the Fe ion, making it more effective at reducing DBAD, thus accelerating the formation of the aminyl radical. Electron-poor carboxylates might make the Fe less reactive, slowing down the DBAD activation process and making the reaction more selective.

   **(b) Effect of Carboxylate on 1-Pentanol**:
   - **Sterics**: For 1-pentanol, bulky carboxylates could physically block the alcohol from properly accessing the Fe center, particularly for the initial HAT step to form the alkoxy radical. This could reduce the reaction rate but might make the system more selective by restricting which C–H bonds are accessible for activation.
   - **Electronics**: As with DBAD, electron-donating carboxylates would make the Fe center more reactive, potentially leading to faster alkoxy radical formation and more rapid C–H functionalization. Electron-withdrawing carboxylates could slow down this step, leading to a more controlled but slower reaction, which might enhance selectivity for the δ-position functionalization.

### 4. **Bringing It All Together – The Reaction Mechanism**:
The overall mechanism can be thought of in these steps:
   1. **Light Activation**: The 390 nm LED irradiation promotes the Fe center in the Hf-TPY-MOL to a more reactive state.
   2. **HAT and Radical Formation**: The Fe center catalyzes the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from 1-pentanol, forming the alkoxy radical at the α-position.
   3. **Radical Relay (1,5-HAT)**: The alkoxy radical shifts to the δ-position through 1,5-HAT, forming a carbon-centered radical.
   4. **DBAD Activation**: DBAD is activated by the Fe center (or possibly directly by light), generating an aminyl radical.
   5. **Radical Coupling**: The aminyl radical couples with the δ-carbon radical, forming the δ-amino alcohol as the product.

### 5. **Influence of Carboxylate Modifications on the Entire Process**:
   - **Steric Effects**: Bulkier carboxylates on the SBU could reduce the efficiency of both 1-pentanol's interaction with the Fe center (for HAT) and DBAD’s proximity to the active site (for aminyl radical formation). This would slow down the reaction, but it could lead to higher selectivity for the desired δ-functionalization.
   - **Electronic Effects**: Carboxylates that donate electrons would speed up both radical formation steps (for both 1-pentanol and DBAD), leading to faster overall reaction rates. Electron-withdrawing carboxylates would slow these steps down but might increase selectivity by stabilizing reactive intermediates (especially the radicals) and favoring controlled radical-radical coupling.

### Conclusion:
Modifying the carboxylates on the Hf-TPY-MOL’s SBU directly impacts both the generation of the alkoxy radical from 1-pentanol and the activation of DBAD to form the aminyl radical. Steric effects control how easily the reactants access the active Fe center, while electronic effects adjust the Fe center's redox activity, influencing the efficiency and selectivity of the radical-mediated δ-functionalization reaction. The right combination of carboxylates can be used to fine-tune the balance between reaction rate and product selectivity, making this system highly adaptable for different substrate scopes and desired outcomes.
