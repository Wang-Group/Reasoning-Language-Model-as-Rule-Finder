    In the pursuit of efficient methodologies for the selective functionalization of aliphatic alcohols, the remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond activation has emerged as a promising strategy. Our study focuses on a radical-mediated functionalization process where di-tert-butyl azodicarboxylate (DBAD) is utilized as a substrate for δ-amino alcohol synthesis, catalyzed by Fe(OTf)₃ under mild conditions. The reaction occurs in the presence of tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBACl) in acetonitrile, activated by 390 nm LEDs.

    Crucial to this approach is the use of a Metal-Organic Layer (Hf-TPY-MOL), composed of hafnium-oxygen clusters and terpyridine ligands, which stabilizes and enhances the activity of the iron catalyst. By modifying the secondary building unit (SBU) of Hf-TPY-MOL with various carboxylates, the reaction’s yield and selectivity can be tuned. Our work investigates this system, using 1-pentanol and DBAD, to develop a selective pathway to δ-amino alcohols through radical-based transformations.

    **Understanding the Core Structure of Hf-TPY-MOL**

    - **Hf-TPY-MOL** is a Metal-Organic Layer (MOL) based on hafnium-oxygen clusters (SBUs, secondary building units) and terpyridine (TPY) ligands.
    - **Hf to Oxygen Bonds:**: Hf-O (μ3-O, μ3-OH): ~2.268 Å (can vary slightly depending on coordination environment)
    - **Size on Hf cluster**
    - Given that the two carboxylates coordinate on opposite sides of the Hf-O cluster, the distance between the two carboxylate carbon atoms is ~8.541 Å
    - **Size of TPY ligand**
    -Considering an axis passing through one carboxylate and the centers of two aromatic rings and the nitrogen atom, the distance from the carboxylate carbon to the nitrogen atom is ~8.660 Å
    - The **SBU (Hf₆(μ₃-O)₄(μ₃-OH)₄)** is the core unit, which contains six hafnium atoms connected through oxo (O²⁻) and hydroxo (OH⁻) bridges. This creates a robust, highly stable 3D architecture.
    - The **TPY ligand**, specifically **4'-(4-benzoate)[2,2';6',2''-terpyridine]-5,5''-dicarboxylate**, has carboxylic groups that coordinate with the Hf-O cluster, and the three nitrogen atoms in the TPY introduce sites where the Fe catalyst can be anchored.
    
    **Existing Knowledge**

    - The reaction takes place in acetonitrile as the solvent.
    - Catalyst: Fe³⁺ loaded on Hf-TPY-MOL acts as a heterogeneous catalyst.
    - The δ-selectivity vanishes if there is no –OH group in the reactant molecule, indicating that the –OH group first changes into an –O· radical, and a six-membered ring transition state occurs during the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process to generate the δ-carbon radical.
    - If there is no TBACl, the reaction yield is zero, indicating the significant impact of chloride ions on the electron transition.
    - **Mechanism**: After the ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) reduces Fe³⁺ to Fe²⁺, a carbon radical is generated. This carbon radical adds to the DBAD to generate a nitrogen radical, which undergoes a single-electron transfer (SET) process (oxidizing Fe²⁺ back to Fe³⁺) to produce the product and complete the catalytic cycle.

    **Understanding Target Value**
    
    The primary goal is to optimize and control the yield of the remote δ-C(sp3)–H bond functionalization reaction. It has been observed that the modifier loading on the catalyst (modifier/SBU), the fraction of Fe to Hf in the catalyst (Fe/Hf), and the total loading of Fe (Fe_loading) significantly impact the yield. It's assumed that modifier/SBU, Fe/Hf, and yield These parameters are influenced by different types of molecular modifiers.
