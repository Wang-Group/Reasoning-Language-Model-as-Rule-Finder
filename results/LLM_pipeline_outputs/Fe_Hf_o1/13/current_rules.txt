**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are linear aliphatic amino acids with a primary amino group (-NH₂) and a single terminal carboxylic acid group (-COOH), with a carbon chain length of five or more carbons, result in high Fe/Hf values.**

  **Combination of Substructures**: Linear aliphatic chain (≥5 carbons) + Terminal primary amine (-NH₂) + Terminal carboxylic acid (-COOH)

  **Explanation**: The sufficient chain length provides flexibility, allowing the amino and carboxyl groups to effectively chelate iron ions. This enhances Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

  **Examples**:
  - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  **Counterexample**:
  - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Low Fe/Hf value due to the presence of a second carboxyl group, which may lead to less effective coordination)

---

- **Rule 2**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups, such as nitro (-NO₂) or halogens, at the para position result in high Fe/Hf values.**

  **Combination of Substructures**: Aromatic ring + Carboxylic acid (-COOH) + Electron-withdrawing group at para position

  **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with iron ions and promote greater Fe incorporation.

  **Examples**:
  - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
  - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

  **Counterexample**:
  - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Low Fe/Hf value due to the electron-donating methyl group reducing coordination efficiency)

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing sulfur-functional groups such as thiol (-SH) or thioether (-S-) alongside a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) result in high Fe/Hf values.**

  **Combination of Substructures**: Sulfur-containing group (thiol or thioether) + Carboxylic acid (-COOH)

  **Explanation**: Sulfur atoms are soft Lewis bases with a strong affinity for iron ions. The combination enhances chelation, increasing Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

  **Examples**:
  - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**
  - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers featuring flexible ether linkages (-O-) with terminal coordinating groups such as amino (-NH₂) or carboxyl (-COOH) result in high Fe/Hf values.**

  **Combination of Substructures**: Ether chains (-O-) + Terminal amino or carboxyl group

  **Explanation**: Ether linkages provide flexibility and additional oxygen atoms that can assist in coordination. Terminal functional groups enhance the ability to chelate iron ions effectively.

  **Examples**:
  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
  - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing multiple coordinating groups, such as amino acids with additional amino or acetamido groups, result in high Fe/Hf values due to enhanced chelation.**

  **Combination of Substructures**: Multiple coordinating groups (e.g., amino (-NH₂), acetamido (-NHCOCH₃)) + Carboxylic acid (-COOH)

  **Explanation**: Multiple coordination sites increase the ligand's binding affinity for iron ions, leading to higher Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

  **Examples**:
  - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
  - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid**
  - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 6**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups such as amino (-NH₂), hydroxyl (-OH), or methoxy (-OCH₃) at the para position result in low Fe/Hf values.**

  **Combination of Substructures**: Aromatic ring + Carboxylic acid (-COOH) + Electron-donating group at para position

  **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing its ability to coordinate with iron ions and resulting in lower Fe incorporation.

  **Examples**:
  - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
  - **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**
  - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) on aliphatic chains or cyclic structures result in low Fe/Hf values.**

  **Combination of Substructures**: Aliphatic chain or ring + Multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) + Carboxylic acid (-COOH)

  **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups may engage in hydrogen bonding or solvation, reducing their availability to coordinate with iron ions and diminishing chelation efficiency.

  **Examples**:
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**
  - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 8**: **Simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional strong coordinating groups result in low Fe/Hf values.**

  **Combination of Substructures**: Aliphatic chain + Single carboxylic acid (-COOH)

  **Explanation**: Lack of multiple or strong coordinating functional groups limits the ligand's ability to effectively chelate iron ions.

  **Example**:
  - **Octanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen atoms, connected via an alkyl chain to a carboxylic acid group, result in high Fe/Hf values.**

  **Combination of Substructures**: Heteroaromatic ring with nitrogen (e.g., pyridine) + Alkyl linker + Carboxylic acid (-COOH)

  **Explanation**: The nitrogen in the heteroaromatic ring serves as an additional coordination site. The alkyl linker reduces steric hindrance, facilitating effective iron chelation.

  **Example**:
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**

  **Counterexample**:
  - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Low Fe/Hf value due to steric hindrance when the carboxyl group is directly attached to the ring)

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups such as formyl (-CHO) adjacent to a carboxylic acid on aromatic rings result in low Fe/Hf values.**

  **Combination of Substructures**: Aromatic ring + Carbonyl group (-C=O) adjacent to carboxylic acid (-COOH)

  **Explanation**: Adjacent electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups reduce electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, diminishing its ability to coordinate with iron ions.

  **Examples**:
  - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with fluorinated aliphatic chains result in low Fe/Hf values due to decreased coordinating ability caused by strong electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms.**

  **Combination of Substructures**: Fluorinated alkyl chain + Carboxylic acid (-COOH)

  **Explanation**: Fluorine's high electronegativity withdraws electron density from coordinating groups, reducing their ability to bind iron ions and leading to lower Fe incorporation.

  **Example**:
  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing ketone groups (-C=O) within aliphatic chains adjacent to carboxylic acid groups result in low Fe/Hf values.**

  **Combination of Substructures**: Aliphatic chain + Internal ketone group (-C=O) + Carboxylic acid (-COOH)

  **Explanation**: Ketone groups can withdraw electron density and may hinder effective coordination with iron ions.

  **Example**:
  - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with bulky aromatic systems or sterically hindered structures result in low Fe/Hf values due to decreased accessibility for coordination.**

  **Combination of Substructures**: Bulky aromatic rings or fused ring systems + Carboxylic acid (-COOH)

  **Explanation**: Steric hindrance from bulky groups can limit the ability of coordinating groups to interact with iron ions effectively.

  **Examples**:
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
  - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing aromatic rings connected through conjugated systems to carboxylic acid groups result in high Fe/Hf values if they also possess additional coordinating atoms like oxygen or nitrogen within the ring system.**

  **Combination of Substructures**: Conjugated aromatic system + Heteroatoms (O, N) in ring + Carboxylic acid (-COOH)

  **Explanation**: Conjugated systems with heteroatoms can delocalize electron density and provide multiple coordination sites, enhancing iron binding.

  **Example**:
  - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with hydroxyl groups (-OH) ortho to carboxylic acid groups on aromatic rings can result in low Fe/Hf values due to intramolecular hydrogen bonding, reducing coordination availability.**

  **Combination of Substructures**: Aromatic ring + Ortho-hydroxyl (-OH) + Carboxylic acid (-COOH)

  **Explanation**: Intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups can decrease the availability of these groups for metal coordination.

  **Example**:
  - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
