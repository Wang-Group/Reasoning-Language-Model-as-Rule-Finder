Rule Generator Message:
Based on the analysis of the provided dataset and considering the underlying physical and chemical properties of the molecular modifiers, here are the generated rules that describe the relationship between the modifiers' structural features and the **Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value**. These rules aim to predict whether a given modifier will result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)** or a **low Fe/Hf value (False)** in the catalyst Hf-TPY-MOL(Fe).

---

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids containing a terminal primary amino group (-NH₂) on medium to long chains (5 to 8 carbons)** lead to a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. The primary amino group acts as a strong coordinating site for Fe ions, and the flexible aliphatic chain facilitates effective chelation.

  _Examples:_
  
  - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with **aromatic carboxylic acids bearing strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, such as **nitro (-NO₂), bromomethyl (-CH₂Br), or thiol (-SH)**, result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  _Examples:_
  
  - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
  - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing **sulfur-functional groups**, specifically **thiols (-SH)** or **thioethers (-S-)**, contribute to a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. Sulfur atoms are soft Lewis bases that coordinate strongly with Fe ions.

  _Examples:_
  
  - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**
  - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with **pyridine rings connected to the carboxyl group directly or via a linker** lead to a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. The nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring can coordinate with Fe ions, and the structure allows for effective interaction.

  _Examples:_
  
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers having **long ether chains ending with amino groups (-NH₂) or carboxyl groups (-COOH)** promote a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. The ether linkages provide flexibility, enabling coordinating groups to interact effectively with Fe ions.

  _Examples:_
  
  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
  - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **short-chain aliphatic dicarboxylic amino acids**, such as **aspartic acid**, result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. The proximity of amino and carboxylate groups facilitates chelation with Fe ions.

  _Example:_
  
  - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid)

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with **long-chain hydroxy acids**, specifically **hydroxyl groups (-OH) at terminal positions on medium-length chains (6 to 7 carbons)**, may contribute to a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. The hydroxyl group can coordinate with Fe ions, aided by chain flexibility.

  _Example:_
  
  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **heterocyclic structures with potential coordinating atoms (e.g., oxygen or nitrogen)** can have a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. These atoms act as coordination sites for Fe ions.

  _Example:_
  
  - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position**, such as **amino (-NH₂), hydroxy (-OH), or methyl (-CH₃)**, lead to a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, reducing its coordination ability with Fe ions.

  _Examples:_
  
  - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
  - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
  - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers rich in **hydroxyl groups (-OH) on aliphatic chains or rings (polyols)** exhibit a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. Extensive hydrogen bonding with solvent molecules can reduce the availability of coordination sites for Fe ions.

  _Examples:_
  
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid)
  - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with **perfluorinated alkyl chains** lead to a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. The strong electronegativity and steric bulk of fluorinated groups hinder coordination with Fe ions.

  _Example:_
  
  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers containing **aldehyde groups (-CHO) attached to the aromatic ring** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. Aldehyde groups may engage in side reactions or form intramolecular interactions, hindering coordination with Fe ions.

  _Examples:_
  
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
  - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups** lead to a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. The lack of donor atoms like nitrogen or sulfur limits coordination with Fe ions.

  _Example:_
  
  - **Octanoic acid**

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with **ketone groups (-C=O) on aliphatic chains** have a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. Ketone groups may not effectively coordinate with Fe ions compared to other donor groups.

  _Example:_
  
  - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aromatic amino acids with bulky or polar side chains**, such as **tryptophan**, contribute to a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. Steric hindrance and potential intramolecular interactions reduce the effectiveness of Fe coordination.

  _Example:_
  
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan)

**End of Rules**

These rules are formulated to directly combine multiple sub-structures and functional groups within the modifiers, considering their physical and chemical properties such as coordination ability, electron-donating or withdrawing effects, and molecular flexibility. Each rule aims to predict the **Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value** based on the presence of specific functional groups or structural features in the modifiers.

By prioritizing rules that cover a broader range of the dataset and maintaining a balance between simplicity and complexity, these rules provide a comprehensive understanding of how different modifiers influence the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst. Modifiers that facilitate effective coordination with Fe ions, such as those containing primary amino groups, sulfur atoms, or pyridine rings, tend to result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. In contrast, modifiers lacking such coordinating groups or containing functional groups that hinder coordination lead to a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

The property insight is acceptable, but the rule would benefit from additional data points to strengthen its applicability and balance.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 indicates that modifiers with long aliphatic chains bearing a terminal hydroxy group tend to have a high Fe/Hf value. The rule is clear, and the property insight is reasonable, noting that the hydroxyl group can coordinate with Fe ions and chain flexibility aids complex formation. However, coverage is limited to one data point—**7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**. Additional supporting data would enhance the rule's validity.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 states that modifiers containing heterocyclic structures with coordinating atoms can result in a high Fe/Hf value. The rule is clear, and the property insight is sound, highlighting additional coordination sites within heterocycles. Coverage is minimal, with only one data point—**1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**. The rule would benefit from more examples to improve coverage and balance.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 indicates that aromatic amino acids with bulky or polar side chains, like tryptophan, exhibit a low Fe/Hf value. While the rule is clear and the property insight is acceptable, it overlaps with Rule 6, which already addresses amino acids with bulky side chains leading to low Fe/Hf values.

These rules are designed to predict whether the **Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value** will be **True** (high) or **False** (low) based on the structural features of the molecular modifiers. Each rule combines multiple functional groups and sub-structures to provide insights into how specific combinations influence the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst **Hf-TPY-MOL(Fe)**.

- Modifiers resulting in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)** typically contain functional groups that are strong Lewis bases or have atoms capable of coordinating with Fe ions, such as terminal amino groups, sulfur-containing groups, pyridine rings, flexible ether chains with coordinating termini, or terminal hydroxy groups on medium-length aliphatic chains.

These rules illustrate how specific combinations of functional groups and structural features in molecular modifiers influence the **Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value** in the catalyst **Hf-TPY-MOL(Fe)**. The underlying physicochemical properties affecting these outcomes include:

- **Coordination Sites**: Functional groups like **amino (-NH₂)**, **thiol (-SH)**, and **pyridine nitrogen** provide lone pairs that can coordinate with Fe ions, increasing the Fe/Hf ratio.

- **Electron-Withdrawing Groups**: Substituents like **nitro (-NO₂)** and **halomethyl (-CH₂Br)** enhance the acidity of the carboxyl group, promoting stronger Fe ion coordination.

- **Steric Factors**: Bulky groups or extensive fluorination can hinder effective coordination due to increased steric hindrance.

- **Electron-Donating Groups**: Groups like **hydroxy (-OH)**, **amino (-NH₂)**, and **methyl (-CH₃)** decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing coordination efficiency with Fe ions.

- **Flexibility**: Ether linkages and medium-length chains allow for better spatial arrangement of coordinating groups, facilitating Fe ion binding.

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a new molecular modifier is likely to result in a **high** or **low Fe/Hf value** based on its structural features. This aids in the rational design and selection of modifiers to optimize the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal primary amino group (-NH₂) on medium-length chains (5 to 8 carbons)** result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. The terminal amino group provides a strong coordination site for Fe ions, enhancing metal binding efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: The presence of the terminal amino group increases the ligand's ability to coordinate with Fe ions due to the lone pair on the nitrogen atom. The chain length allows for optimal spacing, minimizing steric hindrance.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers containing sulfur functional groups**, such as **thiols (-SH)** or **thioethers (-S-)**, contribute to a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. Sulfur atoms have lone pairs that can form strong coordinate bonds with Fe ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Sulfur is a soft Lewis base and has a high affinity for Fe ions, which enhances coordination and increases the Fe/Hf ratio.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, such as **nitro (-NO₂)**, **halogens (e.g., -Br, -Cl)**, or **sulfanyl (-SH)**, generally lead to a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

  - **Counter-examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (electron-donating methyl group)
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (electron-donating amino group)

  - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups stabilize the negative charge on the carboxylate ion after deprotonation, making it a better ligand for Fe ion coordination.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing aromatic nitrogen heterocycles**, such as **pyridine rings** attached to a carboxylic acid, result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. The nitrogen atom in the ring provides an additional coordination site for Fe ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**

  - **Counter-example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid) – the carboxyl group position relative to the nitrogen affects coordination efficiency.

  - **Rationale**: The pyridine nitrogen can coordinate with Fe ions, and its position relative to the carboxyl group influences the overall coordination geometry.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with flexible ether linkages terminating with coordinating groups**, such as **amino (-NH₂)** or **carboxyl (-COOH)** groups, lead to a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**. The flexible chains allow effective interaction of the terminal groups with Fe ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Ether linkages increase molecular flexibility, enabling coordinating groups to adjust their positions for optimal Fe ion binding.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Amino acids with side chains capable of additional coordination with Fe ions**, such as **carboxylate groups** or **aromatic rings**, result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine)
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (lysine derivative)

  - **Counter-example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid) – longer side chain may introduce steric hindrance.

  - **Rationale**: Side chains with additional coordinating atoms enhance Fe ion binding, but excessive chain length or bulk can hinder coordination due to steric effects.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position**, such as **amino (-NH₂)**, **hydroxy (-OH)**, or **methyl (-CH₃)**, result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups destabilize the carboxylate ion, making it a poorer ligand for Fe ion coordination.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) on aliphatic chains (polyols)** lead to a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. Extensive hydrogen bonding with the solvent reduces the availability of coordination sites for Fe ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility in the solvent and can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds, reducing effective coordination with Fe ions.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with bulky aromatic side chains that may cause steric hindrance**, such as **indole rings**, exhibit a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan)

  - **Rationale**: Bulky groups can prevent the coordinating groups from approaching Fe ions closely, hindering effective binding.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (-CHO) or ketone (-C=O) groups in addition to carboxyl groups** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. These carbonyl groups may not effectively coordinate with Fe ions and can participate in side reactions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Aldehyde and ketone groups are less likely to coordinate with Fe ions compared to other donor groups and may react with other components, reducing Fe coordination.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with highly fluorinated alkyl chains or fluorinated acyl groups** lead to a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**. Fluorination increases steric bulk and electron-withdrawing effects, which can hinder coordination with Fe ions.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Highly electronegative fluorine atoms create a strong electron-withdrawing environment, destabilizing potential coordination sites and increasing steric hindrance.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

  - **Example**:
    - **Octanoic acid**

  - **Rationale**: Lack of additional donor atoms limits the ligand's ability to coordinate with Fe ions effectively.

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules are designed to predict whether a molecular modifier will result in a **high** or **low Fe/Hf value** based on its structural features and functional groups. The underlying physicochemical principles considered include:

- **Coordination Chemistry**: Functional groups like **amino (-NH₂)**, **thiol (-SH)**, and **pyridine nitrogen** offer lone pairs that can coordinate with Fe ions, enhancing the Fe/Hf ratio.

- **Electronic Effects**: **Electron-withdrawing groups** increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, promoting better coordination with Fe ions. Conversely, **electron-donating groups** decrease acidity and coordination ability.

- **Steric Factors**: Bulky side chains or excessive chain length can hinder coordination due to steric hindrance, reducing Fe ion binding efficiency.

- **Molecular Flexibility**: Flexible linkages like ethers allow coordinating groups to adjust their positions for optimal interaction with Fe ions.

- **Hydrogen Bonding**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can lead to extensive hydrogen bonding with the solvent, reducing the availability of coordinating sites.

By applying these rules, researchers can predict the impact of different molecular modifiers on the Fe/Hf ratio in the **Hf-TPY-MOL(Fe)** catalyst and select modifiers that optimize the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

Thus, Rule 1 scores highly on all criteria.

- **Comment 2**:

  *Rule 2* states that **modifiers containing thiol (-SH) groups** lead to a **high Fe/Hf value**. The rule is clear, with solid property insight explaining sulfur's ability to coordinate with Fe ions. Complexity is moderate, focusing on a single functional group without combining additional sub-structures. Coverage meets the minimum criterion, with two data points—**3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** and **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**—both exhibiting high Fe/Hf values. While the rule is well-founded, additional supporting examples would strengthen coverage.

- **Comment 3**:

  *Rule 3* is clear, indicating that **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, such as **nitro (-NO₂)** or **halogens**, result in a **high Fe/Hf value**. The property insight is sound, explaining how electron-withdrawing groups enhance carboxylate coordination with Fe ions. Complexity is addressed by combining aromatic systems with specific substituents. Coverage is strong, supported by **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**, both showing high Fe/Hf values. Rule 3 meets all the criteria effectively.

- **Comment 4**:

  *Rule 4* specifies that **modifiers containing pyridine rings adjacent to carboxyl groups**, especially when the nitrogen atom is positioned to coordinate, lead to a **high Fe/Hf value**. Clarity is acceptable but requires careful attention to the positioning of the nitrogen atom. The property insight is good, highlighting the role of pyridine nitrogen in coordination. Complexity is present, considering ring structure and functional group orientation. Coverage includes **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** and **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** (high Fe/Hf), with a counter-example **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (low Fe/Hf), supporting the rule's validity.

- **Comment 5**:

  *Rule 5* indicates that **amino acids with side chains capable of additional coordination**, such as side-chain amino or carboxyl groups, contribute to a **high Fe/Hf value**. The rule is clear, and the property insight explains how additional coordinating groups enhance Fe ion binding, while potential steric hindrance is also considered. Complexity is satisfactory, combining amino acid structures with side-chain functionality.

  *Rule 10* points out that **modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains or fluorinated acyl groups** result in a **low Fe/Hf value**. While the rule is clear and the property insight reasonable, discussing electron-withdrawing effects and steric hindrance of fluorine atoms, coverage is lacking. Only one data point—**2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**—supports the rule. More examples are necessary to meet the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 11**:

  *Rule 11* states that **simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups** lead to a **low Fe/Hf value**. The rule is clear, and the property insight logically addresses the insufficiency of coordination without extra donor atoms. Complexity is minimal but appropriate for this rule. However, coverage is limited to a single example—**octanoic acid**—which does not satisfy the requirement of at least two supporting data points.

**Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal primary amino group (-NH₂) located at least five carbons away from the carboxyl group** result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: The long carbon chain provides flexibility, allowing the terminal amino group to effectively coordinate with Fe ions. The distance reduces steric hindrance, enhancing Fe binding to the catalyst.

---

**Rule 2**: **Modifiers containing thiol (-SH) groups**, whether **aliphatic** or **aromatic**, lead to a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

  - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, promoting deprotonation and enhancing coordination with Hf and Fe ions. They stabilize the coordination environment, improving Fe binding.

---

**Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles, specifically pyridine rings, where the nitrogen atom is positioned to coordinate**, lead to a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

**Rule 5**: **Modifiers with flexible ether linkages terminating with coordinating groups**, such as **carboxyl (-COOH)** or **amino (-NH₂)** groups, result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
  - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Ether linkages provide molecular flexibility, allowing terminal coordinating groups to adjust their positions for optimal interaction with Fe ions, enhancing binding efficiency.

---

**Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains capable of effective coordination**, such as **shorter side-chain carboxyl groups**, increase the **Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Example (High Fe/Hf)**:
  - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid)

- **Counter-example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid)

- **Rationale**: Shorter side chains position coordinating groups favorably for Fe binding. Longer chains may introduce steric hindrance or reduce coordination efficiency.

---

**Rule 7**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) on aliphatic chains (polyols)** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Example**:
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid)

- **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups engage in hydrogen bonding with solvents or internally, reducing the availability of coordination sites for Fe ions.

---

**Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position**, such as **amino (-NH₂)** or **hydroxy (-OH)** groups, lead to a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
  - **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**
  - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing deprotonation and coordination with Hf and Fe ions, leading to lower Fe binding.

---

**Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (-CHO) groups directly attached to the aromatic ring** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
  - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Aldehyde groups may interfere with coordination due to their reactivity or steric hindrance, decreasing Fe binding efficiency.

---

**Rule 10**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Example**:
  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Fluorine's high electronegativity withdraws electron density, destabilizing potential coordination sites and hindering Fe ion binding.

---

**Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups** lead to a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Example**:
  - **Octanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: The absence of additional donor groups limits the molecule's ability to coordinate with Fe ions effectively, resulting in lower Fe incorporation.

---

**Rule 12**: **Modifiers with bulky or sterically hindered side chains reduce Fe/Hf value (False)**, especially when coordinating groups are inaccessible.

- **Example**:
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan)

- **Rationale**: Bulky side chains hinder the approach and binding of functional groups to Fe ions, decreasing coordination efficiency.

These rules are designed to predict whether a molecular modifier will result in a **high** or **low Fe/Hf value** based on its structural features and the physicochemical properties of its functional groups. The considerations include:

1. **Coordination Chemistry**: Groups like **amino (-NH₂)**, **thiol (-SH)**, and **pyridine nitrogen** offer lone pairs for coordination with Fe ions.

2. **Electronic Effects**: **Electron-withdrawing groups** increase carboxyl acidity and coordination ability; **electron-donating groups** have the opposite effect.

3. **Steric Factors**: Bulkiness can hinder effective coordination; optimal chain length and flexibility enhance binding.

4. **Molecular Flexibility**: Flexible structures with coordinating termini adjust to optimize Fe ion interaction.

5. **Hydrogen Bonding and Solvation**: Excessive hydroxyl groups promote hydrogen bonding, reducing coordination sites for Fe ions.

By applying these rules, researchers can predict the impact of different molecular modifiers on the **Fe/Hf ratio** in the **Hf-TPY-MOL(Fe)** catalyst, facilitating the design of modifiers that optimize the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

- **Counter-example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid)

- **Rationale**: The nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring can coordinate with Fe ions. Optimal positioning and flexibility enhance this interaction. In nicotinic acid, the nitrogen's position relative to the carboxyl group may hinder effective coordination.

---

**Rule 5**: **Modifiers with flexible ether linkages terminating with coordinating groups**, such as **amino (-NH₂)** or **carboxyl (-COOH)** groups, result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
  - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Ether linkages provide molecular flexibility, allowing terminal coordinating groups to adjust their orientation for optimal interaction with Fe ions. This flexibility enhances Fe binding to the catalyst.

---

**Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups** lead to a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Example**:
  - **Octanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: The lack of functional groups offering lone pairs for coordination limits the modifier's ability to bind Fe ions effectively. The carboxyl group alone may not provide sufficient coordination.

---

**Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position**, such as **hydroxy (-OH)** or **amino (-NH₂)** groups, result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Examples**:

  - **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**
  - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, making deprotonation less favorable. This reduces the ability of the carboxyl group to coordinate with Fe ions, resulting in lower Fe incorporation.

---

**Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxyl groups close to the main chain** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid)
  - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid)

- **Rationale**: The proximity of multiple carboxyl groups can lead to intramolecular interactions that interfere with effective coordination to Fe ions. Short side chains with adjacent carboxyl groups may reduce Fe binding.

---

**Rule 9**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups within an aliphatic chain (polyols)** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Rationale**: Aldehyde or keto groups near the carboxyl group can alter electron distribution and steric environment, potentially interfering with coordination to Fe ions.

---

**Rule 12**: **Modifiers with bulky aromatic side chains near the coordinating groups** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Example**:
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan)

- **Rationale**: Bulky side chains may sterically hinder the approach of Fe ions to coordinating sites on the modifier, reducing effective coordination and Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

**Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are long-chain hydroxyalkanoic acids with the hydroxyl group positioned several carbons away from the carboxyl group** can result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Example**:
  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: The hydroxyl group positioned away from the carboxyl group can act as an additional coordination site without causing significant steric hindrance. This promotes effective binding of Fe ions.

---

**Rule 14**: **Modifiers with methoxy (-OCH₃) groups attached to aromatic rings and additional coordinating features** result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Example**:
  - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Methoxy groups can influence the electronic properties of the aromatic ring, potentially enhancing coordination interactions when other coordinating groups are present. They may also affect the solubility and overall binding environment.

---

**Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are conjugated aromatic compounds with accessible coordination sites**, such as those containing **diketone** or **dioxo** groups, lead to a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Example**:
  - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

The rationale appropriately links decreased acidity from electron-donating groups to reduced Fe coordination, providing solid property insight.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 addresses modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxyl groups directly attached to the main chain, leading to low Fe/Hf values. However, the rule relies heavily on a single example (**(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid**), limiting its coverage. Expanding the rule with more supporting data would enhance its validity.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 highlights that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups within an aliphatic chain (polyols) result in low Fe/Hf values due to extensive hydrogen bonding. While the rationale is sound, the rule is supported by a single data point (**gluconic acid**), suggesting limited coverage. Additional examples would strengthen the rule’s applicability.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 states that modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains lead to low Fe/Hf values. The rationale explains the electron-withdrawing effects of fluorine atoms decreasing electron density for Fe coordination. However, the rule is based on a single example, indicating a need for more data to confirm its generality.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 indicates that modifiers containing aldehyde or keto groups adjacent to the carboxyl group result in low Fe/Hf values. The examples align with the dataset, and the rationale provides a reasonable explanation for altered electron distribution hindering Fe binding. Yet, the rule’s coverage is limited, and incorporating more data points would be beneficial.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 focuses on modifiers with bulky heteroaromatic side chains near coordinating groups leading to low Fe/Hf values due to steric hindrance. The comparison between tryptophan (low Fe/Hf) and phenylalanine (high Fe/Hf) illustrates the impact of bulkiness on Fe accessibility, offering valuable property insight. The rule effectively considers steric factors, though additional examples would enhance its robustness.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 suggests that long-chain hydroxyalkanoic acids with hydroxyl groups positioned several carbons away from the carboxyl group can lead to high Fe/Hf values. While the rationale is plausible, the rule is supported by a single example (**7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**), limiting its coverage. More data points are needed to validate this rule fully.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 involves modifiers with methoxy groups attached to aromatic rings and additional coordinating features resulting in high Fe/Hf values. The rule introduces complexity by combining electronic modulation with coordinating groups. However, the coverage is minimal with only one supporting example, suggesting a need for further data to substantiate the rule.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 states that conjugated aromatic compounds with accessible coordination sites, such as those containing diketone or dioxo groups, lead to high Fe/Hf values. The rationale is chemically sound, emphasizing electron delocalization in stabilizing Fe binding. Yet, the rule's coverage is limited to one data point, indicating the necessity for additional examples to confirm its applicability.

**Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains capable of coordinating with Fe ions** result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**, provided the side chain is not excessively bulky.

- **Example (High Fe/Hf)**:
  - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(phenylalanine)*

- **Counter-example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(tryptophan)*

- **Rationale**: Side chains with moderate size can coordinate with Fe ions, whereas bulky side chains may cause steric hindrance, reducing accessibility of coordinating sites.

---

**Rule 7**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups adjacent to the carboxyl group (polyols)** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Example**:
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(gluconic acid)*

  - **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing its ability to deprotonate and coordinate effectively with Fe ions.

---

**Rule 9**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains or strong electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Example**:
  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Strong electron-withdrawing effects of fluorine atoms decrease electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening Fe coordination.

---

**Rule 10**: **Simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups** lead to a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Example**:
  - **Octanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Lack of additional coordinating functional groups limits Fe binding to only the carboxyl group, which may not suffice for strong coordination.

These rules are developed based on the structural features of the molecular modifiers and their observed impact on the **Fe/Hf ratio** in the catalyst. Key considerations include:

1. **Coordination Sites**: Functional groups such as **thiol (-SH)**, **amino (-NH₂)**, **pyridine nitrogen**, and **flexible ether linkages** provide lone pairs for Fe coordination.

2. **Electronic Effects**:
   - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups**: Increase carboxyl acidity, enhancing Fe coordination (**Rule 2**).
   - **Electron-Donating Groups**: Decrease carboxyl acidity, reducing Fe coordination (**Rule 8**).

3. **Steric Factors**:
   - **Optimal Chain Length**: Longer chains position coordinating groups favorably (**Rules 4, 6**).
   - **Bulky Groups**: Can hinder Fe access to coordinating sites (**Rule 6**).

4. **Molecular Flexibility**:
   - **Ether Linkages**: Provide flexibility for optimal Fe-binding orientations (**Rule 5**).

5. **Hydrogen Bonding**:
   - **Polyols**: Excessive hydroxyl groups engage in hydrogen bonding, limiting Fe coordination (**Rule 7**).

6. **Electron Density**:
   - **Perfluorinated Chains**: Decrease electron density, weakening Fe coordination (**Rule 9**).

By applying these rules, it is possible to predict whether a given molecular modifier will result in a **high** or **low Fe/Hf value** based on its structural characteristics. This understanding aids in the rational design of modifiers to optimize catalyst performance for the target radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
  - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

- **Counter-examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid**

---

**Rule 8**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position**, such as **amino (-NH₂)** or **hydroxy (-OH)** groups, lead to a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
  - **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**
  - **4-hydroxybenzoylaminoacetic acid**

- **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups increase the electron density on the aromatic ring and decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, resulting in weaker deprotonation and less effective coordination with Fe ions.

---

**Rule 9**: **Simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Example**:
  - **Octanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Without additional coordinating functional groups, these modifiers rely solely on the carboxyl group for Fe coordination, which may not provide sufficient interaction to enhance Fe incorporation significantly.

---

**Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing strong electron-withdrawing groups that excessively decrease electron density on coordinating atoms**, such as **perfluorinated alkyl chains**, result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Example**:
  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

---

**Rule 11**: **Modifiers with bulky side chains or sterically hindered coordinating groups** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(tryptophan)*
  - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(glutamic acid)*

- **Rationale**: Bulky side chains can create steric hindrance around coordinating sites, impeding the approach and binding of Fe ions, thus reducing Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

**Rule 12**: **Modifiers with carbonyl groups conjugated to the carboxyl group without additional coordinating groups** lead to a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
  - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
  - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

- **Rationale**: Conjugated carbonyl groups can delocalize electron density and may not effectively coordinate with Fe ions. Without additional functional groups to facilitate coordination, Fe incorporation is reduced.

   - **Polyhydroxy Carboxylic Acids**: Form extensive hydrogen bonds, limiting available coordination sites (**Rule 7**).
   - **Sterically Hindered Groups**: Reduce effective coordination due to spatial constraints (**Rules 11, 12**).

6. **Conjugation and Delocalization**:
   - **Conjugated Carbonyl Groups**: May delocalize electron density away from coordinating atoms, weakening interaction with Fe ions (**Rule 12**).

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a given molecular modifier will result in a **high** or **low Fe/Hf value** based on its structural characteristics. This predictive capability is valuable for designing modifiers that optimize catalyst performance in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

   - **Multiple Coordination Sites**: Modifiers with flexible linkages or sufficient chain length allow multiple coordinating groups to interact with Fe ions simultaneously (**Rules 3, 6**).

2. **Electronic Effects**:
   - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups**: Increase carboxylate acidity, enhancing coordination with Fe ions (**Rule 5**).
   - **Electron-Donating Groups**: Decrease carboxylate acidity, weakening coordination with Fe ions (**Rule 8**).
   - **Excessive Electron Withdrawal**: Perfluorinated chains can reduce electron density too much, impairing coordination (**Rule 10**).

3. **Steric Factors**:
   - **Steric Hindrance**: Bulky substituents near coordinating sites hinder Fe access, reducing incorporation (**Rules 9, 15**).
   - **Optimal Chain Length**: Adequate separation between coordinating groups prevents steric clashes (**Rule 3**).

4. **Molecular Flexibility**:

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: **Rule 1** is clear and unambiguous, stating that modifiers containing thiol (-SH) groups result in a high Fe/Hf value. The property insight is solid, as thiol groups are known to coordinate strongly with Fe ions. The rule is supported by two data points (entries 10 and 17), which is sufficient for coverage but limited. The rule is based on a single functional group, which limits its complexity and broader applicability.

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 2** provides clear guidance that modifiers with an aromatic nitrogen heterocycle, like a non-hindered pyridine ring, result in a high Fe/Hf value. The property insight is strong, considering both the nitrogen's coordinating ability and steric factors. It successfully balances complexity by including both functional group presence and steric considerations. The rule is well-supported by multiple data points (entries 12, 21, and 24), enhancing its coverage.

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 3** is clear and specifies that aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal primary amino group separated by at least four carbons from the carboxyl group lead to a high Fe/Hf value. The property insight is good, explaining that sufficient chain length allows for effective coordination without steric hindrance. It combines considerations of functional groups and chain length, adding complexity. The rule is supported by at least three data points (entries 3, 31, and 34), ensuring adequate coverage.

- **Comment 4**: **Rule 4** states that amino acids with side chains containing aromatic rings without bulky substituents result in a high Fe/Hf value. While the rule attempts to cover combinations of structural features, the clarity is somewhat reduced due to the subjective term "bulky substituents." The property insight is acceptable, linking aromatic side chains to enhanced Fe coordination. However, the rule is supported by limited data (entries 13 and 15), with the counter-example (entry 15) actually contradicting the rule, as tryptophan is considered bulky but results in a low Fe/Hf value.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** is clear and well-defined, focusing on aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position leading to a high Fe/Hf value. The property insight is strong, explaining how electron-withdrawing groups enhance acidity and coordination ability. The rule effectively balances complexity and coverage, with multiple supporting data points (entries 1, 4, 20, and 22), including both positive examples and counter-examples.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** is somewhat complex, involving modifiers with flexible ether linkages and terminal coordinating groups. The clarity is moderate due to the complexity of the structural description. The property insight is good, highlighting how molecular flexibility facilitates effective Fe coordination. The rule has sufficient coverage with two supporting data points (entries 11 and 32) but could benefit from additional examples to strengthen its applicability.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** indicates that modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group result in a low Fe/Hf value. The clarity is acceptable, and the property insight identifies hydrogen bonding as a factor reducing coordination sites. However, the rule has limited coverage, supported by only one data point (entry 9), which weakens its overall impact and reliability.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** is clear, stating that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position result in a low Fe/Hf value. The property insight is solid, explaining how electron-donating groups decrease acidity and coordination ability. The rule has good coverage, supported by multiple data points (entries 4, 7, 26, and 30), enhancing its validity.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** addresses modifiers with bulky or sterically hindered coordinating groups resulting in a low Fe/Hf value. While the property insight is logical, the clarity is moderate due to the subjective nature of "bulky" and "sterically hindered." The rule is backed by data (entries 0 and 15), but the examples include inconsistencies—for instance, entry 0 contradicts Rule 14 by being listed as False here but True in Rule 14.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** is clear and specific, focusing on modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains resulting in a low Fe/Hf value. The property insight is valid, noting that excessive electron withdrawal impedes coordination. However, the rule's coverage is limited to a single data point (entry 14), reducing its general applicability.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** states that simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups result in a low Fe/Hf value. The rule is clear with acceptable property insight but is supported by only one data point (entry 5), limiting its coverage and impact.

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** suggests that modifiers with conjugated carbonyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group and no additional coordinating groups result in a low Fe/Hf value. The clarity is moderate, but the property insight is acceptable. The rule has coverage with two supporting data points (entries 18 and 19), which strengthens its reliability.

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13** is clear, indicating that α-keto acids without additional coordinating groups result in a low Fe/Hf value. The property insight is good, but the rule's coverage is limited to a single data point (entry 8), reducing its overall robustness.

- **Comment 14**: **Rule 14** is problematic. It states that di-carboxylic acids without additional strong coordinating groups result in a low Fe/Hf value. However, this is contradicted by the data, as (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (entry 2) has a high Fe/Hf value (True) in the dataset. This inconsistency undermines the rule's validity and clarity.

- **Comment 15**: **Rule 15** suggests that modifiers with bulky substituents near coordinating functional groups result in a low Fe/Hf value. This rule lacks clarity due to subjective terms and is contradicted by the data; the examples provided (entries 23 and 33) actually have high Fe/Hf values (True). This inconsistency indicates that the rule is incorrect and needs to be re-evaluated or discarded.

**Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing a primary amino group (-NH₂) connected by a flexible aliphatic chain of at least three carbons to the carboxyl group** result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: The primary amino group acts as a strong coordinating site for Fe ions. The flexible carbon chain allows both the amino and carboxyl groups to simultaneously coordinate with the Fe ion, forming stable chelate complexes that enhance Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

**Rule 2**: **Modifiers containing thiol (-SH) groups** result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Thiol groups are excellent ligands for Fe ions due to the high nucleophilicity of sulfur. The strong affinity between the thiol sulfur and Fe enhances coordination, leading to increased Fe incorporation into the catalyst structure.

---

**Rule 3**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, such as **nitro (-NO₂)** or **halomethyl (-CH₂Hal)** groups, result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
  - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

- **Counter-examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
  - **4-aminobenzoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group by stabilizing the negative charge upon deprotonation. This enhances the ability of the carboxylate anion to coordinate effectively with Fe ions, promoting higher Fe incorporation.

---

**Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing a pyridine ring within the aromatic system**, especially when the nitrogen atom is not sterically hindered, result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**

- **Counter-example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**

- **Rationale**: The nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring can coordinate with Fe ions, enhancing Fe incorporation. Optimal positioning of the nitrogen and minimal steric hindrance allow for effective Fe coordination.

---

**Rule 5**: **Modifiers with flexible ether linkages and terminal coordinating groups**, such as **amino (-NH₂)** or **carboxyl (-COOH)** groups, result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
  - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Ether linkages provide molecular flexibility, enabling the terminal coordinating groups to adopt favorable conformations for Fe ion coordination. This flexibility enhances the likelihood of forming stable complexes with Fe, increasing Fe incorporation.

---

**Rule 6**: **Amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking bulky substituents** result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Example**:
  - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(Phenylalanine)*

- **Counter-example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(Tryptophan)*

- **Rationale**: Aromatic side chains can interact with Fe ions through π-electron interactions or direct coordination, enhancing Fe incorporation. Bulky substituents, however, can cause steric hindrance, reducing coordination efficiency.

---

**Rule 7**: **Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl (-OH) groups near the carboxyl group (polyhydroxy carboxylic acids)** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Example**:
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(Gluconic acid)*

- **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can form extensive hydrogen bonding networks, both intra- and intermolecularly. This reduces the availability of lone pairs for coordination with Fe ions, leading to decreased Fe incorporation.

---

**Rule 8**: **Simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Example**:
  - **Octanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Without additional functional groups capable of coordinating with Fe ions, these modifiers rely solely on the carboxyl group for interaction. This single coordination site is often insufficient for significant Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

**Rule 9**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position**, such as **amino (-NH₂)** or **hydroxy (-OH)** groups, result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
  - **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups increase electron density on the aromatic ring, decreasing the acidity of the carboxyl group. This makes the carboxylate less effective at coordinating with Fe ions, resulting in lower Fe incorporation.

---

**Rule 10**: **Modifiers with bulky or sterically hindered groups near coordinating sites** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(Tryptophan)*
  - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Bulky groups near the coordinating functional groups create steric hindrance, impeding the approach and binding of Fe ions. This reduces coordination efficiency and Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

**Rule 11**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains attached to the carboxyl group** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Example**:
  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Perfluorinated groups are highly electron-withdrawing, which can excessively reduce electron density on the carboxylate oxygen. This weakens its ability to coordinate with Fe ions, leading to lower Fe incorporation.

---

**Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing conjugated carbonyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group without additional strong coordinating groups** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
  - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Conjugation with additional carbonyl groups can delocalize electron density away from the carboxylate oxygen. This reduces the effectiveness of the carboxylate in coordinating with Fe ions, decreasing Fe incorporation.

---

**Rule 13**: **Modifiers with unique chelating structures, such as fused aromatic systems containing carbonyl groups**, can result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Example**:
  - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

- **Rationale**: Fused aromatic systems with carbonyl groups may offer multiple coordination sites and forms of chelation. Such structures can interact more effectively with Fe ions, enhancing Fe incorporation despite lacking conventional coordinating groups.

3. **Steric Factors**:
   - **Steric Hindrance**: Bulky substituents near coordinating sites hinder Fe access, reducing incorporation (**Rule 10**).
   - **Optimal Chain Length**: Adequate separation between coordinating groups prevents steric clashes and allows effective chelation (**Rule 1**).

4. **Molecular Flexibility**:
   - **Flexible Linkers**: Ether linkages enable coordinating groups to adopt favorable conformations for Fe binding (**Rule 5**).

5. **Hydrogen Bonding and Delocalization**:
   - **Polyhydroxy Compounds**: Extensive hydrogen bonding can limit available coordination sites (**Rule 7**).
   - **Conjugated Carbonyl Groups**: Delocalization of electron density can weaken Fe coordination (**Rule 12**).

6. **Unique Structural Features**:
   - **Chelating Structures**: Fused aromatic systems with carbonyl groups can provide effective Fe coordination through chelation (**Rule 13**).

By applying these rules, researchers can predict the Fe/Hf value outcome for modifiers based on their molecular structure. This aids in the rational design and selection of molecular modifiers to optimize catalyst performance in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

**Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing a primary amino group (-NH₂) connected by an aliphatic chain of at least three carbons to the carboxyl group** result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
  - **4-aminobutanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: The primary amino group provides a strong coordination site for Fe ions. The flexible aliphatic chain allows the amino and carboxyl groups to act as bidentate ligands, forming stable chelate complexes with Fe. This enhances the incorporation of Fe into the catalyst.

---

**Rule 2**: **Modifiers containing thiol (-SH) groups** result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Thiol groups are excellent ligands due to the high affinity of sulfur for transition metals like Fe. The strong Fe–S bond increases the stability of the Fe-modifier complex, promoting higher Fe incorporation into the catalyst structure.

---

**Rule 3**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, such as **nitro (-NO₂)** or **halomethyl (-CH₂Hal)** groups, result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
  - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

- **Counter-examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(electron-donating methyl group)*
  - **4-aminobenzoic acid** *(electron-donating amino group)*

- **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group by stabilizing the negative charge on the carboxylate anion. This enhances its ability to coordinate with Fe ions, leading to increased Fe incorporation.

**Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing a pyridine ring** result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**

- **Counter-example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(possible steric hindrance or less optimal positioning of nitrogen)*

- **Rationale**: The lone pair on the nitrogen atom of the pyridine ring can coordinate with Fe ions. When the pyridine nitrogen is accessible and properly positioned, it enhances Fe coordination, increasing Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

**Rule 5**: **Modifiers with flexible ether linkages and terminal coordinating groups**, such as **amino (-NH₂)** or **carboxyl (-COOH)** groups, result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
  - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Ether linkages increase molecular flexibility, allowing coordinating groups to adopt favorable conformations for Fe binding. This flexibility facilitates the formation of stable Fe complexes, enhancing Fe incorporation.

---

**Rule 6**: **Amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking bulky substituents** result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Example**:
  - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(Phenylalanine)*

- **Counter-example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(Tryptophan, bulky indole group)*

- **Rationale**: Aromatic side chains can interact with Fe ions via π-electron interactions or direct coordination. Minimal steric hindrance in the side chain allows effective Fe binding, enhancing Fe incorporation.

---

**Rule 7**: **Modifiers with multiple carboxyl groups capable of chelation**, such as **dicarboxylic acids or amino acids with carboxylate side chains**, result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(Aspartic acid)*
  - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(Glutamic acid)*

- **Rationale**: Multiple carboxyl groups can act as bidentate ligands, chelating Fe ions more effectively. Chelation increases the stability of the Fe complex, promoting higher incorporation into the catalyst.

---

**Rule 8**: **Modifiers with electron-donating groups at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids**, such as **amino (-NH₂)** or **hydroxy (-OH)** groups, result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
  - **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**
  - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group by increasing electron density. This reduces the ability of the carboxylate to coordinate with Fe ions, leading to lower Fe incorporation.

---

**Rule 9**: **Simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional strong coordinating functional groups** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Example**:
  - **Octanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Without additional coordinating sites, these modifiers rely solely on the carboxyl group for Fe binding. The single coordination site is insufficient for significant Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

**Rule 10**: **Modifiers with bulky or sterically hindered groups near coordinating sites** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(Tryptophan)*
  - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(Acetylated lysine)*

- **Rationale**: Bulky groups near coordination sites create steric hindrance, impeding Fe ion access. This reduces coordination efficiency and Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

---

**Rule 11**: **Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl (-OH) groups near the carboxyl group (polyhydroxy carboxylic acids)** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Example**:
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(Gluconic acid)*

- **Rationale**: Extensive hydrogen bonding from multiple hydroxyl groups can sequester lone pairs on oxygen atoms, reducing their availability for Fe coordination. This diminishes Fe incorporation.

---

**Rule 12**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains attached to the carboxyl group** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Example**:
  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

- **Rationale**: Perfluorinated groups are highly electron-withdrawing, excessively lowering electron density on the carboxylate oxygen. This weakens coordination ability with Fe ions, resulting in decreased Fe incorporation.

---

**Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing conjugated carbonyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group without additional strong coordinating groups** result in a **low Fe/Hf value (False)**.

- **Examples**:
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
  - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

- **Rationale**: Conjugation with additional carbonyl groups delocalizes electron density away from the carboxylate oxygen, reducing its coordinating ability with Fe ions and leading to lower Fe incorporation.

---

**Rule 14**: **Modifiers with unique chelating structures, such as fused aromatic systems containing carbonyl groups**, can result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Example**:
  - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

- **Rationale**: Fused aromatic systems with multiple carbonyl groups can offer several coordination sites, enabling effective chelation with Fe ions. This enhances Fe incorporation despite lacking typical strong coordinating functional groups.

---

**Rule 15**: **Modifiers with flexible aliphatic chains terminating with coordinating functional groups on both ends**, such as **amino (-NH₂)** and **carboxyl (-COOH)** groups, result in a **high Fe/Hf value (True)**.

- **Example**:
  - **(2S)-6-aminohexanoic acid** *(Lysine)*

- **Rationale**: The presence of coordinating groups at both ends of a flexible chain allows for simultaneous coordination with Fe ions, forming stable chelate rings that enhance Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been developed to predict whether a molecular modifier will result in a **high** or **low Fe/Hf value** based on its structural features, considering the underlying physical and chemical properties.

**Key Considerations in the Rules:**

1. **Coordination Ability of Functional Groups**:
   - **Strong Coordinating Groups**: Primary amino (-NH₂) and thiol (-SH) groups enhance coordination with Fe ions (**Rules 1 and 2**).
   - **Multiple Coordination Sites**: Modifiers with two or more coordinating groups can chelate Fe ions effectively (**Rules 1, 5, 7, and 15**).

2. **Electronic Effects**:
   - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups**: Increase carboxylate acidity, enhancing Fe coordination (**Rule 3**).
   - **Electron-Donating Groups**: Decrease carboxylate acidity, weakening Fe coordination (**Rule 8**).
   - **Excessive Electron Withdrawal**: Highly electron-withdrawing perfluoroalkyl groups may overly diminish coordination ability (**Rule 12**).

3. **Steric Factors**:
   - **Steric Hindrance**: Bulky substituents near coordinating sites hinder Fe access (**Rule 10**).
   - **Optimal Chain Length and Flexibility**: Adequate separation between coordinating groups allows effective chelation without steric clashes (**Rules 1, 5, and 15**).

4. **Molecular Flexibility**:
   - **Flexible Linkers**: Ether or aliphatic chains enable coordinating groups to adopt favorable conformations (**Rules 5 and 15**).

5. **Hydrogen Bonding and Delocalization**:
   - **Polyhydroxy Compounds**: Extensive hydrogen bonding can reduce available coordination sites (**Rule 11**).
   - **Conjugated Carbonyl Groups**: Delocalization can weaken Fe coordination (**Rule 13**).

6. **Unique Structural Features**:
   - **Chelating Structures**: Fused aromatic systems with carbonyl groups provide effective Fe coordination (**Rule 14**).

By applying these rules, researchers can predict the Fe/Hf value outcome for modifiers based on their molecular structure. This aids in the rational design and selection of molecular modifiers to optimize catalyst performance in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

**Summary of Modifiers and Predicted Fe/Hf Values Based on the Rules:**

- **High Fe/Hf Value (True)**:
  - Modifiers with primary amino groups connected by flexible chains (**Rule 1**).
  - Modifiers containing thiol groups (**Rule 2**).
  - Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing para substituents (**Rule 3**).
  - Modifiers containing pyridine rings (**Rule 4**).
  - Modifiers with flexible ether linkages and terminal coordinating groups (**Rule 5**).
  - Amino acids with non-bulky aromatic side chains (**Rule 6**).
  - Modifiers with multiple carboxyl groups capable of chelation (**Rule 7**).
  - Modifiers with unique chelating structures (**Rule 14**).
  - Modifiers with flexible chains terminating with coordinating groups (**Rule 15**).

- **Low Fe/Hf Value (False)**:
  - Modifiers with electron-donating para substituents on aromatic rings (**Rule 8**).
  - Simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups (**Rule 9**).
  - Modifiers with bulky substituents causing steric hindrance (**Rule 10**).
  - Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups (**Rule 11**).
  - Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains (**Rule 12**).
  - Modifiers with conjugated carbonyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group (**Rule 13**).

By focusing on these structural features, chemists can tailor molecular modifiers to achieve the desired Fe/Hf ratio, thereby controlling the catalytic properties and optimizing the yield of the target reaction.
