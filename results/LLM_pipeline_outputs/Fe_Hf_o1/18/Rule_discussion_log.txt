Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**
- **Comment 1**: **Rule 1** is clear and straightforward: modifiers containing thiol (-SH) groups predict high Fe/Hf values. The property insight is sound, as thiol groups are well-known to form strong coordination bonds with metal ions like iron. The rule's complexity is appropriate, focusing on a specific functional group. It is supported by multiple data points (Compounds 10, 17, and 23), all showing high Fe/Hf values. Therefore, Rule 1 is well-founded.

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 2** is clear in specifying that modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro and halogen substituents on aromatic rings predict high Fe/Hf values. The property insight is appropriate, as these groups can enhance the ability of the modifier to coordinate with metal ions. The complexity is acceptable, considering specific substituents on aromatic rings. It is supported by data points (Compounds 1 and 20), both exhibiting high Fe/Hf values. Rule 2 is well-supported.

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 3** clearly states that modifiers with electron-donating groups on aromatic rings (e.g., hydroxyl, amino groups) predict low Fe/Hf values. The property insight is valid, as electron-donating groups increase electron density, potentially hindering effective metal coordination. The complexity is suitable, focusing on specific functional groups on aromatic rings. The rule is supported by multiple data points (Compounds 4, 7, and 30), all showing low Fe/Hf values. Rule 3 is well-founded.

- **Comment 4**: **Rule 4** is clear and specific: modifiers containing pyridine rings directly connected to the carboxylic acid predict high Fe/Hf values. The property insight is solid, as pyridine nitrogen atoms are strong coordinating sites for metal ions. The complexity is appropriate, considering specific structural features. The rule is supported by data points (Compounds 12 and 24), both showing high Fe/Hf values. Rule 4 is well-supported.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** is clear, stating that modifiers that are aliphatic amino acids with amino groups at terminal positions predict high Fe/Hf values. The property insight is convincing, as terminal amino groups can effectively chelate metal ions. The rule's complexity is acceptable, focusing on the combination of functional group position and molecule type. It is supported by multiple data points (Compounds 3, 31, and 34), all exhibiting high Fe/Hf values. Rule 5 is well-founded.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** suggests that modifiers with long aliphatic chains (>6 carbons) bearing hydroxyl groups at terminal positions predict high Fe/Hf values. While the rule is clear and the property insight is reasonable, it is only supported by a single data point (Compound 29), which does not meet the coverage criterion of at least two data points. Therefore, Rule 6 lacks sufficient support.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** states that modifiers that are α-amino acids with side chains containing sulfur groups predict high Fe/Hf values. The property insight is valid, considering the strong coordination ability of sulfur with metal ions. However, the rule is supported by only one clear data point (Compound 23). Compound 13, included as an exception, does not fit the rule as it lacks a sulfur group, indicating inconsistency. The rule lacks sufficient coverage and clarity, and may require refinement.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** is clear: modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains predict low Fe/Hf values. The property insight is reasonable, as increased hydrophilicity and steric hindrance from multiple hydroxyl groups may hinder effective interaction with Fe ions. The complexity is acceptable, focusing on multiple functional groups. Supported by data points (Compounds 6 and 9), both showing low Fe/Hf values, Rule 8 is well-founded.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** proposes that modifiers with heavily fluorinated aliphatic chains predict low Fe/Hf values. While the rule is clear and the property insight about hydrophobicity is plausible, it is supported by only one data point (Compound 14), failing the coverage criterion. Therefore, Rule 9 lacks sufficient support.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** is clear in stating that modifiers containing formyl groups on aromatic rings predict low Fe/Hf values. The property insight is acceptable, as formyl groups may reduce coordination ability. The complexity is suitable, focusing on specific functional groups on aromatic rings. Supported by data points (Compounds 18 and 19), both showing low Fe/Hf values, Rule 10 is well-supported.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** asserts that modifiers that are α-amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains (e.g., indole ring) predict low Fe/Hf values. While the rule is clear and the property insight regarding steric hindrance is reasonable, it is supported by only one data point (Compound 15), which does not meet the coverage requirement. Rule 11 lacks sufficient support.

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** indicates that modifiers with acetic acid derivatives containing ether linkages predict high Fe/Hf values. The rule is somewhat complex but understandable, and the property insight about ether linkages enhancing coordination is plausible. However, it is supported by only one data point (Compound 11), failing the coverage criterion. Rule 12 lacks sufficient support.

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13** states that modifiers with electron-donating alkyl groups on aromatic rings predict low Fe/Hf values. The rule is clear and the property insight is valid. However, it is only supported by a single data point (Compound 22), which does not satisfy the coverage requirement. Rule 13 lacks sufficient support.

- **Comment 14**: **Rule 14** suggests that modifiers containing keto groups adjacent to carboxylic acids predict low Fe/Hf values. While the rule is clear and the property insight is plausible, it is contradicted by an exception (Compound 25), which shows a high Fe/Hf value. With only one supporting data point (Compound 27) and an exception, the rule lacks sufficient coverage and consistency.

- **Comment 15**: **Rule 15** posits that modifiers with trifluoroacetyl groups predict low Fe/Hf values. The rule is clear and the property insight is acceptable. However, it is supported by only one data point (Compound 28), failing the coverage criterion. Rule 15 lacks sufficient support.

  **Rule 10** states that modifiers containing terminal hydroxyl groups on medium-length aliphatic chains predict high Fe/Hf values.

  **Clarity**: Moderate, as "medium-length" can be subjective.

  **Property Insight**: Terminal –OH groups may facilitate coordination, and medium-length chains balance solubility and steric factors.

  **Complexity**: Moderate complexity combining chain length and functional groups.

  **Coverage**: Limited, with the example of 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid. More data points are needed.

- **Comment 11**:

  **Rule 11** indicates that modifiers with sulfur-containing amino acids (e.g., thioethers) predict high Fe/Hf values.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**:

  **Rule 1** demonstrates high clarity as it clearly states that modifiers containing primary amino groups, especially on aliphatic chains, predict high Fe/Hf values, with consideration for steric hindrance. The rule is supported by several examples with high Fe/Hf values such as 5-aminopentanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, and (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid. However, there is a contradiction in the dataset with (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid showing a low Fe/Hf value, which slightly reduces the clarity and points to potential exceptions not accounted for by the rule. The property insight is adequate as it relates the coordination ability of primary amino groups to the Fe/Hf ratio. The rule considers combinations of functional groups and steric factors, satisfying the complexity criterion. Coverage is strong with multiple data points supporting the rule.

- **Comment 2**:

  **Rule 2** is clear, stating that modifiers containing thiol (–SH) groups predict high Fe/Hf values. The rule is supported by examples like 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid and 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid, both showing high Fe/Hf values in the dataset. Property insight is adequate, attributing high Fe/Hf ratios to the strong coordinating ability of thiol groups. The rule focuses on a single functional group, which is acceptable given the significant impact of thiol groups on coordination. Coverage is moderate, with at least two data points supporting the rule.

- **Comment 3**:

  **Rule 3** has high clarity, specifying that modifiers with pyridine rings where the nitrogen atom is accessible for coordination predict high Fe/Hf values. Examples such as 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid and 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid support the rule with high Fe/Hf values, while pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, which has the nitrogen less accessible, shows a low Fe/Hf value, reinforcing the rule. Property insight is strong, connecting the coordination potential of the pyridine nitrogen to increased Fe/Hf ratios. The rule considers structural features and coordination accessibility, adding to complexity. Coverage is adequate with multiple data points.

- **Comment 4**:

  **Rule 4** is clear in stating that modifiers with strongly electron-withdrawing groups at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids predict high Fe/Hf values, while those with electron-donating groups at the same position predict low Fe/Hf values. Examples like 4-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid support the high Fe/Hf outcome, while 4-aminobenzoic acid and 4-methylbenzoic acid show low Fe/Hf values. This rule shows good property insight by relating electronic effects to metal coordination. Complexity is moderate as it considers both electronic properties and positional effects. Coverage is strong with several data points supporting the rule.

- **Comment 5**:

  **Rule 5** states that modifiers with ether linkages connecting to terminal coordinating groups predict high Fe/Hf values. Examples include 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid and 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid, both showing high Fe/Hf values. The rule is clear and provides property insight into the role of flexible ether linkages enhancing coordination. Complexity is acceptable as it considers linker groups and terminal functionalities. Coverage is limited with two data points, but the rule remains valuable.

- **Comment 6**:

  **Rule 6** is clear, stating that simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional strongly coordinating groups predict low Fe/Hf values. Examples include octanoic acid and 4-oxoheptanedioic acid, both showing low Fe/Hf values. The rule has solid property insight, suggesting that the absence of coordinating groups leads to lower metal uptake. While simple, the rule effectively distinguishes a class of modifiers. Coverage is adequate.

- **Comment 7**:

  **Rule 7** clearly states that modifiers containing hydroxyl (–OH) groups directly attached to aromatic rings predict low Fe/Hf values. Examples like 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid support the rule with low Fe/Hf values. Property insight is acceptable, relating the electron-donating effect of phenolic –OH groups to reduced metal coordination. Complexity is moderate, focusing on specific sub-structures. Coverage is satisfactory with multiple supporting examples.

- **Comment 8**:

  **Rule 8** is clear in stating that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups (polyols) predict low Fe/Hf values. Examples such as (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid show low Fe/Hf values, supporting the rule. Property insight is reasonable, suggesting that extensive hydrogen bonding in polyols might inhibit coordination sites. Complexity is low but appropriate for the rule's purpose. Coverage is limited with few data points but acceptable.

- **Comment 9**:

  **Rule 9** specifies that modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl groups predict low Fe/Hf values. An example is 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid, showing a low Fe/Hf value. Clarity is good, and property insight is adequate as perfluoroalkyl groups are highly electron-withdrawing but do not enhance coordination. Complexity is low. Coverage is minimal with only one data point, suggesting the rule could benefit from more supporting data.

- **Comment 10**:

  **Rule 10** states that modifiers with terminal hydroxyl groups on medium-length aliphatic chains predict high Fe/Hf values. The example given is 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, which shows a high Fe/Hf value. Clarity is acceptable, but the rule would be strengthened with additional examples. Property insight is moderate, possibly relating to the flexibility and coordination ability of terminal –OH groups. Complexity is low to moderate. Coverage is minimal, indicating the need for more data to fully validate the rule.

- **Comment 11**:

  **Rule 11** states that modifiers with conjugated carbonyl groups adjacent to aromatic systems predict low Fe/Hf values. Examples like 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid and 4-formylbenzoic acid support this with low Fe/Hf values. Clarity is high, and the rule offers property insight into how conjugated systems may delocalize electron density, reducing coordination sites. Complexity is moderate. Coverage is acceptable with multiple data points.

- **Comment 12**:

  **Rule 12** states that modifiers containing methoxy groups on aromatic rings without additional coordinating groups predict low Fe/Hf values. However, the example provided, 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid, shows a high Fe/Hf value in the dataset, contradicting the rule. This reduces the rule's clarity and suggests insufficient property insight. Complexity is low. Coverage is weak due to contradictory data, indicating the rule may need revision or additional supporting data.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows for straightforward prediction of high or low Fe/Hf values based on the presence of straight-chain aliphatic amines without additional carboxyl groups or bulky side chains. The property insight is strong, explaining how the absence of steric hindrance facilitates Fe coordination. The rule combines multiple structural features (amine group, chain length, absence of bulky groups) and is well-supported by multiple data points (e.g., **5-aminopentanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, and **8-aminooctanoic acid** for high Fe/Hf; **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** and **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** for low Fe/Hf).

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is explicit in predicting high Fe/Hf values for modifiers containing sulfur functional groups. The chemical rationale is solid, emphasizing the strong coordinating ability of sulfur atoms with Fe centers. While the rule focuses on a single functional group (sulfur-containing groups), it effectively considers different types (thiol, thioether) and is supported by at least three data points (e.g., **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**, **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**, and **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**).

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 provides clear differentiation between electron-withdrawing and electron-donating substituents on aromatic carboxylic acids, with corresponding predictions for Fe/Hf values. The property insight is strong, relating electronic effects to coordination ability. The rule considers combinations of substructures (aromatic ring, type of substituent) and is well-supported by multiple examples for both high (e.g., **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**) and low Fe/Hf values (e.g., **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-methylbenzoic acid**).

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear and provides good property insight into how the accessibility of pyridine nitrogen atoms affects Fe coordination. It considers both structural aspects (position of nitrogen in the ring) and electronic effects (resonance involvement). The rule is supported by multiple data points for both high (e.g., **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**, **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**) and low Fe/Hf values (e.g., **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**).

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 effectively combines the presence of ether linkages with terminal coordinating groups to predict high Fe/Hf values. The rule is clear, and the property insight about chain flexibility and additional donor atoms enhancing coordination is sound. It is supported by at least two data points (**2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**), demonstrating adequate coverage.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 clearly states that aromatic hydroxyl groups reduce Fe coordination, predicting low Fe/Hf values. The property insight is logical, given the electron-donating nature of hydroxyl groups. The rule focuses on a specific combination of substructures (aromatic ring with directly attached –OH groups) and is supported by three data points (**5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**, **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**, **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**).

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 addresses modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups (polyols), predicting low Fe/Hf values due to intramolecular hydrogen bonding limiting coordination sites. The rule is clear and provides good property insight. It considers the combination of multiple hydroxyl groups and is supported by at least two data points (**(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**, **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**).

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is straightforward, predicting low Fe/Hf values for simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups. The rule is clear and based on sound chemical reasoning regarding the lack of donor atoms. While it focuses on a single functional group, it effectively captures modifiers lacking in coordination ability and is supported by data (**octanoic acid**, **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**).

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 clearly predicts low Fe/Hf values for modifiers with perfluoroalkyl groups. The property insight regarding the electron-withdrawing nature of fluorine atoms reducing coordination ability is valid. The rule is specific to a particular substructure and is supported by at least two data points (**2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**, **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**).

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 suggests that modifiers with both amino and amide groups predict high Fe/Hf values due to enhanced coordination capability from multiple nitrogen-containing groups. The property insight is reasonable. However, the rule's coverage is limited, supported by only one data point (**(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**), which reduces confidence in its general applicability.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 provides clear guidance on modifiers containing aromatic heterocycles with resonance-involved nitrogens, predicting low Fe/Hf values. The property insight about resonance reducing nitrogen's availability for coordination is solid. The rule combines structural features and is supported by at least two data points (**1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**, **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**).

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is clear in predicting low Fe/Hf values for modifiers with conjugated carbonyl groups adjacent to aromatic systems lacking additional coordinating groups. The property insight is sound, and the rule considers combined substructures. It is supported by multiple data points (**5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**).

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13, which predicts high Fe/Hf values for modifiers with methoxy groups on aromatic rings coupled with additional donor sites, offers reasonable property insight. However, its coverage is limited, with only one supporting data point (**4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**). This limits the rule's reliability and applicability.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 predicts high Fe/Hf values for modifiers with terminal hydroxyl groups on medium-length aliphatic chains. The rule is clear and the property insight is plausible. However, it is supported by only one data point (**7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**), which affects its robustness due to limited coverage.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 discusses amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms, predicting low Fe/Hf values due to steric hindrance and resonance involvement. The property insight is sound. While it compares two modifiers (**(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** for low Fe/Hf and **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** for high Fe/Hf), the coverage is minimal with only one data point supporting each case, thereby reducing the rule's overall strength.

The physicochemical explanations regarding increased acidity and enhanced coordination are well-founded. It combines substructures (aromatic ring with electron-withdrawing groups), satisfying the complexity criterion. With two supporting data points, the rule has adequate coverage and balances complexity and coverage effectively.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 effectively meets all the criteria. It clearly states that modifiers with electron-donating groups on aromatic rings predict low Fe/Hf values.

While it identifies aromatic rings containing nitrogen atoms available for coordination, it lacks precise criteria for the nitrogen's position, leading to ambiguity. For instance, **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** and **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** contain aromatic nitrogen but predict low Fe/Hf values, contradicting the rule. The property insight is partially adequate but needs more detail on how specific nitrogen positioning affects coordination. The rule's complexity is appropriate, but coverage is inconsistent due to conflicting data points.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** performs well across all criteria. It clearly states that modifiers with electron-donating groups on aromatic rings predict low Fe/Hf values. The property insight is robust, explaining the reduction in carboxyl acidity and weaker Fe coordination due to electron-donating effects. The rule effectively combines multiple sub-structures, fulfilling the complexity criterion. With at least three supporting data points—**4-aminobenzoic acid**, **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**, and **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**—the coverage is strong.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** is clear in its description of simple aliphatic carboxylic acids lacking additional donor groups predicting low Fe/Hf values. The property insight is satisfactory, noting the weaker interactions due to monodentate coordination. However, the rule lacks complexity as it focuses on the absence of additional functional groups. Coverage is minimal, supported by only one data point (**octanoic acid**), indicating a need for more examples to strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** is clear and effectively identifies modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups but without strong Lewis base donor atoms, predicting low Fe/Hf values. The property insight is sound, discussing how hydroxyl groups may engage in internal hydrogen bonding and offer weaker coordination. It combines several structural aspects, satisfying the complexity criterion. Coverage is adequate with at least two supporting data points: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** and **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** could benefit from improved clarity by defining what constitutes "bulky" aromatic side chains and specifying their adjacency to donor atoms. The property insight regarding steric hindrance affecting Fe coordination is valid. The rule considers combinations of structural features leading to steric effects, meeting the complexity criterion. Coverage is acceptable with at least two supporting examples—**(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid**—but more data would enhance its reliability.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** lacks clarity, as identifying modifiers capable of forming stable five-membered chelate rings with Fe ions requires detailed structural analysis that may not be straightforward. The property insight is good, emphasizing the stability of five-membered rings in chelation. Complexity is addressed by considering spatial arrangements of donor atoms. However, coverage is weak, supported by only one data point (**(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid**), necessitating more examples to validate the rule.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** is clear, identifying modifiers with ether linkages alongside terminal donor groups predicting high Fe/Hf values. The property insight is strong, explaining how ether oxygens provide additional coordination sites and chain flexibility enhances orientation toward Fe ions. The rule effectively combines multiple sub-structures, fulfilling the complexity criterion. Coverage is satisfactory with at least two supporting data points: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** is clear in stating that modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains predict low Fe/Hf values. The property insight is adequate, highlighting the electron-withdrawing effects of fluorine reducing donor atom electron density. However, the rule is simple and lacks complexity, focusing solely on the presence of fluorinated chains. Coverage is limited to a single data point (**2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**), suggesting a need for additional examples.

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** is clear and allows for the identification of modifiers containing ketone or aldehyde groups near donor atoms predicting low Fe/Hf values. The property insight is reasonable, discussing resonance effects and competitive interactions of carbonyl groups affecting Fe coordination. The rule combines multiple structural features, satisfying the complexity criterion. Coverage is adequate with at least two supporting data points: **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** and **4-formylbenzoic acid**.
