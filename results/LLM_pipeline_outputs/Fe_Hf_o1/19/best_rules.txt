These rules are designed to capture the relationship between the molecular features of the modifiers and the Fe/Hf value in the dataset. Each rule combines specific substructures and functional groups, considering their physical and chemical properties:

- **Rule 1 & Rule 10**: **Chain Length and Functionalization**

  Longer aliphatic chains with terminal primary amino or hydroxyl groups enhance the interaction with the metal-organic layer (MOL), facilitating higher Fe incorporation. The presence of these functional groups at the terminal position on chains of five or more carbons increases ligand flexibility and the ability to chelate metal centers.

- **Rule 2 & Rule 4**: **Electronic Effects on Aromatic Rings**

  Electron-withdrawing groups at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids stabilize the negative charge of the carboxylate ion, enhancing coordination with metal ions and increasing Fe/Hf ratios. Conversely, electron-donating groups reduce the acidity and binding affinity, leading to lower Fe incorporation.

- **Rule 3**: **Metal-Coordinating Functional Groups**

  Functional groups capable of strong coordination with metal ions (e.g., thiols, thioethers, pyridine rings, amino groups) promote higher Fe loading due to the formation of stable complexes with Fe ions. These groups can donate electron density to the metal, enhancing binding affinity.

- **Rule 5**: **Polyether Chains**

  Polyether chains increase solubility and provide multiple coordination sites through ether oxygen atoms. This flexibility and ability to form multiple coordination bonds can enhance Fe incorporation into the MOL.

- **Rule 6**: **Polyols, Sugar-like Structures, and Perfluoroalkyl Chains**

  Molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups or sugar-like structures may form intramolecular hydrogen bonds or have high hydrophilicity, which can hinder effective coordination with Fe ions. Perfluoroalkyl chains are highly electronegative and can repel metal ions, reducing Fe incorporation.

- **Rule 7**: **Steric and Electronic Effects of Aromatic Amino Acids**

  Amino acids with smaller aromatic side chains (like phenylalanine) have less steric hindrance and can coordinate more effectively with Fe ions, resulting in higher Fe/Hf values. Larger, electron-rich side chains (like indole in tryptophan) can impede coordination due to steric bulk and electron density.

- **Rule 8**: **Aldehyde and Ketone Groups on Aromatic Rings**

  Aldehyde and ketone groups directly attached to aromatic rings can participate in resonance with the aromatic system, reducing the ability of the carboxylate group to coordinate with metal ions and leading to lower Fe/Hf ratios.

- **Rule 9**: **Lack of Functional Groups**

  Simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups have limited ability to interact with the MOL beyond basic carboxylate coordination, resulting in lower Fe incorporation.

- **Rule 11**: **Combined Electronic and Coordination Effects**

  Modifiers with ketone groups on aliphatic chains attached to methoxy-substituted aromatic rings can enhance Fe incorporation due to the combined effects of electron-donating methoxy groups increasing the electron density for coordination and ketone groups providing additional coordination sites.

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a new modifier is likely to result in a high or low Fe/Hf value based on its molecular structure. These rules consider important physical-chemical properties such as:

- **Chelation Ability**: Functional groups that can donate lone pairs to metal ions (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, ether, thiol) enhance Fe incorporation.
- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups stabilize negative charges and enhance metal coordination, while electron-donating groups can reduce metal binding affinity.
- **Sterics**: Bulky groups can hinder effective coordination with metal centers due to spatial constraints.
- **Solubility and Flexibility**: Modifiers that improve solubility and have flexible chains can interact more effectively with the MOL.

**Note**: These rules aim to balance coverage of the dataset with specificity. Rules like **Rule 1**, **Rule 2**, **Rule 3**, and **Rule 4** cover broader categories and explain trends observed across multiple compounds. More specific rules like **Rule 11** address unique combinations of functional groups that have a significant impact on Fe/Hf values. By combining simple, high-coverage rules with more detailed ones, we can create a comprehensive predictive model for Fe/Hf values based on modifier structures.---------------------------------------------------------------
