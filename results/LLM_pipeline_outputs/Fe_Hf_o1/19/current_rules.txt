**Start of Rules**

---

1. **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are linear aliphatic amino acids with a terminal amino group and a terminal carboxylic acid group connected by an unbranched carbon chain of at least four carbons predict a high Fe/Hf value (True).**

   - **Functional Groups Included**: Terminal primary amino group (-NH₂), terminal carboxylic acid group (-COOH), and an unbranched aliphatic chain of four or more carbon atoms.
   - **Rationale**: The amino and carboxylate groups can chelate Fe³⁺ ions effectively due to their positioning, enhancing metal coordination and incorporation.
   - **Examples**:
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

2. **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position predict a high Fe/Hf value (True).**

   - **Functional Groups Included**: Aromatic ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a strong electron-withdrawing substituent at the para position, such as nitro (-NO₂), bromomethyl (-CH₂Br), or pyridyl groups.
   - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing deprotonation and coordination with Fe³⁺ ions. Pyridyl groups can also act as additional coordination sites.
   - **Examples**:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**

3. **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing sulfur atoms capable of coordinating with metals predict a high Fe/Hf value (True).**

   - **Functional Groups Included**: Sulfur-containing groups such as thiol (-SH), thioether (-S-), or methylthio (-SCH₃) groups attached to aliphatic or aromatic backbones.
   - **Rationale**: Sulfur atoms have lone pairs that coordinate strongly with Fe³⁺ ions, enhancing metal incorporation.
   - **Examples**:
     - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**
     - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

4. **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with polyether chains and terminal coordinating groups predict a high Fe/Hf value (True).**

   - **Functional Groups Included**: Polyether chains (-[OCH₂CH₂]_n-) with terminal carboxylic acid (-COOH) or amino (-NH₂) groups.
   - **Rationale**: Ether oxygen atoms can coordinate with Fe³⁺ ions, and the flexibility of the chain allows for multidentate interactions, enhancing metal binding.
   - **Examples**:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

5. **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids fused with additional carbonyl-containing rings predict a high Fe/Hf value (True).**

   - **Functional Groups Included**: Aromatic systems with fused rings containing additional carbonyl groups (e.g., lactones, quinones) adjacent to the carboxylic acid.
   - **Rationale**: Additional carbonyl groups provide extra coordination sites for Fe³⁺ ions, enhancing metal incorporation.
   - **Example**:
     - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

6. **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are linear aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups predict a low Fe/Hf value (False).**

   - **Functional Groups Included**: Unbranched aliphatic chains with a terminal carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and no other coordinating groups.
   - **Rationale**: Lack of additional coordinating sites reduces the ability to chelate Fe³⁺ ions effectively, leading to lower metal incorporation.
   - **Examples**:
     - **Octanoic acid**
     - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

7. **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position predict a low Fe/Hf value (False).**

   - **Functional Groups Included**: Aromatic ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an electron-donating substituent at the para position, such as amino (-NH₂), hydroxy (-OH), or methyl (-CH₃) groups.
   - **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, hindering deprotonation and reducing coordination with Fe³⁺ ions.
   - **Examples**:
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
     - **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
     - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

8. **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups (polyols) predict a low Fe/Hf value (False).**

   - **Functional Groups Included**: Molecules with several hydroxyl groups (-OH) on adjacent carbons, such as sugars and polyols.
   - **Rationale**: High hydrophilicity and intramolecular hydrogen bonding reduce coordination with Fe³⁺ ions by occupying coordination sites or causing steric hindrance.
   - **Examples**:
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**
     - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**

9. **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains predict a low Fe/Hf value (False).**

   - **Functional Groups Included**: Amino acids with large aromatic side chains, such as phenyl or indole groups.
   - **Rationale**: Bulky side chains introduce steric hindrance, reducing effective coordination of amino and carboxylate groups with Fe³⁺ ions.
   - **Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid**
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid**

10. **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups adjacent to the carboxylate predict a low Fe/Hf value (False).**

    - **Functional Groups Included**: Aromatic ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an aldehyde group (-CHO) ortho or para to the carboxylate.
    - **Rationale**: Aldehyde groups may form intramolecular interactions or react, hindering coordination with Fe³⁺ ions.
    - **Examples**:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

11. **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl chains predict a low Fe/Hf value (False).**

    - **Functional Groups Included**: Perfluoroalkyl groups (-CₙF₂ₙ₊₁) attached to carboxylic acids.
    - **Rationale**: Fluorine's high electronegativity withdraws electron density, reducing the carboxylate's ability to coordinate with Fe³⁺ ions. Hydrophobicity may also hinder interaction in polar solvents.
    - **Example**:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

12. **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing aromatic heterocycles with carboxylic acid groups predict a low Fe/Hf value (False).**

    - **Functional Groups Included**: Nitrogenous heterocycles (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole) with carboxylic acid groups.
    - **Rationale**: Nitrogen's lone pairs may be delocalized, reducing coordination ability with Fe³⁺ ions. Steric factors may also limit effective binding.
    - **Examples**:
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**
      - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

13. **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic dicarboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups predict a low Fe/Hf value (False).**

    - **Functional Groups Included**: Linear aliphatic chains with two carboxylic acid groups (-COOH) and no other coordinating groups.
    - **Rationale**: Although they can act as bridging ligands, the lack of additional coordinating atoms weakens chelation with Fe³⁺ ions.
    - **Examples**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid**
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid**
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

14. **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxy groups ortho to the carboxylate predict a low Fe/Hf value (False).**

    - **Functional Groups Included**: Phenolic hydroxyl groups (-OH) adjacent to the carboxylic acid on an aromatic ring.
    - **Rationale**: Intramolecular hydrogen bonding reduces availability of coordination sites for Fe³⁺ ions.
    - **Examples**:
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

15. **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy groups on the aromatic ring predict a high Fe/Hf value (True).**

    - **Functional Groups Included**: Aromatic ring with carboxylic acid (-COOH) and methoxy (-OCH₃) groups, especially in positions that facilitate coordination.
    - **Rationale**: Methoxy groups can enhance electron density through resonance, potentially increasing coordination ability with Fe³⁺ ions.
    - **Example**:
      - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**
