Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**
- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows for straightforward prediction based on the presence of sulfhydryl groups (-SH). The property insight is sound, as thiol groups are known to coordinate strongly with metal ions like Fe, enhancing their incorporation. The rule is simple and effectively captures the relationship with good coverage supported by two data points and no counterexamples.
- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear in specifying that modifiers with amino groups (-NH₂) on aliphatic chains of 6 or more carbons predict high Fe/Hf values. The property insight is reasonable, suggesting that longer chains provide flexibility and better interaction with Fe ions. The rule includes a combination of functional group and chain length, adding some complexity. Coverage is adequate with three supporting data points and no counterexamples.
- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear in its identification of modifiers that contain both carboxylic acid and phenol groups predicting low Fe/Hf values. The property insight is valid, as phenolic hydroxyl groups can indeed chelate metal ions and interfere with Fe incorporation. The rule has acceptable complexity by considering the combination of two functional groups. It is well-supported by four data points and lacks counterexamples.
- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 clearly states that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) on aliphatic chains predict low Fe/Hf values. The property insight makes sense, as multiple hydroxyl groups can increase hydrophilicity and steric hindrance, reducing coordination with Fe ions. The rule is straightforward and is supported by two data points without counterexamples, meeting the coverage criterion minimally.
- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear in its assertion that modifiers with nitro groups (-NO₂) on aromatic rings predict high Fe/Hf values. The property insight suggests that electron-withdrawing nitro groups can activate the aromatic ring toward Fe coordination, which is plausible. However, the rule is supported by only one data point (Entry 20) and lacks additional supporting examples. This limited coverage does not fully satisfy the coverage criterion, reducing the rule's robustness.
- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 proposes that modifiers with thioether groups (-S-alkyl) predict high Fe/Hf values. While the property insight about sulfur's ability to coordinate with metal ions is sound, the rule is based on a single data point (Entry 23) and lacks additional examples or counterexamples. This limited coverage does not fully satisfy the coverage criterion, reducing the reliability of the rule.
- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 clearly states that modifiers with perfluoroalkyl groups predict low Fe/Hf values. The property insight is reasonable, attributing the effect to the electron-withdrawing and hydrophobic nature of perfluorinated chains that may impede Fe interaction. However, the rule is supported by only one data point (Entry 13) and lacks additional supporting data or counterexamples, which does not fulfill the coverage requirement adequately.
- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is moderately complex, distinguishing between modifiers where carboxylic acid groups are directly attached to pyridine rings (predicting low Fe/Hf values) and those where pyridine rings are connected via linkers to carboxylic acids (predicting high Fe/Hf values). The rule leverages structural differences affecting metal coordination, providing good property insight. The rule is supported by four data points, effectively capturing the influence of structural variations on Fe/Hf values.
- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 indicates that modifiers with both ether linkages and amino groups predict high Fe/Hf values. The property insight is logical, suggesting that ether linkages offer flexibility while amino groups facilitate coordination with Fe ions. The rule's complexity arises from considering multiple functional groups together. Coverage is minimal but acceptable with two supporting data points and no counterexamples.
- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear and straightforward, noting that modifiers with aldehyde groups (-CHO) attached to aromatic rings with carboxylic acids predict low Fe/Hf values. The property insight is plausible, as aldehyde groups may interfere with Fe incorporation through strong interactions. The rule has minimal coverage with two data points and no counterexamples, satisfying the basic coverage requirement.
- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 compares modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains, indicating that phenylalanine predicts high Fe/Hf values, while tryptophan predicts low values. The property insight suggests that larger indole rings may hinder Fe incorporation compared to smaller phenyl rings, which is reasonable. However, the rule is based on only one data point for each case, which is minimal and may not provide sufficient coverage for a robust rule.
- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 states that modifiers with methyl groups on aromatic rings predict low Fe/Hf values. The property insight attributes this to methyl groups being electron-donating, potentially reducing effective coordination with Fe ions. However, the rule is supported by only one data point (Entry 22) and does not have further supporting data or counterexamples, failing to meet the coverage requirement fully.
- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 suggests that modifiers with aromatic ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acids predict low Fe/Hf values. The property insight makes sense, considering that such structures could strongly chelate Fe ions, hindering incorporation. However, the rule is supported by only one data point (Entry 27) for low Fe/Hf, and an exception is noted with Entry 25 due to methoxy groups. This limited coverage and presence of exceptions reduce the robustness of the rule.
- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 posits that modifiers with methoxy groups (-OCH₃) on aromatic rings predict high Fe/Hf values. The property insight is reasonable given that methoxy groups are electron-donating and can activate the aromatic ring toward coordination with Fe ions. However, the rule is based on a single data point (Entry 25) and lacks additional examples or counterexamples, which limits its coverage and strength as a rule.
- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 addresses modifiers with halogenated alkyl chains, noting variable effects except for perfluorinated chains, which predict low Fe/Hf values. The property insight is somewhat speculative due to the lack of examples in the dataset other than the perfluorinated compound (Entry 13). The coverage is insufficient, with only one supporting data point for perfluorinated chains and no data for other halogenated compounds, making it challenging to draw firm conclusions.

**End of Rules**

These rules have been formulated by carefully analyzing the dataset to identify patterns based on combinations of functional groups and structural features. The focus has been on combining multiple substructures—such as amino groups with long aliphatic chains, thiol groups with carboxylic acids, and pyridine rings with aliphatic linkers—to determine how these combinations affect the Fe/Hf ratio.

Each rule includes:

- **Direct Combinations of Substructures**: Emphasizing how multiple functional groups within the same molecule interact to enhance or hinder Fe coordination.
- **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Considering factors like electron density, Lewis acidity/basicity, steric effects, and molecular flexibility.
- **Predictive Clarity**: Clearly stating whether modifiers fitting each rule are expected to result in high or low Fe/Hf values.
- **Coverage**: Prioritizing rules that cover a broad range of the dataset while maintaining a balance between simple, high-coverage rules and more complex, lower-coverage ones.

By applying these rules, chemists can predict the Fe/Hf outcome for new modifiers based on their structural features, aiding in the rational design of modifiers to optimize catalyst performance in the targeted reaction.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is robust and meets all the criteria effectively. It provides a clear guideline that modifiers containing both a primary amino group and a carboxylic acid group on an aliphatic chain of five or more carbons predict high Fe/Hf values. The physical-chemical insight is sound, highlighting the role of multiple coordination sites and chain flexibility in enhancing Fe chelation. The rule combines multiple substructures, satisfying the complexity criterion, and is supported by multiple data points (Entries 2, 31, 34, 33), ensuring good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is well-defined and fulfills the criteria satisfactorily. It clearly states that modifiers with both a thiol group and a carboxylic acid group predict high Fe/Hf values. The explanation is logical, emphasizing the strong coordination ability of thiol groups with Fe ions. The rule considers combinations of functional groups, meeting the complexity requirement, and is supported by sufficient data points (Entries 17 and 9), providing adequate coverage.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear and offers reasonable physical-chemical insight by connecting the coordination ability of the pyridine ring nitrogen and the flexibility provided by the aliphatic linker. However, it is based on a single high Fe/Hf data point (Entry 24), limiting its coverage. Although the rule considers multiple substructures, the limited data support affects its predictive reliability.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 clearly indicates that electron-withdrawing groups on an aromatic ring adjacent to a carboxylic acid predict high Fe/Hf values. The rationale is acceptable, but the rule suffers from limited coverage, relying on only one high Fe/Hf data point (Entry 20). The broadness of "electron-withdrawing groups" without specific distinctions further affects its applicability.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 meets the criteria effectively. It clearly states that modifiers with multiple ether linkages in an aliphatic chain and a terminal carboxylic acid group predict high Fe/Hf values. The physical-chemical reasoning is sound, involving coordination through ether oxygens. The rule's complexity is appropriate, and it is supported by two high Fe/Hf data points (Entries 10 and 32), ensuring good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 provides a clear guideline but is based on limited data. It suggests that amino acids with aromatic side chains predict high Fe/Hf values when the aromatic ring is unsubstituted or bears electron-withdrawing groups. While the physical-chemical insight is logical, the rule is supported by only one high Fe/Hf data point (Entry 12), which limits its coverage and general applicability.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear and provides sound physical-chemical reasoning about the effects of hydroxyl groups on coordination ability. It considers specific combinations of functional groups and is supported by two low Fe/Hf data points (Entries 18 and 6), satisfying the coverage criterion. The rule appropriately balances complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear but has questionable physical-chemical insight. While it notes that perfluoroalkyl groups predict low Fe/Hf values, the explanation conflicts by citing both electron-withdrawing effects and decreased coordination due to hydrophobicity. This inconsistency affects the property insight criterion. The rule is supported by two data points (Entries 13 and 28), but the conflicting rationale undermines its robustness.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is straightforward and meets the criteria well. It clearly states that simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups predict low Fe/Hf values. The physical-chemical reasoning is logical. Despite its simplicity, the rule is effective due to its broad applicability and is supported by two data points (Entries 4 and 29), achieving good coverage.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear and provides reasonable physical-chemical insight about steric hindrance when a carboxylic acid is directly attached to a pyridine ring. However, it is based on a single low Fe/Hf data point (Entry 21), limiting its coverage. The contrast with a high Fe/Hf example (Entry 24) where the carboxylic acid is not directly attached highlights the rule's specificity but also its limited data support.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear and meets the criteria effectively. It states that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain predict low Fe/Hf values. The physical-chemical reasoning is sound, and the rule considers combinations of functional groups. It is supported by two data points (Entries 8 and 5), ensuring adequate coverage.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is highly specific and based on a single high Fe/Hf data point (Entry 25), limiting its coverage. While the physical-chemical insight is plausible, the rule's specificity and limited data support affect its general applicability and predictive utility.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear but has limited coverage, supported by only one low Fe/Hf data point (Entry 15). The physical-chemical reasoning about steric hindrance is reasonable, but the lack of additional supporting data reduces the rule's reliability.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 is clear and provides acceptable physical-chemical insight. However, it is based on a single low Fe/Hf data point (Entry 26), limiting its coverage. The specificity of the functional group combination and the lack of additional data points affect its predictive power.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 is clear and offers logical physical-chemical reasoning regarding reduced flexibility in short aliphatic chains. It considers combinations of substructures and is supported by two low Fe/Hf data points (Entries 1 and 14). The exception noted (Entry 12) suggests that additional factors may influence the Fe/Hf outcome, which could be addressed to enhance the rule's accuracy.

These rules have been developed by thoroughly analyzing the dataset to identify patterns based on combinations of functional groups and structural features. The focus has been on:

- **Combining Multiple Substructures**: Emphasizing how different functional groups within the same molecule interact to influence Fe coordination.
- **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Considering electron-donating and electron-withdrawing effects, Lewis acidity/basicity, steric factors, and molecular flexibility.
- **Predictive Clarity**: Each rule explicitly states whether modifiers fitting its description are expected to result in high or low Fe/Hf values.
- **Coverage**: Prioritizing rules that cover a broader range of the dataset while maintaining a balance between simplicity and complexity.

By applying these rules, chemists can predict the Fe/Hf outcome for new modifiers based on their structural features. This aids in the rational design of modifiers to optimize catalyst performance in the targeted radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. The rules serve as guidelines for selecting or synthesizing modifiers that enhance Fe incorporation into the catalyst, thereby improving the reaction yield.

These rules have been developed through a detailed analysis of the dataset, focusing on the presence and combination of functional groups within the molecular modifiers and their influence on Fe/Hf values. The key considerations in formulating these rules include:

- **Combinations of Functional Groups**: Emphasizing the synergistic effect of multiple coordinating groups (e.g., -NH₂ with -COOH, -SH with -COOH) in enhancing Fe incorporation.

- **Physical-Chemical Properties**: Taking into account electronic effects (electron-withdrawing/donating groups), steric factors (bulky substituents), and the coordination ability of specific functional groups (e.g., pyridine nitrogen, ketone oxygen).

- **Predictive Clarity**: Each rule clearly states the expected Fe/Hf outcome (high or low) for modifiers that fit the described structural criteria.

- **Dataset Coverage**: The rules aim to cover a broad spectrum of the dataset, providing guidance for as many modifiers as possible while balancing simplicity and specificity.

By applying these rules, chemists involved in catalyst design can predict the Fe/Hf ratio based on the structural features of potential molecular modifiers. This predictive capability aids in selecting or synthesizing modifiers that are more likely to enhance Fe incorporation into the Hf-TPY-MOL catalyst, ultimately optimizing the yield of the remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

**Note**: While these rules are formulated based on the available dataset, it's important to consider that exceptions may exist due to complex interactions not captured by simple functional group analysis. Experimental validation is recommended when applying these rules to new modifiers.

These rules have been developed through a comprehensive analysis of the dataset, focusing on the combinations of functional groups within the molecular modifiers and their influence on Fe/Hf values. The key considerations in formulating these rules include:

- **Combinations of Functional Groups**: Emphasizing the synergistic effect of multiple coordinating groups (e.g., -NH₂ with -COOH, -SH with -COOH) in enhancing Fe incorporation.

- **Physical-Chemical Properties**: Accounting for electronic effects (electron-withdrawing/donating groups), steric factors (bulky substituents), and the coordination ability of specific functional groups (e.g., pyridine nitrogen, ketone oxygen, ether oxygens).

- **Dataset Coverage**: Prioritizing rules that apply to a broader range of the dataset while balancing simplicity and specificity.

- **Rule Improvement**: Refining existing rules to increase their applicability and accuracy, and discarding those that do not effectively predict Fe/Hf values.

By applying these rules, chemists involved in catalyst design can predict the Fe/Hf ratio based on the structural features of potential molecular modifiers. This predictive capability aids in selecting or synthesizing modifiers that are more likely to enhance Fe incorporation into the Hf-TPY-MOL catalyst, ultimately optimizing the yield of the remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

**Note**: While these rules are formulated based on the available dataset, it's important to consider that exceptions may exist due to complex interactions not captured by simple functional group analysis. Experimental validation is recommended when applying these rules to new modifiers.

**End of Rules**

These rules have been carefully developed to illustrate the relationship between the structural features of molecular modifiers and their impact on the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst. By focusing on direct combinations of functional groups, we have emphasized how multiple sub-structures within a modifier synergize to enhance or diminish Fe incorporation.

**Key considerations in developing these rules include**:

- **Combination of Functional Groups**: Highlighting how specific pairs or groups of functional moieties (e.g., amino with carboxyl, thiol with carboxyl) influence the coordination with Fe ions.

- **Physical-Chemical Properties**: Taking into account factors such as electron-donating or electron-withdrawing effects, steric hindrance, molecular flexibility, and the strength of different ligand-metal interactions.

- **Dataset Coverage**: Prioritizing rules that apply to multiple entries in the dataset to ensure broader applicability while acknowledging exceptions.

- **Balance Between Simplicity and Complexity**: Providing straightforward rules that cover general trends and more detailed rules that explain specific cases.

By applying these rules, chemists and researchers can predict whether a potential molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low Fe/Hf value based on its structural features. This predictive capability aids in the rational design and selection of modifiers to optimize the catalyst's performance in the remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

**Note**: While these rules are informed by the provided dataset and grounded in chemical principles, experimental validation remains essential. Real-world interactions can be complex, and unforeseen factors may influence the Fe/Hf ratio beyond the scope of these guidelines.

**Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing both an *amino group (-NH₂)* and a *carboxylic acid group (-COOH)* separated by an aliphatic chain of at least four carbon atoms predict a **high Fe/Hf** value.**

- **Explanation**: The amino and carboxylate groups can act as bidentate ligands, effectively chelating Fe ions. The longer aliphatic chain provides flexibility for optimal coordination geometry, enhancing Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (Entry 2)
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Entry 31)
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Entry 34)
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Entry 0) – Additional carboxylate groups may hinder effective chelation due to over-coordination or steric hindrance.
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Entry 3) – Amino and carboxylate groups attached directly to the aromatic ring may not have optimal geometry for chelation.

---

**Rule 2**: **Modifiers featuring a *pyridine ring* where the nitrogen atom can coordinate with Fe, and a *carboxylic acid group (-COOH)* attached directly or via a short aliphatic chain predict a **high Fe/Hf** value.**

- **Explanation**: The lone pair on the pyridine nitrogen and the carboxylate oxygen can coordinate simultaneously with Fe ions, forming stable complexes. The positioning of these groups allows for effective chelation.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 11)
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** (Entry 24)
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Entry 21) – The nitrogen and carboxylate groups are positioned such that simultaneous coordination is less favorable due to geometrical constraints.

---

**Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing both a *thiol group (-SH)* and a *carboxylic acid group (-COOH)* predict a **high Fe/Hf** value if the thiol and carboxylate are appropriately spaced to allow chelation.**

- **Explanation**: Thiol groups are strong ligands for Fe ions. Combined with a carboxylate group, they can chelate Fe effectively. The spatial arrangement must allow both groups to coordinate simultaneously.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 17)
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Entry 9)

---

**Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are carboxylic acids (aromatic or aliphatic) without additional strong coordinating groups predict a **low Fe/Hf** value.**

- **Explanation**: Without extra coordinating functionalities, these modifiers have limited ability to chelate Fe ions, resulting in lower Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

- **Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **Octanoic acid** (Entry 4)
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 22)
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Entry 27)
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Entry 21)

---

**Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *electron-withdrawing groups* (e.g., nitro -NO₂) on the ring predict a **high Fe/Hf** value.**

- **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing the carboxylate's ability to donate electron density to Fe ions. This facilitates stronger coordination and higher Fe incorporation.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Entry 20)
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19) – Despite having an electron-withdrawing group (aldehyde), steric factors or resonance effects may reduce coordination effectiveness.

---

**Rule 6**: **Modifiers featuring *polyether chains* (repeating -O-CH₂CH₂- units) ending with a *carboxylic acid group (-COOH)* predict a **high Fe/Hf** value.**

- **Explanation**: The oxygen atoms in the polyether chain can coordinate with Fe ions. The flexible chain allows for multiple coordination points, enhancing Fe binding and incorporation.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 10)
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32)
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (Entry 5) – Multiple hydroxyl groups may form hydrogen bonds, reducing their availability for metal coordination.

---

**Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are *amino acids* with *aromatic side chains* capable of participating in coordination predict a **high Fe/Hf** value.**

- **Explanation**: The amino and carboxylate groups provide primary coordination sites, while aromatic side chains can offer additional stabilization through π-interactions or direct coordination if they contain suitable substituents.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Entry 12)
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Entry 14) – The bulky indole group may cause steric hindrance, reducing coordination efficiency.

---

**Rule 8**: **Modifiers with multiple adjacent *hydroxyl groups (-OH)* (polyols) along with a *carboxylic acid group (-COOH)* predict a **low Fe/Hf** value.**

- **Explanation**: Extensive hydrogen bonding among hydroxyl groups can decrease their availability for metal coordination. The formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds may also alter the structure, making coordination less favorable.

- **Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Entry 8)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (Entry 5)

---

**Rule 9**: **Modifiers featuring a combination of *amide bonds (-CONH-)* and additional coordination sites such as an *amino group (-NH₂)* or *thioether (-S-)* predict a **high Fe/Hf** value.**

- **Explanation**: Amide groups can participate in coordination through the carbonyl oxygen and/or nitrogen lone pairs. Additional coordinating groups like amino or thioether enhance the overall binding capacity to Fe ions.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 33)
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (Entry 23)

---

**Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing *nonaromatic heterocycles* with nitrogen atoms that are less accessible for coordination predict a **low Fe/Hf** value.**

- **Explanation**: Nonaromatic heterocycles may have nitrogen lone pairs involved in internal resonance or hydrogen bonding, making them less available for effective metal coordination.

- **Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 15)
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 7)

---

**Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *electron-donating groups* (e.g., hydroxyl -OH, methoxy -OCH₃) on the ring predict a **low Fe/Hf** value unless additional coordinating groups are present.**

- **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, reducing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions. Without other strong coordinating sites, Fe incorporation remains low.

- **Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Entry 6)
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30)
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Entry 26)

---

**Rule 12**: **Modifiers with long-chain *aliphatic hydroxyl groups (-OH)* and a *carboxylic acid group (-COOH)* predict a **high Fe/Hf** value.**

- **Explanation**: The hydroxyl group can coordinate with Fe ions, and the flexible aliphatic chain allows the hydroxyl and carboxylate groups to adopt conformations favorable for chelation.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Entry 29)

---

**Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing multiple *electron-withdrawing groups* (e.g., fluorine atoms) in the aliphatic chain predict a **low Fe/Hf** value.**

- **Explanation**: Strong electron-withdrawing groups reduce the basicity of potential coordinating atoms (like oxygen), making them less effective at donating electron density to Fe ions for coordination.

- **Examples**:
  - **Low Fe/Hf**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Entry 13)
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** (Entry 28)

---

**Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing *ketone groups (C=O)* adjacent to an aromatic ring and a *carboxylic acid group (-COOH)* predict a **high Fe/Hf** value when the ketone can participate in coordination.**

- **Explanation**: The ketone oxygen provides an additional coordination site. Conjugation with the aromatic ring can stabilize the Fe complex through delocalization of electron density.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Entry 16)
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (Entry 25)

---

**Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing both *thioether groups (-S-)* and *amide bonds (-CONH-)* along with a *carboxylic acid group (-COOH)* predict a **high Fe/Hf** value.**

- **Explanation**: Thioethers and amides contribute additional coordination sites through sulfur and nitrogen atoms. This multiplicity of coordinating groups enhances Fe binding and incorporation.

- **Examples**:
  - **High Fe/Hf**:
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (Entry 23)
