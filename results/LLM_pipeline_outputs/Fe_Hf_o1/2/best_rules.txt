**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing a primary amino group (-NH₂) attached to an aliphatic chain without additional carboxylic acid groups predict high Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Explanation*: Primary amino groups on aliphatic chains can effectively coordinate with Fe ions, enhancing Fe incorporation into the catalyst. The absence of additional carboxylic acid groups prevents potential competition or steric hindrance that could reduce coordination efficiency.

  - *Supporting Data*:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Entry 1)
      - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (Entry 2)
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Entry 31)
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Entry 34)
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 33)
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Entry 0) - contains additional carboxylic acid group.
      - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Entry 3) - amino group attached to aromatic ring, which is less effective.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers containing both a thiol group (-SH) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) predict high Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Explanation*: Thiol groups are strong ligands for Fe ions due to their soft Lewis base character. The presence of both -SH and -COOH groups provides multiple coordination sites, enhancing Fe incorporation.

  - *Supporting Data*:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 17)
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Entry 9)
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Entry 6) - lacks thiol group.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with an accessible nitrogen atom predict high Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Explanation*: The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with Fe ions, facilitating Fe incorporation. Accessibility of the nitrogen (i.e., not hindered by adjacent groups) enhances coordination efficiency.

  - *Supporting Data*:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 11)
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** (Entry 24)
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Entry 21) - carboxylic acid directly attached to pyridine may hinder coordination.
      - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 7) - additional keto group may interfere.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro group -NO₂) on an aromatic ring predict high Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Explanation*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the positive character of the aromatic ring, enhancing its interaction with Fe ions through coordination bonds.

  - *Supporting Data*:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Entry 20)
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 22) - contains electron-donating methyl group.
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19) - aldehyde may not enhance coordination similarly.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing multiple ether linkages (-O-) in the aliphatic chain and a terminal carboxylic acid group predict high Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Explanation*: Ether oxygen atoms can donate lone pairs to Fe ions, and the flexibility of ether linkages facilitates effective coordination.

  - *Supporting Data*:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 10)
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32)
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (Entry 5) - hydroxyl groups may hinder coordination.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) on aliphatic chains or aromatic rings predict low Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Explanation*: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase hydrogen bonding and rigidity, which can reduce the flexibility and availability of coordination sites for Fe ions.

  - *Supporting Data*:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Entry 8)
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 18)
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Entry 29) - single hydroxyl group distant from carboxyl may allow coordination.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl groups or trifluoromethyl groups attached to a carboxylic acid predict low Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Explanation*: Perfluoroalkyl groups are highly electronegative and hydrophobic, which can reduce solubility and coordination ability with Fe ions.

  - *Supporting Data*:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Entry 13)
      - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** (Entry 28)
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - None with perfluoroalkyl groups.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., hydroxyl or methoxy groups) predict low Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Explanation*: Electron-donating groups increase electron density on the aromatic ring, reducing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  - *Supporting Data*:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Entry 6)
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30)
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Entry 26)
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (Entry 25) - exception due to additional coordinating features like ketone groups.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are diacids (compounds with two carboxylic acid groups) predict low Fe/Hf values unless they have other strong coordinating groups that facilitate chelation.**

  - *Explanation*: Multiple carboxylic acid groups can lead to complex formation that doesn't favor Fe incorporation, especially if not properly positioned for chelation.

  - *Supporting Data*:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Entry 0)
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Entry 27)
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Entry 1) - exception possibly due to effective chelation despite being a diacid.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with bulky aromatic side chains, such as indole groups, predict low Fe/Hf values due to steric hindrance affecting coordination.**

  - *Explanation*: Bulky groups can hinder the accessibility of coordinating sites, reducing Fe incorporation.

  - *Supporting Data*:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Entry 14)
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Entry 12) - smaller phenyl group allows effective coordination.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups predict low Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Explanation*: Lack of additional functional groups means fewer sites for effective coordination with Fe ions.

  - *Supporting Data*:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - **Octanoic acid** (Entry 4)
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Entry 29) - presence of hydroxyl group may enhance coordination.

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been developed by thoroughly analyzing the dataset to identify patterns based on combinations of functional groups and structural features. The focus has been on:

- **Combining Multiple Substructures**: Emphasizing how different functional groups within the same molecule interact to influence Fe coordination.
- **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: Considering electron-donating and electron-withdrawing effects, Lewis acidity/basicity, steric factors, and molecular flexibility.
- **Predictive Clarity**: Each rule explicitly states whether modifiers fitting its description are expected to result in high or low Fe/Hf values.
- **Coverage**: Prioritizing rules that cover a broader range of the dataset while maintaining a balance between simplicity and complexity.

By applying these rules, chemists can predict the Fe/Hf outcome for new modifiers based on their structural features. This aids in the rational design of modifiers to optimize catalyst performance in the targeted radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. The rules serve as guidelines for selecting or synthesizing modifiers that enhance Fe incorporation into the catalyst, thereby improving the reaction yield.
