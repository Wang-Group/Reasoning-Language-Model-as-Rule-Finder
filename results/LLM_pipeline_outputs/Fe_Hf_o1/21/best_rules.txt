**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **straight-chain ω-amino acids**—aliphatic carboxylic acids with a **terminal primary amino group**—and a chain length of **five carbons or more** result in a **high Fe/Hf value**. The terminal amino and carboxylate groups can effectively chelate Fe ions due to their favorable spatial arrangement.

  - *High Fe/Hf Examples*: **3: 5-aminopentanoic acid**, **31: 7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **34: 8-aminooctanoic acid**, **33: (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
  - *Low Fe/Hf Examples*: **0: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (amino group is α to the carboxyl, not terminal), **4: 4-aminobenzoic acid** (aromatic ring alters coordination)

---

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **para-substituted benzoic acids** with **electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)** such as **nitro, bromomethyl, pyridyl, or ketone groups** result in a **high Fe/Hf value**. EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid and enhance Fe binding through stronger coordination via the carboxylate and adjacent substituents.

  - *High Fe/Hf Examples*: **1: 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**, **12: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**, **20: 4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **17: 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**, **25: 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**
  - *Low Fe/Hf Examples*: **22: 4-methylbenzoic acid** (electron-donating methyl group), **4: 4-aminobenzoic acid** (electron-donating amino group)

---

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing **sulfur functional groups**, such as **thiol (–SH)** or **thioether (–S–)** groups, along with a **carboxylic acid group**, result in a **high Fe/Hf value**. Sulfur atoms have a high affinity for Fe ions, forming strong coordinate bonds that enhance metal binding.

  - *High Fe/Hf Examples*: **10: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**, **18: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**, **23: 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]-4-methylsulfanylbutanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** containing **polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains** (ether linkages like **–OCH₂CH₂–**) and terminating with an **amino or methoxy group** result in a **high Fe/Hf value**. The multiple ether oxygens and terminal groups coordinate with Fe ions, and the flexible chain enhances solubility and accessibility.

  - *High Fe/Hf Examples*: **11: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, **32: 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic hydroxy acids** with a **terminal hydroxyl group** and a chain length of **seven carbons or more** result in a **high Fe/Hf value**. The distant hydroxyl and carboxylate groups can chelate Fe ions effectively due to the optimal spatial separation.

  - *High Fe/Hf Example*: **29: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
  - *Low Fe/Hf Example*: **7: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (shorter chain and presence of aromatic ring may hinder coordination)

---

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **simple aliphatic carboxylic acids** without additional coordinating functional groups result in a **low Fe/Hf value**. The absence of groups like hydroxyl, amino, or sulfur reduces their ability to effectively bind Fe ions.

  - *Low Fe/Hf Examples*: **5: octanoic acid**, **27: 4-oxoheptanedioic acid**, **28: 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing **multiple hydroxyl groups**, specifically **polyhydroxylated acids**, result in a **low Fe/Hf value**. The numerous hydroxyl groups may engage in intramolecular hydrogen bonding or solvation, reducing their availability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  - *Low Fe/Hf Examples*: **6: 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**, **9: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aromatic amino acids with bulky side chains**, such as the **indole group in tryptophan**, result in a **low Fe/Hf value**. Steric hindrance from the bulky side chain impedes effective coordination with Fe ions.

  - *Low Fe/Hf Example*: **15: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid**
  - *High Fe/Hf Exception*: **13: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine has a less bulky aromatic side chain, allowing coordination)

---

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs)** in the para position result in a **low Fe/Hf value**. EDGs like methyl, amino, or hydroxyl groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, reducing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  - *Low Fe/Hf Examples*: **22: 4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4: 4-aminobenzoic acid**, **30: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **perfluorinated alkyl chains** result in a **low Fe/Hf value**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms reduces electron density on potential coordinating atoms, hindering Fe coordination.

  - *Low Fe/Hf Example*: **14: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids** with the **carboxyl group directly attached to a nitrogen-containing ring** result in a **low Fe/Hf value**. The aromatic nitrogen may delocalize lone pair electrons, reducing availability for Fe coordination, or compete with the carboxylate for metal binding.

  - *Low Fe/Hf Examples*: **8: 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**, **16: 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**, **21: pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**

---

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids** with additional **carboxylate groups** (e.g., dicarboxylic amino acids) show differing Fe/Hf values based on chain length:

    - **Short-chain dicarboxylic amino acids** like **aspartic acid** result in a **high Fe/Hf value** due to favorable chelation geometry facilitating bidentate coordination.
      - *High Fe/Hf Example*: **2: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid)
    - **Longer-chain dicarboxylic amino acids** like **glutamic acid** result in a **low Fe/Hf value** as increased chain length introduces flexibility, reducing effective chelation.
      - *Low Fe/Hf Example*: **0: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid)

---

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers containing a **combination of aldehyde and phenolic hydroxyl groups** adjacent to each other result in a **low Fe/Hf value**. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding can occur between these groups, reducing their availability for coordinating with Fe ions.

  - *Low Fe/Hf Example*: **19: 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with **flexible aliphatic chains** containing **ether linkages** and terminating with an **amino group** result in a **high Fe/Hf value**. The ether oxygens and terminal amino group enhance coordination with Fe ions, and the chain flexibility allows for effective binding.

  - *High Fe/Hf Example*: **32: 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with **bulky substituents or steric hindrance** near the coordinating groups result in a **low Fe/Hf value**. Large groups adjacent to potential coordinating sites can obstruct Fe ion access, impeding complex formation.

  - *Low Fe/Hf Examples*: **15: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (bulky indole side chain), **26: 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (steric hindrance from aromatic ring)
