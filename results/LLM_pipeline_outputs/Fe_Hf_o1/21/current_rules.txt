**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **ω-amino aliphatic carboxylic acids**—straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal **primary amino group** at the end opposite the carboxylic acid—result in a **high Fe/Hf value**. The amino and carboxylate groups can chelate Fe ions effectively by forming stable five- or six-membered rings.

  - *High Fe/Hf Examples*:
    - **3**: **5-aminopentanoic acid**
    - **31**: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **34**: **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  - *Low Fe/Hf Counterexample*:
    - **0**: **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid; the amino group is not terminal and additional carboxyl groups may interfere with coordination)

---

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)** at the **para position** result in a **high Fe/Hf value**. EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing deprotonation and increasing negative charge density on the carboxylate oxygen atoms, which strengthens coordination with Fe ions.

  - *High Fe/Hf Examples*:
    - **1**: **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
    - **10**: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**
    - **12**: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
    - **20**: **4-nitrobenzoic acid**

  - *Low Fe/Hf Counterexamples*:
    - **4**: **4-aminobenzoic acid** (amino group is an electron-donating group (EDG), which reduces acidity)
    - **22**: **4-methylbenzoic acid** (methyl group is an EDG)

---

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-donating groups (EDGs)** such as **amino**, **hydroxy**, or **methoxy** groups at the **para position** result in a **low Fe/Hf value**. EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, reducing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions due to decreased negative charge on the carboxylate oxygen atoms.

  - *Low Fe/Hf Examples*:
    - **4**: **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **7**: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - **26**: **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**
    - **30**: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers containing **sulfur functional groups**, such as **thiols** or **thioethers**, result in a **high Fe/Hf value**. Sulfur atoms have lone pairs that coordinate strongly with Fe ions, enhancing metal-ligand interactions through soft acid-soft base interactions.

  - *High Fe/Hf Examples*:
    - **10**: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**
    - **18**: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
    - **23**: **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-(methylsulfanyl)butanoyl]amino]-4-(methylsulfanyl)butanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that have **nitrogen-containing heterocyclic rings** (e.g., **pyridine**) attached to a carboxylic acid result in a **high Fe/Hf value**. The nitrogen lone pair can coordinate with Fe ions, enhancing metal-ligand interactions.

  - *High Fe/Hf Examples*:
    - **12**: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
    - **24**: **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**

  - *Low Fe/Hf Counterexamples*:
    - **21**: **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid; the carboxylate is directly on the pyridine ring at a position that may hinder effective coordination)

---

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxylated aliphatic acids** (containing multiple hydroxyl groups) result in a **low Fe/Hf value**. The numerous hydroxyl groups increase hydrophilicity and may preferentially interact with solvent molecules rather than coordinate with Fe ions.

  - *Low Fe/Hf Examples*:
    - **6**: **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**
    - **9**: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid)

---

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional strong coordinating functional groups** result in a **low Fe/Hf value**. The absence of extra donor atoms limits their ability to form multiple coordination bonds with Fe ions.

  - *Low Fe/Hf Examples*:
    - **5**: **octanoic acid**
    - **14**: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (fluorination does not enhance coordination)

---

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids** with side chains capable of coordinating with Fe ions result in a **high Fe/Hf value**. The amino and carboxylate groups enable effective chelation of Fe ions.

  - *High Fe/Hf Examples*:
    - **2**: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid)
    - **13**: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine)
    - **33**: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (modified lysine)

  - *Low Fe/Hf Counterexamples*:
    - **0**: **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid; longer side chain may reduce effective chelation)
    - **15**: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan; bulky indole side chain causes steric hindrance)

---

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages** in the chain and terminal functional groups capable of coordination (e.g., amino or additional carboxyl groups) result in a **high Fe/Hf value**. The ether oxygen atoms can coordinate with Fe ions, and the flexible chain allows for effective chelation.

  - *High Fe/Hf Examples*:
    - **11**: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **32**: **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic hydroxy acids** with a **terminal hydroxyl group** result in a **high Fe/Hf value**. The hydroxyl and carboxylate groups at opposite ends provide multiple coordination sites for Fe ions, forming stable chelate structures.

  - *High Fe/Hf Example*:
    - **29**: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

  - *Low Fe/Hf Counterexample*:
    - **7**: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (hydroxy group is on an aromatic ring and chain is shorter)

---

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **dicarboxylic acids** where the carboxyl groups are positioned such that they do not favor chelation (e.g., too close or too far apart) result in a **low Fe/Hf value**. Unfavorable geometry hinders effective coordination with Fe ions.

  - *Low Fe/Hf Examples*:
    - **0**: **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid)
    - **27**: **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

---

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **ortho-hydroxyl** or **ortho-carbonyl** groups that may form intramolecular hydrogen bonds result in a **low Fe/Hf value**. These intramolecular interactions reduce the availability of donor atoms for coordination with Fe ions.

  - *Low Fe/Hf Example*:
    - **19**: **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **bulky or highly fluorinated aliphatic chains** result in a **low Fe/Hf value** due to steric hindrance and the electron-withdrawing nature of fluorine atoms, which can reduce the coordination ability of the carboxylate group.

  - *Low Fe/Hf Example*:
    - **14**: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

**End of Rules**

---

These rules provide a structured understanding of how specific structural features and functional groups in molecular modifiers influence the **Fe/Hf ratio** by affecting their ability to coordinate with Fe ions. The rules are based on fundamental chemical principles, such as:

1. **Coordination Chemistry**: Functional groups like amino, thiol, and ether groups can coordinate with metal ions. The presence and position of these groups are crucial for effective metal-ligand interactions.

2. **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of carboxylic acids, enhancing their ability to donate electrons to metal ions. Electron-donating groups have the opposite effect.

3. **Steric Factors**: Bulky groups can hinder coordination due to steric hindrance, reducing the likelihood of effective metal-ligand interactions.

4. **Chelation**: Molecules that can form stable chelate rings with metal ions (e.g., five- or six-membered rings) have a higher tendency to increase the Fe/Hf ratio.

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a given molecular modifier is likely to result in a **high** or **low Fe/Hf value**, aiding in the design and optimization of catalysts for the target radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------
