  - *Chemical Explanation*: Ether oxygen atoms, along with amino groups, can coordinate with Fe ions, forming multidentate ligands that stabilize the metal within the catalyst framework.
  - *Examples*: 
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid *(Entry 32)*
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid *(Entry 11)*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with non-polar or aromatic side chains influence Fe/Hf values based on steric and electronic factors. Amino acids with simple aromatic side chains tend to result in high Fe/Hf values, whereas bulky or heteroaromatic side chains may result in low Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Simple aromatic rings can facilitate π–π interactions and provide additional coordination sites. Bulky side chains or heteroatoms may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorable electronic effects that impede effective Fe coordination.
  - *Examples*: 
    - **High Fe/Hf**: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid *(Entry 13)*
    - **Low Fe/Hf**: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid *(Entry 15)*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing carbonyl groups adjacent to aromatic rings or additional chelating groups can have variable effects on Fe/Hf values, with the overall structure and electronic context determining the outcome.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Carbonyl groups can coordinate with Fe ions, but their efficacy depends on their electronic environment and the presence of other functional groups that may enhance or hinder coordination.
  - *Examples*:
    - **High Fe/Hf**: 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid *(Entry 17)* (contains chelating sites that can stabilize Fe)
    - **Low Fe/Hf**: 4-formylbenzoic acid *(Entry 20)* (the formyl group may not effectively contribute to Fe coordination due to lack of additional coordination sites and possible steric factors)

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Revised Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing both carboxylic acid groups and terminal primary amino groups on linear aliphatic chains of five or more carbons tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: The carboxylate and amino groups act as bidentate ligands, coordinating with Fe ions to form stable chelate complexes. The extended carbon chain allows for optimal spatial arrangement and flexibility, enhancing metal-ligand interactions.

  - *Examples*:
    - 5-aminopentanoic acid *(Entry 3)*
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid *(Entry 31)*
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid *(Entry 34)*
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid *(Entry 33)*

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers containing sulfur-functional groups such as sulfhydryl (–SH) or thioether (–S–R) groups, especially when combined with carboxylic acid groups, tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Sulfur atoms, being soft Lewis bases with available lone pairs, can form strong coordinate covalent bonds with Fe ions (a soft Lewis acid). This enhances Fe incorporation through stable metal-sulfur complexes.

  - *Examples*:
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid *(Entry 10)*
    - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid *(Entry 18)*
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]-4-methylsulfanylbutanoic acid *(Entry 23)*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) such as nitro (–NO₂) or halogens (e.g., –Br) directly attached to an aromatic ring at the para position relative to a carboxyl group tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid by stabilizing the negative charge on the carboxylate anion. Enhanced deprotonation facilitates stronger coordination with Fe ions.

  - *Examples*:
    - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid *(Entry 1)*
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid *(Entry 21)*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing aromatic rings with electron-donating groups (EDGs) such as amino (–NH₂) or hydroxy (–OH) groups directly attached to the ring tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, making it less likely to deprotonate and coordinate effectively with Fe ions. Additionally, these groups can engage in hydrogen bonding or steric interactions that hinder metal coordination.

  - *Examples*:
    - 4-aminobenzoic acid *(Entry 4)*
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid *(Entry 7)*
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid *(Entry 30)*
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid *(Entry 26)*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**, whereas introducing polar groups like amino (–NH₂) or hydroxyl (–OH) at appropriate positions can increase Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Simple aliphatic acids offer limited coordination sites (primarily the carboxylate). Introducing polar functional groups increases the number of potential binding sites for Fe ions, enhancing coordination.

  - *Examples*:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - Octanoic acid *(Entry 5)*
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid *(Entry 29)*
      - 7-aminoheptanoic acid *(Entry 31)*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen-containing heterocycles separated by a linker (an aliphatic chain or another aromatic ring) from the carboxyl group tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**, while those directly attached to the carboxyl group tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: A linker reduces steric hindrance and electronic repulsion, allowing better spatial orientation for coordination. Direct attachment may impede Fe coordination due to unfavorable interactions.

  - *Examples*:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid *(Entry 12)*
      - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid *(Entry 24)*
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid *(Entry 22)*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (polyols) on aliphatic chains or sugar acid derivatives tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Multiple hydroxyl groups can engage in internal hydrogen bonding or compete with carboxylate groups for coordination with Fe ions. This reduces the availability and effectiveness of coordination sites for Fe incorporation.

  - *Examples*:
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid *(Entry 9)*
    - 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid *(Entry 6)*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with simple aromatic side chains tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**, whereas those with bulky or heteroaromatic side chains may result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to steric hindrance.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Simple aromatic side chains can facilitate π–π interactions without significantly hindering the accessibility of the amino and carboxylate groups for metal coordination. Bulky or heteroaromatic side chains can block these sites.

  - *Examples*:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid *(Entry 13)*
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid *(Entry 15)*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing ether linkages (–O–), especially when combined with amino groups, tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Ether oxygen atoms and amino groups can both coordinate with Fe ions. The combination creates multidentate ligands that enhance metal-ligand stability and increase Fe incorporation.

  - *Examples*:
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid *(Entry 32)*
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid *(Entry 11)*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing adjacent chelating groups, such as hydroxyl and carbonyl groups in ortho positions on aromatic rings, can enhance Fe/Hf values by forming stable chelate complexes with Fe ions, resulting in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Chelating ligands form ring structures upon coordinating with a metal ion, which increases the stability of the complex due to the chelate effect. This promotes greater Fe incorporation.

  - *Examples*:
    - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid *(Entry 17)*
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid *(Entry 8)*

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde groups adjacent to carboxylic acids on aromatic rings tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to potential steric hindrance and lack of additional coordination sites.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Aldehyde groups may not effectively participate in metal coordination and can introduce steric bulk near the carboxylate, hindering its ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  - *Examples*:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid *(Entry 20)*
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid *(Entry 19)*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated aliphatic chains tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms, which decreases the basicity of coordinating atoms.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Fluorine's high electronegativity withdraws electron density from potential coordinating sites (like oxygen), reducing their ability to donate electrons to Fe ions for coordination.

  - *Example*:
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid *(Entry 14)*

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are diketone acids or contain keto groups conjugated with carboxylic acids tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values** unless additional chelating groups are present to stabilize Fe coordination.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Keto groups adjacent to carboxylic acids can lead to resonance stabilization of the carboxylate, reducing its availability for coordination. Without additional chelating sites, Fe incorporation is less favorable.

  - *Examples*:
    - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid *(Entry 27)* (Low Fe/Hf)
    - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid *(Entry 25)* (High Fe/Hf due to methoxy groups donating electron density)

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with both amino and hydroxyl groups on the same aliphatic chain tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values** due to the increased number of coordination sites.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: The presence of both amino and hydroxyl groups provides multiple sites for Fe coordination, enhancing the formation of stable complexes.

  - *Example*:
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid *(Entry 0)*

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing cyclic nitrogen heterocycles without additional coordinating groups tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to limited coordination capability.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Nitrogen in aromatic heterocycles (like pyrazole) may not be sufficiently basic or accessible to effectively coordinate with Fe ions, especially without additional coordinating groups.

  - *Example*:
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid *(Entry 16)*

---

**End of Revised Rules**

---

These revised rules have been crafted to:

- **Combine multiple substructures**: Each rule considers combinations of functional groups (e.g., amino and carboxyl groups, sulfur groups with carboxylic acids).

- **Reflect underlying physicochemical properties**: The chemical explanations provide insights into how electronic effects, coordination chemistry, and steric factors influence Fe/Hf values.

- **Provide clear predictions**: Each rule specifies whether modifiers fitting the description tend to result in high or low Fe/Hf values.

- **Balance coverage and complexity**: The rules range from broad (e.g., the impact of electron-withdrawing groups on aromatic rings) to specific (e.g., the effect of perfluorinated chains), covering a wide spectrum of the dataset.

- **Abandon ineffective rules**: By refining and reorganizing the rules, we have ensured they are relevant and based on sound chemical reasoning, discarding any that were less predictive or redundant.

These rules serve as a predictive framework for assessing new molecular modifiers based on their structural features, aiding in the optimization and control of Fe/Hf values in the catalyst system.

Rule Generator Message:
After thoroughly analyzing the dataset and applying chemical insights, I have generated the following rules that describe the relationship between molecular modifiers and the relative high or low Fe/Hf values. These rules combine multiple sub-structures (functional groups) and reflect the underlying physicochemical properties influencing the Fe/Hf ratio. They aim to predict whether the target value is high or low for any modifier fitting the descriptions.

  - *Examples*:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** *(Entry 4)*
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** *(Entry 7)*
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** *(Entry 30)*
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** *(Entry 26)*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**; introducing polar groups like amino (–NH₂) or hydroxy (–OH) at appropriate positions can increase Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Simple aliphatic acids have limited coordination sites (primarily the carboxylate group). Introducing polar functional groups provides additional coordination sites for Fe ions, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and increasing Fe incorporation.

  - *Examples*:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - **Octanoic acid** *(Entry 5)*
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(Entry 29)*
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(Entry 31)*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles separated by a linker (an aliphatic chain or aromatic ring) from the carboxyl group tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**, while those where the heterocycle is directly attached to the carboxyl group tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: A linker reduces steric hindrance and allows for better spatial orientation of the coordinating sites, facilitating Fe ion coordination. Direct attachment may cause steric and electronic factors that hinder effective metal coordination.

  - *Examples*:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - **4-(pyridin-4-yl)benzoic acid** *(Entry 12)*
      - **4-(pyridin-4-yl)butanoic acid** *(Entry 24)*
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(Entry 22)*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (polyols) on aliphatic chains or sugar acid derivatives tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Multiple hydroxyl groups can form intermolecular or intramolecular hydrogen bonds, reducing the availability of these groups and the carboxylate for coordination with Fe ions. This competition decreases Fe incorporation.

  - *Examples*:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(Entry 9)*
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** *(Entry 6)*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with simple aromatic side chains tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**, whereas those with bulky or heteroaromatic side chains may result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to steric hindrance.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Simple aromatic side chains can participate in π–π interactions without significantly obstructing the amino and carboxylate groups necessary for metal coordination. Bulky side chains may hinder access to these coordinating sites.

  - *Examples*:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(Entry 13)*
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(Entry 15)*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing ether linkages (–O–) along with carboxylic acid and amino groups tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values** due to increased flexibility and multiple coordination sites.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Ether oxygen atoms and amino groups provide additional lone pairs for coordination with Fe ions. The ether linkage offers flexibility, allowing optimal positioning for metal-ligand interactions.

  - *Examples*:
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** *(Entry 32)*
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(Entry 11)*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing adjacent chelating groups, such as hydroxyl and carbonyl groups in close proximity on aromatic rings, tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values** by forming stable chelate complexes with Fe ions.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Chelating ligands form ring structures upon coordination, which increases the stability of the metal complex through the chelate effect. This promotes greater Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

  - *Examples*:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** *(Entry 17)*
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** *(Entry 8)*

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with aldehyde groups adjacent to carboxylic acids on aromatic rings tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to potential steric hindrance and reduced coordination capability.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Aldehyde groups can introduce steric bulk near the carboxylate group. Additionally, aldehyde oxygen is less likely to coordinate with Fe ions compared to hydroxyl or amino groups, limiting effective coordination.

  - *Examples*:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(Entry 20)*
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** *(Entry 19)*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated aliphatic chains tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms, which decreases the coordinating ability of the carboxylate group.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: The presence of highly electronegative fluorine atoms withdraws electron density, reducing the basicity and donor strength of the carboxylate oxygen atoms, thus hindering Fe coordination.

  - *Example*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(Entry 14)*

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are diketone acids or contain conjugated keto and carboxylic acid groups tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values** unless additional coordinating groups are present.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Keto groups adjacent to carboxyl groups can delocalize electron density through resonance, reducing the availability of lone pairs for Fe coordination. Without other coordinating groups, Fe incorporation is minimized.

  - *Examples*:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** *(Entry 27)*
    - **High Fe/Hf** (due to additional EDGs enhancing coordination):
      - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** *(Entry 25)*

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing both amino and hydroxyl groups on the same aliphatic chain tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values** due to increased coordination sites and potential chelation.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: The combination of amino and hydroxyl groups allows for multiple coordination points with Fe ions, forming stable chelate complexes and enhancing Fe incorporation.

  - *Example*:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(Entry 0)*

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing small nitrogen heterocycles without additional coordinating groups tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to limited coordination ability and potential steric hindrance.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Nitrogen atoms in small heterocycles (e.g., pyrazole) may not effectively coordinate with Fe ions due to steric constraints and reduced basicity compared to amino groups. Lack of other coordinating sites diminishes Fe incorporation.

  - *Example*:
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** *(Entry 16)*

Rule Generator Message:
After reviewing the current rules, I have identified some that can be improved or replaced due to potential reasoning errors or inconsistencies with chemical principles. Below is a list of these rules along with brief explanations.

---

**Rules to be Discarded or Revised:**

1. **Rule 11**:

   - **Reason for Revision**: The original rule attributes low Fe/Hf values to steric hindrance caused by aldehyde groups adjacent to carboxylic acids on aromatic rings. However, aldehyde groups are generally not large enough to cause significant steric hindrance. The electron-withdrawing nature of the aldehyde group can actually increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, potentially enhancing coordination with Fe ions. The low Fe/Hf values may be due to other factors such as electronic effects reducing the donor ability of the carboxylate oxygen.

2. **Rule 15**:

   - **Reason for Revision**: The original rule suggests that small nitrogen heterocycles without additional coordinating groups result in low Fe/Hf values due to limited coordination ability and steric hindrance. However, nitrogen heterocycles can act as effective ligands through the lone pair on the nitrogen atom. The observed low Fe/Hf values may arise from other factors, such as the positioning of coordinating groups or electronic effects.

---

Based on these insights, I have revised the rules and generated new ones to better reflect the relationship between molecular modifiers and Fe/Hf values.

---

**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing both carboxylic acid groups and terminal primary amino groups on linear aliphatic chains of five or more carbons tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: The combination of amino and carboxylate groups allows for bidentate chelation with Fe ions. The flexible aliphatic chain facilitates optimal spatial arrangement for effective metal-ligand interactions.

    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** *(Entry 1)*
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(Entry 21)*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing aromatic rings with strong electron-donating groups (EDGs) such as amino (–NH₂) or hydroxy (–OH) groups directly attached to the ring tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid by destabilizing the carboxylate anion, reducing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  - *Examples*:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** *(Entry 4)*
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** *(Entry 7)*
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** *(Entry 30)*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (polyols) on aliphatic chains or sugar acid derivatives tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Multiple hydroxyl groups can form hydrogen bonds, reducing the availability of these groups and the carboxylate for coordination with Fe ions.

  - *Examples*:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(Entry 9)*
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** *(Entry 6)*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with simple aromatic side chains tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**, whereas those with bulky or heteroaromatic side chains may result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to steric hindrance.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Simple aromatic side chains allow effective metal coordination without significant steric obstruction. Bulky side chains may hinder access to coordinating sites.

  - *Examples*:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(Entry 13)*
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(Entry 15)*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing ether linkages (–O–) along with carboxylic acid and amino groups tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values** due to increased flexibility and multiple coordination sites.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Ether oxygen atoms and amino groups provide additional lone pairs for coordination with Fe ions. The flexibility allows optimal positioning for metal-ligand interactions.

  - *Examples*:
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** *(Entry 32)*
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(Entry 11)*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing adjacent chelating groups, such as hydroxyl and carbonyl groups in close proximity on aromatic rings, tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values** by forming stable chelate complexes with Fe ions.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Chelating ligands form ring structures upon coordination, increasing the stability of the metal complex through the chelate effect.

  - *Examples*:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** *(Entry 17)*
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** *(Entry 8)*

---

- **Revised Rule 11**: **Modifiers with electron-deficient aromatic rings containing electron-withdrawing substituents adjacent to carboxylic acid groups tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to reduced electron density on coordinating atoms.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Strong electron-withdrawing groups can decrease the donor ability of the carboxylate oxygen, weakening coordination with Fe ions.

  - *Examples*:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(Entry 20)*
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** *(Entry 19)*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated aliphatic chains tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms, which decreases the coordinating ability of the carboxylate group.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Fluorine atoms withdraw electron density, reducing the basicity and donor strength of the carboxylate oxygen atoms, hindering Fe coordination.

  - *Example*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(Entry 14)*

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with keto and carboxylic acid groups separated by a short aliphatic chain tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values** unless additional coordinating groups are present.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: The keto group may engage in resonance with the carboxyl group, delocalizing electron density and reducing coordination with Fe ions.

  - *Examples*:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** *(Entry 27)*
    - **High Fe/Hf** (due to additional coordinating groups):

  - *Chemical Explanation*: The combination provides multiple coordination points for Fe ions, forming stable chelate complexes.

  - *Example*:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(Entry 0)*

---

- **Revised Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing small nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to carboxylic acid groups may result in **variable Fe/Hf values** depending on the electronic properties of the heterocycle.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Nitrogen heterocycles can coordinate with Fe ions through nitrogen lone pairs. However, factors such as ring electron density and substituents influence their coordinating ability.

  - *Examples*:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** *(Entry 16)*
    - **Note**: Despite potential coordination through the nitrogen atom, the overall effect depends on the specific structure.

---

**End of Rules**

---

**Notes:**

- **Adjustments Made**: Rules 11 and 15 were revised to correct reasoning errors and to provide more accurate explanations based on chemical principles.

- **Broad Coverage**: The rules aim to cover a wide range of modifiers by balancing simple, high-coverage rules with more complex, specific ones.

    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** *(Entry 26)*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**; introducing polar groups like amino (–NH₂) or hydroxy (–OH) can increase Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Simple aliphatic acids have limited coordination sites. Adding polar functional groups provides additional coordination points for Fe ions, enhancing metal-ligand interactions.

  - *Examples*:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - **Octanoic acid** *(Entry 5)*
    - **High Fe/Hf**:

    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(Entry 9)*
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** *(Entry 6)*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with simple aromatic side chains tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**, whereas those with bulky or heteroaromatic side chains may result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to steric hindrance.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Simple aromatic side chains allow effective metal coordination without significant steric obstruction. Bulky side chains may hinder access to coordinating sites.

  - *Examples*:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(Entry 13)*
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(Entry 15)*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing ether linkages (–O–) along with carboxylic acid and amino groups tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values** due to increased flexibility and multiple coordination sites.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Ether oxygen atoms and amino groups provide additional lone pairs for coordination with Fe ions. The flexibility allows optimal positioning for metal-ligand interactions.

  - *Examples*:
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** *(Entry 32)*
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(Entry 11)*

---

  - *Example*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(Entry 14)*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with keto and carboxylic acid groups separated by a short aliphatic chain tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values** unless additional coordinating groups are present.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: The keto group may engage in resonance with the carboxyl group, delocalizing electron density and reducing coordination with Fe ions.

  - *Examples*:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** *(Entry 27)*
    - **High Fe/Hf** (due to additional coordinating groups):
      - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** *(Entry 25)*

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing both amino and hydroxyl groups on the same aliphatic chain tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values** due to increased coordination sites and potential chelation.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: The combination provides multiple coordination points for Fe ions, forming stable chelate complexes.

  - *Example*:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(Entry 0)*

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing adjacent chelating groups, such as hydroxyl and carbonyl groups in close proximity on aromatic rings, tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values** by forming stable chelate complexes with Fe ions.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Chelating ligands form ring structures upon coordination, increasing the stability of the metal complex through the chelate effect.

  - *Examples*:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** *(Entry 17)*
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** *(Entry 8)*

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing small nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to carboxylic acid groups may result in **variable Fe/Hf values** depending on the electronic properties of the heterocycle.**

  - *Chemical Explanation*: Nitrogen heterocycles can coordinate with Fe ions through nitrogen lone pairs. However, factors such as ring electron density and substituents influence their coordinating ability.

  - *Examples*:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** *(Entry 16)*
    - **Variable Fe/Hf**:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(Entry 22)*

---

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: The first several rules (Rules 1-9) are generally well-formulated. They are clear, provide adequate chemical insights, consider combinations of substructures, and have sufficient data support with at least two examples each. These rules effectively balance complexity and coverage, aiding in the prediction of Fe/Hf values based on modifier structures.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 10 lacks clarity and seems to conflict with Rule 3. Both rules address modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups, but they predict opposite effects on Fe/Hf values. Rule 3 suggests that strong electron-withdrawing groups increase Fe/Hf values, while Rule 10 claims they decrease Fe/Hf values when adjacent to the carboxylic acid group. This contradiction needs resolution for the rules to be reliable.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 11 is based on a single data point (Entry 14), which is insufficient for establishing a robust rule. The low coverage undermines its reliability. To strengthen this rule, additional data supporting the influence of perfluorinated chains on Fe/Hf values are necessary.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 13 appears to contradict the provided data. The example given, (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Entry 0), is reported to have a low Fe/Hf value, whereas the rule states that such modifiers should result in high Fe/Hf values. This inconsistency indicates a need to re-evaluate or clarify the rule.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 14 lacks sufficient data support and clarity. One example (Entry 17) supports a high Fe/Hf value, while the other (Entry 8) does not. The rule's prediction is inconsistent with the data, and the complexity may not be justified given the limited coverage.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 15 is vague, stating that modifiers with small nitrogen heterocycles may result in variable Fe/Hf values depending on electronic properties. Without specific criteria or sufficient examples (only one or two data points), the rule lacks predictive utility and clarity, limiting its usefulness.

- **Comment 7**: Overall, while many of the rules are solid, the set could be improved by revising or removing rules that have contradictions, insufficient data support, or lack clarity. Focusing on rules with strong data backing and clear predictive power will enhance the reliability and practical application of the rules in designing new modifiers.

Rule Generator Message:
**Analysis and Generation of Rules:**

Based on the dataset provided and using chemical insights, I have analyzed the relationships between the molecular modifiers and the Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value. Below are the generated rules that describe these relationships.

---

**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing primary amino groups attached to aliphatic chains with carboxylic acid groups tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Primary amino groups can coordinate with Fe ions through lone pair electrons on nitrogen. When combined with carboxylic acid groups, these modifiers can act as bidentate ligands, enhancing metal coordination through chelation.

  - **Examples**:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid** *(Entry 3)*
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(Entry 31)*
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(Entry 34)*
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(Entry 33)*

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers containing sulfur functional groups, such as thiol (–SH) or thioether (–S–R) groups, especially when combined with carboxylic acid groups, tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Sulfur atoms have readily available lone pairs that can strongly coordinate with transition metals like Fe, forming stable complexes and enhancing Fe incorporation.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** *(Entry 10)*
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(Entry 18)*
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]-4-methylsulfanylbutanoic acid** *(Entry 23)*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) on aromatic rings, particularly at the para position relative to a carboxyl group, tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid by stabilizing the negative charge on the carboxylate anion. This enhances the ability of the carboxylate group to coordinate with Fe ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** *(Entry 1)*
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(Entry 21)*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with electron-donating groups (EDGs) on aromatic rings, such as amino (–NH₂) or hydroxy (–OH) groups, particularly at the para position relative to a carboxyl group, tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid by destabilizing the carboxylate anion. This reduces the carboxylate's ability to coordinate with Fe ions, leading to lower Fe incorporation.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** *(Entry 4)*
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** *(Entry 7)*
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** *(Entry 30)*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**; introducing coordinating groups like amino (–NH₂) or hydroxy (–OH) can increase Fe/Hf values.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Simple aliphatic acids have limited coordination sites. Adding functional groups with lone pairs (e.g., amino or hydroxy groups) provides additional coordination points for Fe ions, enhancing metal-ligand interactions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - **Octanoic acid** *(Entry 5)*
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(Entry 29)*
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(Entry 31)*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles separated by a linker (an aliphatic chain or aromatic ring) from the carboxyl group tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**; those where the heterocycle is directly attached may result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: A linker allows better spatial orientation of coordinating sites, facilitating Fe ion coordination. Direct attachment may hinder effective coordination due to steric hindrance or electronic factors.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(Entry 12)*
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** *(Entry 24)*
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(Entry 22)*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups (polyols) on aliphatic chains or sugar acid derivatives tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can form internal hydrogen bonds or engage in extensive solvation. They may also compete with carboxylate groups for metal coordination, reducing Fe incorporation.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(Entry 9)*
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** *(Entry 6)*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing ether linkages (–O–) along with carboxylic acid and amino groups tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values** due to increased flexibility and multiple coordination sites.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Ether oxygen atoms can act as coordination sites with lone pairs. The flexibility provided by ether linkages allows the molecule to adopt conformations that facilitate coordination with Fe ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(Entry 11)*
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** *(Entry 32)*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing sulfur-containing amino acids or dipeptides tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values** due to multiple coordination sites including sulfur and amino groups.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Sulfur and amino groups provide multiple coordination sites, enhancing Fe binding through chelation and multidentate interactions.

  - **Example**:
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]-4-methylsulfanylbutanoic acid** *(Entry 23)*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with bulky or sterically hindered aromatic side chains may result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to steric hindrance affecting Fe coordination.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Bulky side chains can interfere with the approach of Fe ions to coordination sites, reducing Fe incorporation.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(Entry 15)*
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** *(Entry 17)*

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing strong electron-withdrawing groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid group without additional coordinating sites tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to decreased electron density on coordinating atoms.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Strong EWGs can withdraw electron density from the carboxylate oxygen, decreasing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(Entry 20)*
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** *(Entry 19)*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated aliphatic chains tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to strong electron-withdrawing effects decreasing coordinating ability.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Fluorine atoms are highly electronegative and withdraw electron density from the carboxylate group, reducing its donor ability towards Fe ions.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(Entry 14)*

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing both amino and hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values** due to potential chelation and multiple coordination sites.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: The presence of both amino and hydroxyl groups allows for the formation of stable chelate rings with Fe ions, enhancing coordination.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(Entry 0)*

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxylic acid group, especially small rings like pyrazole, may result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to electronic and steric factors.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Direct attachment may lead to resonance delocalization or steric hindrance, reducing the effectiveness of coordination with Fe ions.

  - **Example**:
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** *(Entry 16)*

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are keto acids (containing both ketone and carboxylic acid functionalities) with separation between functional groups may result in **low Fe/Hf values** unless additional coordinating groups are present.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Keto groups can engage in tautomerism or resonance, which might affect the availability of coordination sites. Additional coordinating groups can counteract this effect.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** *(Entry 27)*
    - **High Fe/Hf** (with additional coordinating groups):
      - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** *(Entry 25)*

---

**End of Rules**

---

**Notes:**

- **Chemical Insights**: These rules are based on the presence of functional groups such as amino, hydroxyl, sulfur-containing groups, and heterocycles, as well as electronic effects from substituents that influence the ability of the modifiers to coordinate with Fe ions.

- **Balance of Coverage**: The rules cover a broad range of modifiers in the dataset, balancing between simple rules with higher coverage (e.g., presence of primary amino groups) and more complex rules with lower coverage (e.g., impact of bulky side chains).

- **Application**: Each rule provides criteria to predict whether a modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value, aiding in the selection or design of modifiers to control the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst system.

**Analysis and Generation of Rules:**

After carefully analyzing the dataset and considering the chemical properties of the modifiers, I have generated a set of rules that describe the relationship between molecular modifiers and the Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value. These rules aim to balance coverage and specificity, providing both broad and detailed insights into how different functional groups and structures influence the Fe/Hf ratio.

---

**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing primary amino groups attached to linear aliphatic carboxylic acids tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Primary amino groups can coordinate with Fe ions through lone pair electrons on nitrogen. When present on linear aliphatic chains with carboxylic acid groups, these modifiers can act as bidentate ligands, enhancing metal coordination through chelation.

    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 18)
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]-4-methylsulfanylbutanoic acid** (Entry 23)

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) on aromatic rings, particularly at the para position relative to a carboxyl group, tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid by stabilizing the negative charge on the carboxylate anion, enhancing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Entry 1)
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Entry 21)

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with electron-donating groups (EDGs) on aromatic rings, such as hydroxy (–OH) groups, particularly at the para position relative to a carboxyl group, tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid by destabilizing the carboxylate anion, reducing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Entry 4)
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Entry 7)
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30)
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Entry 26)

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**. Introducing coordinating groups like amino (–NH₂) or hydroxy (–OH) increases Fe/Hf values.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Simple aliphatic acids have limited coordination sites. Adding functional groups with lone pairs provides additional coordination points for Fe ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - **Octanoic acid** (Entry 5)
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Entry 31)
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Entry 29)

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles connected to the carboxyl group via a spacer tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**. If the heterocycle is directly attached, they tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: A spacer allows better alignment of coordinating sites, facilitating Fe coordination. Direct attachment may lead to steric hindrance or reduced flexibility.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Fe/Hf**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 12)
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** (Entry 24)
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Entry 22)

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups (polyols) on aliphatic chains or sugar acids tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can form internal hydrogen bonds or engage extensively with the solvent, reducing their ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Entry 9)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (Entry 6)

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing ether linkages (–O–) along with carboxylic acid and amino or hydroxy groups tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values** due to increased flexibility and multiple coordination sites.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Ether oxygen atoms can serve as additional coordination sites. The flexibility provided by ether linkages allows for better spatial accommodation of Fe ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 11)
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32)

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated chains tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to strong electron-withdrawing effects decreasing the coordinating ability of the carboxylate group.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Fluorine's high electronegativity pulls electron density away from the carboxylate oxygen, weakening its interaction with Fe ions.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Entry 14)

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing keto groups adjacent to carboxylic acid groups tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values** unless additional coordinating groups are present.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Keto groups can engage in resonance with the carboxyl group, which may delocalize electron density and reduce coordination ability.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Fe/Hf**:
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Entry 27)
    - **High Fe/Hf** (with additional coordinating groups):
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 19)

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to steric hindrance and less effective coordination.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Bulky aromatic side chains can hinder the approach of Fe ions to the coordination sites on the amino acid backbone.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Entry 13)
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Entry 15)

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing lactone or cyclic anhydride structures tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to decreased availability of coordinating sites.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: The formation of a lactone ring reduces the availability of carboxylate oxygen atoms for coordination with Fe ions.

  - **Example**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Entry 17)

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with strong electron-donating groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid group without additional coordinating sites tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Electron-donating groups reduce the positive character of the carboxylate carbon, diminishing its interaction with Fe ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 20)
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 8)

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing both amino and carboxylic acid groups on a short aliphatic chain (e.g., dicarboxylic amino acids) tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values** due to chelation through multiple coordination sites.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: The amino group and multiple carboxylate groups provide several coordination sites that can chelate Fe ions effectively.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Entry 0)
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Entry 2)

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with long aliphatic chains bearing functional groups at both ends (e.g., amino and acetamido groups) tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values** due to the potential to form macrochelates with Fe ions.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: The presence of functional groups at both ends allows the modifier to wrap around the Fe ion, forming stable complexes through multiple coordination points.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 33)

---

**End of Rules**

---

**Notes:**

- **Chemical Insights**: These rules are derived by examining the functional groups present in the modifiers and understanding their ability to coordinate with Fe ions. Functional groups such as amino, thiol, and ether linkages enhance Fe coordination, while bulky groups or strong electron-withdrawing/donating groups can hinder coordination.

- **Balance of Coverage**: The rules provide a mix of broad generalizations (e.g., presence of primary amino groups) and specific cases (e.g., modifiers with lactone structures), ensuring wide applicability across the dataset.

- **Predictive Utility**: Each rule is designed to predict the Fe/Hf value based on the structural features of the modifier. This can aid in the selection or design of new modifiers to achieve desired Fe/Hf ratios.

---

I hope these rules offer clear guidance on how different molecular modifiers influence the Fe/Hf ratio in your catalyst system. If you have any questions or need further clarification on any of the rules or their chemical explanations, please feel free to ask.

Rule Generator Message:
**Analysis and Generation of Rules:**

After analyzing the provided dataset and considering the chemical properties that influence the Fe/Hf ratio, I have generated a set of rules describing the relationship between molecular modifiers and the `Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value`. These rules focus on the presence of specific functional groups and their combinations, as well as the underlying physicochemical principles that affect metal coordination.

---

**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing a primary amino group (–NH₂) on a straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acid tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: The primary amino group can coordinate with Fe ions through its lone pair of electrons. When attached to a flexible aliphatic chain, it allows effective chelation, enhancing Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (Entry 3)
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Entry 31)
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Entry 34)

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers with sulfur-containing functional groups, such as thiols (–SH) or thioethers (–S–R), especially when combined with a carboxylic acid group, tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Sulfur atoms have a strong affinity for transition metals like Fe due to their lone pairs and larger atomic size, which enhances coordination and stabilizes the Fe ion in the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 18)
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Entry 10)

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs), such as nitro (–NO₂) or halogens, on an aromatic ring, particularly at the para position relative to a carboxylic acid group, tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid by stabilizing the negative charge on the carboxylate ion, enhancing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions. This increased electron-withdrawing effect facilitates better metal-ligand interactions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Entry 21)
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Entry 1)

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with nitrogen-containing heterocycles connected via a spacer to a carboxylic acid group tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles can serve as additional coordination sites. A spacer (aliphatic chain) provides flexibility, allowing the nitrogen atom and carboxylate group to simultaneously coordinate with Fe ions, enhancing metal binding.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** (Entry 24)
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 12)

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Without additional donor atoms or functional groups capable of coordinating with Fe, these modifiers provide limited interaction sites, resulting in lower Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **Octanoic acid** (Entry 5)

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing electron-donating groups (EDGs), such as amino (–NH₂) or hydroxy (–OH) groups, on an aromatic ring tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid by destabilizing the carboxylate ion, reducing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions. Additionally, these groups can engage in intramolecular hydrogen bonding, further decreasing coordination efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Entry 4)
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Entry 7)
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30)

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups (polyols), especially in sugar acids or aliphatic chains, tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can form extensive hydrogen bonding networks and may preferentially interact with solvent molecules rather than coordinate with Fe ions. This reduces the availability of coordination sites for Fe.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Entry 9)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (Entry 6)

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing ether linkages (–O–) combined with additional coordinating groups like amino (–NH₂) tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Ether oxygen atoms can act as coordination sites due to lone pairs. When combined with amino groups, these modifiers offer multiple coordination points, enhancing Fe binding through chelation and flexibility provided by ether linkages.

  - **Examples**:
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32)
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 11)

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to strong electron-withdrawing effects that reduce the donor ability of coordinating groups.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Fluorine atoms withdraw electron density from adjacent atoms, decreasing the nucleophilicity of the carboxylate oxygen and weakening its ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Entry 14)

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with small side chains, particularly those containing additional carboxyl groups (dicarboxylic amino acids), tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Such amino acids can act as multidentate ligands, coordinating with Fe ions through both amino and carboxylate groups, enhancing metal binding via chelation.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Entry 2)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Entry 0)

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with large or bulky aromatic side chains adjacent to coordinating groups tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to steric hindrance that impedes effective metal coordination.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Bulky groups can prevent the close approach of Fe ions to coordination sites, reducing the efficiency of Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Entry 13)
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Entry 15)

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing carbonyl groups (ketones or aldehydes) adjacent to carboxylic acid groups without additional coordinating groups tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Carbonyl groups can participate in resonance with the carboxylate group, delocalizing electron density and reducing the lone pair availability on oxygen atoms for coordination with Fe ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Entry 27)
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 20)

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with lactone or cyclic anhydride structures tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to limited availability of coordinating oxygen atoms.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Formation of cyclic esters (lactones) or anhydrides reduces free carboxylate groups, decreasing the number of coordination sites for Fe ions.

  - **Example**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Entry 17)

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing both amino and acetamido groups on a medium-length aliphatic chain tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values** due to multiple coordination sites enabling chelation.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: The presence of multiple nitrogen-containing functional groups along with carboxylate groups provides several potential coordination points for Fe ions, enhancing metal binding.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 33)

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with strong electron-donating groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid group but lacking additional coordinating sites tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Electron-donating groups decrease the positive character of the carboxyl carbon, reducing its ability to interact with Fe ions. Without other coordinating atoms, the overall metal binding is weakened.

  - **Examples**:
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 8)
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 19)

---

**End of Rules**

---

**Notes:**

- **Chemical Insights**: These rules are based on the coordination chemistry principles, considering how functional groups influence the ability of modifiers to bind Fe ions. Factors such as electron-donating/withdrawing effects, steric hindrance, and the presence of multiple coordination sites play significant roles.

- **Balance of Coverage**: The rules cover a broad spectrum of functional groups present in the dataset, providing both general trends and specific cases. This balance ensures that the rules are widely applicable while still offering detailed insights.

- **Predictive Utility**: Each rule is designed to help predict whether a new modifier with similar structural features would result in a high or low Fe/Hf value, aiding in the rational design of modifiers for optimal catalyst performance.

I hope these rules offer clear guidance on how different molecular modifiers influence the Fe/Hf ratio in your catalyst system. Feel free to reach out if you need further clarification or assistance.

Rule Generator Message:
**Analysis and Refinement of Rules:**

After reviewing the current set of rules and considering the underlying physicochemical properties, I have identified opportunities to improve and consolidate some rules for better clarity and coverage. The updated rules aim to provide a clear relationship between molecular modifiers' functional groups and the Fe/Hf ratio, adhering closely to the requirements.

---

**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing a primary amino group (–NH₂) attached to a straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acid tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: The primary amino group and carboxylate can act as bidentate ligands, forming strong chelation with Fe ions. The flexibility of the aliphatic chain enhances coordination efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (Entry 3)
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Entry 31)
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Entry 34)

These rules illustrate the relationship between the structural features of molecular modifiers and their influence on the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst. By considering the presence and position of functional groups such as amino, hydroxyl, thiol, and heterocyclic rings, as well as the length and flexibility of the molecular backbone, we can predict whether a modifier will lead to high or low Fe incorporation.

When designing new modifiers, applying these rules can aid in selecting functional groups that promote the desired Fe/Hf ratio, thus optimizing the catalyst's performance in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction of aliphatic alcohols.

These rules illustrate the relationship between the structural features of molecular modifiers and their influence on the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst. By combining multiple substructures, such as amino groups, thiol groups, ether linkages, and heterocycles, and considering their positions within the molecule, we can predict whether a modifier will lead to high or low Fe incorporation.

When designing new modifiers, applying these rules can aid in selecting functional groups that promote the desired Fe/Hf ratio, thus optimizing the catalyst's performance in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction of aliphatic alcohols.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: EWGs such as nitro (–NO₂) and bromomethyl (–CH₂Br) increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid and enhance the electron-withdrawing character of the ring. This promotes deprotonation and strengthens the carboxylate's ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Entry 21)
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Entry 1)

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing thiol groups (–SH), especially when combined with carboxylate groups, tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: EDGs such as amino (–NH₂) and hydroxy (–OH) groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid by donating electron density to the aromatic ring. This reduces the carboxylate's ability to coordinate with Fe ions, leading to lower Fe incorporation.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Entry 4)
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30)

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 20)
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Entry 27)

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with electron-rich heterocycles directly attached to the carboxylate tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to rigidity and potential coordination competition.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Direct attachment of heterocycles like pyridine or pyrazole may limit the flexibility required for effective coordination of both the heterocyclic nitrogen and the carboxylate oxygen. Additionally, electron-rich heterocycles may compete with the carboxylate for Fe coordination, reducing overall Fe incorporation.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Entry 22)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 16)

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing sulfur-containing amino acids or their derivatives tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

These rules illustrate the relationship between the structural features of molecular modifiers and their influence on the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst. By combining multiple substructures—such as amino groups, thiol groups, ether linkages, and heterocycles—and considering their positions, electronic effects, and steric factors, we can predict whether a modifier will lead to high or low Fe incorporation.

When designing new modifiers, applying these rules can aid in selecting functional groups that promote the desired Fe/Hf ratio, thereby optimizing the catalyst's performance in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction of aliphatic alcohols.

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic amino acids or amino carboxylic acids with a terminal primary amino group (–NH₂) and a carboxylate group, with carbon chains of 5 to 8 carbons, tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: The presence of both amino and carboxylate groups at opposite ends of a flexible aliphatic chain allows for effective bidentate coordination with Fe ions. This chelation enhances Fe incorporation into the catalyst by stabilizing the Fe ions within the structure.

  - **Examples**:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (Entry 3)
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Entry 31)
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Entry 34)

  - **Counterexample**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Entry 4) – The aromatic ring reduces flexibility, leading to **low Fe/Hf values**.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: EWGs like nitro (–NO₂) and bromomethyl (–CH₂Br) increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing deprotonation. This results in a more negatively charged carboxylate that can coordinate more effectively with Fe ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Entry 21)
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Entry 1)

  - **Counterexample**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Entry 4) – An electron-donating group (–NH₂) leads to **low Fe/Hf values**.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal hydroxy groups (–OH) tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: The hydroxy group introduces an additional coordination site. This increases the likelihood of Fe binding through chelation, enhancing Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Entry 29)

  - **Counterexample**:
    - **Octanoic acid** (Entry 5) – Lacks the hydroxy group, leading to **low Fe/Hf values**.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: EDGs like amino (–NH₂) and hydroxy (–OH) decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid by donating electron density to the aromatic ring. This reduces the negative charge on the carboxylate after deprotonation, weakening its ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Entry 4)
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Entry 7)
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30)

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with short side chains or additional coordinating groups (e.g., amino or hydroxy groups) tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**; those with bulky or rigid side chains tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Short side chains minimize steric hindrance, allowing the amino and carboxylate groups to coordinate effectively with Fe ions. Bulky or rigid side chains hinder this coordination due to steric effects or reduced flexibility.

  - **High Fe/Hf Examples**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)** (Entry 2)

  - **Low Fe/Hf Examples**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)** (Entry 0) – Longer side chain introduces steric hindrance.
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)** (Entry 15) – Bulky aromatic side chain reduces coordination efficiency.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains (polyhydroxy acids) tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups may engage in intramolecular hydrogen bonding or interact strongly with the solvent, decreasing their availability to coordinate with Fe ions. This reduces overall Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Entry 9)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (Entry 6)

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing perfluorinated alkyl chains tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Fluorine's high electronegativity withdraws electron density from coordinating groups like carboxylates, weakening their ability to bind Fe ions. Additionally, the strong C–F bonds and overall hydrophobicity may reduce effective interactions with Fe.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Entry 14)

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with heterocyclic aromatic rings containing nitrogen (e.g., pyridine) attached to carboxylate groups tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: The nitrogen atom in heterocyclic rings like pyridine can act as an additional coordination site. This dual binding through the nitrogen and carboxylate oxygen enhances Fe incorporation via chelation.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 12)
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** (Entry 24)

  - **Counterexample**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Entry 22) – Despite containing a pyridine ring, the position of the nitrogen relative to the carboxylate may hinder effective coordination, resulting in a **low Fe/Hf value**.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with ketone or aldehyde groups adjacent to the carboxylate tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Carbonyl groups adjacent to the carboxylate can delocalize electron density through resonance, reducing the negative charge on the carboxylate oxygen and weakening its ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 20)
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Entry 17)

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing flexible ether linkages and terminal amino groups tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Ether oxygen atoms and amino groups serve as donor sites for Fe coordination. The molecular flexibility provided by ether linkages allows the molecule to adopt conformations that facilitate simultaneous coordination to Fe ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32)
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 11)

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with long aliphatic chains containing only a carboxylate group tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: The absence of additional coordinating groups limits Fe binding to the carboxylate alone. Long hydrophobic chains may also decrease solubility in the reaction medium and introduce steric hindrance, reducing interaction with Fe ions.

  - **Example**:
    - **Octanoic acid** (Entry 5)

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic rings bearing methoxy groups conjugated to carboxylate groups tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Methoxy groups can donate electron density through resonance, potentially stabilizing Fe ions via pi-interactions and enhancing coordination with the carboxylate group.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (Entry 25)

  - **Note**: This rule is based on limited data and may require further validation.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing bulky or rigid structures, such as polycyclic aromatic compounds, tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to steric hindrance and reduced flexibility.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Bulky structures can impede the approach of coordinating groups to the Fe ion, reducing effective chelation.

  - **Example**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)** (Entry 15)

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with sulfur-containing amino acids or derivatives may result in **high Fe/Hf values** when the sulfur atom is positioned to coordinate effectively with Fe ions; however, results can be variable and are influenced by the overall molecular structure.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Sulfur atoms are good soft Lewis bases and can coordinate with Fe ions. The effectiveness depends on the sulfur's availability and the molecule's flexibility.

  - **Example**:
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (Entry 23) – **High Fe/Hf value**

  - **Counterexample**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 18) – Despite containing a thiol group, it results in a **low Fe/Hf value**, possibly due to steric factors or intermolecular interactions.

  - **Note**: Due to variability, this rule should be applied cautiously.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups on aromatic rings tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Hydroxyl groups on aromatic rings can form strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds or engage in π–π stacking interactions, reducing their availability to coordinate with Fe ions. Additionally, electron-donating effects decrease carboxylate acidity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 19)
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Entry 26)

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic amino acids with a terminal primary amino group (–NH₂) and a carboxylate group, possessing carbon chains of 5 to 8 carbons, tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: The flexible aliphatic chain allows the amino and carboxylate groups to effectively coordinate with Fe ions, forming stable chelate complexes. This bidentate interaction enhances Fe incorporation into the catalyst by stabilizing the Fe coordination environment.

  - **Examples**:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (Entry 3)
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Entry 31)
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Entry 34)
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 33)

  - **Counterexamples**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Entry 0) – The presence of two carboxylate groups may lead to less effective coordination due to rigidity or unfavorable binding geometry, resulting in a **low Fe/Hf value**.
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Entry 4) – The aromatic ring introduces rigidity, reducing flexibility for effective chelation, leading to a **low Fe/Hf value**.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: EWGs, such as nitro or bromo groups, increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid by stabilizing the negative charge on the carboxylate anion through resonance or inductive effects. This enhanced acidity facilitates deprotonation and improves the ability of the carboxylate to coordinate with Fe ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Entry 1)
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Entry 21)

  - **Counterexamples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 20) – Although an aldehyde is an EWG, it may engage in side reactions or reduce effective coordination, leading to a **low Fe/Hf value**.
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 8) – The positioning of the EWG may not favor coordination, resulting in a **low Fe/Hf value**.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: EDGs, such as amino or hydroxy groups, decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid by destabilizing the carboxylate anion. This reduced acidity hinders deprotonation and weakens the ability of the carboxylate to coordinate with Fe ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Entry 4)
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Entry 7)
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30)
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Entry 26)

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing heterocyclic aromatic rings with nitrogen atoms positioned to coordinate (e.g., pyridine rings at the 4-position relative to the carboxylate) tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocyclic rings can act as Lewis bases, providing additional coordination sites for Fe ions. When the nitrogen is positioned appropriately, it can participate in chelation alongside the carboxylate group, enhancing Fe incorporation.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 12)
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** (Entry 24)

  - **Counterexample**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Entry 22) – The nitrogen atom is adjacent to the carboxylate, potentially causing steric hindrance or unfavorable geometry, leading to a **low Fe/Hf value**.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal hydroxy groups (–OH) tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: The terminal hydroxy group introduces an additional coordination site. The flexibility of the aliphatic chain allows both the carboxylate and hydroxy groups to simultaneously coordinate with Fe ions, forming chelate rings that stabilize the Fe complex.

  - **Example**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Entry 29)

  - **Counterexample**:
    - **Octanoic acid** (Entry 5) – Lacks the hydroxy group and thus offers fewer coordination sites, resulting in a **low Fe/Hf value**.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with multiple coordinating functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxy, ether linkages) in flexible aliphatic chains tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Multiple coordinating groups increase the possibilities for chelation, enhancing the stability of the Fe complex. Ether linkages add flexibility, allowing coordinating groups to align favorably with Fe ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32)
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 11)
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Entry 2)

  - **Counterexample**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Entry 9) – Although it has multiple hydroxy groups, the rigidity from multiple hydroxylation may hinder effective coordination, leading to a **low Fe/Hf value**.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing sulfur atoms in functional groups such as thiol (–SH) or thioether (–S–) tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Sulfur is a soft Lewis base that can coordinate strongly with Fe ions. The presence of sulfur-containing groups enhances the overall coordination capacity of the modifier, facilitating Fe incorporation.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Entry 10)
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 18)
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (Entry 23)

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing perfluorinated alkyl chains tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Perfluorinated groups are highly electronegative and can withdraw electron density from coordinating groups, diminishing their ability to bind with Fe ions. Additionally, the hydrophobic nature of fluorinated chains may reduce solubility and interaction with the catalyst.

  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Entry 14)

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on rigid or bulky aliphatic chains tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can lead to intramolecular hydrogen bonding or increased hydrophilicity, which may interfere with coordination to Fe ions. Bulky structures can also introduce steric hindrance.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Entry 9)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (Entry 6)

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with bulky or rigid aromatic structures without additional coordinating groups tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to steric hindrance and limited coordination sites.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Rigid aromatic rings limit the flexibility required for effective coordination with Fe ions. Without additional coordinating groups, these modifiers cannot form strong interactions with Fe.

  - **Examples**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Entry 15)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 16)

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are dicarboxylic acids with adjacent carbonyl groups (e.g., α-keto diacids) tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: The presence of adjacent carbonyl groups may delocalize electron density away from the carboxylate oxygens, weakening their ability to coordinate with Fe ions. Additionally, these structures may adopt conformations unfavorable for chelation.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Entry 27)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Entry 0)

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy groups on the aromatic ring tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**, especially when additional coordinating groups are present.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Methoxy groups, while electron-donating, can participate in resonance, potentially enhancing the coordination ability of neighboring groups. In combination with other functional groups, they can facilitate Fe binding.

  - **Example**:
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (Entry 25)

  - **Counterexample**:
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 19) – Despite methoxy-like groups, the presence of aldehyde and hydroxy groups may interfere with coordination, leading to a **low Fe/Hf value**.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with aldehyde groups adjacent to carboxylic acids on aromatic rings tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Aldehyde groups are susceptible to oxidation and may engage in side reactions. They can also withdraw electron density from the carboxylate, reducing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 20)
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 19)

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing flexible ether linkages with terminal coordinating groups (e.g., amino or carboxylate) tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Ether linkages increase molecular flexibility, allowing terminal coordinating groups to effectively align and interact with Fe ions. This enhances the formation of stable complexes through chelation.

  - **Examples**:
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32)
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 11)

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with fused aromatic systems containing additional carbonyl groups may have varying effects, but certain structures can result in **high Fe/Hf values** when they facilitate coordination.**

  - **Chemical Explanation**: Fused rings with carbonyl groups can create unique electronic environments that, in some cases, enhance coordination with Fe ions. The overall molecular geometry and electron distribution play crucial roles.

  - **Example**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Entry 17)

  - **Note**: Due to the complexity of these structures, predictions may require case-by-case analysis.

These rules aim to illustrate the relationship between structural features of molecular modifiers and their impact on the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst. By focusing on combinations of functional groups, chain length, electronic effects, and molecular flexibility, we can predict whether a modifier will lead to **high** or **low Fe/Hf values**.

**Key Takeaways for Designing Modifiers**:

- **Enhanced Coordination**: Incorporate multiple coordinating groups (e.g., –NH₂, –OH, –SH) in flexible chains to promote chelation with Fe ions.

- **Electronic Effects**: Utilize strong EWGs to increase carboxylic acid acidity, enhancing Fe coordination.

- **Avoid Steric Hindrance**: Minimize bulky or rigid structures without additional coordinating sites, as they impede effective interaction with Fe ions.

- **Balance Hydrophilicity**: Be cautious with highly hydrophilic modifiers (e.g., multiple –OH groups) that may not coordinate well due to solvent interactions.

By applying these principles, researchers can tailor molecular modifiers to achieve desired Fe/Hf ratios, optimizing catalyst performance for remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reactions.
