**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are ω-amino carboxylic acids (amino acids with the amino group at the terminal position) having aliphatic chains of five or more carbons tend to have HIGH Fe/Hf values.**

  - **Combination of Sub-structures**: Presence of a terminal **amino group** and a **carboxylic acid group** at opposite ends of an **aliphatic chain with five or more carbons**.
  - **Explanation**: The amino and carboxyl groups act as bidentate ligands, effectively chelating Fe ions. Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility, allowing the coordinating groups to interact optimally with the Fe center, enhancing Fe incorporation into the catalyst.
  - **Predicts**: **High Fe/Hf**.
  - **Examples**:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (Entry 3)
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Entry 31)
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Entry 34)
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 33)
  - **Counterexample**:
    - **Octanoic acid** (Entry 5, lacks amino group) – **Low Fe/Hf**.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position tend to have HIGH Fe/Hf values.**

  - **Combination of Sub-structures**: An **aromatic ring** with a **carboxylic acid group** and a strong **electron-withdrawing group** (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl, thiol) at the **para position**.
  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing its ability to deprotonate and coordinate with Fe ions. This facilitates stronger metal-ligand interactions, leading to higher Fe incorporation.
  - **Predicts**: **High Fe/Hf**.
  - **Examples**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Entry 21)
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Entry 1)
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Entry 10)
  - **Counterexamples**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 23, methyl is electron-donating) – **Low Fe/Hf**.
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Entry 4, amino is electron-donating) – **Low Fe/Hf**.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing both sulfur-containing groups (thiol or thioether) and carboxylic acid groups tend to have HIGH Fe/Hf values.**

  - **Combination of Sub-structures**: Presence of **sulfur-containing functional groups** (–SH, –S–) along with a **carboxylic acid group**.
  - **Explanation**: Sulfur atoms are soft Lewis bases and can form strong coordination bonds with Fe ions. The combination of sulfur groups and carboxylates provides multiple coordination sites, enhancing Fe binding and incorporation into the catalyst.
  - **Predicts**: **High Fe/Hf**.
  - **Examples**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 18)
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Entry 10)
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (Entry 24)
  - **Counterexample**:
    - **Octanoic acid** (Entry 5, lacks sulfur groups) – **Low Fe/Hf**.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with pyridine rings adjacent to carboxylic acid groups tend to have HIGH Fe/Hf values.**

  - **Combination of Sub-structures**: **Pyridine ring** (a six-membered aromatic ring with a nitrogen atom) connected to a **carboxylic acid group**.
  - **Explanation**: The nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring can coordinate with Fe ions, acting as a strong ligand. This enhances Fe binding, leading to increased Fe incorporation into the catalyst.
  - **Predicts**: **High Fe/Hf**.
  - **Examples**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 12)
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** (Entry 25)
  - **Counterexample**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Entry 22, nitrogen position less favorable for coordination) – **Low Fe/Hf**.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains tend to have HIGH Fe/Hf values if the side chain does not cause steric hindrance.**

  - **Combination of Sub-structures**: **Amino acids** possessing **aromatic side chains** (e.g., phenyl ring) along with **amino** and **carboxylic acid groups**.
  - **Explanation**: The aromatic side chains can participate in π-interactions or coordinate with Fe ions. Combined with the amino and carboxyl groups, these modifiers offer multiple coordination sites, enhancing Fe incorporation. However, bulky aromatic rings can cause steric hindrance, reducing effectiveness.
  - **Predicts**: **High Fe/Hf**.
  - **Example**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Entry 13)
  - **Counterexample**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Entry 15, indole ring may cause steric hindrance) – **Low Fe/Hf**.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups tend to have LOW Fe/Hf values.**

  - **Combination of Sub-structures**: **Straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** lacking other functional groups such as amino, sulfur, or hydroxyl groups capable of coordinating with Fe ions.
  - **Explanation**: Without additional coordinating functionalities, these modifiers have limited interaction with Fe ions, resulting in lower Fe incorporation into the catalyst.
  - **Predicts**: **Low Fe/Hf**.
  - **Example**:
    - **Octanoic acid** (Entry 5)

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position tend to have LOW Fe/Hf values.**

  - **Combination of Sub-structures**: **Aromatic ring** with a **carboxylic acid group** and an **electron-donating substituent** (e.g., methyl, amino, hydroxy) at the **para position**.
  - **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions. This leads to weaker interactions with Fe, resulting in lower Fe incorporation.
  - **Predicts**: **Low Fe/Hf**.
  - **Examples**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 23)
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Entry 4)
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30)
  - **Counterexample**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Entry 21, electron-withdrawing group enhances coordination) – **High Fe/Hf**.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (polyols) on aliphatic chains without additional strong coordinating groups tend to have LOW Fe/Hf values.**

  - **Combination of Sub-structures**: **Aliphatic chains** featuring **multiple hydroxyl groups** and a **carboxylic acid group**, but lacking other strong coordinating functionalities.
  - **Explanation**: While hydroxyl groups can coordinate with metals, excessive hydroxylation can lead to strong hydrogen bonding with solvent molecules, reducing availability for metal coordination and thus decreasing Fe incorporation.
  - **Predicts**: **Low Fe/Hf**.
  - **Example**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Entry 9)

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with carboxylic acids attached to perfluorinated alkyl chains tend to have LOW Fe/Hf values.**

  - **Combination of Sub-structures**: **Carboxylic acid group** connected to a **perfluorinated alkyl chain** (e.g., –CF₃, –C₄F₉).
  - **Explanation**: Perfluorinated chains are highly electron-withdrawing but also highly hydrophobic, which may hinder effective interaction with Fe ions in a polar environment. This can reduce Fe binding and incorporation.
  - **Predicts**: **Low Fe/Hf**.
  - **Example**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Entry 14)

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal hydroxyl groups and sufficient chain length (six or more carbons) tend to have HIGH Fe/Hf values.**

  - **Combination of Sub-structures**: **Aliphatic chains** with a **carboxylic acid group** at one end and a **terminal hydroxyl group** at the other, with a chain length that provides flexibility.
  - **Explanation**: The terminal hydroxyl group can coordinate with Fe ions, and the flexibility of the longer chain allows both ends to interact with Fe simultaneously, enhancing Fe incorporation.
  - **Predicts**: **High Fe/Hf**.
  - **Example**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Entry 29)
  - **Counterexample**:
    - **Short-chain hydroxy acids** lacking sufficient flexibility – **Low Fe/Hf**.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing flexible ether linkages with terminal coordinating groups tend to have HIGH Fe/Hf values.**

  - **Combination of Sub-structures**: **Polyether chains** (–O–CH₂–CH₂–O–) terminated with **coordinating groups** such as **amino** or **carboxylic acid groups**.
  - **Explanation**: Ether oxygens can coordinate with metals, and the flexibility of the ether linkages allows the molecule to adopt conformations that facilitate effective coordination. Terminal groups provide additional binding sites for Fe ions, enhancing incorporation.
  - **Predicts**: **High Fe/Hf**.
  - **Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 11)
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32)
  - **Counterexample**:
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (Entry 6, lacks effective terminal coordinating groups) – **Low Fe/Hf**.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with adjacent carbonyl groups on aromatic rings, forming chelating sites, tend to have HIGH Fe/Hf values.**

  - **Combination of Sub-structures**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids** with additional **carbonyl groups** (e.g., keto groups) adjacent to the carboxyl group.
  - **Explanation**: Adjacent carbonyl groups can chelate Fe ions more effectively by providing multiple coordination sites in close proximity, enhancing Fe incorporation.
  - **Predicts**: **High Fe/Hf**.
  - **Example**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Entry 17)

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with small side chains (e.g., Asp, Glu analogs) tend to have HIGH Fe/Hf values due to minimal steric hindrance and effective coordination.**

  - **Combination of Sub-structures**: **α-Amino acids** with **small or acidic side chains** (e.g., additional carboxyl groups).
  - **Explanation**: The amino and carboxylate groups can chelate Fe ions effectively. Small side chains minimize steric hindrance, and additional carboxyl groups provide more coordination sites.
  - **Predicts**: **High Fe/Hf**.
  - **Examples**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Entry 2)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Entry 0)
  - **Counterexample**:
    - **Bulky amino acids with steric hindrance – Lower Fe/Hf values**.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with hydrophilic polyhydroxy groups that engage in excessive hydrogen bonding without providing effective coordination tend to have LOW Fe/Hf values.**

  - **Combination of Sub-structures**: **Multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups** (polyols) on aliphatic chains with a **carboxylic acid group**, but lacking other strong coordinating groups.
  - **Explanation**: Extensive hydrogen bonding with solvent molecules reduces the availability of hydroxyl groups for metal coordination, leading to lower Fe incorporation.
  - **Predicts**: **Low Fe/Hf**.
  - **Example**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Entry 9)

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that contain sterically hindered functional groups adjacent to coordinating sites tend to have LOW Fe/Hf values due to ineffective coordination caused by steric bulk.**

  - **Combination of Sub-structures**: **Bulky functional groups** (e.g., large aromatic rings or multiple adjacent substituents) near potential coordinating sites like amino or carboxyl groups.
  - **Explanation**: Steric hindrance can prevent effective interaction between coordinating groups and Fe ions. Even if coordinating groups are present, their spatial arrangement may impede Fe binding.
  - **Predicts**: **Low Fe/Hf**.
  - **Examples**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Entry 15)
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 33, acetamido group may cause some steric hindrance)

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been developed by analyzing the dataset and considering the underlying physicochemical properties that influence the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalysts. They focus on combinations of functional groups and structural features that enhance or diminish the ability of molecular modifiers to coordinate with Fe ions.

- **High Fe/Hf Predictors**:
  - **Multiple coordinating groups**: Amino, thiol, hydroxyl, pyridine nitrogen.
  - **Flexibility in the molecule**: Aliphatic chains that allow coordinating groups to interact effectively with Fe ions.
  - **Electron-withdrawing substituents**: Increase acidity and enhance coordination ability.
  - **Chelating ligands**: Structures that form strong complexes with Fe.
  - **Optimized steric environment**: Minimal hindrance near coordinating sites.

- **Low Fe/Hf Predictors**:
  - **Lack of coordinating groups**: Simple carboxylic acids without additional functional groups.
  - **Electron-donating substituents**: Decrease acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing coordination ability.
  - **Steric hindrance**: Bulky groups that prevent effective coordination.
  - **Hydrophobic groups**: Perfluorinated chains that hinder interaction with Fe ions.
  - **Excessive hydrogen bonding**: Multiple hydroxyls engaging in solvent interactions rather than metal coordination.

By applying these rules, researchers can predict whether a given molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low Fe/Hf value. This guidance aids in the selection and design of modifiers to optimize the catalyst's performance for the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------
