Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**:

  **Rule 1** is clear in stating that modifiers containing sulfur functional groups (thiols or thioethers) result in high Fe/Hf values. The physical-chemical insight is strong, explaining that sulfur acts as a soft Lewis base coordinating effectively with Fe³⁺ ions. While the rule focuses on a single functional group, it is significant due to sulfur's unique properties. The coverage is adequate with three supporting data points. The rule strikes a good balance between simplicity and effectiveness.

- **Comment 2**:

  **Rule 2** provides a clear distinction between aliphatic amino groups (resulting in high Fe/Hf values) and aromatic amino groups (resulting in low Fe/Hf values). The property insight is robust, discussing electron delocalization in aromatic systems reducing nitrogen's availability for coordination. The rule adds complexity by considering the position and environment of the amino group. Coverage is strong with multiple examples for both outcomes, achieving a good balance between detail and applicability.

- **Comment 3**:

  **Rule 3** clearly states that para-substituted benzoic acids with strongly electron-withdrawing groups yield high Fe/Hf values, whereas those with electron-donating or weakly withdrawing groups yield low Fe/Hf values. The physical-chemical explanation regarding the influence of substituents on acidity and coordination ability is sound. The rule incorporates complexity by involving electronic effects and specific positions of substituents. Coverage includes multiple examples supporting both scenarios, ensuring a balanced and comprehensive rule.

- **Comment 4**:

  **Rule 4** specifies that modifiers with nitrogen heterocycles attached via flexible aliphatic linkers to the carboxylic acid result in high Fe/Hf values, while direct attachment leads to low values. The clarity is satisfactory, though understanding the structural nuances requires some chemical knowledge. The property insight is adequate, considering steric hindrance and linker flexibility affecting coordination. Coverage includes two examples for each case, meeting the minimum requirement but could be strengthened with more data points. The rule balances complexity with practical applicability.

- **Comment 5**:

  **Rule 5** states that modifiers with aliphatic chains containing a single hydroxyl group result in high Fe/Hf values, while those with multiple hydroxyl groups result in low values. The clarity is good, and the physical-chemical insight regarding hydrophilicity and steric hindrance is appropriate. Complexity is introduced by considering the number of hydroxyl groups rather than just their presence. Coverage is minimal with one example for each case, suggesting the rule could be improved with additional supporting data. The balance between simplicity and coverage is acceptable but has room for enhancement.

- **Comment 6**:

  **Rule 6** indicates that modifiers containing polyether chains lead to high Fe/Hf values due to multiple coordinating oxygen atoms. The rule is clear, although defining polyether chains may require specific chemical understanding. The property insight about chelation through multiple oxygen atoms is solid. Complexity is evident as the rule considers extended functional groups. Coverage meets the minimum with two supporting examples, but additional data would strengthen the rule. The balance between complexity and coverage is reasonable.

- **Comment 7**:

  **Rule 7** asserts that modifiers with aromatic ketone groups conjugated with the carboxylic acid result in high Fe/Hf values. Clarity is adequate, though the specific structural requirement may be complex for some. The physical-chemical insight is sufficient, emphasizing electron delocalization and chelation. The rule adds complexity by focusing on conjugated systems. Coverage is limited to two examples, suggesting a need for more data to confirm the rule's generality. Overall, the rule is balanced but could benefit from expanded coverage.

- **Comment 8**:

  **Rule 8** states that modifiers with highly electronegative fluorinated alkyl chains result in low Fe/Hf values. The clarity is high, and the property insight regarding electron-withdrawing effects decreasing coordination ability is logical. Complexity arises from the specific nature of fluorinated chains. Coverage is minimal with two examples, indicating that more data points would enhance the rule's reliability. The balance between specificity and coverage is acceptable.

- **Comment 9**:

  **Rule 9** mentions that modifiers with aromatic rings substituted with phenolic hydroxyl groups lead to low Fe/Hf values. The clarity is good, and the physical-chemical explanation about intramolecular hydrogen bonding reducing coordination potential is valid. Complexity is present by considering both the aromatic ring and the phenolic hydroxyl groups. Coverage includes two examples, meeting the minimal requirement but could be expanded. The rule has a reasonable balance but would benefit from additional supporting data.

- **Comment 10**:

  **Rule 10** explains that α-amino acids with bulky, electron-rich aromatic side chains (like tryptophan) result in low Fe/Hf values due to steric hindrance and electron delocalization, while those with smaller aromatic side chains (like phenylalanine) result in high values. The clarity is satisfactory, although specifying "bulky, electron-rich" side chains adds complexity. The physical-chemical insight concerning steric and electronic effects is appropriate. Coverage is minimal with one example for each case, suggesting the need for more data. The balance is acceptable, but the rule would be stronger with increased coverage.

    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (thioether group)

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers with aliphatic chains containing a terminal primary amino group (–NH₂) result in high Fe/Hf values; modifiers with aromatic amino groups or internally positioned amino groups result in low Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Explanation*: Terminal primary amines are efficient at coordinating with Fe ions due to their accessibility and availability of the lone pair on nitrogen. Aromatic amines have delocalized lone pairs less available for coordination, and internal amines may be sterically hindered.
  - *Examples (High Fe/Hf)*:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
  - *Examples (Low Fe/Hf)*:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (aromatic amine)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (internal amino group)

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with strongly electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) result in high Fe/Hf values; those with electron-donating groups (e.g., amino, methyl) result in low Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Explanation*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid and enhance its ability to coordinate with Fe ions. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and coordination ability.
  - *Examples (High Fe/Hf)*:
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
  - *Examples (Low Fe/Hf)*:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles (e.g., pyridine rings) attached via a flexible aliphatic linker to the carboxylic acid result in high Fe/Hf values; those where the heterocycle is directly attached to the carboxyl group result in low Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Explanation*: Flexible linkers reduce steric hindrance, allowing the nitrogen atom in the heterocycle to effectively coordinate with Fe ions. Direct attachment can hinder coordination due to steric and electronic effects.
  - *Examples (High Fe/Hf)*:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (with linker)
  - *Examples (Low Fe/Hf)*:
    - **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing polyether chains (e.g., ethylene glycol units) with terminal or side-chain amino groups result in high Fe/Hf values; those without amino groups or with only ether oxygens result in lower Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Explanation*: Oxygen atoms in polyether chains can coordinate with Fe ions, and the presence of amino groups enhances coordination through additional binding sites.
  - *Examples (High Fe/Hf)*:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with aliphatic chains containing a single hydroxyl (–OH) group result in high Fe/Hf values; those with multiple hydroxyl groups or phenolic hydroxyl groups result in low Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Explanation*: A single hydroxyl group can coordinate with Fe ions without significantly increasing hydrophilicity or steric hindrance. Multiple hydroxyls increase hydrophilicity and may form intramolecular hydrogen bonds that hinder coordination.
  - *Examples (High Fe/Hf)*:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
  - *Examples (Low Fe/Hf)*:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing aromatic ketone groups conjugated with the carboxylic acid result in high Fe/Hf values due to enhanced chelation ability.**

  - *Explanation*: Conjugated ketone and carboxyl groups can chelate Fe ions, providing a stable coordination environment.
  - *Examples (High Fe/Hf)*:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing highly fluorinated alkyl chains result in low Fe/Hf values due to electron-withdrawing effects that reduce coordinating ability.**

  - *Explanation*: Fluorinated groups withdraw electron density, decreasing the electron-donating ability of coordinating atoms like oxygen or nitrogen.
  - *Examples (Low Fe/Hf)*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with bulky, electron-rich aromatic side chains (e.g., tryptophan) result in low Fe/Hf values; those with smaller aromatic side chains (e.g., phenylalanine) can result in high Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Explanation*: Bulky side chains can cause steric hindrance, and electron-rich systems may delocalize lone pairs that would otherwise coordinate with Fe ions. Smaller aromatic groups pose less steric hindrance.
  - *Examples (High Fe/Hf)*:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid**
  - *Examples (Low Fe/Hf)*:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid**

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing phenolic hydroxyl groups attached to aromatic rings result in low Fe/Hf values due to decreased availability of lone pairs for coordination.**

  - *Explanation*: Phenolic hydroxyl groups engage in strong hydrogen bonding and resonance stabilization, making the oxygen less available to coordinate with Fe ions.
  - *Examples (Low Fe/Hf)*:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

These rules collectively capture the relationships between molecular modifiers and the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst based on their structural features and underlying physical-chemical properties:

- **Coverage and Balance**: The rules cover a broad range of the dataset by focusing on prevalent functional groups like sulfur-containing groups, amino groups, electron-withdrawing or -donating substituents, polyether chains, and hydroxyl groups. There's a balance between simple rules with wider coverage (e.g., presence of sulfur or amino groups) and more complex rules that address specific structural motifs (e.g., effects of fluorination, conjugated ketone groups).

- **Physical-Chemical Considerations**: Each rule is founded on chemical reasoning:
  - **Coordination Chemistry**: Understanding how functional groups such as sulfur, amino, hydroxyl, and ketone groups interact with Fe ions.
  - **Electronic Effects**: Considering how electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups influence the coordinating ability of the modifiers.
  - **Steric Factors**: Recognizing the impact of bulky substituents and flexible linkers on the accessibility of coordinating atoms.
  - **Hydrophilicity and Hydrogen Bonding**: Assessing how multiple hydroxyl groups or phenolic groups affect metal coordination through increased hydrophilicity or internal hydrogen bonding.

- **Predictive Clarity**: Each rule clearly predicts whether a modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value based on its functional groups and sub-structures.

By applying these rules, researchers can rationally design or select molecular modifiers to control and optimize the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst. This, in turn, influences the yield of the target remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction, allowing for improved reaction efficiency and selectivity.

**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**:

  Rule 1 is clear, allowing us to predict high Fe/Hf values when modifiers contain sulfur functional groups (thiols or thioethers) adjacent to coordinating groups like carboxylates or amines. The property insight is strong, explaining how sulfur atoms with lone pairs enhance coordination with Fe ions. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures (sulfur groups near coordinating groups), satisfying the complexity criterion. It covers at least three data points supporting high Fe/Hf values (Entries 10, 18, 24), providing good coverage. The balance between specificity and coverage is well-maintained.

- **Comment 2**:

  Rule 2 is clear in distinguishing between modifiers with terminal primary amino groups and those with aromatic or internal amino groups, enabling accurate predictions of Fe/Hf values. The property insight is solid, explaining how accessibility of the amino group affects coordination with Fe ions. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures (amine type and position), satisfying the complexity criterion. It has strong coverage with multiple data points for both high (Entries 3, 31, 33, 34) and low Fe/Hf values (Entries 0, 4), achieving a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 3**:

  Rule 3 clearly relates the presence of electron-withdrawing or -donating groups on para-substituted benzoic acids to Fe/Hf values. The property insight is valid, discussing how electronic effects influence the coordinating ability. The rule considers both the type and position of substituents, meeting the complexity criterion. It has good coverage with at least two data points supporting each outcome (Entries 1, 21 for high Fe/Hf; Entries 4, 23 for low Fe/Hf), maintaining a balanced approach.

- **Comment 4**:

  Rule 4 is clear, explaining how the flexibility of the linker between the nitrogen heterocycle and the carboxylic acid affects Fe/Hf values. The property insight is reasonable, addressing steric hindrance and coordination effectiveness. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures (heterocycle type and linker presence), satisfying the complexity criterion. It has adequate coverage with data points supporting both high (Entries 12, 25) and low Fe/Hf values (Entries 16, 22), providing a balanced perspective.

- **Comment 5**:

  Rule 5 lacks clarity due to inconsistencies in the examples provided. While the rule states that modifiers with polyether chains and amino groups result in high Fe/Hf values, one of the high Fe/Hf examples (Entry 11) lacks an amino group but still shows high Fe/Hf. This contradicts the rule and reduces clarity. The property insight is limited and doesn't fully explain the observed outcomes. The rule attempts to consider combinations of sub-structures but falls short in complexity due to inconsistency. Coverage is limited and inconsistent, affecting the balance. This rule needs refinement for better clarity and alignment with the data.

- **Comment 6**:

  Rule 6 is clear, indicating that modifiers with a single hydroxyl group on an aliphatic chain lead to high Fe/Hf values, while multiple hydroxyls or phenolic hydroxyls lead to low Fe/Hf values. The property insight is acceptable, discussing how hydrophilicity and steric factors affect coordination. The rule considers the number and type of hydroxyl groups, meeting the complexity criterion. Coverage includes one data point for high Fe/Hf (Entry 29) and at least two for low Fe/Hf (Entries 6, 9), though additional data supporting high Fe/Hf would strengthen coverage. The rule maintains a reasonable balance.

- **Comment 7**:

  Rule 7 is clear and specific, relating conjugated aromatic ketone groups to high Fe/Hf values through enhanced chelation. The property insight is solid, focusing on chelation effects. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures (ketone and carboxyl groups), satisfying the complexity criterion. Coverage is adequate with two data points supporting high Fe/Hf values (Entries 17, 26), providing a balanced approach between specificity and coverage.

- **Comment 8**:

  Rule 8 is clear, stating that highly fluorinated alkyl chains result in low Fe/Hf values due to strong electron-withdrawing effects. The property insight is valid, explaining how reduced electron density affects coordination. The rule focuses on specific sub-structures, meeting the complexity criterion. Coverage includes two data points supporting low Fe/Hf values (Entries 14, 28), offering a balanced perspective.

- **Comment 9**:

  Rule 9 is somewhat clear but limited by the small number of examples. It distinguishes between α-amino acids with bulky, electron-rich aromatic side chains resulting in low Fe/Hf values and those with smaller aromatic side chains resulting in high Fe/Hf values. The property insight is reasonable, addressing steric hindrance and electron effects. The rule considers side-chain size and electronic properties, satisfying the complexity criterion. However, coverage is limited with only one data point for each outcome (Entries 13 for high Fe/Hf and 15 for low Fe/Hf), affecting the balance. Additional data would strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 10**:

  Rule 10 is clear, indicating that phenolic hydroxyl groups attached to aromatic rings lead to low Fe/Hf values due to decreased availability of lone pairs for coordination. The property insight is acceptable. The rule focuses on specific sub-structures, meeting the complexity criterion. Coverage includes at least two data points supporting low Fe/Hf values (Entries 7, 30), achieving a balanced approach.

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal primary amino group (–NH₂) result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: The primary amino group can coordinate with Fe ions, enhancing Fe incorporation. The flexible aliphatic chain allows for optimal coordination geometry without significant steric hindrance.
  - **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *5-aminopentanoic acid*
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*
  - **Counterexamples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *Octanoic acid* (no amino group)
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid* (amino group attached to an aromatic ring, reducing its availability for coordination due to resonance stabilization)

---

- **Rule 2**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., nitro, halogens, thiol) at the para position result in **high Fe/Hf values**; those with electron-donating substituents (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, methoxy) result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid and enhance its ability to coordinate with Fe ions. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and may hinder coordination due to increased electron density and potential resonance effects.
  - **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *4-nitrobenzoic acid*
    - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid*
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* (thiol group acts as both an electron-withdrawing group and a coordinating site)
  - **Counterexamples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid*
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid*
    - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing thiol groups (–SH) along with carboxylic acids result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: Thiol groups have highly polarizable lone pairs on sulfur, forming strong coordinate bonds with Fe ions, thus enhancing Fe incorporation.
  - **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with flexible aliphatic linkers connecting a carboxylic acid to a nitrogen-containing heterocycle result in **high Fe/Hf values**; those where the heterocycle is directly attached to the carboxylic acid result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: Flexible linkers enhance the ability of the nitrogen in the heterocycle to coordinate effectively with Fe ions by reducing steric hindrance. Direct attachment restricts rotational freedom and may prevent optimal coordination geometry.
  - **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid*

  - **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with small or unbranched side chains result in **high Fe/Hf values**; those with bulky or aromatic side chains may still result in **high Fe/Hf values** if the side chain can participate in coordination.**

  - **Explanation**: The amino and carboxylate groups can chelate Fe ions effectively. Small side chains reduce steric hindrance, while certain bulky side chains with coordinating groups (e.g., phenyl rings) can enhance coordination.
  - **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (aspartic acid)
    - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (phenylalanine)
  - **Counterexamples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (glutamic acid; additional methylene group increases steric bulk)

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with a terminal hydroxyl group (–OH) on an aliphatic chain result in **high Fe/Hf values**; modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups or hydroxyl groups on aromatic rings result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: A terminal aliphatic hydroxyl group provides an additional coordination site without significant steric hindrance. Multiple hydroxyls increase steric bulk and intra- or intermolecular hydrogen bonding, hindering coordination with Fe ions.
  - **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*
  - **Counterexamples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid*
    - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*

---

    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*
    - *4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with aldehyde groups attached to aromatic rings result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to potential side reactions and decreased coordination ability.**

  - **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups can undergo condensation reactions or oxidize, leading to instability. They also withdraw electron density from the aromatic ring, reducing the effectiveness of the carboxylate group in coordinating with Fe ions.
  - **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing multiple coordinating groups (e.g., amino, thiol, ether) in flexible positions enhance Fe/Hf values due to increased chelation sites.**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple coordinating sites increase the likelihood of Fe binding, enhancing the Fe/Hf ratio.
  - **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid* (ether coordination)
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid* (amino and ether coordination)
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (amide and amino groups)

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: Without additional functional groups to act as coordination sites, these modifiers have limited ability to chelate Fe ions.
  - **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *Octanoic acid*
    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with bulky aromatic substituents attached to aliphatic carboxylic acids result in **high Fe/Hf values** if the aromatic ring contains coordinating groups (e.g., methoxy); otherwise, they result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to steric hindrance.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups like methoxy increase electron density, facilitating coordination with Fe ions despite bulkiness. Without such groups, steric hindrance reduces Fe coordination.
  - **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid*
  - **Counterexamples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (phenolic hydroxyl without methoxy groups)

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain or sugar moiety result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to increased steric hindrance and hydrogen bonding.**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can form extensive hydrogen bonds and create a sterically crowded environment, hindering effective coordination with Fe ions.
  - **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid*
    - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with flexible aliphatic linkers connecting a carboxylic acid to an electron-rich aromatic system result in **high Fe/Hf values** if the aromatic system can participate in coordination.**

  - **Explanation**: The flexible linker allows the electron-rich aromatic system to effectively coordinate with Fe ions, enhancing Fe incorporation.
  - **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid*
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (despite being directly attached, the pyridine nitrogen can coordinate with Fe)

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing internal ketone groups within aliphatic carboxylic acids result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to steric hindrance and decreased coordination ability.**

  - **Explanation**: Internal carbonyl groups can introduce steric hindrance and act as electron-withdrawing moieties, reducing the coordination ability of nearby functional groups with Fe ions.

    - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (tryptophan)
    - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers combining carboxylic acid groups with amide functionalities adjacent to amino groups result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: Amide and amino groups can serve as additional coordination sites for Fe ions, enhancing binding through chelation.

  - **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid*
    - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid*

---

  - **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, reducing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions. Without other coordinating groups, Fe binding is limited.

  - **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid*
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid*
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing both carboxylic acid groups and flexible ether linkages alongside amino groups result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Example (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups on the chain result in **variable Fe/Hf values** depending on the presence of additional coordinating groups.**

  - **Explanation**: Hydroxyl groups alone may not significantly enhance Fe coordination unless combined with other coordinating functionalities like amino groups.

  - **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (High Fe/Hf due to potential for hydroxyl coordination and chain flexibility)

  - **Counterexamples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *Octanoic acid* (no hydroxyl or additional coordinating groups)

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with conjugated keto-carboxylic acid structures in rigid rings result in **high Fe/Hf values** due to chelation, whereas isolated ketones in aliphatic chains result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: Chelating effects in rigid structures enhance Fe binding, while isolated ketones may not contribute significantly to coordination.

  - **Example (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid* (rigid conjugated system)

  - **Example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid* (isolated ketone on aliphatic chain)

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with sulfur-containing side chains (e.g., thioethers) adjacent to amino groups and carboxylic acids result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: Sulfur atoms enhance coordination with Fe ions, and adjacent amino groups offer additional binding sites.

  - **Example (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid*

---

**Application and Interpretation:**

- **Predictive Use**: Use these rules to assess new modifiers by identifying their functional groups and structural features. Determine if they match the criteria for high or low Fe/Hf values based on the combination of substructures described.

- **Design Guidance**:

  - To achieve **high Fe/Hf values**, consider modifiers that:

    - Include a flexible aliphatic chain with both carboxylic acid and primary amino groups.
    - Possess aromatic rings with strong electron-withdrawing groups at key positions.
    - Contain sulfur functionalities (thiol or thioether groups).
    - Incorporate polyether chains with additional coordinating groups like amino groups.
    - Feature nitrogen-containing heterocycles connected via flexible linkers.
    - Combine amide functionalities with carboxylic acids and amino groups.
    - Have rigid conjugated systems capable of chelation.

  - To avoid **low Fe/Hf values**, be cautious with modifiers that:

    - Lack additional coordinating groups beyond the carboxylic acid.
    - Have multiple hydroxyl groups on rigid structures without other coordinating sites.
    - Present bulky aromatic rings without coordinating substituents.
    - Contain perfluorinated chains.
    - Possess electron-donating groups directly attached to aromatic rings without other coordination potential.
    - Include isolated ketone groups on aliphatic chains.

- **Chemical Considerations**:

  - **Coordination Sites**: Functional groups like amino, thiol, ether oxygens, amide nitrogens, and nitrogen heterocycles enhance Fe coordination by providing lone pairs for binding.
  - **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of carboxylic acids, promoting Fe ion coordination; electron-donating groups have the opposite effect.
  - **Steric Effects**: Flexible linkers and less bulky substituents facilitate Fe binding by reducing steric hindrance around coordination sites.
  - **Chelation**: Structures capable of forming chelate rings with Fe ions significantly enhance coordination due to increased stability of the complex.

**Final Remarks:**

These rules capture the key structural features influencing Fe/Hf values in the dataset by combining multiple functional groups and considering their electronic and steric effects. By applying these rules, researchers can predict the Fe/Hf outcome for new modifiers and design molecules that optimize Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

    - *Octanoic acid*
    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups on rigid structures, such as sugar moieties, result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

    - *Octanoic acid*
    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups on rigid cyclic structures result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

**Application and Interpretation:**

- **Predictive Use**: To predict whether a modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value, identify the presence of functional groups and structural features as outlined in the rules.

- **Design Guidance**:

  - **For High Fe/Hf Values**:

    - **Incorporate Multidentate Ligands**: Use modifiers with multiple coordinating groups (e.g., amino, thiol, hydroxyl, ether oxygens) that can chelate Fe ions effectively (**Rules 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7**).

    - **Enhance Flexibility**: Choose modifiers with flexible aliphatic chains or linkers that allow coordinating groups to align properly for multidentate binding (**Rules 1, 3, 5, 6**).

    - **Increase Acidity with EWGs**: Employ aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents to enhance coordination via increased acidity (**Rule 4**).

  - **For Low Fe/Hf Values**:

    - **Avoid Monodentate Ligands**: Steer clear of modifiers that offer only a single coordination site, such as a sole carboxylic acid (**Rule 8**).

    - **Limit Steric Hindrance**: Avoid bulky or rigid structures without additional coordinating groups, as they hinder effective Fe coordination (**Rules 9, 12**).

    - **Consider Electronic Effects**: Be cautious with modifiers containing strong electron-withdrawing groups that overly reduce electron density on donor atoms (e.g., perfluorinated chains) (**Rule 10**).

    - **Exclude Reactive Groups**: Refrain from using modifiers with potentially reactive functional groups adjacent to coordination sites, such as aldehydes (**Rule 11**).

- **Chemical Considerations**:

  - **Coordination Sites**: Functional groups with lone pairs (–NH₂, –SH, –OH, ether oxygens, pyridine nitrogen) enhance coordination with Fe ions. Multidentate ligands increase stability and Fe incorporation.

  - **Flexibility vs. Rigidity**: Flexibility in molecular structure allows for optimal alignment of coordinating groups, promoting effective multidentate binding. Rigid structures may prevent coordination due to steric constraints.

  - **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase acidity and promote deprotonation of the carboxylic acid, facilitating binding to Fe ions. However, excessively electron-deficient donor atoms (e.g., from perfluorination) may have reduced coordinating ability.

  - **Steric Effects**: Bulky substituents can impede the approach of Fe ions to coordination sites, reducing the effectiveness of the modifier.

  - **Reactivity of Functional Groups**: Functional groups prone to side reactions (e.g., aldehydes) may interfere with coordination processes or catalyst stability.

**Conclusion:**

By applying these rules, researchers can rationally design molecular modifiers that optimize Fe incorporation into the Hf-TPY-MOL catalyst. Selecting modifiers that promote high Fe/Hf values can enhance the catalytic performance of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. Understanding the balance between ligand flexibility, coordination sites, electronic properties, and steric factors is crucial in the design of effective modifiers.

### **Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing amino groups (–NH₂) on flexible aliphatic chains terminating with carboxylic acid groups result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: The presence of amino and carboxylate groups on a flexible chain allows for effective chelation with Fe ions through multidentate coordination.

- **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid**

- **Counterexamples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - **Octanoic acid** (lacks amino group)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (additional carboxyl group may affect coordination differently)

---

### **Rule 2**: **Modifiers with multiple coordinating groups (e.g., amino, thiol, hydroxyl, ether oxygens) on flexible aliphatic chains result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: Multiple coordinating sites enhance Fe ion binding through multidentate interactions, and chain flexibility allows simultaneous coordination.

- **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (thiol and carboxylate groups)
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (hydroxyl and carboxylate groups)
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (ether oxygens and carboxylate group)
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (amino, ether oxygens, and carboxylate group)

---

### **Rule 3**: **Modifiers featuring nitrogen-containing aromatic rings (e.g., pyridine) connected via flexible linkers to carboxylic acids result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: The nitrogen atom in the aromatic ring coordinates with Fe ions, and the flexible linker facilitates effective multidentate binding alongside the carboxylate group.

- **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

- **Counterexample (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (rigid attachment limits effective coordination)

---

### **Rule 4**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at positions that enhance coordination result in **high Fe/Hf values**; those with electron-donating groups (EDGs) result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: EWGs increase the acidity and coordinating ability of the carboxylate group by withdrawing electron density, while EDGs decrease it by donating electron density.

- **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (–NO₂ group)
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (–CH₂Br group)

- **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (–NH₂ group)
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (–CH₃ group)

---

### **Rule 5**: **Modifiers lacking additional coordinating groups beyond the carboxylic acid result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: Without additional ligating groups, the modifiers act as monodentate ligands, which are less effective in Fe coordination compared to multidentate ligands.

- **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - **Octanoic acid**
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**

---

### **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated chains result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to decreased electron density on coordinating atoms.**

- **Explanation**: Highly electronegative fluorine atoms withdraw electron density, weakening the ability of coordinating groups to bind Fe ions.

- **Example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

---

### **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with bulky or rigid structures lacking additional coordinating groups result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: Steric hindrance from bulky or rigid moieties impedes effective coordination with Fe ions.

- **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

---

### **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with rigid heterocycles directly attached to carboxylic acids without flexible linkers result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: The rigidity limits the ability of coordinating atoms to align properly with Fe ions for effective binding.

- **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

---

### **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on rigid structures result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to steric hindrance and reduced coordination effectiveness.**

- **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups on a rigid backbone can create steric bulk, hindering the approach and binding of Fe ions.

- **Example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**

---

### **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing ketone or aldehyde groups adjacent to carboxylic acids result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to potential side reactions or interference with coordination.**

- **Explanation**: Carbonyl groups may compete with carboxylate groups for coordination or undergo side reactions, reducing Fe incorporation.

- **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**
