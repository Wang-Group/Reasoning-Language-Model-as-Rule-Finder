    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing sulfur functional groups (such as thiols or thioethers) result in high Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Explanation*: Sulfur-containing groups have a high affinity for metal ions due to their soft nucleophilic character, enhancing Fe incorporation into the catalyst.
  - *Examples (True)*:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**
    - **(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoic acid derivative**

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers with aliphatic chains containing an amino group (–NH₂) result in high Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Explanation*: Amino groups can coordinate with metal ions, enhancing Fe incorporation into the catalyst.
  - *Examples (True)*:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**
  - *Examples (False)*:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (aromatic amino group does not enhance Fe incorporation)

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing groups result in high Fe/Hf values; those with electron-donating groups result in low Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Explanation*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing metal coordination. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity, reducing Fe incorporation into the catalyst.
  - *Examples (True)*:
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (electron-withdrawing bromomethyl group)
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (electron-withdrawing nitro group)
  - *Examples (False)*:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (electron-donating methyl group)
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (electron-donating amino group)

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles attached via a flexible linker to the carboxylic acid group result in high Fe/Hf values; those where the heterocycle is directly attached result in low Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Explanation*: Nitrogen heterocycles can coordinate with metal centers. A flexible linker allows effective coordination by reducing steric hindrance, enhancing Fe incorporation. Direct attachment may hinder coordination due to steric constraints.
  - *Examples (True)*:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
  - *Examples (False)*:
    - **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with aliphatic chains containing a single hydroxyl (–OH) group result in high Fe/Hf values; those with multiple hydroxyl groups result in low Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Explanation*: A single hydroxyl group can facilitate coordination with metal centers without causing excessive hydrophilicity or steric hindrance. Multiple hydroxyl groups increase hydrophilicity and may inhibit Fe incorporation into the catalyst.
  - *Examples (True)*:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
  - *Examples (False)*:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing aromatic ketone groups conjugated with the carboxylic acid result in high Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Explanation*: Conjugated ketone groups can delocalize charge and facilitate coordination with metal centers, enhancing Fe incorporation.
  - *Examples (True)*:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing highly electronegative fluorinated alkyl chains result in low Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Explanation*: Fluorinated chains are poor at coordinating with metal centers and may repel metal incorporation due to their strong electron-withdrawing nature.
  - *Examples (False)*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with aromatic rings substituted with hydroxyl groups (phenolic –OH) result in low Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Explanation*: Phenolic hydroxyl groups can engage in strong hydrogen bonding or deactivate coordination sites, reducing Fe incorporation into the catalyst.
  - *Examples (False)*:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic dicarboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups result in low Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Explanation*: Dicarboxylic acids may destabilize Fe incorporation due to competition between carboxylate groups for coordination sites, reducing effective Fe binding.
  - *Examples (False)*:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid**
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing electron-rich aromatic systems directly attached to the carboxylic acid result in low Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Explanation*: Electron-rich aromatic rings may not coordinate effectively with metal centers due to delocalization of electron density, reducing Fe incorporation.
  - *Examples (False)*:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan derivative)
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine derivative)

**End of Rules**

---

These rules collectively capture the relationship between molecular modifiers and the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst. By analyzing the functional groups and sub-structures within the modifiers, we can predict the impact on Fe incorporation based on established chemical principles such as coordination chemistry, electronic effects, and steric factors.

- **Coverage and Balance**: The rules are designed to cover a broad range of the dataset by focusing on prevalent functional groups and structural motifs. Simple rules with higher coverage (e.g., presence of amino or thiol groups) are balanced with more complex rules that address specific cases (e.g., the effect of flexible linkers in nitrogen heterocycles).

- **Physical-Chemical Considerations**: Each rule is grounded in chemical reasoning, considering factors like coordination ability, electron-withdrawing/donating effects, steric hindrance, and the nature of metal-ligand interactions.

- **Predictive Clarity**: The rules are structured to make clear predictions about whether a modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value based on its structural features.

By applying these rules, researchers can rationally design or select molecular modifiers to control and optimize the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst, ultimately influencing the yield of the target δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing sulfur functional groups (such as thiols or thioethers) result in high Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Explanation*: Sulfur atoms are soft Lewis bases that coordinate strongly with metal ions like Fe³⁺. Their lone pair electrons on the sulfur can effectively overlap with the empty orbitals of the metal, enhancing Fe incorporation into the catalyst.
  - *Examples (High Fe/Hf, True)*:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers with aliphatic chains containing a terminal amino group (–NH₂) result in high Fe/Hf values. Amino groups directly attached to aromatic rings result in low Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Explanation*: Aliphatic amino groups are effective at coordinating with metal ions due to their lone pair electrons on nitrogen, enhancing Fe incorporation. In contrast, aromatic amino groups have their lone pair electrons delocalized into the ring, reducing their availability for coordination.
  - *Examples (High Fe/Hf, True)*:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**
  - *Examples (Low Fe/Hf, False)*:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with strongly electron-withdrawing groups result in high Fe/Hf values; those with electron-donating groups or weakly withdrawing groups result in low Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Explanation*: Strongly electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro or bromomethyl) increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid and enhance its ability to coordinate with metal ions. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and coordination ability.
  - *Examples (High Fe/Hf, True)*:
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (strongly withdrawing bromomethyl group)
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (strongly withdrawing nitro group)
  - *Examples (Low Fe/Hf, False)*:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (electron-donating methyl group)
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (electron-donating amino group)
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (weakly withdrawing formyl group)

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles attached via a flexible aliphatic linker to the carboxylic acid result in high Fe/Hf values; those where the heterocycle is directly attached to the carboxyl group result in low Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Explanation*: Flexible linkers reduce steric hindrance and allow the nitrogen atom in heterocycles to effectively coordinate with metal ions. Direct attachment can create steric clashes and electronic effects that hinder coordination.
  - *Examples (High Fe/Hf, True)*:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
  - *Examples (Low Fe/Hf, False)*:
    - **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with aliphatic chains containing a single hydroxyl (–OH) group result in high Fe/Hf values; those with multiple hydroxyl groups result in low Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Explanation*: A single hydroxyl group can participate in coordination without significantly increasing hydrophilicity or steric hindrance. Multiple hydroxyl groups increase hydrophilicity and can lead to unfavorable interactions that reduce Fe incorporation.
  - *Examples (High Fe/Hf, True)*:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
  - *Examples (Low Fe/Hf, False)*:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing polyether chains (such as ethylene glycol units) result in high Fe/Hf values due to multiple coordinating oxygen atoms.**

  - *Explanation*: The oxygen atoms in polyether chains can chelate metal ions, providing multiple points of attachment that stabilize the metal within the catalyst structure.
  - *Examples (High Fe/Hf, True)*:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing aromatic ketone groups conjugated with the carboxylic acid result in high Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Explanation*: Conjugated ketone groups can delocalize electron density and facilitate coordination with metal ions through chelation, enhancing Fe incorporation.
  - *Examples (High Fe/Hf, True)*:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing highly electronegative fluorinated alkyl chains result in low Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Explanation*: Fluorinated groups are highly electron-withdrawing and can decrease the electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening interactions with metal ions and reducing Fe incorporation.
  - *Examples (Low Fe/Hf, False)*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with aromatic rings substituted with phenolic hydroxyl groups result in low Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Explanation*: Phenolic hydroxyl groups can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds and are less effective at coordinating with metal ions due to their participation in strong hydrogen bonding networks, reducing Fe incorporation.
  - *Examples (Low Fe/Hf, False)*:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with bulky, electron-rich aromatic side chains (like tryptophan) result in low Fe/Hf values due to steric hindrance and electron delocalization. Smaller aromatic side chains (like phenylalanine) can still result in high Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Explanation*: Bulky side chains can hinder effective coordination with metal ions, and electron-rich systems may delocalize coordinating lone pairs. Smaller aromatic groups pose less steric hindrance and allow coordination.
  - *Examples (Low Fe/Hf, False)*:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan derivative)
  - *Examples (High Fe/Hf, True)*:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine derivative)

These rules collectively capture the relationships between molecular modifiers and the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst based on their structural features and underlying physical-chemical properties:

- **Coverage and Balance**: The rules cover a broad range of the dataset by focusing on prevalent functional groups such as sulfur-containing groups, amino groups, electron-withdrawing substituents, and polyether chains. We've maintained a balance between simple rules with higher coverage (e.g., presence of sulfur or amino groups) and more complex rules that address specific structural motifs (e.g., flexible linkers in nitrogen heterocycles, effects of fluorination).

- **Physical-Chemical Considerations**: Each rule is grounded in chemical reasoning:
  - **Coordination Chemistry**: Understanding how functional groups like sulfur, amino, and hydroxyl groups interact with metal ions.
  - **Electronic Effects**: Considering electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups' influence on coordination ability.
  - **Steric Factors**: Recognizing how bulky groups or flexible linkers affect the accessibility of coordinating atoms.
  - **Hydrophilicity and Hydrogen Bonding**: Assessing how multiple hydroxyl groups or phenolic groups influence metal coordination through increased hydrophilicity or hydrogen bonding.

- **Predictive Clarity**: The rules are structured to make clear predictions about whether a modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value based on its functional groups and sub-structures.

By applying these rules, researchers can rationally design or select molecular modifiers to control and optimize the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst. This, in turn, influences the yield of the target remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction, allowing for improved reaction efficiency and selectivity.

**Note**: While these rules are based on the available data, they are not absolute and may have exceptions. Experimental validation is recommended when applying these rules to new modifiers not included in the dataset.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Target Name: Fe/Hf
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing sulfur functional groups (thiols or thioethers), especially when adjacent to coordinating groups like carboxylates or amines, result in high Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Explanation*: Sulfur atoms have lone pairs that can strongly coordinate with Fe ions. When sulfur is near other coordinating groups, it enhances the overall binding affinity for Fe.
  - *Examples (High Fe/Hf)*:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (thiol group)
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (thiol group)
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (thioether group)

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers with aliphatic chains containing a terminal primary amino group (–NH₂) result in high Fe/Hf values; modifiers with aromatic amino groups or internally positioned amino groups result in low Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Explanation*: Terminal primary amines are efficient at coordinating with Fe ions due to their accessibility and availability of the lone pair on nitrogen. Aromatic amines have delocalized lone pairs less available for coordination, and internal amines may be sterically hindered.
  - *Examples (High Fe/Hf)*:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
  - *Examples (Low Fe/Hf)*:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (aromatic amine)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (internal amino group)

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with strongly electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) result in high Fe/Hf values; those with electron-donating groups (e.g., amino, methyl) result in low Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Explanation*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid and enhance its ability to coordinate with Fe ions. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and coordination ability.
  - *Examples (High Fe/Hf)*:
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
  - *Examples (Low Fe/Hf)*:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles (e.g., pyridine rings) attached via a flexible aliphatic linker to the carboxylic acid result in high Fe/Hf values; those where the heterocycle is directly attached to the carboxyl group result in low Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Explanation*: Flexible linkers reduce steric hindrance, allowing the nitrogen atom in the heterocycle to effectively coordinate with Fe ions. Direct attachment can hinder coordination due to steric and electronic effects.
  - *Examples (High Fe/Hf)*:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (with linker)
  - *Examples (Low Fe/Hf)*:
    - **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing polyether chains (e.g., ethylene glycol units) with terminal or side-chain amino groups result in high Fe/Hf values; those without amino groups or with only ether oxygens result in lower Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Explanation*: Oxygen atoms in polyether chains can coordinate with Fe ions, and the presence of amino groups enhances coordination through additional binding sites.
  - *Examples (High Fe/Hf)*:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with aliphatic chains containing a single hydroxyl (–OH) group result in high Fe/Hf values; those with multiple hydroxyl groups or phenolic hydroxyl groups result in low Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Explanation*: A single hydroxyl group can coordinate with Fe ions without significantly increasing hydrophilicity or steric hindrance. Multiple hydroxyls increase hydrophilicity and may form intramolecular hydrogen bonds that hinder coordination.
  - *Examples (High Fe/Hf)*:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
  - *Examples (Low Fe/Hf)*:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing aromatic ketone groups conjugated with the carboxylic acid result in high Fe/Hf values due to enhanced chelation ability.**

  - *Explanation*: Conjugated ketone and carboxyl groups can chelate Fe ions, providing a stable coordination environment.
  - *Examples (High Fe/Hf)*:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing highly fluorinated alkyl chains result in low Fe/Hf values due to electron-withdrawing effects that reduce coordinating ability.**

  - *Explanation*: Fluorinated groups withdraw electron density, decreasing the electron-donating ability of coordinating atoms like oxygen or nitrogen.
  - *Examples (Low Fe/Hf)*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with bulky, electron-rich aromatic side chains (e.g., tryptophan) result in low Fe/Hf values; those with smaller aromatic side chains (e.g., phenylalanine) can result in high Fe/Hf values.**

  - *Explanation*: Bulky side chains can cause steric hindrance, and electron-rich systems may delocalize lone pairs that would otherwise coordinate with Fe ions. Smaller aromatic groups pose less steric hindrance.
  - *Examples (High Fe/Hf)*:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid**
  - *Examples (Low Fe/Hf)*:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid**

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing phenolic hydroxyl groups attached to aromatic rings result in low Fe/Hf values due to decreased availability of lone pairs for coordination.**

  - *Explanation*: Phenolic hydroxyl groups engage in strong hydrogen bonding and resonance stabilization, making the oxygen less available to coordinate with Fe ions.
  - *Examples (Low Fe/Hf)*:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

    Target Name: Fe/Hf
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing a terminal primary aliphatic amino group (–NH₂) attached to an aliphatic carboxylic acid result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Explanation*: Terminal primary amines provide lone pairs for strong coordination with Fe ions, enhancing metal-binding efficiency.
  - *Examples (High Fe/Hf)*:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
  - *Counterexamples (Low Fe/Hf)*:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (aromatic amine)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (internal amino group)

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers containing sulfur functional groups (thiols or thioethers) combined with an aliphatic carboxylic acid lead to **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Explanation*: Sulfur atoms have polarizable lone pairs that form strong coordination bonds with Fe ions.
  - *Examples (High Fe/Hf)*:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers with aromatic carboxylic acids bearing electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halogens) result in **high Fe/Hf values**; those with electron-donating groups (e.g., amino, methyl) result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Explanation*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase acidity and enhance coordination with Fe ions; electron-donating groups have the opposite effect.
  - *Examples (High Fe/Hf)*:
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
  - *Examples (Low Fe/Hf)*:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with an aliphatic carboxylic acid chain containing a single terminal hydroxyl group (–OH) result in **high Fe/Hf values**; those with multiple hydroxyl groups or phenolic hydroxyl groups result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Explanation*: A single hydroxyl group can coordinate effectively without steric hindrance; multiple hydroxyls or phenolic hydroxyls reduce coordination efficiency.
  - *Examples (High Fe/Hf)*:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
  - *Examples (Low Fe/Hf)*:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing flexible aliphatic linkers between a carboxylic acid and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle result in **high Fe/Hf values**; those where the heterocycle is directly attached result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Explanation*: Flexible linkers reduce steric hindrance, allowing effective coordination of heterocyclic nitrogen atoms with Fe ions.
  - *Examples (High Fe/Hf)*:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
  - *Examples (Low Fe/Hf)*:
    - **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with acidic side chains (additional carboxyl groups) result in **high Fe/Hf values**; those with bulky aromatic side chains result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Explanation*: Acidic side chains provide extra coordination sites; bulky side chains introduce steric hindrance.
  - *Examples (High Fe/Hf)*:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid)
  - *Examples (Low Fe/Hf)*:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan)

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with aliphatic carboxylic acids containing polyether chains (e.g., ethylene glycol units) and terminal or side-chain amino groups result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Explanation*: Oxygen atoms in polyether chains, along with amino groups, enhance coordination with Fe ions.
  - *Examples (High Fe/Hf)*:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with fluorinated aliphatic chains result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Explanation*: Fluorine's high electronegativity withdraws electron density, reducing coordinating ability.
  - *Examples (Low Fe/Hf)*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing aromatic rings with electron-donating hydroxyl groups (phenolic –OH) result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Explanation*: Phenolic hydroxyl groups have delocalized lone pairs, decreasing availability for coordination.
  - *Examples (Low Fe/Hf)*:
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with aromatic ketone groups conjugated with carboxylic acids result in **high Fe/Hf values** due to enhanced chelation.**

  - *Explanation*: Adjacent carbonyl groups can chelate Fe ions, forming stable complexes.
  - *Examples (High Fe/Hf)*:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**

**End of Rules**

---

These rules capture the relationships between molecular modifiers and the Fe/Hf ratio based on structural features and underlying physical-chemical properties:

- **Combination of Substructures**: The rules consider combinations of functional groups, such as amino groups with aliphatic carboxylic acids, sulfur groups with aromatic systems, and flexible linkers with heterocycles.

- **Physical-Chemical Considerations**: Coordination ability, electron density, steric factors, and chelation potential are taken into account to explain how different modifiers affect Fe/Hf values.

- **Clear Predictions**: Each rule predicts whether a modifier will result in high or low Fe/Hf values based on its structural features, allowing for straightforward application to new compounds.

- **Coverage and Balance**: The rules cover a broad range of modifiers in the dataset, balancing simple rules with higher coverage and more complex rules for specific cases.

By applying these rules, researchers can strategically select or design molecular modifiers to control the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst, optimizing the yield of the remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Current_Rules:
    After carefully analyzing the dataset and considering the underlying physical-chemical properties, I have refined and expanded the rules to better capture the relationship between molecular modifiers and the Fe/Hf ratio. Below are the improved rules:

---

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing a terminal primary aliphatic amino group (–NH₂) attached to an aliphatic chain with a terminal carboxylic acid result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Explanation*: Primary aliphatic amines provide lone pairs that strongly coordinate with Fe ions, enhancing metal-binding efficiency.
  - *Examples (High Fe/Hf)*:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
  - *Counterexamples (Low Fe/Hf)*:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (aromatic amine)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (internal amino group)

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers containing sulfur functional groups (thiols or thioethers) combined with a carboxylic acid lead to **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Explanation*: Sulfur atoms have polarizable lone pairs that form strong coordination bonds with Fe ions.
  - *Examples (High Fe/Hf)*:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids bearing electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., nitro, halogens) result in **high Fe/Hf values**; those with electron-donating substituents (e.g., amino, methyl, hydroxyl) result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Explanation*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase acidity and enhance coordination with Fe ions; electron-donating groups decrease acidity and reduce coordination ability.
  - *Examples (High Fe/Hf)*:
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
  - *Examples (Low Fe/Hf)*:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with an aliphatic carboxylic acid chain containing a single terminal hydroxyl group (–OH) result in **high Fe/Hf values**; those with multiple hydroxyl groups or phenolic hydroxyl groups result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Explanation*: A single terminal hydroxyl group can coordinate effectively without steric hindrance; multiple hydroxyls or phenolic hydroxyls reduce coordination efficiency due to steric effects or hydrogen bonding.
  - *Examples (High Fe/Hf)*:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
  - *Examples (Low Fe/Hf)*:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing flexible aliphatic linkers between a carboxylic acid and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle result in **high Fe/Hf values**; those where the heterocycle is directly attached to the carboxylic acid result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Explanation*: Flexible linkers reduce steric hindrance, allowing effective coordination of heterocyclic nitrogen atoms with Fe ions.
  - *Examples (High Fe/Hf)*:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**
  - *Examples (Low Fe/Hf)*:
    - **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids generally result in **high Fe/Hf values**, except when they have bulky aromatic side chains that cause steric hindrance, leading to **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Explanation*: The amino and carboxyl groups in α-amino acids provide coordination sites for Fe ions; bulky side chains may hinder coordination.
  - *Examples (High Fe/Hf)*:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine)
  - *Example (Low Fe/Hf)*:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan)

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with aliphatic carboxylic acids containing polyether chains (e.g., ethylene glycol units) and terminal or side-chain amino groups result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Explanation*: Oxygen atoms in polyether chains, along with amino groups, enhance coordination with Fe ions by providing multiple coordination sites.
  - *Examples (High Fe/Hf)*:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing highly fluorinated aliphatic chains result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Explanation*: Fluorine's high electronegativity withdraws electron density, reducing the coordinating ability of functional groups.
  - *Examples (Low Fe/Hf)*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing aromatic rings with electron-donating hydroxyl groups (phenolic –OH) result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Explanation*: Phenolic hydroxyl groups have delocalized lone pairs, decreasing their availability for coordination with Fe ions.
  - *Examples (Low Fe/Hf)*:
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with aromatic ketone groups conjugated with carboxylic acids result in **high Fe/Hf values** due to enhanced chelation.**

  - *Explanation*: Adjacent carbonyl groups can chelate Fe ions, forming stable complexes that enhance Fe incorporation.
  - *Examples (High Fe/Hf)*:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**

**End of Rules**

---

These rules capture the relationships between molecular modifiers and the Fe/Hf ratio based on structural features and underlying physical-chemical properties:

- **Combination of Substructures**: The rules consider combinations of functional groups, such as amino groups with aliphatic carboxylic acids, sulfur groups with carboxylic acids, and flexible linkers with heterocycles.

- **Physical-Chemical Considerations**: Coordination ability, electron density, steric factors, and chelation potential are taken into account to explain how different modifiers affect Fe/Hf values.

- **Clear Predictions**: Each rule predicts whether a modifier will result in high or low Fe/Hf values based on its structural features, allowing for straightforward application to new compounds.

- **Coverage and Balance**: The rules cover a broad range of modifiers in the dataset, balancing simple rules with higher coverage and more complex rules for specific cases.

By applying these rules, researchers can strategically select or design molecular modifiers to control the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst, optimizing the yield of the remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

---

**Note**: Some rules have been refined for clarity and accuracy. By focusing on the combinations of sub-structures and considering physical-chemical properties, these rules provide a robust framework for predicting the Fe/Hf ratio based on the molecular structure of modifiers.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Target Name: Fe/Hf
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing a primary aliphatic amino group (–NH₂) attached to a straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acid result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Explanation*: Primary aliphatic amines can effectively coordinate with Fe ions due to their available lone pair of electrons, enhancing metal-binding efficiency.
  - *Examples (High Fe/Hf)*:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
  - *Counterexamples (Low Fe/Hf)*:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (amine attached to aromatic ring; electron delocalization reduces coordination)

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers containing thiol groups (–SH) along with a carboxylic acid result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Explanation*: Thiol groups contain sulfur atoms that form strong coordination bonds with Fe ions due to their polarizable lone pairs.
  - *Examples (High Fe/Hf)*:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

- **Rule 3**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., nitro, halogens) result in **high Fe/Hf values**; those with electron-donating substituents (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, methyl) result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Explanation*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions, while electron-donating groups decrease acidity and coordination ability.
  - *Examples (High Fe/Hf)*:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
  - *Examples (Low Fe/Hf)*:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal hydroxyl group (–OH) result in **high Fe/Hf values**; those with multiple hydroxyl groups or aromatic hydroxyl groups result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Explanation*: A terminal aliphatic hydroxyl group can coordinate with Fe ions without significant steric hindrance, whereas multiple hydroxyls or phenolic hydroxyls may form internal hydrogen bonds or delocalize electron density, reducing coordination efficiency.
  - *Examples (High Fe/Hf)*:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
  - *Examples (Low Fe/Hf)*:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (multiple hydroxyl groups)
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (phenolic hydroxyl group)

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with flexible aliphatic linkers between a carboxylic acid and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle result in **high Fe/Hf values**; those where the heterocycle is directly attached to the carboxylic acid result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Explanation*: Flexible linkers reduce steric hindrance, allowing nitrogen atoms in heterocycles to effectively coordinate with Fe ions.
  - *Examples (High Fe/Hf)*:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (with an aliphatic bridge)
  - *Counterexamples (Low Fe/Hf)*:
    - **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (heterocycle directly attached; steric hindrance)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing polyether chains (e.g., ethylene glycol units) with terminal carboxylic acid groups result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Explanation*: Oxygen atoms in polyether chains provide additional coordination sites for Fe ions, enhancing metal-binding efficiency.
  - *Examples (High Fe/Hf)*:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with small side chains result in **high Fe/Hf values**; those with bulky or strongly electron-donating side chains result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Explanation*: Smaller side chains allow the amino and carboxyl groups to coordinate effectively with Fe ions, while bulky side chains cause steric hindrance or electron donation that reduces coordination efficiency.
  - *Examples (High Fe/Hf)*:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid)
  - *Examples (Low Fe/Hf)*:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid; longer side chain)
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan; bulky aromatic side chain)

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing aromatic rings with phenolic hydroxyl groups result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Explanation*: Phenolic hydroxyl groups have delocalized lone pairs due to resonance with the aromatic ring, decreasing their availability for coordination with Fe ions.
  - *Examples (Low Fe/Hf)*:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated aliphatic chains result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Explanation*: The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms withdraws electron density from potential coordinating sites, reducing coordination ability with Fe ions.
  - *Examples (Low Fe/Hf)*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing internal ketone groups within aliphatic carboxylic acids result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - *Explanation*: Internal ketone groups can introduce steric hindrance and electron-withdrawing effects, reducing the ability of nearby groups to coordinate with Fe ions.
  - *Examples (Low Fe/Hf)*:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

**End of Rules**

---

These rules capture the relationships between molecular modifiers and the Fe/Hf ratio based on structural features and underlying physical-chemical properties:

- **Combination of Functional Groups**: The rules consider how specific combinations of functional groups—such as amino groups with aliphatic chains, thiol groups with carboxylic acids, and electron-withdrawing substituents on aromatic rings—affect the Fe/Hf values.

- **Physical-Chemical Considerations**: Coordination ability, electron density, steric factors, and chelation potential are taken into account to explain how different modifiers influence Fe incorporation.

- **Clear Predictions**: Each rule predicts whether a modifier will result in high or low Fe/Hf values based on its structural features, allowing for straightforward application to new compounds.

- **Coverage and Balance**: The rules cover a broad range of modifiers in the dataset, balancing simple rules with higher coverage and more complex rules for specific cases.

By applying these rules, researchers can strategically select or design molecular modifiers to control the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst, thereby optimizing the yield of the remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

---

**Note**: The rules have been refined to ensure they are precise, clear, and aligned with the dataset. This approach ensures that the rules are practical for predicting Fe/Hf values and are based on sound chemical principles.---------------------------------------------------------------

    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing a primary aliphatic amino group (–NH₂) attached to a straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acid result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: The primary amino group can effectively coordinate with Fe ions, and the straight-chain aliphatic structure minimizes steric hindrance, enhancing coordination.
  - **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *5-aminopentanoic acid*
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*
  - **Counterexamples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid* (amino group attached to an aromatic ring reduces nitrogen's availability for coordination due to resonance)
    - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (additional carboxyl group introduces steric hindrance and charge repulsion)

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with small or moderate side chains result in **high Fe/Hf values**; those with bulky or heterocyclic side chains result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: Small side chains allow both the amino and carboxyl groups to coordinate effectively with Fe ions. Bulky or aromatic side chains introduce steric hindrance or delocalization of electrons, reducing coordination efficiency.
  - **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (aspartic acid)
    - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (phenylalanine; moderate-sized side chain)
  - **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (tryptophan; bulky indole ring)
    - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (glutamic acid; additional methylene group increases chain length and steric bulk)

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing thiol groups (–SH) along with carboxylic acids result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: Thiol groups have polarizable lone pairs on sulfur that strongly coordinate with Fe ions, enhancing Fe incorporation.
  - **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., nitro, halogens) result in **high Fe/Hf values**; those with electron-donating substituents (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, methoxy) result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing its ability to deprotonate and coordinate with Fe ions. Electron-donating groups reduce acidity and hinder coordination.
  - **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *4-nitrobenzoic acid*
    - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid*
  - **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid*
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid*
    - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with flexible aliphatic linkers connecting a carboxylic acid to a nitrogen-containing heterocycle result in **high Fe/Hf values**; those where the heterocycle is directly attached to the carboxylic acid result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: Flexible linkers reduce steric hindrance and allow the nitrogen in the heterocycle to effectively coordinate with Fe ions. Direct attachment limits flexibility and coordination efficiency.
  - **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid*
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (with an aliphatic spacer)
  - **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (nicotinic acid; heterocycle directly attached)
    - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing polyether chains (e.g., ethylene glycol units) with terminal carboxylic acid groups result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: Ether oxygen atoms along the polyether chain can coordinate with Fe ions, increasing the number of binding sites and enhancing Fe loading.
  - **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal hydroxyl group (–OH) result in **high Fe/Hf values**; those with multiple hydroxyl groups or aromatic hydroxyl groups result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: A terminal aliphatic hydroxyl group provides an additional coordination site without significant steric hindrance. Multiple hydroxyls or phenolic hydroxyls can engage in extensive hydrogen bonding or delocalization, which may reduce coordination with Fe ions.
  - **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*
  - **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (multiple hydroxyls)
    - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid* (phenolic hydroxyl)

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated aliphatic chains result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: Fluorine's strong electronegativity withdraws electron density, reducing the coordination ability of nearby functional groups with Fe ions.
  - **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*
    - *4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing internal ketone groups within aliphatic carboxylic acids result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: Internal ketone groups introduce steric hindrance and withdraw electron density, diminishing coordination sites for Fe ions.
  - **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with bulky aromatic substituents attached to aliphatic carboxylic acids result in **high Fe/Hf values** if the aromatic ring contains electron-donating methoxy groups; otherwise, they result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-donating methoxy groups increase electron density on the aromatic ring, enhancing coordination with Fe ions despite steric bulk.
  - **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid*
  - **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (phenolic hydroxyl without methoxy groups)

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with conjugated carbonyl groups (e.g., ketones, lactones) result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: Conjugated carbonyl groups can participate in chelation, providing additional coordination sites for Fe ions.
  - **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing amide linkages along with amino groups result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: Amide groups can coordinate with Fe ions through the lone pairs on nitrogen and oxygen, and adjacent amino groups enhance this effect by providing multiple coordination sites.
  - **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid*
    - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid*

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with amino groups attached directly to an aromatic ring result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: The lone pair on the aromatic amino nitrogen is delocalized into the ring, reducing its availability to coordinate with Fe ions.
  - **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase hydrogen bonding and steric bulk, hindering coordination with Fe ions.
  - **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid*
    - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to carboxylic acids result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to steric hindrance and less flexible coordination.**

  - **Explanation**: Direct attachment limits the nitrogen atom's ability to coordinate effectively with Fe ions because of restricted orientation and increased steric hindrance.
  - **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
    - *pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (nicotinic acid)

**End of Rules**

---

These revised rules have been carefully crafted to:

- **Illustrate Direct Combinations of Functional Groups**: Each rule focuses on specific combinations of functional groups (e.g., amino groups with aliphatic carboxylic acids) and how they influence Fe/Hf values.
  
- **Consider Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**: The rules are based on coordination chemistry principles, such as electron donation/withdrawal, steric hindrance, resonance effects, and chelation ability.
  
- **Provide Clear Predictions**: Each rule clearly predicts whether a modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value for any structure fitting its description.
  
- **Cover a Broad Range of the Dataset**: The rules collectively cover the majority of the modifiers in the dataset, ensuring that they are broadly applicable.
  
- **Maintain Balance Between Simple and Complex Rules**: There is a mix of simple rules with high coverage and more complex rules that address specific cases, achieving a suitable balance.

By applying these rules to new modifiers:

- **Designing Effective Modifiers**: Researchers can select or synthesize modifiers that are more likely to result in high Fe/Hf values by incorporating functional groups known to enhance Fe coordination.
  
- **Predicting Fe/Hf Values**: For any given modifier, one can refer to these rules to predict its impact on the Fe/Hf ratio, aiding in experimental planning.
  
- **Understanding Structure-Activity Relationships**: The rules shed light on how structural features influence Fe coordination, contributing to a deeper understanding of the system.

**Note**: These rules are based on the provided dataset and are intended to guide future research. Exceptions may occur, and experimental verification is recommended for novel modifiers.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Target Name: Fe/Hf
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal primary amino group (–NH₂) result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: The primary amino group can coordinate strongly with Fe ions, enhancing Fe incorporation into the metal-organic layer. The flexible aliphatic chain allows for optimal coordination geometry without significant steric hindrance.
  - **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *5-aminopentanoic acid*
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*
  - **Counterexamples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *Octanoic acid* (lacks amino group)
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid* (amino group attached to an aromatic ring, reducing availability due to resonance stabilization)

---

- **Rule 2**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position result in **high Fe/Hf values**; those with electron-donating substituents result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halogens) increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions. Electron-donating groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, methyl) decrease acidity and may hinder coordination due to increased electron density and resonance effects.
  - **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *4-nitrobenzoic acid*
    - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid*
  - **Counterexamples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid*
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid*
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing thiol groups (–SH) along with carboxylic acids result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: Thiol groups have a high affinity for metal ions due to their polarizable sulfur atoms, forming strong coordinate bonds with Fe ions and enhancing Fe incorporation.
  - **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with polyether chains (e.g., ethylene glycol units) connected to a terminal carboxylic acid result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: The ether oxygen atoms along the chain can act as additional coordination sites for Fe ions, increasing the overall binding affinity and promoting higher Fe loading.
  - **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with small or unbranched side chains result in **high Fe/Hf values**; those with bulky or complex side chains result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: The amino and carboxylate groups in α-amino acids can chelate Fe ions effectively. Small side chains reduce steric hindrance, allowing better coordination. Bulky side chains can hinder coordination due to increased steric bulk.
  - **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (aspartic acid)
  - **Counterexamples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (glutamic acid; longer side chain)
    - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (tryptophan; bulky indole ring)

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, methoxy) on the aromatic ring result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups increase the electron density on the aromatic ring, decreasing the acidity of the carboxylic acid and its ability to coordinate with Fe ions. Additionally, resonance effects may delocalize electron density away from coordination sites.
  - **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid*
    - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially on aliphatic chains or sugar moieties, result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase steric hindrance and promote extensive hydrogen bonding, which can interfere with effective coordination of Fe ions.
  - **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (gluconic acid)
    - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing perfluorinated aliphatic chains result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: Perfluorinated chains are highly electronegative, withdrawing electron density from the carboxylate group and reducing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions.
  - **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with aldehyde groups attached to aromatic rings result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups can engage in side reactions or oxidize, leading to instability. They also withdraw electron density, reducing the effectiveness of the carboxylate group in coordinating with Fe ions.
  - **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles (e.g., pyridine) with available nitrogen atoms for coordination result in **high Fe/Hf values** when connected via flexible linkers; direct attachment to the carboxylic acid may result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles can serve as coordination sites for Fe ions. Flexible linkers allow for favorable coordination geometry, enhancing Fe incorporation. Direct attachment may limit flexibility and hinder coordination.
  - **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid* (flexible linker)
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (aromatic spacer with some flexibility)
  - **Counterexamples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (nicotinic acid; direct attachment reduces flexibility)

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with internal ketone groups within aliphatic chains result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: Internal ketone groups can introduce steric hindrance and act as additional electron-withdrawing groups, reducing the coordinating ability of nearby functional groups with Fe ions.
  - **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing ether-functionalized aliphatic chains with terminal amino groups result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: Ether oxygen atoms and terminal amino groups provide multiple coordination sites, enhancing the ability to chelate Fe ions effectively.
  - **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: Without extra functional groups to provide additional coordination sites, these modifiers have limited ability to chelate Fe ions effectively.
  - **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *Octanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing sulfur in side chains as thioethers or sulfides result in **high Fe/Hf values** due to enhanced coordination with Fe ions.**

  - **Explanation**: Sulfur atoms in thioethers or sulfides can coordinate with Fe ions via lone pairs, increasing Fe incorporation.
  - **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid* (contains a methylthio group)
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* (thiol group)

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with bulky aromatic side chains may result in **high Fe/Hf values** if the side chains contribute to coordination; otherwise, they result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to steric hindrance.**

  - **Explanation**: Bulky aromatic side chains can either hinder Fe coordination due to steric effects or enhance it if they contain coordinating functional groups (e.g., methoxy groups) that interact with Fe ions.
  - **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid* (methoxy groups can coordinate)
    - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (phenylalanine; phenyl ring may assist in coordination)
  - **Counterexamples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (tryptophan; bulky indole ring without effective coordination)

---

**End of Rules**

---

**Application and Interpretation:**

- **Predictive Power**: These rules can be applied to predict whether a new molecular modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value based on its structural features.
- **Design Guidance**: Researchers can design new modifiers that are more likely to enhance Fe loading by incorporating functional groups known to promote high Fe/Hf values.
- **Understanding Interactions**: The rules highlight the importance of coordination chemistry in modifier performance, emphasizing how functional groups interact with Fe ions.

**Key Considerations:**

- **Functional Groups**: The presence and type of functional groups (e.g., amino, thiol, ether, electron-withdrawing/donating groups) play a crucial role in determining Fe/Hf ratios.
- **Steric Effects**: Bulky groups can either hinder or enhance coordination depending on their ability to interact with Fe ions.
- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups enhance coordination by increasing acidity, while electron-donating groups can decrease coordination ability.
- **Flexibility**: Flexible linkers can improve coordination by allowing functional groups to adopt favorable geometries for Fe binding.

**Note on Rule Development:**

- **Coverage Balance**: The rules aim to cover a broad range of modifiers while maintaining specificity based on combined structural features.
- **Chemical Principles**: Each rule is grounded in fundamental principles of coordination chemistry, sterics, and electronics.
- **Dataset Alignment**: The rules are derived from patterns observed in the provided dataset, ensuring relevance and applicability.

**Final Remarks:**

By utilizing these rules, researchers can better understand the relationship between molecular modifiers and Fe/Hf ratios, aiding in the optimization of catalytic systems for the targeted radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. Experimental validation remains essential to confirm predictions and refine the rules further.

    Target Name: Fe/Hf
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing both a carboxylic acid group and a primary amino group (–NH₂) on a flexible aliphatic chain (with at least three carbon atoms) result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: The combination of carboxyl and amino groups on a flexible chain allows for effective chelation of Fe ions, enhancing Fe binding and incorporation into the catalyst.

  - **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *5-aminopentanoic acid*
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*
    - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (aspartic acid)
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid*

  - **Counterexamples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (glutamic acid; possible intramolecular interactions reduce Fe coordination)

---

- **Rule 2**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position result in **high Fe/Hf values**; those with electron-donating groups result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing its ability to deprotonate and coordinate with Fe ions. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity, reducing coordination effectiveness.

  - **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *4-nitrobenzoic acid* (–NO₂ group)
    - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid* (–CH₂Br group)
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* (–SH group)

  - **Counterexamples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid* (–NH₂ group)
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (–CH₃ group)
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (–OH group)

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that contain thiol groups (–SH) result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: Thiol groups have a strong affinity for Fe ions due to the lone pair on sulfur, facilitating coordination and enhancing Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

  - **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with polyether chains (e.g., repeating –O–CH₂–CH₂– units) linked to carboxylic acids result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: The ether oxygen atoms can act as additional coordination sites for Fe ions, increasing binding affinity through multiple coordination points along the chain.

  - **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: The absence of extra coordination sites limits Fe binding efficiency; only the carboxyl group is available, which may not suffice for strong Fe coordination.

  - **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *Octanoic acid*
    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups on rigid structures, such as sugar moieties, result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can engage in intramolecular hydrogen bonding, reducing their availability to coordinate with Fe ions, and the rigidity may hinder effective Fe binding.

  - **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (gluconic acid)
    - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles connected via flexible linkers to carboxylic acids result in **high Fe/Hf values**; direct attachment without a linker often leads to **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: Flexible linkers allow the nitrogen atoms in heterocycles to coordinate effectively with Fe ions by reducing steric hindrance.

  - **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid*
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*

  - **Counterexample (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (nicotinic acid; direct attachment may limit coordination due to rigidity)

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: Perfluorinated chains are highly electronegative and hydrophobic, which can repel Fe ions and reduce the electron density available for coordination.

  - **Example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with bulky aromatic groups lacking coordinating substituents result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: Bulky groups increase steric hindrance around potential coordination sites, impeding Fe binding.

  - **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (tryptophan)
    - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers combining carboxylic acid groups with amide functionalities adjacent to amino groups result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: Amide and amino groups provide additional coordination sites for Fe ions, enhancing binding through chelation.

  - **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid*
    - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid*

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with electron-donating groups (e.g., –OH, –NH₂) directly attached to aromatic rings without additional coordinating groups result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, reducing its propensity to coordinate with Fe ions.

  - **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid*
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid*
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with conjugated keto-carboxylic acid structures in rigid rings capable of chelation result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: Chelation through conjugated systems stabilizes the Fe complex, enhancing Fe binding and incorporation.

  - **Example (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing aliphatic chains with hydroxyl groups result in variable Fe/Hf values; the presence of additional coordinating groups determines the outcome.**

  - **Explanation**: Hydroxyl groups may coordinate with Fe ions, but effectiveness depends on chain flexibility and other coordinating functionalities.

  - **Example (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (High Fe/Hf due to chain flexibility and hydroxyl coordination)

  - **Counterexamples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *Octanoic acid* (No hydroxyl groups)
    - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid* (Bulky aromatic group may hinder coordination)

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic dicarboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: While possessing two carboxylic acid groups, the lack of other coordinating sites limits effective Fe binding.

  - **Example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that contain sulfur atoms in thioether linkages adjacent to amino groups result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

  - **Explanation**: Sulfur atoms enhance coordination with Fe ions, and the proximity of amino groups provides additional binding sites for effective chelation.

  - **Example (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid*

---

**End of Rules**

**Application and Interpretation:**

- **Predictive Use**: Use these rules to assess new modifiers by identifying their functional groups and structural features. Determine if they match the criteria for high or low Fe/Hf values based on the combination of substructures described.

- **Design Guidance**:

  - To achieve **high Fe/Hf values**, consider modifiers that:

    - Include both carboxyl and primary amino groups on flexible aliphatic chains (Rule 1).
    - Possess aromatic rings with strong electron-withdrawing groups at key positions (Rule 2).
    - Contain thiol or thioether groups (Rule 3 and Rule 15).
    - Incorporate polyether chains with additional coordinating groups (Rule 4).
    - Feature nitrogen-containing heterocycles connected via flexible linkers (Rule 7).
    - Combine amide functionalities with carboxylic acids and amino groups (Rule 10).
    - Have rigid conjugated systems capable of chelation (Rule 12).

  - To avoid **low Fe/Hf values**, be cautious with modifiers that:

    - Lack additional coordinating groups beyond the carboxylic acid (Rule 5).
    - Have multiple hydroxyl groups on rigid structures without other coordinating sites (Rule 6).
    - Present bulky aromatic rings without coordinating substituents (Rule 9).
    - Contain perfluorinated chains (Rule 8).
    - Possess electron-donating groups directly attached to aromatic rings without other coordination potential (Rule 11).
    - Include aliphatic dicarboxylic acids without other coordinating groups (Rule 14).

- **Chemical Considerations**:

  - **Coordination Sites**: Functional groups like amino, thiol, ether oxygen, amide nitrogen, and heterocyclic nitrogen enhance Fe coordination by providing lone pairs for binding.

  - **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase acidity and promote Fe coordination; electron-donating groups have the opposite effect.

  - **Steric Effects**: Flexible linkers and smaller substituents facilitate Fe binding by reducing steric hindrance around coordination sites.

  - **Chelation**: Structures capable of forming chelate rings with Fe ions significantly enhance coordination due to increased complex stability.

---

**Final Remarks:**

These rules capture the key structural features influencing Fe/Hf values by combining multiple functional groups and considering their electronic and steric effects. By applying these rules, researchers can predict the Fe/Hf outcome for new modifiers and design molecules that optimize Fe incorporation into the catalyst. Balancing broad coverage with specific structural insights, this set of rules provides a practical framework for guiding modifier selection in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

    Target Name: Fe/Hf
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

**Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing both an amino group (–NH₂) and a carboxylic acid group on flexible aliphatic chains result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: The amino and carboxylate groups can act as bidentate ligands, effectively coordinating with Fe ions. The flexibility of the aliphatic chain allows optimal positioning for chelation, enhancing Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

- **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
  - *5-aminopentanoic acid*
  - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
  - *8-aminooctanoic acid*
  - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid*

- **Counterexamples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (presence of an additional carboxylic acid group may interfere with coordination)
  - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (bulky aromatic side chain causing steric hindrance)

---

**Rule 2**: **Modifiers containing thiol groups (–SH) adjacent to carboxylic acids result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: Thiol groups have a strong affinity for Fe ions due to the lone pair electrons on sulfur. The proximity of –SH to the carboxylate allows for multidentate coordination, enhancing Fe incorporation.

- **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
  - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*
  - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid*
  - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid*

---

**Rule 3**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position result in **high Fe/Hf values**; those with electron-donating groups (EDGs) result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing its ability to deprotonate and coordinate with Fe ions. EDGs decrease acidity and coordination ability.

- **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
  - *4-nitrobenzoic acid* (–NO₂ group)
  - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid* (–CH₂Br group)

- **Counterexamples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - *4-aminobenzoic acid* (–NH₂ group, EDG)
  - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (–CH₃ group, EDG)

---

**Rule 4**: **Modifiers with polyether chains (e.g., repeating –O–CH₂–CH₂– units) linked to carboxylic acids result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: Ether oxygen atoms can coordinate with Fe ions. Multiple oxygens along the chain increase the overall binding affinity through multidentate interactions, enhancing Fe incorporation.

- **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
  - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
  - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

---

**Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups on rigid cyclic structures result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: The rigidity and potential intramolecular hydrogen bonding reduce the availability of hydroxyl groups to coordinate with Fe ions, limiting Fe incorporation.

- **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (gluconic acid)
  - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*

---

**Rule 6**: **Perfluorinated carboxylic acids result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: The highly electronegative fluorine atoms withdraw electron density from the carboxylate oxygen, decreasing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

- **Example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*

---

**Rule 7**: **Aliphatic carboxylic acids lacking additional coordinating groups beyond the carboxylate result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: A single carboxylate does not provide sufficient coordination sites for effective Fe binding compared to modifiers with additional functional groups.

- **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - *Octanoic acid*
  - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*
  - *4-formylbenzoic acid*

---

**Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles connected via flexible aliphatic linkers to carboxylic acids result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: The heterocyclic nitrogen and carboxylate can coordinate with Fe ions. Flexible linkers reduce steric hindrance, facilitating effective multidentate binding.

- **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
  - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid*
  - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*

- **Counterexample (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (nicotinic acid; direct attachment limits flexibility)

---

**Rule 9**: **Modifiers with bulky aromatic groups lacking additional coordinating substituents result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to steric hindrance.**

- **Explanation**: Bulky groups can impede access of Fe ions to coordinating sites, reducing Fe incorporation.

- **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (tryptophan)
  - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*

---

**Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing hydroxyl groups on flexible aliphatic chains result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: Hydroxyl groups act as additional coordination sites. Flexibility of the chain allows simultaneous coordination of the hydroxyl and carboxylate groups with Fe ions.

- **Example (High Fe/Hf)**:
  - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*

- **Counterexamples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid* (hydroxyl on aromatic ring, sterically hindered)

---

**Rule 11**: **Modifiers with electron-donating groups (e.g., –OH, –NH₂) directly attached to aromatic rings without additional coordinating groups result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, reducing its ability to deprotonate and coordinate with Fe ions.

- **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - *4-aminobenzoic acid*
  - *4-methylbenzoic acid*
  - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*

---

**Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing ketone groups conjugated with carboxylic acids in aromatic systems capable of chelation result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: The conjugated carbonyl and carboxylate groups can form chelate complexes with Fe ions, enhancing Fe incorporation due to increased binding stability.

- **Example (High Fe/Hf)**:
  - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*

---

**Rule 13**: **Modifiers with aldehyde groups adjacent to carboxylic acids result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to limited coordination capability.**

- **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups do not effectively coordinate with Fe ions, and their proximity to the carboxylate may hinder its coordination potential.

- **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
  - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*

---

**Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing both ether linkages and amino groups on flexible chains result in **high Fe/Hf values** due to multiple coordination sites.**

- **Explanation**: Ether oxygen atoms and amino groups provide additional lone pairs for Fe coordination. Chain flexibility facilitates effective binding.

- **Example (High Fe/Hf)**:
  - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

---

**Rule 15**: **Perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to decreased electron density on coordinating atoms.**

- **Explanation**: The strong electron-withdrawing effects of fluorine atoms reduce the ability of the carboxylate oxygen to donate electron density for coordination with Fe ions.

- **Example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*

---

**End of Rules**

---

**Application and Interpretation:**

- **Predictive Use**: Apply these rules to new modifiers by identifying their functional groups and structural features. Predict whether they will result in high or low Fe/Hf values based on the combination of substructures described.

- **Design Guidance**:

  - To achieve **high Fe/Hf values**, consider modifiers that:

    - Contain amino groups and carboxylic acids on flexible aliphatic chains (Rule 1).
    - Include thiol groups adjacent to carboxylic acids (Rule 2).
    - Have aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position (Rule 3).
    - Incorporate polyether chains with multiple ether oxygens (Rule 4).
    - Feature nitrogen heterocycles linked via flexible chains (Rule 8).
    - Contain hydroxyl groups on flexible aliphatic chains (Rule 10).
    - Include conjugated ketone-carboxylic acid systems capable of chelation (Rule 12).
    - Combine ether linkages and amino groups on flexible chains (Rule 14).

  - To avoid **low Fe/Hf values**, be cautious with modifiers that:

    - Lack additional coordinating groups beyond the carboxylic acid (Rule 7).
    - Have multiple hydroxyl groups on rigid cyclic structures (Rule 5).
    - Are perfluorinated carboxylic acids (Rules 6 and 15).
    - Present bulky aromatic groups without coordinating substituents (Rule 9).
    - Contain electron-donating groups directly attached to aromatic rings without other coordination potential (Rule 11).
    - Include aldehyde groups adjacent to carboxylic acids (Rule 13).

- **Chemical Considerations**:

  - **Coordination Sites**: Functional groups such as amino, thiol, ether oxygen, and heterocyclic nitrogen atoms enhance Fe coordination by providing lone pairs for binding.

  - **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity and coordination ability of carboxylic acids. Electron-donating groups have the opposite effect.

  - **Steric Effects**: Flexible chains and smaller substituents reduce steric hindrance, facilitating effective Fe binding. Bulky groups may hinder coordination.

  - **Chelation**: Multidentate ligands that can form chelate rings with Fe ions enhance complex stability and Fe incorporation.

---

**Final Remarks:**

These rules capture the relationship between the structural features of molecular modifiers and their impact on Fe/Hf values in the catalyst. By combining multiple functional groups and considering electronic and steric factors, the rules provide a practical framework for predicting and optimizing Fe incorporation. Researchers can use these guidelines to select or design modifiers that enhance catalytic performance in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Target Name: Fe/Hf
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

### **Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing amino groups (–NH₂) on flexible aliphatic chains ending with a carboxylic acid result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: Amino groups can coordinate with Fe ions, and flexible aliphatic chains allow both the amino and carboxylate groups to chelate the Fe center effectively. This multidentate binding enhances Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

- **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
  - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
  - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

- **Counterexamples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (additional carboxylate may create steric hindrance)
  - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (amino group on rigid aromatic ring reduces flexibility)

---

### **Rule 2**: **Modifiers with thiol groups (–SH) adjacent to carboxylic acids result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: Thiol groups are strong ligands due to the polarizable sulfur atom. When near carboxylic acids, they can form chelating ligands with Fe ions, enhancing Fe incorporation.

- **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
  - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**
  - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

---

### **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing pyridine rings connected via flexible linkers to carboxylic acids result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with Fe ions. Flexible linkers allow simultaneous coordination of the pyridine nitrogen and carboxylate oxygen, enhancing Fe binding.

- **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

- **Counterexample (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (rigidity limits chelation)

---

### **Rule 4**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position result in **high Fe/Hf values**; those with electron-donating groups (EDGs) result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing its ability to deprotonate and coordinate with Fe ions. EDGs decrease acidity, reducing coordination ability.

- **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
  - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (–NO₂ group, strong EWG)
  - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (–CH₂Br group, EWG)

- **Counterexamples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (–CH₃ group, EDG)
  - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (–NH₂ group, EDG)

---

### **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with flexible polyether chains connected to carboxylic acids result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: Ether oxygens can coordinate with Fe ions. Flexible polyether chains provide multiple coordination sites, enhancing multidentate binding and Fe incorporation.

- **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
  - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

---

### **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with hydroxyl groups (–OH) on flexible aliphatic chains result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: Hydroxyl groups can coordinate with Fe ions. Flexibility allows hydroxyl and carboxylate groups to chelate Fe ions effectively.

- **Example (High Fe/Hf)**:
  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

- **Counterexample (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (hydroxyl on rigid aromatic ring)

---

### **Rule 7**: **Amino acids with side chains capable of additional coordination result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: Side chains with functional groups (e.g., additional amino or carboxyl groups) can enhance coordination with Fe ions.

- **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
  - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid)
  - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (lysine derivative)

- **Counterexample (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid; increased chain length may reduce coordination efficiency)

---

### **Rule 8**: **Modifiers lacking additional coordinating groups beyond the carboxylic acid result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: Single coordination sites are less effective in incorporating Fe ions compared to multidentate ligands.

- **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **Octanoic acid**
  - **4-methylbenzoic acid**

---

### **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with bulky or rigid aromatic substituents without additional coordinating groups result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to steric hindrance.**

- **Explanation**: Bulky groups can hinder access of Fe ions to coordination sites.

- **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan)
  - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**

---

### **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing perfluorinated chains result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to decreased electron density on coordinating atoms.**

- **Explanation**: Fluorine's high electronegativity withdraws electron density, weakening coordination ability.

- **Example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

---

### **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on rigid cyclic structures result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: Rigid structures may prevent effective coordination due to lack of flexibility.

- **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid)
  - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**

---

### **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with aldehyde groups adjacent to carboxylic acids result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups may participate in side reactions or reduce overall coordination efficiency.

- **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
  - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

---

### **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic rings without electron-withdrawing substituents result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups decrease acidity, reducing coordination ability.

- **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (–NH₂ group)
  - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (–OH group)

---

### **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with rigid heterocycles directly attached to carboxylic acids without flexible linkers result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: Lack of flexibility limits effective coordination of heteroatoms with Fe ions.

- **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
  - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

---

### **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing conjugated systems capable of chelation through multiple coordinating atoms result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: Conjugated systems with multiple donor atoms form stable complexes with Fe ions.

- **Example (High Fe/Hf)**:
  - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

---

**End of Rules**

---

**Application and Interpretation:**

- **Predictive Use**: To predict whether a modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value, identify the presence of functional groups and structural features as outlined in the rules.

- **Design Guidance**:
  - **For High Fe/Hf Values**:
    - Include amino groups on flexible chains (**Rule 1**).
    - Use thiol groups near carboxylic acids (**Rule 2**).
    - Connect pyridine rings with flexible linkers (**Rule 3**).
    - Incorporate EWGs on aromatic rings (**Rule 4**).
    - Utilize flexible polyether chains (**Rule 5**).
    - Add hydroxyl groups on flexible chains (**Rule 6**).
    - Select amino acids with coordinating side chains (**Rule 7**).
    - Design conjugated systems with multiple donor atoms (**Rule 15**).
  - **For Low Fe/Hf Values**:
    - Avoid modifiers with only a carboxylic acid group (**Rule 8**).
    - Steer clear of bulky aromatic groups without coordinating sites (**Rule 9**).
    - Limit perfluorinated chains (**Rule 10**).
    - Refrain from rigid structures with multiple hydroxyls (**Rule 11**).
    - Avoid aldehyde groups adjacent to carboxylic acids (**Rule 12**).
    - Do not use electron-rich aromatics without EWGs (**Rule 13**).
    - Avoid rigid heterocycles without flexible linkers (**Rule 14**).

**Chemical Considerations:**

- **Coordination Sites**: Functional groups with lone pairs (–NH₂, –SH, –OH, ether oxygens, pyridine nitrogen) enhance Fe coordination.

- **Flexibility**: Flexible chains enable multidentate binding, increasing Fe incorporation.

- **Steric Effects**: Bulky and rigid structures hinder coordination due to steric hindrance.

- **Electronic Effects**: EWGs increase acidity, improving Fe binding; EDGs decrease it.

- **Chelation**: Multidentate ligands form stable complexes with Fe ions.

By applying these rules, researchers can design molecular modifiers to optimize Fe incorporation into the Hf-TPY-MOL catalyst, enhancing the performance of the target reaction.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

### **Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing amino groups (–NH₂) on flexible aliphatic chains with terminal carboxylic acids result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: Amino groups can coordinate with Fe ions, and flexible aliphatic chains allow both amino and carboxylate groups to chelate the Fe center effectively. This multidentate binding enhances Fe incorporation into the catalyst.

- **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
  - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
  - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
  - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid)

- **Counterexamples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **Octanoic acid** (lacks amino group)
  - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid; additional carboxyl group may hinder coordination)

---

### **Rule 2**: **Modifiers with thiol groups (–SH) near carboxylic acids result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: Thiol groups are strong ligands due to the polarizable sulfur atom. When near carboxylic acids, they form chelating ligands with Fe ions, enhancing Fe incorporation through multidentate coordination.

- **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
  - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**
  - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

---

### **Rule 3**: **Modifiers featuring pyridine rings connected via flexible linkers to carboxylic acids result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: The nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring coordinates with Fe ions. Flexible linkers allow simultaneous coordination of the pyridine nitrogen and carboxylate oxygen, enhancing multidentate binding.

- **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

- **Counterexample (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (rigid connection limits chelation)

---

### **Rule 4**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position result in **high Fe/Hf values**; those with electron-donating groups (EDGs) result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing its ability to deprotonate and coordinate with Fe ions. EDGs decrease acidity, reducing coordination ability.

- **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
  - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (–NO₂ group, strong EWG)
  - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (–CH₂Br group, EWG)

- **Counterexamples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (–CH₃ group, EDG)
  - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (–NH₂ group, EDG)

---

### **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with flexible polyether chains connected to carboxylic acids result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: Ether oxygens coordinate with Fe ions. Flexible polyether chains provide multiple coordination sites, enhancing multidentate binding and Fe incorporation.

- **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
  - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

---

### **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with hydroxyl groups (–OH) on flexible aliphatic chains result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: Hydroxyl groups can coordinate with Fe ions. Flexibility allows hydroxyl and carboxylate groups to chelate Fe ions effectively, promoting multidentate interactions.

- **Example (High Fe/Hf)**:
  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

- **Counterexample (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (hydroxyl on a rigid aromatic ring reduces flexibility)

---

### **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing amino acids with side chains capable of additional coordination result in **high Fe/Hf values** if the side chain has functional groups capable of coordinating (e.g., –OH, –SH); bulky aromatic side chains result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: Side chains with coordinating groups enhance Fe binding through multidentate interactions. Bulky aromatic side chains without coordinating groups hinder effective Fe coordination due to steric effects.

- **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
  - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid; side-chain carboxyl improves coordination)
  - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (lysine derivative)

- **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan; bulky indole ring)
  - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine; lacks additional coordinating groups)

---

### **Rule 8**: **Modifiers lacking additional coordinating groups beyond the carboxylic acid result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: Single coordination sites are less effective in incorporating Fe ions compared to multidentate ligands, which offer multiple binding sites.

- **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **Octanoic acid**
  - **4-methylbenzoic acid**

---

### **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated chains result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to decreased electron density on coordinating atoms.**

- **Explanation**: Fluorine's high electronegativity withdraws electron density, weakening coordination ability of donor atoms like oxygen in carboxylate groups.

- **Example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

---

### **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with aldehyde groups adjacent to carboxylic acids result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups may engage in side reactions or inhibit effective coordination with Fe ions due to potential reactivity or electronic effects.

- **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
  - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

---

### **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with rigid heterocycles directly attached to carboxylic acids without flexible linkers result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: Rigidity limits the ability of heteroatoms to align properly for coordination, reducing Fe incorporation.

- **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
  - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

---

### **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on rigid structures result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to steric hindrance and decreased coordination ability.**

- **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can create steric bulk, hindering access to coordination sites and reducing effective Fe binding.

- **Example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**

---

### **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with bulky or rigid aromatic substituents without additional coordinating groups result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: Bulky groups can hinder Fe ions from accessing coordination sites, and rigidity limits functional group alignment for coordination.

- **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid**
  - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**

---

### **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acids on aliphatic chains may result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to competing coordination or steric effects.**

- **Explanation**: Ketone oxygen may compete with carboxylate for coordination or introduce steric hindrance, reducing Fe incorporation.

- **Example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

---

### **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with electron-rich heterocycles directly attached to carboxylic acids without flexible linkers result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: Electron-rich heterocycles may not coordinate effectively with Fe ions if rigidity prevents optimal alignment, reducing Fe incorporation.

- **Example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
  - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**

---

**End of Rules**

---

**Application and Interpretation:**

- **Predictive Use**: To predict whether a modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value, identify the presence of functional groups and structural features as outlined in the rules.

- **Design Guidance**:

  - **For High Fe/Hf Values**:

    - **Incorporate Multidentate Ligands**: Use modifiers with multiple coordinating groups (e.g., amino, thiol, hydroxyl, ether oxygens) that can chelate Fe ions effectively (**Rules 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7**).

    - **Enhance Flexibility**: Choose modifiers with flexible aliphatic chains or linkers that allow coordinating groups to align properly for multidentate binding (**Rules 1, 3, 5, 6**).

    - **Increase Acidity with EWGs**: Employ aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents to enhance coordination via increased acidity (**Rule 4**).

  - **For Low Fe/Hf Values**:

    - **Avoid Monodentate Ligands**: Steer clear of modifiers that offer only a single coordination site, such as a sole carboxylic acid (**Rule 8**).

    - **Limit Steric Hindrance**: Avoid bulky or rigid structures without additional coordinating groups, as they hinder effective Fe coordination (**Rules 11, 12, 13**).

    - **Consider Electronic Effects**: Be cautious with modifiers containing strong electron-withdrawing groups that overly reduce electron density on donor atoms (e.g., perfluorinated chains) (**Rule 9**).

    - **Exclude Reactive Groups**: Refrain from using modifiers with potentially reactive functional groups adjacent to coordination sites, such as aldehydes and ketones (**Rules 10, 14**).

- **Chemical Considerations**:

  - **Coordination Sites**: Functional groups with lone pairs (–NH₂, –SH, –OH, ether oxygens, pyridine nitrogen) enhance coordination with Fe ions. Multidentate ligands increase stability and Fe incorporation.

  - **Flexibility vs. Rigidity**: Flexibility in molecular structure allows for optimal alignment of coordinating groups, promoting effective multidentate binding. Rigid structures may prevent coordination due to steric constraints.

  - **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase acidity and promote deprotonation of the carboxylic acid, facilitating binding to Fe ions. However, excessively electron-deficient donor atoms (e.g., from perfluorination) may have reduced coordinating ability.

  - **Steric Effects**: Bulky substituents can impede the approach of Fe ions to coordination sites, reducing the effectiveness of the modifier.

  - **Reactivity of Functional Groups**: Functional groups prone to side reactions (e.g., aldehydes, ketones) may interfere with coordination processes or catalyst stability.

**Conclusion:**

By applying these refined rules, researchers can rationally design molecular modifiers that optimize Fe incorporation into the Hf-TPY-MOL catalyst. Selecting modifiers that promote high Fe/Hf values can enhance the catalytic performance of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. Understanding the balance between ligand flexibility, coordination sites, electronic properties, and steric factors is crucial in the design of effective modifiers.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

### **Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing amino groups (–NH₂) on flexible aliphatic chains terminating with carboxylic acid groups result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: The presence of amino and carboxylate groups on a flexible chain allows for effective chelation with Fe ions through multidentate coordination.

- **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid**

- **Counterexamples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - **Octanoic acid** (lacks amino group)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (additional carboxyl group may affect coordination differently)

---

### **Rule 2**: **Modifiers with multiple coordinating groups (e.g., amino, thiol, hydroxyl, ether oxygens) on flexible aliphatic chains result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: Multiple coordinating sites enhance Fe ion binding through multidentate interactions, and chain flexibility allows simultaneous coordination.

- **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (thiol and carboxylate groups)
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (hydroxyl and carboxylate groups)
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (ether oxygens and carboxylate group)
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (amino, ether oxygens, and carboxylate group)

---

### **Rule 3**: **Modifiers featuring nitrogen-containing aromatic rings (e.g., pyridine) connected via flexible linkers to carboxylic acids result in **high Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: The nitrogen atom in the aromatic ring coordinates with Fe ions, and the flexible linker facilitates effective multidentate binding alongside the carboxylate group.

- **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

- **Counterexample (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (rigid attachment limits effective coordination)

---

### **Rule 4**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at positions that enhance coordination result in **high Fe/Hf values**; those with electron-donating groups (EDGs) result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: EWGs increase the acidity and coordinating ability of the carboxylate group by withdrawing electron density, while EDGs decrease it by donating electron density.

- **Examples (High Fe/Hf)**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (–NO₂ group)
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (–CH₂Br group)

- **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (–NH₂ group)
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (–CH₃ group)

---

### **Rule 5**: **Modifiers lacking additional coordinating groups beyond the carboxylic acid result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: Without additional ligating groups, the modifiers act as monodentate ligands, which are less effective in Fe coordination compared to multidentate ligands.

- **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - **Octanoic acid**
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**

---

### **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated chains result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to decreased electron density on coordinating atoms.**

- **Explanation**: Highly electronegative fluorine atoms withdraw electron density, weakening the ability of coordinating groups to bind Fe ions.

- **Example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

---

### **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with bulky or rigid structures lacking additional coordinating groups result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: Steric hindrance from bulky or rigid moieties impedes effective coordination with Fe ions.

- **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

---

### **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with rigid heterocycles directly attached to carboxylic acids without flexible linkers result in **low Fe/Hf values**.**

- **Explanation**: The rigidity limits the ability of coordinating atoms to align properly with Fe ions for effective binding.

- **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

---

### **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on rigid structures result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to steric hindrance and reduced coordination effectiveness.**

- **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups on a rigid backbone can create steric bulk, hindering the approach and binding of Fe ions.

- **Example (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**

---

### **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing ketone or aldehyde groups adjacent to carboxylic acids result in **low Fe/Hf values** due to potential side reactions or interference with coordination.**

- **Explanation**: Carbonyl groups may compete with carboxylate groups for coordination or undergo side reactions, reducing Fe incorporation.

- **Examples (Low Fe/Hf)**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

---
