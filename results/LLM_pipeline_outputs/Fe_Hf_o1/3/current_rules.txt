**End of Rules**

**Summary:**

These rules have been developed by analyzing the dataset and applying principles of coordination chemistry. Each rule identifies specific combinations of functional groups that influence the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst.

**Key Concepts:**

1. **Coordination Sites:** Functional groups such as thiols, amino groups, pyridine nitrogens, ether oxygens, and hydroxyl groups can coordinate with Fe ions.

2. **Electronic Effects:** Electron-withdrawing groups increase carboxylic acid acidity, enhancing coordination. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity, hindering coordination.

3. **Steric Factors:** Bulky groups near coordinating sites can cause steric hindrance, reducing interaction with Fe ions.

4. **Chain Length and Flexibility:** Longer chains with flexible linkages allow better positioning of coordinating groups for effective chelation.

5. **Multiplicity of Functional Groups:** Multiple coordinating sites enhance Fe incorporation if appropriately positioned and not competing.

**Application:**

By applying these rules, researchers can predict whether a molecular modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value based on its structural features. This aids in the design and selection of modifiers to optimize catalyst performance.

**Balance and Coverage:**

- **Simple rules with higher coverage:** Rules 1, 2, 3, and 7 cover common functional group patterns affecting Fe/Hf values.
- **Complex rules with lower coverage:** Rules like 11 address specific structural features observed in fewer compounds.
- This balance ensures practical applicability and detailed predictions.

**Note on Improvement:**

- The rules have been refined to enhance clarity and accuracy, focusing on clear, evidence-backed relationships that align with chemical principles and the observed data.
- Ineffective or unsupported rules from previous analyses have been revised or omitted.

**Conclusion:**

These refined rules provide a comprehensive understanding of how different functional groups and molecular structures influence the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst. By considering the combined effects of electronic properties, coordination ability, and steric factors, these rules serve as a valuable tool for predicting the performance of molecular modifiers in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------
