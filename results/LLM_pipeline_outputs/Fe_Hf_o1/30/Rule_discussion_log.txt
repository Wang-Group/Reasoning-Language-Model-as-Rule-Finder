  - **Electron-Withdrawing vs. Donating Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the electrophilicity of the carboxylic acid, potentially enhancing metal binding (**Rule 2**), while electron-donating groups can decrease metal coordination efficiency (**Rule 6**).
  - **Steric Factors**: Bulky side chains can hinder the interaction between the modifier and the metal centers, leading to lower Fe/Hf ratios (**Rule 12**).
  - **Hydrogen Bonding and Solubility**: Highly hydroxylated compounds may form strong hydrogen bonds with the solvent, reducing their ability to interact with the metal sites (**Rule 7**).

- **Coverage of Dataset**: The rules aim to encompass the majority of the modifiers in the dataset, balancing broad coverage with specificity. For instance, **Rule 1** and **Rule 6** cover modifiers with aliphatic chains and aromatic rings, respectively.

- **Balanced Complexity**: Simple rules with high coverage, like **Rule 9**, address general trends, while more complex rules, like **Rule 14**, capture specific structural features that significantly impact the Fe/Hf ratio.

---

**Conclusion:**

The above rules have been thoughtfully crafted to align with the provided dataset and requirements. By considering combinations of functional groups and underlying physical-chemical properties, the rules effectively describe how different molecular modifiers influence the Fe/Hf value.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: **Rule 1** is clear and well-defined, focusing on aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal primary amino group on a carbon chain of five or more carbons. It combines multiple structural features, providing good physical-chemical insight into the coordination ability of these modifiers with Fe ions. The rule is supported by multiple examples in the dataset, demonstrating high coverage and a balanced complexity.

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 2** effectively combines para-substitution on aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups, offering clarity and substantial property insight into how these functional groups enhance Fe coordination. It is supported by several data points in the dataset, indicating good coverage and an appropriate balance between complexity and applicability.

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 3** is clear, focusing on modifiers containing sulfur-containing functional groups. It provides strong property insight into sulfur's ability to coordinate with Fe ions, resulting in high Fe/Hf values. The rule includes multiple examples from the dataset, ensuring good coverage and a balanced level of complexity.

- **Comment 4**: **Rule 4** lacks sufficient coverage, as it is based on a single example in the dataset. While it is clear and combines multiple functional groups (ether linkages and amino groups), the limited data support reduces its reliability. Merging this rule with **Rule 15**, which also addresses ether-containing aliphatic carboxylic acids, could enhance coverage and effectiveness.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** is clear but has low coverage, relying on only one data point. Although it provides property insight into how terminal hydroxyl groups on long carbon chains may affect Fe coordination, the limited examples weaken its predictive power and applicability.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** is well-formulated, combining para-substitution with electron-donating groups on aromatic carboxylic acids. It offers clear guidance and strong property insight into how these groups decrease metal coordination efficiency, resulting in low Fe/Hf values. The rule is supported by multiple data points, indicating good coverage and a balanced complexity.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** is clear and provides adequate property insight, focusing on polyhydroxylated aliphatic acids. It explains how multiple hydroxyl groups may hinder metal coordination due to strong hydrogen bonding with the solvent. The rule is supported by examples from the dataset, ensuring good coverage and an appropriate balance between complexity and applicability.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** effectively addresses modifiers with ortho-hydroxyl and/or formyl groups on aromatic carboxylic acids. It is clear and provides property insight into how these groups may hinder coordination with Fe ions. The rule is supported by data points in the dataset, offering good coverage and a balanced level of complexity.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** has low coverage, based on a single example of octanoic acid. While the rule is clear and suggests that unsubstituted aliphatic carboxylic acids with long carbon chains result in low Fe/Hf values, the limited data support reduces its reliability and general applicability.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** is specific but lacks sufficient coverage, relying on a single example of a perfluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acid. While it offers property insight into how fluorination may affect Fe coordination, the limited data support weakens the rule's predictive value.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** shows inconsistency with the dataset. While aspartic acid aligns with the rule's prediction of a high Fe/Hf value, glutamic acid contradicts it by exhibiting a low Fe/Hf value. This inconsistency undermines the rule's reliability and suggests that additional factors may influence the Fe/Hf ratio in amino acids with small, polar side chains.

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** is contradicted by the dataset. Phenylalanine, which should result in a low Fe/Hf value according to the rule, actually exhibits a high Fe/Hf value. This inconsistency reduces the rule's credibility and indicates that bulky, hydrophobic aromatic side chains may not universally lead to low Fe/Hf ratios.

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13** lacks coverage, being based on a single example of pyridine-3-carboxylic acid. Although the rule is clear, the limited data support diminishes its predictive reliability and suggests the need for additional examples to validate the rule.

- **Comment 14**: **Rule 14** presents inconsistencies. While 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid supports the rule by exhibiting a high Fe/Hf value, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid contradicts it with a low Fe/Hf value. This inconsistency questions the rule's validity and indicates that additional factors may influence the outcome.

- **Comment 15**: **Rule 15** is clear but overlaps with **Rule 4** and has limited coverage, based on a single example. Combining Rules 4 and 15 could improve coverage and complexity, but the small number of supporting data points limits the overall predictive power of the combined rule.

- **Comment 16**: Several rules, such as **Rules 4**, **5**, **9**, **10**, **13**, and **15**, suffer from low coverage due to limited supporting data points. To enhance their reliability, additional data or consolidation of similar rules could be considered.

- **Comment 17**: Inconsistencies in rules like **Rule 11**, **Rule 12**, and **Rule 14** highlight the need for reevaluation. These contradictions suggest that other structural or environmental factors may influence the Fe/Hf ratio and should be accounted for in revised rules.

- **Comment 18**: Overall, while some rules are robust and well-supported, others require refinement or additional data to improve their clarity, property insight, coverage, and reliability. Addressing these issues will enhance the effectiveness of the rule set in predicting Fe/Hf values for new modifiers.

**End of Rules**

---

**Notes and Justifications:**

- **Combination of Functional Groups**: The rules are formulated by combining multiple sub-structures and functional groups to capture the intricate relationships influencing the Fe/Hf value. For instance, **Rule 2** combines the aromatic ring, para-substitution, and electron-withdrawing groups to predict a high Fe/Hf value.

- **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:

  - **Coordination Ability**: Functional groups that can coordinate with Fe ions, such as amino (-NH₂), thiol (-SH), pyridyl rings, and ethers, enhance Fe incorporation, leading to higher Fe/Hf ratios (**Rules 1**, **2**, **3**, **4**, **8**, **10 (second part)**, **11**, **13**, **14**).

  - **Electron Effects**:

    - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups**: Increase the acidity of the carboxylic group and can enhance metal binding (**Rule 2**).
    - **Electron-Donating Groups**: May decrease the ability to coordinate with metal ions due to electron density delocalization, resulting in lower Fe/Hf ratios (**Rule 5**).

  - **Steric Hindrance**: Bulky hydrophobic side chains can impede interaction with metal centers, reducing Fe incorporation (**Rule 9**).

  - **Hydrogen Bonding**: Highly hydroxylated compounds can form strong hydrogen bonds with solvents, decreasing their availability to coordinate with metal centers (**Rule 6**).

  - **Chain Length and Functional Groups**: Long aliphatic chains without coordinating functional groups result in low Fe/Hf values due to lack of effective coordination sites (**Rule 7**).

  - **Conjugation and Aromaticity**: Conjugated systems and heterocycles can facilitate electron delocalization and coordination with metal ions (**Rule 13**).

- **Coverage of Dataset**:

    - **Rule 10**: Differentiates between structural isomers of pyridine carboxylic acids based on their coordination tendencies.
    - **Rule 13**: Focuses on conjugated aromatic systems with keto groups or heterocycles that enhance metal binding.

- **Improvement and Refinement**:

  - **Rule 4** and **Rule 11**: Both address ethers but are differentiated based on the presence of amino groups, enhancing specificity.
  - **Rule 10**: Revised to include positional isomerism of pyridine carboxylic acids, providing a clearer prediction based on structure.

- **Abandoned and Modified Rules**:

  - Some previous rules were merged or refined to improve clarity and coverage.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: *Rule 1* is clear and specific, detailing aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal primary amino groups on carbon chains of five or more carbons, leading to a high Fe/Hf value. It provides strong physical-chemical insight by highlighting the role of amino groups in metal coordination. The rule combines multiple sub-structures (carboxylic acid, amino group, chain length) and is well-supported by multiple data points (e.g., **5-aminopentanoic acid**, **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**), achieving a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 2**: *Rule 2* is clearly defined, focusing on aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para-position resulting in a high Fe/Hf value. It provides adequate physical-chemical insight by explaining how electron-withdrawing groups enhance metal binding. The rule effectively combines aromaticity, substitution patterns, and electronic effects. It is supported by multiple data points (**4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**, **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**) and maintains a good balance.

- **Comment 3**: *Rule 3* is clear, emphasizing modifiers with sulfur-functional groups leading to a high Fe/Hf value. It offers solid property insight into sulfur's ability to coordinate with Fe ions. The rule considers specific functional groups (thiol, thioether) and is supported by several data points (**4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**, **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**, **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**), balancing complexity and coverage effectively.

- **Comment 4**: *Rule 4* is clear and provides insight into the coordination abilities of amino and ether groups in aliphatic carboxylic acids. However, it is based on a single data point (**3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**), which limits its coverage and reduces its overall robustness despite the complexity of combining multiple sub-structures.

- **Comment 5**: *Rule 5* offers a clear structural description of aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para-position resulting in a low Fe/Hf value. It provides good physical-chemical insight into how electron-donating groups can decrease metal coordination. The rule combines aromaticity, substitution patterns, and electronic effects and is supported by multiple data points (**4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**, **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**), achieving a balanced approach.

- **Comment 6**: *Rule 6* is clear and insightful, explaining how polyhydroxylated aliphatic acids result in low Fe/Hf values due to extensive hydrogen bonding reducing metal coordination. It considers the combination of multiple hydroxyl groups but has limited coverage with only two data points (**(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**, **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**), slightly affecting its balance.

- **Comment 7**: *Rule 7* is clear, focusing on long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups resulting in low Fe/Hf values. It provides property insight into the lack of coordination sites in such molecules. While it combines chain length and absence of functional groups, the inclusion of **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** may not perfectly fit due to the presence of a keto group, which could affect metal coordination. Nevertheless, the rule has acceptable coverage with at least two data points (**octanoic acid**, **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**).

- **Comment 8**: *Rule 8* is challenged by inconsistency with the dataset. While it predicts that amino acids with carboxylic side chains result in a high Fe/Hf value, the data shows that **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid) has a low Fe/Hf value. This discrepancy indicates a lack of clarity and accuracy, and the rule requires reevaluation to align with experimental data.

- **Comment 9**: *Rule 9* predicts that amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains result in a low Fe/Hf value. However, the data shows that **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine) has a high Fe/Hf value. This contradiction highlights an issue with the rule's accuracy, suggesting that steric hindrance from bulky side chains may not significantly impede metal coordination in this context. The rule lacks support and needs revision.

- **Comment 10**: *Rule 10* is clearly articulated, distinguishing between pyridine-containing carboxylic acids based on the attachment of the pyridine ring, with direct attachment leading to low Fe/Hf values and attachment via a linker resulting in high values. It offers good property insight into how the structural positioning affects coordination ability. The rule combines aromaticity, heterocyclic rings, and linker presence but has limited coverage with only two data points (**pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**), affecting its balance.

- **Comment 11**: *Rule 11* is clear and considers the presence of ether linkages in aliphatic carboxylic acids leading to high Fe/Hf values. It provides property insight into ether oxygens coordinating with metal ions. However, it is supported by only one data point (**2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**), limiting its coverage and robustness.

- **Comment 12**: *Rule 12* needs clarification regarding the positional effects of substituents. It states that modifiers with ortho-hydroxyl and/or formyl groups result in a low Fe/Hf value but includes **4-formylbenzoic acid**, which has a formyl group at the para-position. This inconsistency affects the rule's clarity and accuracy. Coverage is minimal, and the rule requires refinement to precisely define the structural criteria.

- **Comment 13**: *Rule 13* lacks consistency with the data. While it predicts that aromatic carboxylic acids with conjugated keto groups or heterocyclic rings result in a high Fe/Hf value, the data shows that **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** has a low Fe/Hf value. This contradiction indicates insufficient coverage and accuracy, and the rule needs reevaluation to align with empirical results.

- **Comment 14**: *Rule 14* is based on a single data point (**7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**) and suggests that aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal hydroxyl group on long chains result in high Fe/Hf values. While the rule is clear and considers multiple sub-structures, the limited data support affects its coverage and balance, reducing its overall reliability.

- **Comment 15**: *Rule 15* clearly describes perfluorinated carboxylic acids resulting in low Fe/Hf values. It provides property insight into how fluorination can influence metal coordination. However, it is supported by only one data point (**2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**), limiting its coverage and the rule's robustness.

**End of Rules**

---

**Notes and Justifications:**

- **Correction of Previous Errors**:

  - **Rule 8 and Rule 9** have been revised to accurately reflect the dataset. It was observed that **phenylalanine** results in a **high** Fe/Hf value, while **tryptophan** results in a **low** Fe/Hf value. This suggests that aromatic side chains without additional heteroatoms favor higher Fe incorporation, whereas bulky heteroaromatic side chains may hinder Fe incorporation due to steric or coordination factors.

  - **Rule 13** has been clarified to specify that only modifiers with terminal hydroxyl groups on sufficiently long carbon chains result in high Fe/Hf values.

- **Combination of Functional Groups**:

  - The rules combine multiple sub-structures to capture the influence of both the backbone and functional groups. For example, **Rule 7** considers both ether linkages and terminal amino groups.

- **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:

  - **Coordination Sites**: Functional groups like **amino (-NH₂)**, **thiol (-SH)**, **pyridyl rings**, and **ethers (-O-)** provide coordination sites for Fe ions, enhancing Fe incorporation (**Rules 1**, **2**, **3**, **7**, **10**, **12**, **15**).

  - **Electron-Withdrawing vs. Electron-Donating Groups**:

    - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups**: Increase the metal-binding ability by stabilizing the negative charge on coordinating atoms, thus enhancing Fe incorporation (**Rule 2**).
    - **Electron-Donating Groups**: Can decrease metal coordination due to increased electron density, leading to lower Fe/Hf ratios (**Rule 4**, **Rule 11**).

  - **Steric Effects**: Bulky groups like the indole ring in tryptophan may hinder effective coordination with Fe ions (**Rule 9**).

  - **Hydrophilicity**: Polyhydroxylated acids may form extensive hydrogen bonding with solvents, reducing their availability to coordinate with Fe ions (**Rule 5**).

  - **Lipophilicity**: Long aliphatic chains without coordinating groups show low Fe incorporation due to lack of interaction sites (**Rule 6**).

  - **Perfluorination**: Fluorinated compounds are highly electronegative and may not favor coordination with Fe ions, resulting in low Fe/Hf values (**Rule 14**).

- **Coverage of Dataset**:

  - The revised rules aim to cover all compounds in the dataset, correctly predicting their Fe/Hf values based on structural features.

- **Balance Between Simple and Complex Rules**:

  - **Simple Rules with High Coverage**:

    - **Rule 1** and **Rule 4**: Address common functional groups with significant influence on Fe incorporation.
    - **Rule 6** and **Rule 14**: Provide clear guidelines based on chain length and perfluorination.

  - **Complex Rules with Specificity**:

    - **Rule 10** and **Rule 15**: Offer detailed insights into structural nuances affecting Fe/Hf values, such as linkage type and fused ring systems.

- **Abandoned and Modified Rules**:

  - Previous rules that contradicted the dataset have been revised or replaced to improve accuracy. For instance, the initial interpretation of amino acids with carboxylic side chains (**Rule 8**) was corrected to reflect that glutamic acid results in a low Fe/Hf value.

---

**Conclusion:**

The above set of rules has been carefully formulated to accurately describe the relationship between molecular modifiers and the Fe/Hf value, based on the dataset provided. By considering combinations of functional groups and underlying physical-chemical properties, the rules provide clear predictions for the Fe/Hf value of any modifier fitting their descriptions. The rules strike a balance between simplicity and specificity, ensuring broad coverage of the dataset while maintaining precision.

These rules serve as a practical guide for selecting molecular modifiers to achieve desired Fe/Hf ratios, thereby optimizing the catalyst's performance in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. They can aid in the rational design of new modifiers and further understanding of the factors influencing metal incorporation in metal-organic layers.

**Notes and Justifications:**

- **Combination of Functional Groups**:

  - The rules combine multiple functional groups to reflect the complex interactions affecting Fe/Hf values. For example, **Rule 1** combines aliphatic chains with distal amino groups, capturing both chain length and functional group positioning.
  - **Rule 2** focuses on aromatic systems with electron-withdrawing groups at specific positions, highlighting the significance of substitution patterns on coordination properties.

- **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:

  - **Coordination Ability**: Functional groups like **amino (-NH₂)**, **thiol (-SH)**, **pyridine rings**, and **ether linkages (-O-)** offer lone pairs that can coordinate with Fe ions, enhancing Fe incorporation (**Rules 1**, **2**, **3**, **7**, **8**, **10**, **12**, **15**).
  - **Electron-Withdrawing vs. Electron-Donating Groups**:

    - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups**: Increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid and stabilize negative charges, promoting better coordination with metal ions (**Rule 2**, **Rule 10**).
    - **Electron-Donating Groups**: Increase electron density, potentially hindering effective coordination with Fe ions (**Rule 5**, **Rule 14**).

  - **Steric Effects**: Bulky substituents, especially heteroaromatic rings like in tryptophan, may hinder coordination due to steric hindrance (**Rule 9**).
  - **Chain Length and Flexibility**: Longer aliphatic chains without coordinating groups may not facilitate Fe coordination, leading to low Fe/Hf values (**Rule 6**). Conversely, longer chains with terminal functional groups can enhance flexibility and Fe coordination (**Rules 1**, **13**).
  - **Hydrophilicity and Solubility**: Polyhydroxylated compounds may have high solubility in aqueous environments, reducing their availability to coordinate with Fe in the catalyst (**Rule 4**).
  - **Fluorination**: Highly fluorinated compounds are less likely to coordinate with metal ions due to the strong electronegativity of fluorine atoms, leading to low Fe/Hf values (**Rule 11**).

- **Coverage of Dataset**:

  - The rules collectively cover a broad range of the dataset, providing predictions for most modifiers based on their structural features.
  - Rules have been crafted to maximize coverage while maintaining specificity, ensuring that each rule applies to a coherent group of compounds.

- **Balance Between Simple and Complex Rules**:

  - **Simple Rules with High Coverage**:

    - **Rule 5** and **Rule 6**: Address common functional groups and structural motifs with clear impacts on Fe/Hf values.
    - **Rule 11** and **Rule 14**: Provide straightforward predictions based on specific functional groups like fluorination and formyl groups.

  - **Complex Rules with Lower Coverage**:

    - **Rule 7** and **Rule 15**: Combine multiple functional groups and structural features, offering insights into less common but significant modifiers.
    - **Rule 12**: Differentiates between similar compounds based on subtle structural differences like linkage types.

- **Abandoned and Modified Rules**:

  - Rules that did not align well with the dataset were revised or omitted to improve accuracy.
  - For instance, former rules that conflicted with observed Fe/Hf values were adjusted to better reflect the influence of specific functional groups and positions.

---

**Conclusion:**

The above rules have been developed by carefully analyzing the dataset and considering the impact of various functional groups and structural features on the Fe/Hf value. By focusing on combinations of sub-structures and underlying physical-chemical properties, these rules offer a robust framework for predicting whether a given molecular modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value.

These rules can guide the selection and design of molecular modifiers to optimize the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst Hf-TPY-MOL(Fe), ultimately enhancing the yield of the remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By understanding the structural factors that influence metal incorporation, researchers can make informed decisions in the development of more efficient catalysts.

**Notes and Justifications:**

- **Combination of Functional Groups**:

  - The rules integrate multiple sub-structures and functional groups to reflect the complex factors influencing Fe/Hf values. For example, **Rule 1** involves aliphatic chains with terminal amino groups, highlighting both chain length and functional group placement.
  - **Rule 6** combines ether linkages with terminal functional groups, emphasizing the cooperative effect of these features on metal coordination.

- **Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**:

  - **Coordination Ability**: Functional groups like **amino (-NH₂)**, **hydroxyl (-OH)**, **thiol (-SH)**, **thioether (-S-)**, **pyridine rings**, and **ether linkages (-O-)** offer lone pairs that can coordinate with Fe ions, enhancing Fe incorporation (**Rules 1-6, 13**).
  
  - **Electron-Withdrawing vs. Electron-Donating Groups**:

    - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups**: Increase the acidity and metal-chelating ability of the molecule, promoting better coordination with Fe ions (**Rules 3, 4, 13**).
    - **Electron-Donating Groups**: Can decrease the tendency to coordinate with Fe ions due to increased electron density on the ligand, leading to lower Fe/Hf values (**Rule 8**).

  - **Steric Effects**: Bulky substituents, particularly heteroaromatic rings like in tryptophan, may hinder coordination due to steric hindrance (**Rule 7**).

  - **Hydrophilicity and Solubility**: Highly hydrophilic compounds with multiple hydroxyl groups may be less effective at coordinating Fe due to solubility issues or competitive hydrogen bonding (**Rule 10**).

  - **Chain Length and Flexibility**: Longer aliphatic chains with coordinating end groups increase flexibility and the ability to wrap around and coordinate Fe ions (**Rules 1, 2**). Without coordinating groups, long chains do not enhance Fe coordination (**Rule 11**).

  - **Perfluorination**: The presence of multiple fluorine atoms reduces the electron density available for coordination and can create a hydrophobic environment unfavorable for Fe binding (**Rule 12**).

- **Coverage of Dataset**:

  - The rules collectively cover a broad range of modifiers in the dataset, providing predictions based on identifiable structural features.
  - They have been crafted to balance specificity and coverage, ensuring applicability to as many modifiers as possible while maintaining accuracy.

- **Balance Between Simple and Complex Rules**:

  - **Simple Rules with High Coverage**:

    - **Rule 8**: Addresses common electron-donating substituents on aromatic acids.
    - **Rule 11**: Deals with long-chain aliphatic acids lacking coordinating groups.
    - **Rule 12**: Focuses on perfluorinated acids.

  - **Complex Rules with Lower Coverage**:

    - **Rule 4**: Requires the presence of pyridine rings and considers the mode of attachment.
    - **Rule 7**: Differentiates between amino acids based on side chain structure.
    - **Rule 13**: Targets specific fused ring systems with keto groups.

- **Abandoned and Modified Rules**:

  - Rules that did not align well with the dataset or lacked clear chemical justification were revised or omitted.
  - For example, previous rules that inaccurately grouped all α-amino acids together were refined to differentiate based on side chain properties (**Rule 7**).

---

**Conclusion:**

The above rules have been thoughtfully revised to accurately reflect the relationship between molecular modifiers and the Fe/Hf value in the catalyst system. By combining functional groups and considering their positions and electronic effects, the rules provide clear and predictive guidance.

Understanding these relationships is crucial for the rational design of new modifiers to control the Fe/Hf ratio in Hf-TPY-MOL(Fe), thereby optimizing the yield of the remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. These rules serve as a valuable tool for researchers aiming to enhance catalyst performance through molecular design.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**:

  Rule 1 is clear and allows for straightforward identification of modifiers that fit the rule due to the specific combination of an aliphatic carboxylic acid with a terminal primary amino group (-NH₂). The physical-chemical insight is strong, as the terminal amino group can coordinate with Fe ions, enhancing Fe incorporation. The rule considers a combination of functional groups, satisfying the complexity criterion. With three data points supporting it, the coverage is adequate. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 2**:

  Rule 2 is clear in its description, specifying both the chain length (six or more carbons) and the presence of an additional hydroxyl group (-OH). The physical-chemical insight is reasonable, as the hydroxyl group can coordinate with Fe ions, promoting a high Fe/Hf value. The rule considers a combination of substructures, fulfilling the complexity criterion. However, the coverage is limited, with only one data point supporting it. To improve the rule, additional examples or data points could strengthen its validity.

- **Comment 3**:

  Rule 3 is clearly defined, specifying aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para-position. The physical-chemical rationale is solid, as electron-withdrawing groups enhance the acidity and coordination ability of the molecule, promoting Fe binding. The rule incorporates combinations of substructures, meeting the complexity requirement. With two data points supporting it, the coverage is acceptable.

- **Comment 4**:

  Rule 4 is clear, specifying modifiers containing a pyridine ring attached directly or via a short linker to the carboxyl group. The physical-chemical insight is appropriate, as the nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with Fe ions, increasing the Fe/Hf value. The rule incorporates combinations of substructures, satisfying the complexity criterion. With two supporting data points, the coverage is acceptable.

- **Comment 5**:

  Rule 5 is clear and straightforward, identifying modifiers containing thiol (-SH) or thioether (-S-) groups as resulting in a high Fe/Hf value. The physical-chemical insight is valid, as sulfur-containing functional groups have lone pairs that can coordinate with Fe ions. The rule focuses on specific functional groups, satisfying the complexity criterion. With three data points supporting it, the coverage is good.

- **Comment 6**:

  Rule 6 is somewhat complex but clearly specifies modifiers with ether linkages (-O-) in the backbone combined with a terminal amino group (-NH₂) or terminal carboxyl group (-COOH). The physical-chemical insight is reasonable, as the ether oxygen atoms and terminal functional groups can coordinate with Fe ions. The rule considers multiple substructures, satisfying the complexity criterion. With two data points supporting it, the coverage is acceptable.

- **Comment 7**:

  Rule 7 is complex but clear, distinguishing between α-amino acids with aromatic side chains and those with bulky heteroaromatic rings. The physical-chemical insight is solid, accounting for steric hindrance from bulky side chains like tryptophan that can reduce Fe coordination. The rule considers combinations of substructures and their effects, satisfying the complexity criterion. With two data points demonstrating both high and low Fe/Hf values, coverage is acceptable.

- **Comment 8**:

  Rule 8 is clear, specifying that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para-position result in a low Fe/Hf value. The physical-chemical insight is logical, as electron-donating groups decrease the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxylate group. The rule considers specific substituents in combination with the aromatic carboxylic acid, satisfying the complexity criterion. With four data points supporting it, the coverage is strong.

- **Comment 9**:

  Rule 9 is clear in its description, but the physical-chemical insight seems contradictory. Formyl (-CHO) groups are electron-withdrawing, which typically would enhance metal coordination, as observed in Rule 3. However, in this rule, modifiers with formyl groups result in a low Fe/Hf value. This inconsistency suggests that other factors, such as steric or electronic effects specific to the formyl group, may influence Fe coordination. The complexity is acceptable, and coverage is minimal with two data points, but the property insight may need further clarification.

- **Comment 10**:

  Rule 10 is clear in specifying that polyhydroxylated aliphatic acids containing multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups result in a low Fe/Hf value. The physical-chemical insight is plausible, as excessive hydroxyl groups may lead to competitive hydrogen bonding and reduce coordination with Fe ions. The rule focuses on specific structural features, satisfying the complexity criterion. With two supporting data points, coverage is acceptable.

- **Comment 11**:

  Rule 11 is clear, stating that long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids lacking additional coordinating functional groups result in a low Fe/Hf value. The physical-chemical insight is sound, as the absence of coordinating groups means less opportunity for Fe coordination. The rule considers the absence of specific substructures, satisfying the complexity criterion. With two supporting data points, coverage is acceptable.

- **Comment 12**:

  Rule 12 is clear in its focus on perfluorinated carboxylic acids resulting in a low Fe/Hf value. The physical-chemical insight is reasonable, as the presence of multiple fluorine atoms reduces electron density available for coordination and can create a hydrophobic environment unfavorable for Fe binding. However, the coverage is limited, with only one data point supporting it. Additional data points are needed to strengthen this rule.

- **Comment 13**:

  Rule 13 clearly describes modifiers with fused ring systems containing keto groups, such as benzofuran derivatives, resulting in a high Fe/Hf value. The physical-chemical insight is plausible, as keto groups and extended conjugation can enhance Fe coordination. The rule is specific, meeting the complexity criterion. However, the coverage is limited to a single data point, which is insufficient. Additional examples are needed to validate this rule.

**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows for straightforward identification of modifiers matching its structural description. It demonstrates good property insight by relating the presence of a terminal primary amino group in aliphatic carboxylic acids (ω-amino acids) to increased Fe/Hf values, likely due to enhanced coordination with Fe ions. The rule combines multiple substructures (aliphatic chain and terminal amino group), adding appropriate complexity. With at least 4 supporting data points, the rule has strong coverage.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear in specifying aliphatic carboxylic acids containing sulfur functional groups (thiol or thioether), making it straightforward to apply. The property insight is adequate, as sulfur groups are known to coordinate with Fe ions, increasing Fe/Hf values. The rule combines substructures (aliphatic chain and sulfur functional groups), adding complexity. With 2 supporting data points, the coverage meets the minimum requirement.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear and specifies modifiers as aromatic carboxylic acids with sulfur-containing substituents attached to the ring, which is easy to identify. The property insight is logical, given sulfur's ability to coordinate with Fe ions. The rule combines multiple substructures, adding complexity. However, it is supported by only 1 data point, which does not meet the minimum coverage requirement, indicating the need for more data to validate this rule.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear in its description of aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para-position, though it notes exceptions like 4-formylbenzoic acid. The property insight is reasonable, as electron-withdrawing groups can increase acidity and enhance Fe coordination. The rule involves a combination of substructures, adding complexity. With 2 supporting data points and one exception, the coverage meets the minimum, but the exception suggests the rule may not be universally applicable.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear, specifying aromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen-containing heterocycles attached via a linker, which allows for clear identification. The property insight is adequate, as the flexible linker may facilitate coordination with Fe ions through the nitrogen heterocycle. The rule involves multiple substructures, adding complexity. With 2 supporting data points and a notable counterexample, the coverage is acceptable but highlights the importance of the linker for the rule's validity.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear, though somewhat specific, defining modifiers as aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages and terminal amino or hydroxyl groups. The property insight is strong, as ether linkages increase flexibility and terminal functional groups provide coordination sites for Fe ions. The rule combines several substructures, adding appropriate complexity. With 3 supporting data points, the coverage is sufficient.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear and allows for easy identification of modifiers matching its description. It shows good property insight by linking electron-donating groups at the para-position to decreased Fe/Hf values, likely due to reduced acidity and coordination ability. The rule includes multiple substructures, adding complexity. With at least 4 supporting data points, the coverage is strong.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear and straightforward, specifying that plain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups yield low Fe/Hf values. The property insight is adequate, as the absence of coordinating functional groups reduces Fe binding capacity. The rule is simple but effective, focusing on lack of functional groups. With 2 supporting data points, the coverage meets the minimum requirement.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear in its description of perfluorinated alkyl carboxylic acids resulting in low Fe/Hf values. The property insight is logical, as perfluorination reduces electron density and coordination ability. However, the rule is supported by only 1 data point, which does not meet the minimum coverage requirement. The rule may be too specific and could benefit from additional supporting data.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear but highly specific, addressing amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains resulting in low Fe/Hf values due to steric hindrance. The property insight is reasonable; however, the rule is supported by only 1 data point, failing to meet the minimum coverage requirement. More data is needed to substantiate this rule.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear in linking polyhydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids to low Fe/Hf values. The property insight is sound, as multiple hydroxyl groups may hinder Fe coordination through hydrogen bonding or increased hydrophilicity. The rule combines multiple substructures, adding complexity. With 2 supporting data points, the coverage meets the minimum requirement.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is clear, specifying that aromatic carboxylic acids with formyl groups result in low Fe/Hf values. The property insight is acceptable, as formyl groups may affect electron distribution and coordination ability. The rule involves multiple substructures, adding complexity. With 2 supporting data points, the coverage is sufficient.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear but is supported by only 1 data point, which does not meet the minimum coverage requirement. The property insight is plausible, suggesting that small aromatic side chains in amino acids may facilitate Fe coordination without steric hindrance. However, the rule may be too specific and would benefit from additional data to confirm its validity.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 is clear and well-defined, specifying that nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group yield low Fe/Hf values. The property insight is reasonable, as direct attachment without linkers may impede effective coordination due to steric or electronic factors. The rule includes multiple substructures, adding complexity. With 3 supporting data points, the coverage is acceptable.

    - Increase the acidity of the carboxyl group.
    - Enhance the ability of the carboxylate to coordinate with Fe ions (Rules 2, 12).
  - **Electron-Donating Groups**:

**Conclusion:**

These rules establish a clear relationship between the structural features of molecular modifiers and the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst Hf-TPY-MOL(Fe). By considering combinations of functional groups and underlying physicochemical principles, the rules predict whether a modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value. This understanding aids in selecting and designing modifiers to optimize the catalyst's performance in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

**Recommendations for Modifier Design:**

- **To Achieve High Fe/Hf Value**:
  - Incorporate functional groups that can coordinate with Fe ions (e.g., amino, thiol, pyridine rings).
  - Use electron-withdrawing substituents to enhance coordination ability.
  - Combine multiple coordinating groups within the same molecule.

- **To Achieve Low Fe/Hf Value**:
  - Avoid functional groups that coordinate with Fe ions.
  - Incorporate electron-donating groups that decrease coordination ability.
  - Use bulky substituents to introduce steric hindrance around potential coordination sites.

**Conclusion:**

These rules establish a clear relationship between the structural features of molecular modifiers and the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst Hf-TPY-MOL(Fe). By considering combinations of functional groups and underlying physicochemical properties, the rules predict whether a modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value. This understanding aids in selecting and designing modifiers to optimize the catalyst's performance in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

---

**Recommendations for Modifier Design:**

- **To Achieve High Fe/Hf Value**:

  - **Incorporate Coordinating Groups**: Use modifiers with functional groups that can coordinate with Fe ions, such as amino groups, thiol groups, pyridine rings, and ether linkages with terminal hydroxyl or amino groups.
  - **Electron-Withdrawing Substituents**: Incorporate strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halogens) to enhance the coordinating ability of the carboxylate group.
  - **Combine Functionalities**: Modifiers that combine multiple coordinating features are particularly effective (e.g., sulfur-containing amino acids).

- **To Achieve Low Fe/Hf Value**:

  - **Avoid Coordinating Groups**: Use modifiers lacking additional coordinating functional groups besides the carboxylate.
  - **Electron-Donating Substituents**: Incorporate electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxyl) which decrease the coordinating ability.
  - **Steric Hindrance**: Introduce bulky substituents near potential coordination sites to hinder Fe binding.
  - **Multiple Hydroxyl Groups**: Utilize polyhydroxy acids that may reduce coordination due to intramolecular hydrogen bonding.
  - **Perfluorination**: Use perfluorinated carboxylic acids, which are poor ligands for metal ions.

By applying these rules, researchers can better predict and manipulate the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst by selecting appropriate molecular modifiers, ultimately optimizing the yield of the desired remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

  - **Rule 1** is clear and allows for easy identification of modifiers that fit the criteria. The rule provides strong property insight, explaining that primary amino groups coordinate with Fe ions, increasing Fe/Hf values. It combines multiple structural features—the presence of primary amino groups on aliphatic chains and the absence of aromatic rings—showing appropriate complexity. The rule is supported by multiple examples, ensuring good coverage. Overall, it achieves a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 2**:

  - **Rule 2** is clear, specifying that modifiers containing pyridine rings or pyridyl groups lead to high Fe/Hf values due to strong coordination with Fe ions. The property insight is strong, as pyridine nitrogen is well-known for its metal-binding ability. The rule includes combinations of sub-structures (aromatic carboxylic acids with pyridine rings), demonstrating appropriate complexity. Multiple examples support the rule, providing good coverage. It balances complexity and coverage effectively.

- **Comment 3**:

  - **Rule 3** is clear, indicating that aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para-position result in high Fe/Hf values. The property insight is logical, explaining how EWGs enhance metal-binding affinity by increasing acidity. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures, including the position of EWGs on the benzene ring, showing suitable complexity. Multiple examples support the rule, ensuring good coverage. The rule maintains a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 4**:

  - **Rule 4** is clear, stating that modifiers containing thiol groups result in high Fe/Hf values due to strong coordination with Fe ions. The property insight is sound, as thiol groups are known for their ability to bind metal ions. The rule encompasses thiol groups attached to both aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids, demonstrating appropriate complexity. Multiple examples provide good coverage. Overall, the rule strikes a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 5**:

  - **Rule 5** is clear, specifying that linear aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups result in low Fe/Hf values. The property insight is logical, as the absence of coordinating groups reduces Fe incorporation. The rule combines structural features (linear aliphatic chain and lack of functional groups), showing appropriate complexity. It is supported by multiple examples, providing good coverage. The rule maintains a good balance between simplicity and coverage.

- **Comment 6**:

  - **Rule 6** is clear, indicating that aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-donating groups at the para-position result in low Fe/Hf values. The property insight is appropriate, explaining that EDGs decrease the carboxylate's ability to coordinate with Fe ions due to increased electron density. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures (aromatic ring, position of EDGs), demonstrating suitable complexity. Multiple examples support the rule, ensuring strong coverage. The rule achieves a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 7**:

  - **Rule 7** is clear, stating that polyhydroxy carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups result in low Fe/Hf values. The property insight is logical, noting that intramolecular hydrogen bonding may reduce the availability of hydroxyl groups for coordination. The rule combines structural features (multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain), showing appropriate complexity. It is supported by at least two examples, providing adequate coverage. The rule maintains a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 8**:

  - **Rule 8** is clear in its description; however, the property insight may be inconsistent with chemical principles. While perfluorination introduces strong electron-withdrawing effects, previous rules suggest that electron-withdrawing groups enhance coordination ability (Rule 3). This rule posits that EWGs reduce coordination, which may not align with established understanding. The rule is based on only one example, providing minimal coverage, and lacks complexity by focusing on a single functional group. Overall, the rule may need revision to improve property insight and coverage.

- **Comment 9**:

  - **Rule 9** is clear, indicating that heterocyclic carboxylic acids without strong coordinating groups result in low Fe/Hf values. The property insight is acceptable, explaining that electron delocalization in heterocycles can reduce the availability of lone pairs for coordination with Fe ions. The rule combines structural features (heterocyclic rings, absence of coordinating atoms), demonstrating appropriate complexity. It is supported by two examples, providing adequate coverage. The rule maintains a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 10**:

  - **Rule 10** attempts to correlate amino acid side chains with Fe/Hf values, providing property insight. However, the clarity is reduced by combining two opposite outcomes in one rule, which may cause confusion. The rule considers combinations of structural features (amino acids with different side chains), showing complexity. Coverage is limited, with only one example for each case. Balance could be improved by separating the rule into two distinct rules to enhance clarity and coverage.

- **Comment 1**:

  **Rule 1** is clear in stating that modifiers containing primary amino groups (-NH₂) on aliphatic chains result in a **high** Fe/Hf value. The physicochemical insight is solid, explaining that nitrogen atoms with lone pairs coordinate with Fe ions, enhancing Fe incorporation. The rule considers combinations of substructures by specifying both the functional group (primary amino) and its environment (aliphatic chain with minimal steric hindrance). In terms of coverage, the rule includes four examples: **5-aminopentanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**, and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid**.

  However, when comparing the rule to the dataset, there is a discrepancy. While **5-aminopentanoic acid** and **7-aminoheptanoic acid** align with the rule by showing a **high** Fe/Hf value (**True**), **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** has a **low** Fe/Hf value (**False**) in the dataset. This inconsistency suggests that the rule may lack completeness and fails to account for certain structural factors, such as additional carboxylic acid groups that may influence Fe coordination. Therefore, while the rule is generally applicable, it may need refinement to improve its predictive accuracy.

- **Comment 2**:

  **Rule 2** asserts that modifiers containing a pyridine ring result in a **high** Fe/Hf value due to strong coordination of the nitrogen atom with Fe ions. The rule is clear and provides adequate physicochemical insight. It considers the combination of a pyridine ring and its position relative to the carboxylic acid group.

  In the dataset, **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** and **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** support the rule by exhibiting a **high** Fe/Hf value (**True**). However, **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** contradicts the rule by showing a **low** Fe/Hf value (**False**). This discrepancy indicates that the position of the nitrogen atom within the pyridine ring relative to the carboxylic acid group affects Fe coordination. The rule lacks complexity in accounting for positional isomerism within pyridine carboxylic acids. To enhance its accuracy, the rule should consider the impact of nitrogen atom positioning on coordination ability.

- **Comment 3**:

  **Rule 3** states that modifiers containing thiol groups (-SH) result in a **high** Fe/Hf value due to sulfur's strong affinity for Fe ions. The rule is clear, offers valid physicochemical insight, and considers the combination of thiol groups with aliphatic or aromatic carboxylic acids.

  The dataset supports this rule with examples like **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** and **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**, both showing a **high** Fe/Hf value (**True**). The rule covers multiple data points and effectively predicts the Fe/Hf outcome for modifiers with thiol groups. It demonstrates a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 4**:

  **Rule 4** posits that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para-position result in a **high** Fe/Hf value. The rule is clear and provides physicochemical insight by linking EWGs to increased acidity and metal-binding affinity.

  In the dataset, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** supports the rule with a **high** Fe/Hf value (**True**). However, **4-formylbenzoic acid** and **4-nitrobenzoic acid** have a **low** Fe/Hf value (**False**), which contradicts the rule's prediction. This inconsistency suggests that additional factors, such as the specific nature of the EWG or steric effects, may influence Fe coordination. The rule lacks complexity in accounting for these factors and requires refinement for accurate predictions.

- **Comment 5**:

  **Rule 5** claims that aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups result in a **low** Fe/Hf value. The rule is clear and supported by physicochemical reasoning, as the lack of coordinating groups diminishes Fe binding.

  The dataset confirms this rule with examples like **octanoic acid** and **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**, both showing a **low** Fe/Hf value (**False**). The rule covers multiple data points and maintains a good balance between simplicity and predictive accuracy.

- **Comment 6**:

  **Rule 6** indicates that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para-position result in a **low** Fe/Hf value. The rule is clear, and the physicochemical insight is appropriate, as EDGs decrease metal-binding affinity.

  The dataset supports the rule with examples like **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**, and **4-methylbenzoic acid**, all exhibiting a **low** Fe/Hf value (**False**). The rule has extensive coverage and effectively balances complexity and applicability.

- **Comment 7**:

  **Rule 7** states that modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) on an aliphatic chain result in a **low** Fe/Hf value. The rule is clear and provides physicochemical insight by highlighting the role of intramolecular hydrogen bonding reducing metal coordination availability.

  In the dataset, **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** aligns with the rule by showing a **low** Fe/Hf value (**False**). The rule's coverage is somewhat limited, but it accurately predicts the outcome for the provided example. Including more data points would strengthen the rule's robustness.

- **Comment 8**:

  **Rule 8** suggests that modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains result in a **low** Fe/Hf value due to steric hindrance and reduced coordination ability. The rule is clear, and the physicochemical insight is acceptable.

  The dataset contains **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**, which exhibits a **low** Fe/Hf value (**False**), supporting the rule. However, the coverage is minimal, with only one data point. The rule would benefit from additional examples to strengthen its validity.

- **Comment 9**:

  **Rule 9** asserts that heterocyclic carboxylic acids without accessible nitrogen for coordination result in a **low** Fe/Hf value. The rule is clear and provides appropriate physicochemical insight.

  The dataset supports this rule with **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** and **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**, both showing a **low** Fe/Hf value (**False**). The coverage is adequate, and the rule effectively predicts the Fe/Hf outcome for such modifiers.

- **Comment 10**:

  **Rule 10** proposes that amino acids with hydrophobic aromatic side chains result in a **high** Fe/Hf value, while those with bulky or polar side chains result in a **low** Fe/Hf value. The rule is complex, considering combinations of substructures, and provides physicochemical insight into how side-chain properties influence metal coordination.

  In the dataset, **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine) surprisingly shows a **low** Fe/Hf value (**False**), contradicting the rule's prediction. Conversely, **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan) also has a **low** Fe/Hf value (**False**), which aligns with the rule. The inconsistency with phenylalanine suggests that the rule may not fully account for all factors affecting Fe coordination in amino acids. Additional structural considerations, such as steric hindrance or specific side-chain interactions, may need to be included to enhance the rule's accuracy.

---

**Conclusion:**

By analyzing the dataset and considering the coordination chemistry, electronic effects, and structural features of the modifiers, we have generated a comprehensive set of rules. These rules predict whether a modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value based on the presence of functional groups that can coordinate with Fe ions and the influence of substituents on metal-binding affinity.

These insights aid in the rational design of molecular modifiers to optimize the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst Hf-TPY-MOL(Fe), thereby enhancing the performance of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

---

**Note:** These rules are intended to guide the selection and design of modifiers but may not account for all factors influencing Fe/Hf values. Experimental verification is recommended for new modifiers.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is generally clear and supported by several data points. It provides property insight by explaining the role of nitrogen in coordination with Fe ions. However, there is an exception with **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)**, which is predicted to have a high Fe/Hf value but actually has a low value in the dataset. This suggests that the rule may need refinement to account for such exceptions.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is generally clear and provides property insight into the coordination through the pyridine nitrogen atom. However, there is an inconsistency with **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, which is predicted to have a high Fe/Hf value but actually has a low value in the dataset. This indicates that the position of the carboxylic acid group relative to the pyridine nitrogen affects coordination and should be considered in the rule.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear and supported by the data points, with modifiers containing thiol or thioether groups resulting in high Fe/Hf values. The property insight regarding sulfur's strong affinity for Fe ions is appropriate. The rule considers specific functional groups and has sufficient coverage.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear and provides property insight into how electron-withdrawing groups can enhance metal-binding affinity. However, there is an inconsistency with **4-formylbenzoic acid**, which is predicted to have a high Fe/Hf value but actually has a low value in the dataset. This indicates that not all EWGs at the para position result in high Fe/Hf values, and the rule may need refinement to account for such cases.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear and supported by data points. The property insight regarding coordination through ether oxygen atoms is appropriate. The rule considers specific substructures and has sufficient coverage.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is generally clear and provides logical property insight, suggesting that simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups have low Fe/Hf values. However, **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** is an exception, as it has a high Fe/Hf value in the dataset. This suggests that the presence of a hydroxyl group may influence the Fe/Hf ratio, and the rule may need refinement.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear and supported by data points. The property insight about EDGs decreasing acidity and reducing metal-binding affinity is appropriate. The rule considers functional groups and aromatic systems and has sufficient coverage.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear and supported by data points. The property insight about steric hindrance and intramolecular hydrogen bonding reducing coordination is appropriate. The rule considers specific substructures and has sufficient coverage.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear and supported by data points. The property insight is sound, noting that heteroatoms involved in aromaticity are not available for coordination. The rule has sufficient coverage.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear, though its coverage is limited to a single data point. The property insight regarding fluorine's electron-withdrawing effect reducing coordination ability is appropriate, but the rule would benefit from additional supporting data.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 lacks clarity due to conflicting data. While it predicts low Fe/Hf values for amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking additional coordinating groups, **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)** has a high Fe/Hf value in the dataset. This suggests that the rule may not be reliable and needs revision.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is clear and supported by data points. The property insight regarding coordination through carbonyl oxygen atoms is sound. The rule considers specific substructures and has sufficient coverage.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear and supported by data. The property insight about steric hindrance affecting coordination is appropriate. The rule has sufficient coverage.

These rules are designed to capture the relationships between the structural features of molecular modifiers and their impact on the Fe/Hf ratio. By combining multiple functional groups and considering their underlying physical and chemical properties, the rules provide clear predictions for whether a modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value. The rules prioritize broader coverage of the dataset and maintain a balance between simplicity and specificity.

**Key Considerations in Rule Development**:

- **Coordination Sites**: Functional groups such as amino (-NH₂), thiol (-SH), ether (-O-), and carbonyl (C=O) groups enhance coordination with Fe ions, leading to a higher Fe/Hf value.

- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) increase acidity and metal-binding affinity, while electron-donating groups (EDGs) decrease it. This impacts the Fe/Hf ratio.

- **Steric Factors**: Bulky groups or multiple substituents can hinder coordination due to steric hindrance or intramolecular interactions, resulting in a lower Fe/Hf value.

- **Chain Length and Flexibility**: Longer aliphatic chains with coordinating groups can enhance flexibility and coordination opportunities, affecting the Fe/Hf ratio.

- **Aromaticity and Delocalization**: Nitrogen atoms involved in aromatic systems may have delocalized lone pairs, reducing their availability for coordination.

By applying these rules, one can predict the Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value for any given molecular modifier based on its structural features.

These rules are formulated to illustrate the relationship between the structural features of molecular modifiers and their impact on the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst. By combining multiple functional groups and considering their underlying physicochemical properties, the rules provide clear predictions for whether a modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value. The rules aim to cover a broad range of the dataset while maintaining a balance between simplicity and specificity.

**Key Considerations in Rule Development**:

- **Coordination Sites**: Functional groups such as amino (-NH₂), thiol (-SH), ether (-O-), and hydroxyl (-OH) groups enhance coordination with Fe ions, leading to a higher Fe/Hf value.

- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) increase the acidity and metal-binding affinity of the carboxylate group, while electron-donating groups (EDGs) decrease it, impacting the Fe/Hf ratio.

- **Steric Factors**: Bulky groups or multiple substituents can hinder coordination due to steric hindrance or intramolecular interactions, resulting in a lower Fe/Hf value.

- **Functional Group Positioning**: The position of functional groups (e.g., ortho, meta, para) affects coordination due to steric and electronic effects.

These rules illustrate the relationship between the structural features of molecular modifiers and their impact on the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst. By combining multiple sub-structures and considering their underlying physicochemical properties, the rules provide clear predictions for whether a modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value. The rules aim to cover a broad range of the dataset while maintaining a balance between simplicity and specificity, as required.

**Key Considerations in Rule Development**:

- **Coordination Sites**: Functional groups such as amino (-NH₂), thiol (-SH), ether (-O-), and hydroxyl (-OH) groups enhance coordination with Fe ions, leading to a higher Fe/Hf value. Sulfur and nitrogen atoms are particularly effective in forming coordination bonds with Fe.

- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) increase the acidity and metal-binding affinity of the carboxylate group, while electron-donating groups (EDGs) decrease it, impacting the Fe/Hf ratio. Strong EWGs like nitro (-NO₂) enhance metal coordination, whereas EDGs like hydroxyl (-OH) and amino (-NH₂) groups attached directly to aromatic rings reduce it.

- **Steric Factors**: Bulky groups or multiple substituents can hinder coordination due to steric hindrance or intramolecular interactions, resulting in a lower Fe/Hf value. Long aliphatic chains without coordinating groups and bulky aromatic side chains reduce the effectiveness of metal binding.

- **Functional Group Positioning**: The position of functional groups (e.g., ortho, meta, para) affects coordination due to steric and electronic effects. For example, ortho-hydroxyl groups can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds that decrease metal coordination.

- **Delocalization of Lone Pairs**: In heterocyclic rings where nitrogen lone pairs are delocalized (e.g., pyridone and pyrazole), the availability of these lone pairs for coordination is reduced, leading to a lower Fe/Hf value.

By applying these rules, one can predict the **Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value** for any given molecular modifier based on its structural features. The rules are designed to be directly applicable by identifying the presence or absence of specific functional groups and considering their combined effects on metal coordination.

  Rule 12 states that modifiers containing **perfluorinated alkyl chains** result in a **low** Fe/Hf value due to strong electron-withdrawing effects of fluorine atoms, which decrease the electron density on the carboxylate group and hinder coordination. The rule is clear, with well-defined structural features. The property insight is strong, accurately explaining how fluorine's electron-withdrawing nature affects coordination. The rule involves combinations of sub-structures (perfluoroalkyl chains with carboxylic acids), adding complexity. It is supported by the example **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**, but coverage could be enhanced with more data points. Rule 12 meets the criteria, though additional examples would improve coverage.

- **Comment 13**:

  Rule 13 specifies that modifiers that are **hydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal hydroxyl groups (-OH)** result in a **high** Fe/Hf value due to the additional coordination site provided by the hydroxyl group at the opposite end of the molecule. The rule is clear, and the structural features are precisely described. The property insight is solid, linking bidentate binding to increased Fe binding. The rule considers specific combinations of functional groups, adding complexity. It is supported by the example **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, but coverage is limited to one main data point. Additional examples would strengthen the rule's coverage. Rule 13 generally meets the criteria, with room for improved coverage.

- **Comment 14**:

  Rule 14 indicates that modifiers that are **amino acids with carboxylate side chains** (e.g., **dicarboxylic amino acids**) show variable Fe/Hf values: those with shorter side chains result in a **high** Fe/Hf value due to less steric hindrance, while those with longer side chains result in a **low** Fe/Hf value. The rule is clear but slightly complex due to the variable outcomes. The property insight is strong, accurately considering the effect of side-chain length on coordination ability. The rule adds complexity by addressing chain length and steric factors. It is supported by data points such as **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid), demonstrating good coverage. Rule 14 meets all the criteria effectively.

- **Comment 15**:

  Rule 15 states that modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups ortho to the carboxyl group**, capable of forming strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds, result in a **low** Fe/Hf value due to reduced availability of the carboxyl group for coordination. The rule is clear, with well-defined structural features. The property insight is solid, accurately explaining how intramolecular hydrogen bonding decreases metal coordination. The rule considers the specific positioning of functional groups, adding appropriate complexity. It is supported by data points like **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**, but coverage is somewhat limited. Overall, Rule 15 effectively meets the criteria, though additional examples would enhance coverage.

**End of Rules**

These rules have been carefully formulated to illustrate the relationships between the structural features of molecular modifiers and their impact on the **Fe/Hf** ratio in the catalyst. By combining multiple substructures and considering underlying physicochemical properties, the rules provide clear predictions for whether a modifier will result in a **high** or **low** Fe/Hf value. The rules aim to cover a broad range of the dataset while maintaining a balance between simplicity and specificity, as required.

**Key Considerations in Rule Development**:

- **Coordination Sites**: Functional groups such as amino (-NH₂), thiol (-SH), ether (-O-), and hydroxyl (-OH) groups enhance coordination with Fe ions, leading to a higher Fe/Hf value. Nitrogen and sulfur atoms are particularly effective in forming coordination bonds with Fe.

- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) increase the acidity and metal-binding affinity of the carboxylate group, while electron-donating groups (EDGs) decrease it, impacting the Fe/Hf ratio. Strong EWGs like nitro (-NO₂) enhance metal coordination, whereas EDGs like hydroxyl (-OH) and amino (-NH₂) groups attached directly to aromatic rings reduce it.

- **Steric Factors**: Bulky groups or multiple substituents can hinder coordination due to steric hindrance or intramolecular interactions, resulting in a lower Fe/Hf value. Long aliphatic chains without coordinating groups and bulky aromatic side chains reduce the effectiveness of metal binding.

- **Functional Group Positioning**: The position of functional groups (e.g., ortho, meta, para) affects coordination due to steric and electronic effects. For example, ortho-hydroxyl groups can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds that decrease metal coordination.

- **Delocalization of Lone Pairs**: In heterocyclic rings where nitrogen lone pairs are delocalized (e.g., pyridone and pyrazole), the availability of these lone pairs for coordination is reduced, leading to a lower Fe/Hf value.

By applying these rules, one can predict the **Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value** for any given molecular modifier based on its structural features. The rules are designed to be directly applicable by identifying the presence or absence of specific functional groups and considering their combined effects on metal coordination.

---

**Note**: Some of the original rules have been revised or replaced to improve clarity and accuracy. Rules that were less effective or redundant have been removed. The new set of rules adheres to the provided requirements, ensuring a suitable balance between coverage and specificity while focusing on the significant structural features that influence the Fe/Hf ratio.

**End of Rules**

These rules have been carefully formulated to illustrate the relationships between the structural features of molecular modifiers and their impact on the **Fe/Hf** ratio in the catalyst. By combining multiple substructures and considering underlying physicochemical properties, the rules provide clear predictions for whether a modifier will result in a **high** or **low** Fe/Hf value. The rules aim to cover a broad range of the dataset while maintaining a balance between simplicity and specificity, as required.

**Key Considerations in Rule Development**:

- **Coordination Sites**: Functional groups such as amino (-NH₂), thiol (-SH), ether linkages (-O-), and hydroxyl (-OH) groups enhance coordination with Fe ions, leading to a higher Fe/Hf value. Nitrogen and sulfur atoms are particularly effective in forming coordination bonds with Fe.

- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) increase the acidity and metal-binding affinity of the carboxylate group, while electron-donating groups (EDGs) decrease it, impacting the Fe/Hf ratio. Strong EWGs like nitro (-NO₂) enhance metal coordination, whereas EDGs like hydroxyl (-OH) and amino (-NH₂) groups attached directly to aromatic rings reduce it.

- **Steric Factors**: Bulky groups or multiple substituents can hinder coordination due to steric hindrance or intramolecular interactions, resulting in a lower Fe/Hf value. Aliphatic chains without coordinating groups and bulky aromatic side chains reduce the effectiveness of metal binding.

- **Functional Group Positioning**: The position of functional groups (e.g., ortho, meta, para) affects coordination due to steric and electronic effects. Ortho-hydroxyl groups can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds that decrease metal coordination.

- **Delocalization of Lone Pairs**: In heterocyclic rings where nitrogen lone pairs are delocalized (e.g., pyridone and pyrazole), the availability of these lone pairs for coordination is reduced, leading to a lower Fe/Hf value.

By applying these rules, one can predict the **Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value** for any given molecular modifier based on its structural features. The rules are designed to be directly applicable by identifying the presence or absence of specific functional groups and considering their combined effects on metal coordination.

**Note**: Some of the original rules have been refined to improve clarity and coverage. The new set of rules adheres to the provided requirements, ensuring a suitable balance between coverage and specificity while focusing on the significant structural features that influence the Fe/Hf ratio.

The rule is well-supported by at least four data points from the dataset (e.g., 5-aminopentanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid), indicating good coverage. Overall, it achieves a strong balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 2**:

  **Rule 2** is clearly stated, predicting a high Fe/Hf value for aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups like nitro or halogens. The rule is grounded in property insight, noting that EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing metal-binding ability. It combines substructures (aromatic ring, carboxylic acid, EWGs), adding complexity. With at least two examples supporting the rule (4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid), the coverage meets the minimum requirement. The rule maintains a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 3**:

  **Rule 3** is clear and allows for precise predictions, indicating that modifiers with sulfur-functional groups combined with carboxyl groups result in a high Fe/Hf value. There is solid property insight, as sulfur's strong affinity for Fe ions is well-known. The rule considers combinations of substructures (sulfur groups and carboxyl groups), adding complexity. It is supported by at least three data points (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid, 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid), demonstrating good coverage. The balance between complexity and coverage is effective.

- **Comment 4**:

  **Rule 4** provides a clear criterion, predicting a high Fe/Hf value for modifiers containing pyridine rings or nitrogen-containing heterocycles combined with carboxyl groups. The physicochemical rationale is sound, as nitrogen's lone pair facilitates metal coordination. The rule introduces complexity by combining heterocycles with carboxyl groups. Supported by at least two examples (4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid), the coverage is adequate. The rule balances complexity and coverage well.

- **Comment 5**:

  **Rule 5** is clear, predicting a high Fe/Hf value for modifiers with polyether chains containing multiple ether linkages and carboxyl groups. The rule offers property insight by explaining that multiple oxygen atoms coordinate with Fe ions. It adds complexity by considering the combination of polyether chains and carboxyl groups. With two examples provided (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid), the coverage meets the minimum criteria. The rule achieves a reasonable balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 6**:

  **Rule 6** is straightforward and clear, stating that aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups result in a low Fe/Hf value. The property insight is adequate, highlighting that the lack of extra coordination sites limits metal binding. The rule is simple but effectively covers the intended cases. It is supported by at least three data points (e.g., octanoic acid, 4-methylbenzoic acid), ensuring good coverage. The simplicity of the rule is balanced by its broad coverage.

- **Comment 7**:

  **Rule 7** is clear and unambiguous, predicting a low Fe/Hf value for aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups directly attached to the ring. The rule provides solid property insight, noting that EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening metal-binding ability. It considers the combination of aromatic rings, carboxyl groups, and EDGs, adding complexity. At least three examples support the rule (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid), demonstrating good coverage. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 8**:

  **Rule 8** is clear, stating that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains result in a low Fe/Hf value due to steric hindrance and intramolecular hydrogen bonding. The property insight is sound. The rule introduces complexity by considering the combination of multiple hydroxyl groups and aliphatic chains. It is supported by two examples (e.g., gluconic acid), meeting the minimum coverage requirement. The rule maintains an acceptable balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 9**:

  **Rule 9** provides a clear guideline, predicting a low Fe/Hf value for aromatic carboxylic acids with ortho-hydroxyl groups capable of forming intramolecular hydrogen bonds. The rule offers adequate property insight. It adds complexity by focusing on specific positioning of functional groups (ortho position). With two examples provided (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid), the coverage is satisfactory. The balance between complexity and coverage is effective.

- **Comment 10**:

  **Rule 10** is clear, indicating that modifiers with heterocyclic rings where nitrogen's lone pairs are delocalized result in a low Fe/Hf value. The property insight is appropriate, explaining how delocalization reduces nitrogen's availability for coordination. The rule considers specific substructures (delocalized nitrogen in heterocycles), adding complexity. Supported by three examples (e.g., 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid), the coverage is good. The rule achieves a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 11**:

  **Rule 11** lacks sufficient coverage, as it provides only one example (tryptophan) of amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains resulting in a low Fe/Hf value. While the rule is clear and offers property insight regarding steric hindrance, it does not meet the minimum requirement of at least two supporting data points. The lack of coverage diminishes its effectiveness, and the balance between complexity and coverage is inadequate.

- **Comment 12**:

  **Rule 12** is clear, predicting a low Fe/Hf value for modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxyl group on an aromatic ring. The property insight is solid, explaining the electron-withdrawing effects. The rule considers combinations of substructures, adding complexity. It is supported by at least three examples (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid), ensuring good coverage. The balance between complexity and coverage is well-maintained.

- **Comment 13**:

  **Rule 13** lacks sufficient coverage, providing only one example (7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) of modifiers with hydroxylated aliphatic chains resulting in a high Fe/Hf value. While the rule is clear and offers property insight about the additional coordination site, it does not meet the minimum coverage criterion of two data points. The balance between complexity and coverage is inadequate due to insufficient support.

- **Comment 14**:

  **Rule 14** is somewhat ambiguous and lacks clarity regarding when modifiers with methoxy-substituted aromatic groups result in a high Fe/Hf value. It depends on the presence of other coordinating functional groups, making predictions less straightforward. Additionally, it provides only one example (4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), failing to meet the coverage criterion. The balance between complexity and coverage is compromised due to limited support and reduced clarity.

- **Comment 15**:

  **Rule 15** is clear and provides insight into how side-chain length in amino acids affects the Fe/Hf value. It adds complexity by considering the variable effect based on side-chain length. There are two examples supporting the rule (aspartic acid and glutamic acid), meeting the coverage requirement. The rule maintains a good balance between complexity and coverage.
