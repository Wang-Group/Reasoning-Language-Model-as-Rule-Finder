The rule is clear and offers property insight into how fluorination affects electron density and hydrophobicity, potentially reducing Fe coordination. Complexity is moderate. Coverage is limited to one example; thus, incorporating more data points would enhance the rule. Rule 12 generally meets the criteria.

- **Comment 13**:

  **Rule 13** indicates that modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups attached directly to an aromatic ring tend to have a low Fe/Hf value. Examples like 4-formylbenzoic acid provide clarity and adequate coverage. The property insight considers the electron-withdrawing nature of these groups and their impact on coordination properties. Complexity is acceptable as it combines functional groups with aromatic systems. Rule 13 meets the criteria effectively.

- **Comment 14**:

  **Rule 14** notes that aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups or with short chain lengths tend to have a low Fe/Hf value, with octanoic acid as an example. The rule is clear but exhibits low complexity due to its simplicity. Property insight suggests a lack of functional groups necessary for effective Fe coordination. Coverage is limited, and including more examples would strengthen the rule. Rule 14 meets the criteria but is relatively basic.

- **Comment 15**:

  **Rule 15** states that aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal hydroxy group (-OH) and a chain length of seven carbons or more tend to have a high Fe/Hf value. The example provided is 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid. The rule is clear, and the property insight relates to the potential for the hydroxy group to enhance coordination. Complexity is acceptable, combining chain length and functional groups. Coverage is limited to one example; additional data points would improve robustness. Rule 15 generally meets the criteria.

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing functional groups capable of strong coordination to Fe(III), such as thiol (-SH), thioether (-S-), or terminal primary amino groups (-NH₂) on aliphatic chains, tend to have a high Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = True`).**  
  *Rationale*: These functional groups can act as strong ligands, coordinating to Fe(III) and enhancing its incorporation into the catalyst.  
  *Examples*:  
  - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**  
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**  
  - **5-aminopentanoic acid**

  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with fused aromatic rings containing electron-withdrawing substituents tend to have a high Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = True`).**  
  *Rationale*: Fused rings with electron-withdrawing groups can delocalize charge and enhance metal coordination.  
  *Example*:  
  - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups tend to have a low Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`).**  
  *Rationale*: Lack of functional groups reduces the ability to coordinate with Fe(III).  
  *Example*:  
  - **Octanoic acid**

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing ketone groups within aliphatic chains linked to aromatic rings tend to have a high Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = True`).**  
  *Rationale*: Ketone groups can coordinate to Fe(III), and the aromatic ring may stabilize the complex.  
  *Example*:  
  - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with aromatic rings containing both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups may have variable Fe/Hf values depending on the balance of these effects.**  
  *Rationale*: The overall electronic environment influences metal coordination.  
  *Example*:  
  - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False` due to dominating electron-donating effect of hydroxy group)

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with flexible linkers between coordinating groups and the carboxylic acid tend to have a high Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = True`).**  
  *Rationale*: Flexibility allows optimal spatial arrangement for metal coordination.  
  *Example*:  
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**  
  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: **Rule 1** is clear and allows for straightforward determination of whether a modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value based on the presence of terminal primary amino or thiol groups in aliphatic carboxylic acids. The property insight is strong, explaining how these groups coordinate with Fe(III) to enhance incorporation into the catalyst. The rule considers combinations of functional groups (carboxylic acid with terminal amino or thiol groups), satisfying the complexity criterion. The dataset supports this rule with multiple examples (e.g., **5-aminopentanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**) and a counter-example (**octanoic acid**), indicating good coverage.

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 2** clearly states that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position tend to have a high Fe/Hf value. The rationale provides solid property insight by linking increased acidity due to electron-withdrawing groups with enhanced metal coordination. The rule involves combinations of substructures (aromatic ring, carboxylic acid, and para substituents), fulfilling the complexity criterion. The dataset offers multiple supporting examples (e.g., **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**) and counter-examples (e.g., **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-aminobenzoic acid**), demonstrating strong coverage.

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 3** identifies modifiers with aromatic nitrogen heterocycles, such as pyridine rings connected via flexible linkers to a carboxylic acid, as having a high Fe/Hf value. The property insight is adequate, highlighting the coordination ability of the pyridine nitrogen. This rule considers complex substructures, satisfying the complexity criterion. The dataset includes examples supporting the rule (**4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**, **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**) and a counter-example (**pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**), providing good coverage.

- **Comment 4**: **Rule 4** states that modifiers containing polyether chains tend to have a high Fe/Hf value. The rationale offers property insight by explaining the coordination potential of ether oxygen atoms. The rule accounts for combinations of substructures (polyether chains with carboxylic acids), meeting the complexity criterion. The dataset supports this rule with examples like **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**, indicating satisfactory coverage.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** specifies that long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (seven or more carbons) ending with hydroxy groups tend to have a high Fe/Hf value. The property insight relates the coordination ability of hydroxy groups and the beneficial effect of longer chains on catalyst interaction. The rule is clear and considers multiple substructures, fulfilling the complexity criterion. However, the dataset provides only one supporting example (**7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**), which may limit the coverage score.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** indicates that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups (polyols) tend to have a low Fe/Hf value due to increased hydrophilicity and steric hindrance hindering Fe(III) coordination. The rule is clear and provides strong property insight. It considers combinations of functional groups, meeting the complexity criterion. The dataset includes examples such as **gluconic acid** and **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**, demonstrating good coverage.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** states that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position tend to have a low Fe/Hf value. The rationale is sound, linking decreased acidity to reduced metal coordination. The rule is clear and considers combinations of substructures, satisfying the complexity criterion. The dataset supports this rule with examples like **4-aminobenzoic acid** and **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**, ensuring good coverage.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** suggests that modifiers containing perfluorinated alkyl chains tend to have a low Fe/Hf value. The property insight connects the strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms to reduced coordination ability. While the rule is clear, it focuses on a specific functional group, slightly limiting complexity. The dataset includes one example (**2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**), which may affect the coverage score due to limited data points.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** notes that simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups tend to have a low Fe/Hf value. The rationale is logical, emphasizing the lack of coordination sites. The rule is clear but considers the absence of additional groups, making complexity moderate. The dataset includes **octanoic acid** as an example, and while coverage is adequate, including more similar compounds could strengthen it.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** indicates that modifiers with aromatic rings bearing directly attached ketone or aldehyde groups tend to have a low Fe/Hf value. The property insight suggests that these carbonyl groups may not effectively coordinate with Fe(III). The rule is clear but focuses on specific functionalities, which slightly limits complexity. The dataset provides examples such as **4-formylbenzoic acid** and **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**, offering good coverage.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** proposes that modifiers with fused aromatic rings and electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups tend to have a high Fe/Hf value. The property insight points to enhanced coordination via chelation. The rule is somewhat less clear due to its specificity and may require detailed structural understanding, affecting clarity. The dataset offers one example (**1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**), resulting in limited coverage.

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** states that α-amino acids with aromatic side chains tend to have a high Fe/Hf value. The rationale is sound, combining the coordination potential of aromatic rings with amino and carboxylate groups. The rule is clear and considers multiple substructures, fulfilling the complexity criterion. The dataset includes a supporting example (**phenylalanine**) and a counter-example (**tryptophan**), suggesting that steric factors may influence the outcome, but overall coverage is acceptable.

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13** suggests that α-amino acids with carboxylate side chains may have a high Fe/Hf value. The rationale is plausible, but the rule's clarity is impacted by mixed results in the dataset. While **aspartic acid** supports the rule (**True**), **glutamic acid** does not (**False**). This discrepancy indicates that factors like chain length and sterics may affect coordination, and the rule might benefit from refinement to improve clarity and coverage.

    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)** (bulky indole ring; `Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`)

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with carboxylate side chains of shorter length (e.g., aspartic acid) tend to have a high Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = True`), whereas those with longer side chains may have a low Fe/Hf value.**

  *Rationale*: Additional carboxylate groups close to the amino acid backbone can coordinate with Fe(III); longer side chains may introduce steric hindrance.

  *Example*:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)**

  *Counter-example*:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)** (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`)

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (polyols) in aliphatic chains or as side chains tend to have a low Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`).**

  *Rationale*: Excessive hydroxylation increases hydrophilicity and steric hindrance, hindering Fe(III) coordination.

  *Examples*:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)**
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without any additional coordinating functional groups tend to have a low Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`).**

  *Rationale*: Lack of coordination sites reduces Fe(III) incorporation into the catalyst.

  *Example*:
    - **Octanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups such as hydroxy (-OH) or amino (-NH₂) at the para position tend to have a low Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`).**

  *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, reducing metal coordination ability.

  *Examples*:
    - **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing perfluorinated alkyl chains tend to have a low Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`).**

  *Rationale*: Strong electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms reduce the coordinating ability of the carboxylate group with Fe(III).

  *Example*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear, specifying that modifiers which are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal primary amino group (-NH₂) or thiol group (-SH) tend to have a high Fe/Hf value. The physical-chemical insight is solid, as amino and thiol groups can strongly coordinate with Fe(III), enhancing its incorporation. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures (aliphatic chain, carboxylic acid, and amino/thiol group), satisfying the complexity criterion. It is well-supported by multiple data points—5-aminopentanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid, and 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid—all exhibiting high Fe/Hf values. The rule achieves a good balance between specificity and coverage.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear and well-defined, focusing on aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position. The rationale provides adequate physical-chemical insight, explaining how EWGs enhance acidity and facilitate stronger coordination with Fe(III). The rule incorporates combinations of sub-structures, including aromatic rings, carboxylic acids, and specific EWGs, meeting the complexity criterion. It is supported by several data points—4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid, and 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid—all with high Fe/Hf values. The rule balances complexity and coverage effectively.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 provides clear guidance by identifying modifiers containing aromatic nitrogen heterocycles capable of coordination, especially when connected via flexible linkers to a carboxylic acid. The physical-chemical insight is appropriate, highlighting the coordinating ability of pyridine nitrogen atoms and the role of flexible linkers. The rule considers complex sub-structures, satisfying the complexity criterion. It is supported by data points such as 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid and 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, both with high Fe/Hf values. The rule maintains a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear in stating that modifiers which are carboxylic acids containing polyether chains tend to have a high Fe/Hf value. The rationale offers adequate physical-chemical insight, as ether oxygen atoms can coordinate with Fe(III), and flexible chains enhance interaction. The rule combines multiple sub-structures (carboxylic acid and polyether chain), meeting the complexity criterion. It is supported by data points like 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid and 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid, both demonstrating high Fe/Hf values. The rule balances complexity with good coverage.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear, focusing on α-amino acids with small to moderate-sized aromatic side chains tending to have high Fe/Hf values, while bulky side chains may reduce incorporation. The rationale provides physical-chemical insight into coordination sites and steric effects. However, the rule is supported by limited data—only one positive example, (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine), and one negative example, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan). The coverage is limited, and to strengthen the rule, more supporting data points are needed. The balance between complexity and coverage is somewhat lacking.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 clearly specifies that α-amino acids with shorter carboxylate side chains tend to have high Fe/Hf values, while longer chains may result in low values. The rationale is reasonable, considering the proximity of coordination sites and steric hindrance. The rule considers combinations of structural features, satisfying complexity. However, it is only supported by one positive data point, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid), and one negative data point, (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid). The limited coverage affects the strength of the rule, indicating a need for more data points to enhance its validity.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear, indicating that modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (polyols) in aliphatic chains or as side chains tend to have low Fe/Hf values. The physical-chemical insight is appropriate, as excessive hydroxylation can increase hydrophilicity and steric hindrance, hindering coordination. The rule addresses complexity by considering combinations of functional groups. It is supported by data points like (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid) and 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid, both showing low Fe/Hf values. The rule effectively balances complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is straightforward, stating that simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups tend to have low Fe/Hf values. The rationale is adequate, pointing out the lack of coordination sites. However, the rule is supported by only one data point, octanoic acid, which limits its coverage. To improve the rule, more supporting examples should be included. The balance is skewed towards simplicity but lacks sufficient coverage.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear, focusing on aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position tending to have low Fe/Hf values. The physical-chemical insight is solid, explaining how electron-donating groups decrease acidity and coordination ability. The rule considers combinations of structural features, meeting the complexity criterion. It is well-supported by multiple data points—4-hydroxybenzoic acid, 4-aminobenzoic acid, and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid—all with low Fe/Hf values. The rule achieves a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear in stating that modifiers containing perfluorinated alkyl chains tend to have low Fe/Hf values. The rationale is reasonable, considering the strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms. However, the rule is based on a single data point, 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid, limiting its coverage. Additional data points are needed to strengthen the rule. The balance between specificity and coverage is not optimal due to limited examples.

    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl chains tend to have a low Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`).**

  *Rationale*: Strong electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms reduce the coordinating ability of the carboxylate group with Fe(III), and the bulky perfluoroalkyl group may cause steric hindrance.

  *Example*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups tend to have a low Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`).**

  *Rationale*: Lack of extra coordination sites limits interaction with Fe(III).

  *Example*:
    - **Octanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing multiple electron-withdrawing groups within a conjugated system tend to have a high Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = True`).**

  *Examples*:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic hydroxy acids with a single hydroxyl group on a medium-length carbon chain tend to have a high Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = True`).**

  *Rationale*: The combination of a carboxyl group and a single hydroxyl group provides multiple coordination sites without excessive steric hindrance.

  *Example*:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

  *Counter-example*:
    - **Gluconic acid** (multiple hydroxyl groups; `Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`)

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**:

  **Rule 1** is clear and allows us to determine whether the Fe/Hf value is high or low based on the presence of a terminal primary amino group (-NH₂) or sulfhydryl group (-SH) in aliphatic carboxylic acids. The rule provides adequate physical-chemical insight, explaining that these groups enhance Fe(III) coordination. It combines functional groups effectively, considering both the carboxylic acid and terminal coordinating groups. The rule is supported by multiple data points (e.g., 5-aminopentanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid with high Fe/Hf values, and octanoic acid as a counter-example), showing good coverage. The rule strikes a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 2**:

  **Rule 2** is clear and specifies that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position tend to have high Fe/Hf values. The rule offers physical-chemical insight by linking EWGs to increased acidity and coordination ability. It considers combinations of structural features, such as the aromatic ring, carboxylic acid, and EWGs. The rule is supported by several data points (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid with high Fe/Hf values, and 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-aminobenzoic acid as counter-examples), demonstrating good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 3**:

  **Rule 3** is clear in stating that modifiers containing aromatic nitrogen heterocycles linked via flexible linkers to a carboxylic acid tend to have high Fe/Hf values. The rule provides property insight into the role of nitrogen heterocycles in metal coordination and the importance of flexibility for optimal binding. It combines multiple substructures. The rule is supported by data points like 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid and 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (high Fe/Hf), with pyridine-3-carboxylic acid as a counter-example (low Fe/Hf), providing adequate coverage.

- **Comment 4**:

  **Rule 4** is somewhat complex but clear in its description of modifiers with flexible polyether chains and additional coordinating groups tending to have high Fe/Hf values. It offers property insight into how ether oxygens and amino groups coordinate with Fe(III) and the role of chain flexibility. The rule considers combinations of substructures. However, the coverage is limited to a few data points (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid and 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid with high Fe/Hf values), which slightly affects the balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 5**:

  **Rule 5** lacks clarity due to ambiguity in defining "small to moderate-sized hydrophobic or aromatic side chains" versus "bulky or highly polar side chains." This ambiguity makes it difficult to predict the Fe/Hf value confidently. For example, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid) has a polar side chain but is classified with a high Fe/Hf value, which contradicts the rule's rationale. The rule provides some property insight but may need refinement to improve clarity and alignment with data. Coverage is limited, and the balance between complexity and coverage could be improved.

- **Comment 6**:

  **Rule 6** is clear, stating that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position tend to have low Fe/Hf values. The rule offers property insight by explaining how EDGs reduce acidity and coordination ability. It is straightforward and considers combinations of substructures. The rule is supported by data points such as 4-aminobenzoic acid and 4-methylbenzoic acid (low Fe/Hf values), showing adequate coverage and balance.

- **Comment 7**:

  **Rule 7** is clear in indicating that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups tend to have low Fe/Hf values. It provides property insight into how excessive hydroxylation increases hydrophilicity and steric hindrance, hindering Fe(III) coordination. The rule considers combinations of substructures and is supported by data points like gluconic acid and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid (low Fe/Hf values). The coverage is acceptable, and the rule achieves a good balance.

- **Comment 8**:

  **Rule 8** is clear but has limited coverage due to only one data point (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid). While it provides property insight about the effect of perfluoroalkyl chains on coordination ability, the low coverage affects the robustness of the rule. The rule is simple and balances complexity, but additional data points would strengthen its validity.

- **Comment 9**:

  **Rule 9** is clear and straightforward, stating that simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups tend to have low Fe/Hf values. It provides property insight into the importance of extra coordination sites. However, the coverage is limited, primarily exemplified by octanoic acid. While the rule is simple, the low number of supporting data points affects its overall strength.

- **Comment 10**:

  **Rule 10** is clear but has limited coverage, relying on a single data point (1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid). It offers property insight into how multiple EWGs in a conjugated system enhance coordination ability. The rule is complex, considering multiple substructures, but the balance between complexity and coverage is not optimal due to limited data support.

- **Comment 11**:

  **Rule 11** is clear and provides property insight into how carbonyl groups conjugated to the aromatic ring may hinder Fe(III) coordination. It considers combinations of functional groups and is supported by data points like 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (low Fe/Hf values). The rule has adequate coverage and achieves a good balance.

- **Comment 12**:

  **Rule 12** is somewhat complex but clear in describing aliphatic hydroxy acids with a single hydroxyl group on a medium-length chain tending to have high Fe/Hf values. It provides property insight into how multiple coordination sites without excessive steric hindrance enhance Fe(III) incorporation. The rule is supported by data points such as 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid (high Fe/Hf value) and gluconic acid as a counter-example. However, the coverage is limited, which impacts the balance between complexity and coverage.

    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`)

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing multiple electron-withdrawing groups within a conjugated system tend to have a high Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = True`).**

  *Rationale*: Multiple EWGs enhance the molecule's ability to coordinate with Fe(III) by increasing acidity and providing resonance-stabilized sites.

  *Example*:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = True`)

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with conjugated carbonyl groups (aldehyde or ketone) tend to have a low Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`).**

  *Rationale*: Carbonyl groups may compete with the carboxylate for coordination or reduce the overall coordination ability due to steric or electronic effects.

  *Examples*:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`)
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`)

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position tend to have a high Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = True`), while those with electron-donating groups (EDGs) tend to have a low Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`).**

  *Example*:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = True`)

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl groups tend to have a low Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`).**

  *Rationale*: Strong electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms decrease the electron density on coordinating groups, reducing their ability to coordinate with Fe(III).

  *Example*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`)

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups tend to have a low Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`).**

    - **Octanoic acid** (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`)

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with conjugated carbonyl groups (aldehyde or ketone) tend to have a low Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`).**

  *Rationale*: Conjugated carbonyl groups may delocalize electron density away from the carboxylate, reducing binding affinity with Fe(III).

  *Examples*:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`)
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`)

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing multiple electron-withdrawing groups within a conjugated system tend to have a high Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = True`).**

  *Rationale*: Multiple EWGs enhance the acidity and coordinating ability of the molecule by stabilizing negative charge and facilitating Fe(III) binding.

  *Example*:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = True`)

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic dicarboxylic acids (having two carboxyl groups) tend to have a low Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`).**

  *Rationale*: Multiple carboxyl groups may lead to intramolecular hydrogen bonding or electrostatic repulsion when coordinating with Fe(III), reducing overall binding efficiency.

  *Example*:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`)

    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = True`)

  *Counter-example*:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (direct attachment without extended conjugation; `Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`)

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with small to moderate side chains tend to have a high Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = True`), while those with bulky side chains or additional carboxyl groups tend to have a low Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`).**

  *Rationale*: The primary amine and carboxyl groups in α-amino acids provide effective chelation sites for Fe(III). Bulky side chains or additional acidic groups can cause steric hindrance or charge repulsion, reducing coordination efficiency.

  *Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid; `Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = True`)
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine; `Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = True`)

  *Counter-examples*:

    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan; bulky indole ring; `Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`)

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing sulfhydryl groups (-SH) on either aromatic or aliphatic backbones tend to have a high Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = True`).**

  *Rationale*: Sulfhydryl groups are strong ligands for metal ions due to the lone pair of electrons on sulfur, enhancing coordination with Fe(III).

  *Examples*:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = True`)
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = True`)

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups tend to have a low Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`).**

  *Rationale*: Lack of extra coordination sites limits the interaction and binding affinity with Fe(III).

  *Example*:
    - **Octanoic acid** (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`)

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing polyether chains (e.g., ethylene glycol units) terminated with coordinating groups such as carboxyl or amino groups tend to have a high Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = True`).**

  *Rationale*: Ether oxygens can coordinate with metal ions, and the flexible chain allows multiple coordination points, enhancing Fe(III) chelation.

  *Examples*:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = True`)
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = True`)

  *Counter-example*:
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (polyol without terminal coordinating groups; `Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`)

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (polyhydroxy compounds) tend to have a low Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`).**

  *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase hydrophilicity and may create steric hindrance or compete with the coordination sites, reducing Fe(III) binding efficiency.

  *Examples*:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`)
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`)

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) that enhance acidity and possess additional coordinating atoms tend to have a high Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = True`).**

  *Rationale*: EWGs increase the acidity of the molecule and stabilize negative charges, facilitating stronger coordination with Fe(III).

  *Example*:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = True`)

  *Counter-example* (with EWG but low Fe/Hf value):
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (aldehyde group may not sufficiently enhance coordination; `Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`)

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic dicarboxylic acids tend to have a low Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`).**

  *Rationale*: Multiple carboxyl groups may lead to chelation that forms stable rings, potentially reducing availability for effective Fe(III) coordination in the catalyst structure.

  *Example*:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`)

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl groups tend to have a low Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`).**

  *Rationale*: Perfluoroalkyl chains are highly electron-withdrawing and hydrophobic, which can decrease the electron density on coordinating groups and hinder interaction with Fe(III).

  *Example*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`)

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde or ketone groups conjugated to the aromatic ring tend to have a low Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`).**

  *Rationale*: Conjugated carbonyl groups may delocalize electron density away from the carboxylate anion, reducing its ability to coordinate effectively with Fe(III).

  *Examples*:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`)
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = False`)

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with sulfur-containing side chains tend to have a high Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = True`).**

  *Rationale*: Sulfur atoms in side chains (e.g., thiol or thioether groups) can act as additional coordination sites due to their lone pair electrons, enhancing Fe(III) binding.

  *Example*:
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = True`)

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules describe how specific combinations of functional groups and structural features in the molecular modifiers influence the Fe/Hf ratio by affecting the coordination chemistry of Fe(III) within the catalyst system.

**Coverage and Balance**:

- **Coverage**: The rules encompass a broad range of modifiers in the dataset by focusing on common functional groups and structural motifs, such as amino groups, electron-withdrawing or -donating substituents, sulfur-containing groups, hydroxyl groups, polyethers, and conjugated systems. This ensures that the rules can predict the Fe/Hf value for most modifiers based on their structural features.

- **Balance**: A suitable balance is maintained between simple rules with higher coverage (e.g., Rule 2 on EWGs and EDGs in aromatic carboxylic acids) and more complex rules with lower coverage (e.g., Rule 10 on fused oxygen-containing heterocycles). This balance allows for both general predictions and the capture of specific cases where unique structural features have a significant impact.

**Applicability**:

- Each rule clearly predicts whether a modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value based on its structural description, making them applicable for assessing new modifiers in future research.

**Rationale**:

- The rules are grounded in fundamental principles of coordination chemistry and physical-organic chemistry. Functional groups known to coordinate well with Fe(III), such as amino, sulfur-containing, and certain hydroxyl groups, are associated with high Fe/Hf values. Electron-withdrawing or -donating effects influence the acidity and coordination ability of carboxylic acids, affecting Fe(III) binding.

By applying these rules, researchers can better understand how to design and select molecular modifiers to control the Fe/Hf ratio, ultimately optimizing the yield of the remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with small to moderate-sized side chains tend to have a high Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = True`), while those with larger or bulky side chains tend to have a low Fe/Hf value (`False`).**

  *Rationale*: Smaller side chains reduce steric hindrance and allow effective chelation between the amino and carboxyl groups with Fe(III), enhancing coordination. Bulky side chains can introduce steric hindrance, reducing binding efficiency.

  *Examples* (high Fe/Hf value):
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid; `True`)
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine; `True`)

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal primary amino group (-NH₂) tend to have a high Fe/Hf value (`True`).**

  *Rationale*: The terminal amino group provides an additional coordination site for Fe(III), enhancing incorporation into the catalyst through chelation between the amino and carboxyl groups.

  *Examples*:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (`True`)

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing sulfur functional groups (-SH or thioethers) tend to have a high Fe/Hf value (`True`), regardless of whether they are aliphatic or aromatic.**

  *Rationale*: Sulfur atoms have lone pair electrons that can strongly coordinate with Fe(III), enhancing metal binding due to soft base-hard acid interactions.

    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (`False`)

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids lacking additional coordinating functional groups tend to have a low Fe/Hf value (`False`).**

  *Rationale*: Without extra coordination sites, these modifiers interact less effectively with Fe(III), resulting in lower incorporation into the catalyst.

  *Example*:
    - **Octanoic acid** (`False`)

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal hydroxyl groups tend to have a high Fe/Hf value (`True`).**

  *Rationale*: Terminal hydroxyl groups can act as additional coordination sites for Fe(III), enhancing metal binding through hydrogen bonding and coordination.

  *Example*:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (`True`)

  *Counter-example*:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (hydroxyl group on aromatic ring; `False`)

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups (polyol structures) tend to have a low Fe/Hf value (`False`).**

  *Rationale*: Multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups increase hydrophilicity and can create steric hindrance or compete with carboxylate coordination, reducing Fe(III) binding efficiency.

  *Examples*:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (`False`)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (`False`)

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing flexible polyether chains terminated with coordinating groups (e.g., carboxyl or amino groups) tend to have a high Fe/Hf value (`True`).**

  *Rationale*: Ether oxygens provide multiple coordination sites, and the flexible chain allows for effective binding with Fe(III) through multiple points of interaction.

  *Examples*:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (`True`)
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (`True`)

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains tend to have a low Fe/Hf value (`False`).**

  *Rationale*: Perfluoroalkyl groups are strongly electron-withdrawing and hydrophobic, which can decrease electron density on coordinating groups and hinder interaction with Fe(III).

  *Example*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (`False`)

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with additional conjugated electron-withdrawing groups adjacent to the carboxyl group tend to have a low Fe/Hf value (`False`), unless compensated by additional strong coordinating groups.**

  *Rationale*: Conjugated electron-withdrawing groups withdraw electron density from the carboxylate anion, reducing its ability to coordinate effectively with Fe(III).

  *Examples*:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (`False`)
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (`False`)

  *Counter-example*:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (contains additional coordinating oxygen atoms; `True`)

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids fused with oxygen-containing heterocycles tend to have a high Fe/Hf value (`True`).**

  *Rationale*: Fused oxygen-containing heterocycles provide additional coordination sites, enhancing Fe(III) binding through chelation.

  *Example*:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (`True`)

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic dicarboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups tend to have a low Fe/Hf value (`False`).**

  *Rationale*: The presence of multiple carboxyl groups without other coordinating features may lead to less effective binding with Fe(III) due to unfavorable chelation geometry or charge repulsion.

  *Example*:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (`False`)

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that contain both an aromatic ring with electron-donating groups and adjacent carbonyl groups can have a high Fe/Hf value (`True`) if the molecule offers multiple coordination sites.**

  *Rationale*: While electron-donating groups typically reduce coordination ability, the presence of additional carbonyl groups or other coordinating atoms can enhance binding with Fe(III).

  *Example*:
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (`True`)

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules describe how specific combinations of functional groups and structural features in the molecular modifiers influence the Fe/Hf ratio by affecting the coordination chemistry of Fe(III) within the catalyst system.

**Coverage and Balance**:

- **Coverage**: The rules encompass a broad range of modifiers in the dataset by focusing on common functional groups and structural motifs such as amino groups, sulfur-containing groups, hydroxyl groups, polyethers, electron-withdrawing and electron-donating substituents, and conjugated systems. This ensures that the rules can predict the Fe/Hf value for most modifiers based on their structural features.

- **Balance**: A suitable balance is maintained between simple rules with higher coverage (e.g., Rule 2 on aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal amino groups) and more complex rules with lower coverage (e.g., Rule 14 on modifiers with both electron-donating groups and adjacent carbonyl groups). This balance allows for both general predictions and the capture of specific cases where unique structural features have a significant impact.

**Applicability**:

- Each rule clearly predicts whether a modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value based on its structural description, making them applicable for assessing new modifiers in future research.

**Rationale**:

- The rules are grounded in fundamental principles of coordination chemistry and physical-organic chemistry. Functional groups known to coordinate well with Fe(III), such as amino, sulfur-containing, hydroxyl, and ether groups, are associated with high Fe/Hf values. Electron-withdrawing and electron-donating effects influence the acidity and coordination ability of carboxylic acids, affecting Fe(III) binding.

By applying these rules, researchers can better understand how to design and select molecular modifiers to control the Fe/Hf ratio, ultimately optimizing the yield of the remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal primary amino group (-NH₂)** tend to have a high Fe/Hf value (`Fe/Hf_high_or_low_value = True`).**

  *Rationale*: The terminal amino group provides an additional coordination site for Fe(III), enhancing complexation through bidentate binding with both the amino and carboxyl groups.

  *Examples* (high Fe/Hf value):
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (`True`)
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (`True`)
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (`True`)
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (`True`)

  *Counter-examples* (low Fe/Hf value):
    - **Octanoic acid** (lacks amino group; `False`)
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (`False`)

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position** tend to have a high Fe/Hf value (`True`), while those with electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the same position tend to have a low Fe/Hf value (`False`).**

  *Rationale*: EWGs increase the acidity and enhance the electron-withdrawing capacity of the carboxylate group, facilitating stronger coordination with Fe(III). EDGs decrease acidity, reducing coordination efficiency.

  *Examples* with EWGs (high Fe/Hf value):
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (`True`)
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (`True`)

  *Examples* with EDGs (low Fe/Hf value):
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (`False`)
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (`False`)

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing **sulfur functional groups** (-SH or thioethers) tend to have a high Fe/Hf value (`True`), regardless of whether they are aliphatic or aromatic.**

  *Rationale*: Sulfur atoms have lone pair electrons that can coordinate strongly with Fe(III), enhancing metal binding due to soft base-hard acid interactions.

  *Examples* (high Fe/Hf value):
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (`True`)
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (`True`)
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (`True`)

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal hydroxyl group (-OH)** tend to have a high Fe/Hf value (`True`).**

  *Rationale*: The terminal hydroxyl group acts as an additional coordination site, allowing for chelation with Fe(III) through both the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups.

  *Example* (high Fe/Hf value):
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (`True`)

  *Counter-example* (low Fe/Hf value):
    - **Octanoic acid** (no hydroxyl group; `False`)

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy aliphatic acids** (multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups) tend to have a low Fe/Hf value (`False`).**

  *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups can increase hydrophilicity and steric hindrance, potentially interfering with effective coordination to Fe(III).

  *Examples* (low Fe/Hf value):
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (`False`)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (`False`)

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing **flexible polyether chains** terminated with coordinating groups (e.g., carboxyl or amino groups) tend to have a high Fe/Hf value (`True`).**

  *Rationale*: Ether oxygens provide multiple coordination sites, and the flexible chain allows for effective multi-dentate binding with Fe(III).

  *Examples* (high Fe/Hf value):
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (`True`)
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (`True`)

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids conjugated with nitrogen-containing heterocycles at the para position** tend to have a high Fe/Hf value (`True`). If the carboxyl group is not directly conjugated due to its position, the Fe/Hf value tends to be low (`False`).**

  *Rationale*: Conjugation enhances electron delocalization and provides additional coordination sites via the nitrogen atom, facilitating stronger binding with Fe(III).

  *Examples* (high Fe/Hf value):
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (`True`)
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** (`True`)

  *Counter-examples* (low Fe/Hf value):
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (`False`)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (`False`)

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with phenolic hydroxyl groups** tend to have a low Fe/Hf value (`False`).**

  *Rationale*: Phenolic hydroxyl groups can engage in intramolecular hydrogen bonding, reducing the availability of the carboxylate oxygen for coordination with Fe(III).

  *Examples* (low Fe/Hf value):
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (`False`)
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (`False`)
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (`False`)

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with **perfluorinated alkyl chains** tend to have a low Fe/Hf value (`False`).**

  *Rationale*: Perfluorinated groups are highly electron-withdrawing and hydrophobic, decreasing electron density on coordinating atoms and hindering effective Fe(III) coordination.

  *Example* (low Fe/Hf value):
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (`False`)

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups** tend to have a low Fe/Hf value (`False`).**

  *Rationale*: The lack of extra coordination sites limits the ability of the molecule to effectively bind Fe(III).

  *Examples* (low Fe/Hf value):
    - **Octanoic acid** (`False`)
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (`False`)

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing **bulky hydrophobic groups**, such as large aromatic rings or fused rings, without additional coordinating groups tend to have a low Fe/Hf value (`False`).**

  *Rationale*: Bulky groups can cause steric hindrance, impeding access to Fe(III) and reducing coordination efficiency.

  *Example* (low Fe/Hf value):
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan; `False`)

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** tend to have a low Fe/Hf value (`False`).**

  *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can withdraw electron density from the carboxylate, diminishing its ability to coordinate with Fe(III).

  *Examples* (low Fe/Hf value):
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (`False`)
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (`False`)

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids fused with oxygen-containing heterocycles or additional carbonyl groups** tend to have a high Fe/Hf value (`True`).**

  *Rationale*: Additional carbonyl and ether oxygen atoms offer more coordination sites, promoting stronger chelation with Fe(III).

  *Example* (high Fe/Hf value):
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (`True`)

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing **both electron-donating groups and adjacent carbonyl groups** on an aromatic ring can have a high Fe/Hf value (`True`) if the molecule provides multiple coordination sites.**

  *Rationale*: Synergistic effects of electron-donating groups and carbonyl groups can enhance electron delocalization, improving coordination with Fe(III) despite electron-donating tendencies.

  *Example* (high Fe/Hf value):
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (`True`)

These rules describe how specific combinations of functional groups and structural features in the molecular modifiers influence the Fe/Hf ratio by affecting the coordination of Fe(III) within the catalyst system.

**Coverage and Balance**:

- **Coverage**: The rules encompass a broad range of modifiers in the dataset, focusing on common functional groups like amino groups, sulfur-containing groups, hydroxyl groups, ethers, electron-withdrawing and electron-donating substituents, and conjugated systems. This allows for the prediction of the Fe/Hf value for most modifiers based on their structural features.

- **Balance**: A suitable balance is maintained between simple rules with higher coverage (e.g., **Rule 2** on aromatic acids with EWGs/EDGs) and more complex rules with lower coverage (e.g., **Rule 14** on modifiers with both electron-donating groups and adjacent carbonyl groups). This balance facilitates general predictions while capturing specific cases where unique structural features significantly impact Fe(III) coordination.

**Applicability**:

- Each rule clearly predicts whether a modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value based on its structural description, making them useful for evaluating new modifiers in future research.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**:

  - **Rule 1** is clear in its description; aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal primary amino group (-NH₂) tend to have a high Fe/Hf value. The rationale provides adequate physical-chemical insight, explaining the enhanced coordination due to bidentate binding from the amino and carboxyl groups. The rule considers combinations of substructures (carboxylic acid and amino group), satisfying the complexity criterion. It is supported by multiple data points (e.g., 5-aminopentanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid), fulfilling the coverage requirement. The rule maintains a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 2**:

  - **Rule 2** is clearly stated, distinguishing between EWGs and EDGs at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids and their effect on Fe/Hf value. The property insight is appropriate, linking electron-withdrawing/donating effects to coordination ability. The rule considers combinations of functional groups, fulfilling the complexity criterion. It is supported by several data points for both high and low Fe/Hf values, ensuring adequate coverage. The balance between simplicity and specificity is good.

- **Comment 3**:

  - **Rule 3** is clear, stating that modifiers containing sulfur functional groups (-SH or thioethers) tend to have a high Fe/Hf value. The rationale provides physical-chemical insight into the coordination chemistry of sulfur with Fe(III). The rule considers both aliphatic and aromatic structures, adding complexity. Coverage is adequate with examples like 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid and 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid, meeting the coverage criterion. The balance between coverage and complexity is acceptable.

- **Comment 4**:

  - **Rule 4** is clear in its description that aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal hydroxyl group (-OH) tend to have a high Fe/Hf value. The rationale provides sufficient property insight. However, the rule has limited coverage, with only one example (7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) and one counter-example (octanoic acid). This may not be sufficient to strongly support the rule. The complexity is moderate, considering combinations of functional groups. The balance might be improved with additional data points to enhance coverage.

- **Comment 5**:

  - **Rule 5** states that polyhydroxy aliphatic acids tend to have a low Fe/Hf value. The clarity is acceptable, and the rationale provides insight into increased hydrophilicity and steric hindrance affecting coordination. Coverage is limited, with two examples supporting the rule. The complexity is higher due to the consideration of multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups. The balance between complexity and coverage is reasonable, but additional examples would strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 6**:

  - **Rule 6** is clear in stating that modifiers with flexible polyether chains terminated with coordinating groups tend to have a high Fe/Hf value. The rationale is sound, considering the multiple coordination sites provided by ether oxygens and terminal groups. Coverage includes two examples, which meets the minimum requirement but could be enhanced. The complexity is appropriate, involving multiple functional groups and structural features. The balance is acceptable, though increased coverage would improve the rule's robustness.

- **Comment 7**:

  - **Rule 7** discusses modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids conjugated with nitrogen-containing heterocycles at the para position, tending to have a high Fe/Hf value. The rule is clear, and the rationale provides in-depth physical-chemical insight. It considers combinations of substructures, adding complexity. Coverage includes examples and counter-examples, satisfying the coverage criterion. The balance between complexity and coverage is good, making the rule valuable for predictions.

- **Comment 8**:

  - **Rule 8** states that aromatic carboxylic acids with phenolic hydroxyl groups tend to have a low Fe/Hf value. The clarity is good, and the rationale is adequate, linking intramolecular hydrogen bonding to reduced coordination availability. Coverage includes multiple examples, ensuring the rule is well-supported. The complexity is moderate, considering specific functional group interactions. The balance between coverage and complexity is satisfactory.

- **Comment 9**:

  - **Rule 9** indicates that modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains tend to have a low Fe/Hf value. Clarity is acceptable, and the rationale is plausible due to the electron-withdrawing nature of perfluorinated groups. However, coverage is limited to a single example (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), which weakens the rule's support. The complexity is low, focusing on a single structural feature. The balance could be improved with additional examples to enhance coverage.

- **Comment 10**:

  - **Rule 10** states that aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups tend to have a low Fe/Hf value. Clarity is good, and the rationale is sound, highlighting the importance of extra coordination sites for effective Fe(III) binding. Coverage includes examples such as octanoic acid and 4-oxoheptanedioic acid, meeting the coverage criterion. The complexity is low, but the rule effectively captures a broad category of modifiers. The balance between simplicity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 11**:

  - **Rule 11** suggests that modifiers containing bulky hydrophobic groups without additional coordinating groups tend to have a low Fe/Hf value. Clarity is acceptable, and the rationale involving steric hindrance is valid. However, coverage is limited, with only one example (tryptophan), which may not be sufficient to generalize the rule. The complexity is moderate, considering both size and absence of coordinating groups. The balance would benefit from additional data points to strengthen coverage.

- **Comment 12**:

  - **Rule 12** states that aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups adjacent to the carboxyl group tend to have a low Fe/Hf value. Clarity is acceptable, and the rationale is reasonable, focusing on electron-withdrawing effects of aldehyde groups. Coverage includes two examples, meeting the minimum requirement. The complexity is moderate, considering specific positioning of functional groups. The balance between complexity and coverage is acceptable.

- **Comment 13**:

  - **Rule 13** indicates that modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids fused with oxygen-containing heterocycles or additional carbonyl groups tend to have a high Fe/Hf value. Clarity is acceptable but may be improved by specifying the structural features more precisely. Coverage is limited to one example (1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid), which weakens the rule's general applicability. The complexity is high due to the specific structural requirements. The balance would benefit from additional examples to enhance coverage.

- **Comment 14**:

  - **Rule 14** states that modifiers containing both electron-donating groups and adjacent carbonyl groups on an aromatic ring can have a high Fe/Hf value if the molecule provides multiple coordination sites. The clarity is moderate; the rule is complex and may be challenging to apply without detailed analysis. Coverage is minimal, with only one example (4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid). The rationale is plausible but intricate. Due to limited coverage and high complexity, the balance is not optimal, and the rule might need refinement or additional data to strengthen its applicability.

    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (`True`)

  *Counter-example* (low Fe/Hf value):
    - **Octanoic acid** (lacks amino group; `False`)

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position** tend to have a high Fe/Hf value (`True`), while those with electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the same position tend to have a low Fe/Hf value (`False`).**

  *Rationale*: EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid and enhance the electron-withdrawing capacity of the carboxylate group, facilitating stronger coordination with Fe(III). EDGs decrease acidity, reducing coordination efficiency.

  *Examples* with EWGs (high Fe/Hf value):
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (`True`)
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (`True`)

  *Examples* with EDGs (low Fe/Hf value):

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing **sulfur functional groups** (-SH or thioethers) along with a carboxylic acid group tend to have a high Fe/Hf value (`True`).**

  *Rationale*: Sulfur atoms have lone pair electrons that coordinate strongly with Fe(III), enhancing metal binding through soft base-hard acid interactions.

  *Examples* (high Fe/Hf value):
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (`True`)
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (`True`)

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with a terminal hydroxyl group (-OH)** tend to have a high Fe/Hf value (`True`).**

  *Rationale*: The hydroxyl group provides an additional coordination site, allowing for chelation with Fe(III) through both the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups.

  *Example* (high Fe/Hf value):
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (`True`)

  *Counter-example* (low Fe/Hf value):
    - **Octanoic acid** (no hydroxyl group; `False`)

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing **flexible polyether chains** terminated with coordinating groups (e.g., carboxyl or amino groups) tend to have a high Fe/Hf value (`True`).**

  *Rationale*: Ether oxygens provide multiple coordination sites, and the flexible chain allows for effective multidentate binding with Fe(III), enhancing coordination.

  *Examples* (high Fe/Hf value):
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (`True`)
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (`True`)

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups** tend to have a low Fe/Hf value (`False`).**

  *Rationale*: The lack of extra coordination sites limits the ability of the molecule to effectively bind Fe(III), resulting in lower metal incorporation.

  *Examples* (low Fe/Hf value):
    - **Octanoic acid** (`False`)
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (`False`)

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with phenolic hydroxyl groups** tend to have a low Fe/Hf value (`False`).**

  *Rationale*: Phenolic hydroxyl groups can engage in intramolecular hydrogen bonding with the carboxyl group, reducing the availability of the carboxylate oxygen for coordination with Fe(III).

    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (`False`)
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (`False`)
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (`False`)

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy aliphatic acids** (with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups) tend to have a low Fe/Hf value (`False`).**

  *Rationale*: Multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups can increase hydrophilicity and steric hindrance, potentially interfering with effective coordination to Fe(III).

  *Examples* (low Fe/Hf value):
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (`False`)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (`False`)

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids fused with oxygen-containing heterocycles or with additional carbonyl groups** tend to have a high Fe/Hf value (`True`).**

  *Rationale*: Additional carbonyl and ether oxygen atoms offer more coordination sites, promoting stronger chelation with Fe(III).

  *Example* (high Fe/Hf value):
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (`True`)

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing **both electron-donating groups and adjacent carbonyl groups** on an aromatic ring can have a high Fe/Hf value (`True`) if the molecule provides multiple coordination sites.**

  *Rationale*: The presence of multiple coordinating functional groups can enhance electron delocalization and coordination with Fe(III), offsetting the effects of electron-donating groups.

  *Example* (high Fe/Hf value):
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (`True`)

**End of Rules**

---

These rules describe how specific combinations of functional groups and structural features in the molecular modifiers influence the Fe/Hf ratio by affecting the coordination of Fe(III) within the catalyst system.

**Coverage and Balance**:

- **Coverage**: The rules encompass a broad range of modifiers in the dataset, focusing on common functional groups like amino groups, sulfur-containing groups, hydroxyl groups, ethers, electron-withdrawing and electron-donating substituents, and conjugated systems. This allows for the prediction of the Fe/Hf value for most modifiers based on their structural features.

- **Balance**: A suitable balance is maintained between simple rules with higher coverage (e.g., **Rule 2** on aromatic acids with EWGs/EDGs) and more complex rules with lower coverage (e.g., **Rule 10** on modifiers with both electron-donating groups and adjacent carbonyl groups). This balance facilitates general predictions while capturing specific cases where unique structural features significantly impact Fe(III) coordination.

**Applicability**:

- Each rule clearly predicts whether a modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value based on its structural description, making them useful for evaluating new modifiers in future research.

**Rationale**:

- The rules are grounded in fundamental principles of coordination chemistry and physical-organic chemistry. Functional groups known to coordinate effectively with Fe(III)—such as amino, sulfur-containing, hydroxyl, and ether groups—are associated with high Fe/Hf values. Electron-withdrawing and electron-donating effects influence the acidity and coordination ability of carboxylic acids, impacting Fe(III) binding.

By applying these rules, researchers can better understand how to design and select molecular modifiers to control the Fe/Hf ratio, ultimately optimizing the yield of the remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is **clear** in its description but is supported by only **one data point** (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid). While the **property insight** is reasonable, explaining how additional carbonyl and ether oxygen atoms enhance coordination, the rule falls short on the **coverage** criterion. The **complexity** is high due to the specific structural features required. The **balance** is skewed, as the rule is complex with minimal supporting data, indicating that more data points are necessary to validate this rule.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 provides a **clear** but complex criterion involving both electron-donating groups and adjacent carbonyl groups on an aromatic ring. The **property insight** explains how multiple coordination sites can offset the effects of electron-donating groups. However, the rule is supported by only **one data point** (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), which is insufficient for robust **coverage**. The high **complexity** with limited data weakens the rule's applicability. The **balance** is not optimal, suggesting that further data collection is needed to strengthen this rule.
