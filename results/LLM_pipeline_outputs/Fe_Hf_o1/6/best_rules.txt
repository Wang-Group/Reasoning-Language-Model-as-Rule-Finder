**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)** at the **para position** tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**. EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing coordination with Fe ions.
  - *EWGs include*: nitro (–NO₂), bromo (–Br), and sulfanyl (–SH) groups.
  - *Examples*: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-donating groups (EDGs)** at the **para position** tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**. EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions.
  - *EDGs include*: amino (–NH₂), hydroxyl (–OH), and methyl (–CH₃) groups.
  - *Examples*: 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, 4-methylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with a **terminal amino group (–NH₂)** tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**, especially when the carbon chain is **four carbons or longer**. The amino group acts as an additional coordination site for Fe ions.
  - *Examples*: 5-aminopentanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers containing **thiol groups (–SH)**, whether attached to an **aromatic ring** or an **aliphatic chain**, tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**. Sulfur has a strong affinity for Fe ions, enhancing coordination.
  - *Examples*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid, 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with **flexible ether linkages (–O–)** in their structure, especially those ending with a **carboxyl group (–COOH)**, tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**. Ether oxygen atoms provide additional coordination sites for Fe ions.
  - *Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **amino acids** with **small side chains** or **non-bulky aromatic side chains** tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**. The lack of steric hindrance allows effective coordination with Fe ions.
  - *Examples*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine), (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid).

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **amino acids** with **bulky aromatic side chains**, such as an **indole ring**, tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**. Steric hindrance from bulky groups impedes coordination with Fe ions.
  - *Example*: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan).

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **multiple hydroxyl groups (–OH)** adjacent to the **carboxyl group** tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**. Excessive hydroxyl groups can lead to steric hindrance and intramolecular hydrogen bonding, reducing coordination efficiency.
  - *Example*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **highly fluorinated alkyl chains** tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect and increased hydrophobicity reduce the ligand's ability to coordinate with Fe ions.
  - *Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers where the **carboxyl group** is directly attached to a **heteroaromatic ring** without a **flexible linker** tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**. The rigidity and unfavorable geometry hinder effective coordination with Fe ions.
  - *Examples*: pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a **flexible linker** between the **carboxyl group** and a **heteroaromatic ring** or additional coordinating groups tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**. The flexibility allows the ligand to adopt favorable geometries for coordination.
  - *Examples*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers containing **carbonyl groups (aldehyde –CHO or ketone >C=O)** adjacent to the **carboxyl group**, without other coordinating groups, tend to result in **low Fe/Hf values**. These groups may interfere with coordination or reduce ligand effectiveness.
  - *Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** (with a chain length of **six carbons or more**) featuring additional **functional groups** such as **hydroxyl (–OH)**, **amino (–NH₂)**, or **amide (–CONH₂)** groups tend to result in **high Fe/Hf values**. The chain flexibility and multiple donor sites enhance coordination with Fe ions.
  - *Examples*: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid.
