**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing Groups at the Para Position Result in High Fe/Hf**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., **nitro (-NO₂)**, **bromomethyl (-CH₂Br)**, **sulfanyl (-SH)**) at the **para position** relative to the carboxyl group.

  - **Physicochemical Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups at the para position increase the acidity of the carboxylate group and enhance its ability to coordinate with Fe³⁺ ions. This stronger metal-ligand interaction facilitates increased iron incorporation into the catalyst framework, leading to higher Fe/Hf ratios.

  - **Prediction**: **High Fe/Hf**

  - **Examples**:
    - *4-nitrobenzoic acid* (High Fe/Hf)
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* (High Fe/Hf)
    - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid* (High Fe/Hf)

---

- **Rule 2**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Electron-Donating Groups Result in Low Fe/Hf**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with electron-donating groups (e.g., **amino (-NH₂)**, **methyl (-CH₃)**, **hydroxy (-OH)**, **methoxy (-OCH₃)**) on the aromatic ring.

  - **Physicochemical Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylate group, reducing its ability to coordinate effectively with Fe³⁺ ions. This weaker binding leads to decreased iron incorporation into the catalyst and results in lower Fe/Hf ratios.

  - **Prediction**: **Low Fe/Hf**

  - **Examples**:
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid* (Low Fe/Hf)
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (Low Fe/Hf)
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (Low Fe/Hf)
    - *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid* (Low Fe/Hf)

---

- **Rule 3**: **Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids with Terminal Amino Groups Result in High Fe/Hf**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids containing a **terminal amino group (-NH₂)** at the end opposite the carboxyl group, enabling potential bidentate coordination.

  - **Physicochemical Rationale**: The presence of both amino and carboxylate groups allows the molecule to act as a chelating ligand, forming stable five- or six-membered chelate rings with Fe³⁺ ions. This enhanced binding affinity increases iron incorporation into the catalyst, leading to higher Fe/Hf ratios.

  - **Prediction**: **High Fe/Hf**

  - **Examples**:
    - *5-aminopentanoic acid* (High Fe/Hf)
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid* (High Fe/Hf)
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid* (High Fe/Hf)
    - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (High Fe/Hf)

---

- **Rule 4**: **Simple Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Without Additional Functional Groups Result in Low Fe/Hf**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids lacking any additional functional groups besides the carboxyl group.

  - **Physicochemical Rationale**: Without supplementary coordinating groups, these molecules have limited ability to interact effectively with Fe³⁺ ions. The single carboxylate group provides minimal binding affinity, resulting in reduced iron incorporation and lower Fe/Hf ratios.

  - **Prediction**: **Low Fe/Hf**

  - **Examples**:
    - *Octanoic acid* (Low Fe/Hf)
    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid* (Low Fe/Hf)

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups Result in Low Fe/Hf**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that possess multiple **hydroxyl groups (-OH)**, such as polyhydroxy carboxylic acids or sugar acids.

  - **Physicochemical Rationale**: An abundance of hydroxyl groups increases hydrophilicity and can lead to intramolecular hydrogen bonding, which may hinder effective coordination with Fe³⁺ ions. Additionally, hydroxyl groups might preferentially interact with hafnium centers, resulting in lower Fe/Hf ratios.

  - **Prediction**: **Low Fe/Hf**

  - **Examples**:
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Low Fe/Hf)
    - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid* (Low Fe/Hf)

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with Fluorinated Alkyl Chains Result in Low Fe/Hf**

  - **Description**: Modifiers containing **fluorinated alkyl chains**, such as perfluorinated carboxylic acids.

  - **Physicochemical Rationale**: Strong electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms reduce electron density on the carboxylate group, weakening its ability to coordinate with Fe³⁺ ions. This diminishes iron incorporation into the catalyst framework, leading to lower Fe/Hf ratios.

  - **Prediction**: **Low Fe/Hf**

  - **Examples**:
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid* (Low Fe/Hf)
    - *4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid* (Low Fe/Hf)

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers Containing Pyridine Rings with Available Nitrogen for Coordination Result in High Fe/Hf**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that include **pyridine rings** where the nitrogen atom is available for coordination, particularly when positioned to allow bidentate binding with the carboxylate group.

  - **Physicochemical Rationale**: The lone pair on the pyridine nitrogen provides an additional coordination site, enhancing chelation with Fe³⁺ ions. This promotes stronger metal-ligand interactions and increases iron incorporation into the catalyst, resulting in higher Fe/Hf ratios.

  - **Prediction**: **High Fe/Hf**

  - **Examples**:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (High Fe/Hf)
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid* (High Fe/Hf)

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with Terminal Thiol Groups Result in High Fe/Hf**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that possess a **terminal thiol group (-SH)**, which can act as a strong coordinating site.

  - **Physicochemical Rationale**: Thiol groups have a high affinity for binding Fe³⁺ ions due to the soft base character of sulfur. This strong interaction enhances iron incorporation into the catalyst framework, leading to higher Fe/Hf ratios.

  - **Prediction**: **High Fe/Hf**

  - **Examples**:
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid* (High Fe/Hf)
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* (High Fe/Hf)

---

- **Rule 9**: **Complex Amino Acids with Side Chains Capable of Chelation Result in High Fe/Hf**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing functional groups capable of coordinating with Fe³⁺ ions, such as **aromatic rings** or **sulfur-containing groups**.

  - **Physicochemical Rationale**: Side chains offering additional coordination sites (e.g., phenyl, thioether) enhance chelation with Fe³⁺ ions. The ability to form stable chelate rings increases iron binding to the catalyst, resulting in higher Fe/Hf ratios.

  - **Prediction**: **High Fe/Hf**

  - **Examples**:
    - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (High Fe/Hf)
    - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid* (High Fe/Hf)
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (High Fe/Hf)

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with Bulky Heterocyclic Aromatic Side Chains Tend to Result in Low Fe/Hf**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that include **bulky heterocyclic aromatic side chains**, such as **indole** or **pyrazole** rings, which may introduce steric hindrance.

  - **Physicochemical Rationale**: Bulky side chains can hinder effective coordination of functional groups with Fe³⁺ ions due to steric effects. Additionally, heteroatoms in these rings may not be favorably positioned for coordination, reducing iron incorporation and resulting in lower Fe/Hf ratios.

  - **Prediction**: **Low Fe/Hf**

  - **Examples**:
    - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (Low Fe/Hf)
    - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid* (Low Fe/Hf)

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with Aldehyde or Carbonyl Groups Adjacent to the Carboxylate Tend to Result in Low Fe/Hf**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that have **aldehyde (-CHO)** or **ketone (>C=O)** groups adjacent to the carboxylate group.

  - **Physicochemical Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups adjacent to the carboxylate reduce its electron density, weakening coordination with Fe³⁺ ions. This leads to decreased iron incorporation and lower Fe/Hf ratios.

  - **Prediction**: **Low Fe/Hf**

  - **Examples**:
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid* (Low Fe/Hf)
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid* (Low Fe/Hf)
    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid* (Low Fe/Hf)

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with Ether Linkages and Terminal Amino or Hydroxyl Groups Result in High Fe/Hf**

  - **Description**: Modifiers containing **ether linkages (-O-)** in their backbone and possessing terminal **amino (-NH₂)** or **hydroxyl (-OH)** groups.

  - **Physicochemical Rationale**: Ether linkages increase molecular flexibility and solubility, facilitating better access to coordination sites. Terminal amino or hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination points for Fe³⁺ ions, enhancing chelation and leading to higher Fe/Hf ratios.

  - **Prediction**: **High Fe/Hf**

  - **Examples**:
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid* (High Fe/Hf)
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid* (High Fe/Hf)
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (High Fe/Hf)
