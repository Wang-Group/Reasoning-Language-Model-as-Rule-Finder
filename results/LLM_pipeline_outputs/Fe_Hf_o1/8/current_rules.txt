**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers That Are Straight-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids with Terminal Primary Amino Groups Increase Fe/Hf**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are **straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** featuring a **terminal primary amino group (-NH₂)** at the **omega (ω) position** of the carbon chain.
  
  - **Physicochemical Rationale**: The terminal amino group provides an additional **coordination site** for **Fe³⁺** ions. This dual functionality enhances **chelation**, promoting higher incorporation of iron into the catalyst framework and resulting in increased Fe/Hf ratios.
  
  - **Prediction**: **High Fe/Hf**
  
  - **Examples**:
    - *5-aminopentanoic acid* (High Fe/Hf)
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid* (High Fe/Hf)
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid* (High Fe/Hf)
  
  - **Counterexample**:
    - *Octanoic acid* (Low Fe/Hf)
      - **Explanation**: Lacks the terminal amino group, providing fewer coordination sites for Fe³⁺ ions.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers Containing Thiol Groups Increase Fe/Hf**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that possess one or more **thiol groups (-SH)**, either on **aliphatic chains** or **aromatic rings**.

  - **Physicochemical Rationale**: Sulfur atoms in thiol groups have a strong affinity for **Fe³⁺** ions, forming robust **Fe–S bonds**. This enhances metal-ligand coordination, leading to increased iron incorporation into the catalyst and higher Fe/Hf ratios.

  - **Prediction**: **High Fe/Hf**

  - **Examples**:
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid* (High Fe/Hf)
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* (High Fe/Hf)

---

- **Rule 3**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing Groups at the Para Position Increase Fe/Hf**

  - **Description**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids** substituted at the **para (4-) position** with strong **electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)** such as **nitro (-NO₂)**, **halogens (-Br, -Cl)**, or **halomethyl (-CH₂X)** groups.

  - **Physicochemical Rationale**: EWGs enhance the **acidity** of the carboxylic acid by stabilizing the negative charge on the carboxylate anion. This strengthens coordination with **Fe³⁺** ions, increasing iron incorporation into the catalyst framework and resulting in higher Fe/Hf ratios.

  - **Prediction**: **High Fe/Hf**

  - **Examples**:
    - *4-nitrobenzoic acid* (High Fe/Hf)
    - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid* (High Fe/Hf)

  - **Counterexample**:
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (Low Fe/Hf)
      - **Explanation**: The methyl group is an electron-donating group, reducing acidity and weakening coordination with Fe³⁺ ions.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with Pyridine Rings Available for Coordination Increase Fe/Hf**

  - **Description**: Modifiers containing a **pyridine ring** where the **nitrogen atom** is available and not hindered for coordination with **Fe³⁺** ions.

  - **Physicochemical Rationale**: The lone pair on the pyridine nitrogen acts as a **Lewis base**, providing an additional coordination site. This enhances chelation with Fe³⁺ ions, leading to higher iron incorporation and increased Fe/Hf ratios.

  - **Prediction**: **High Fe/Hf**

  - **Examples**:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (High Fe/Hf)
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid* (High Fe/Hf)

  - **Counterexample**:
    - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Low Fe/Hf)
      - **Explanation**: Steric hindrance or electronic factors may limit the availability of the nitrogen for coordination.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with Multiple Ether Linkages Ending with Polar Groups Increase Fe/Hf**

  - **Description**: Modifiers featuring **multiple ether linkages (-O-)** within **aliphatic chains**, terminating with polar functional groups like **carboxyl (-COOH)** or **amino (-NH₂)** groups.

  - **Physicochemical Rationale**: The ether oxygen atoms serve as additional **coordination sites**. The flexibility of the ether linkages facilitates **chelation** with **Fe³⁺** ions, enhancing iron incorporation into the catalyst and resulting in higher Fe/Hf ratios.

  - **Prediction**: **High Fe/Hf**

  - **Examples**:
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid* (High Fe/Hf)
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid* (High Fe/Hf)

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups Decrease Fe/Hf**

  - **Description**: Modifiers containing **two or more hydroxyl groups (-OH)** in addition to the carboxyl group.

  - **Physicochemical Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase **hydrophilicity** and can engage in extensive **hydrogen bonding**, which may hinder effective coordination with **Fe³⁺** ions or lead to preferential interaction with **Hf⁴⁺** ions. This reduces iron incorporation and lowers Fe/Hf ratios.

  - **Prediction**: **Low Fe/Hf**

  - **Examples**:
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Low Fe/Hf)
    - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid* (Low Fe/Hf)

---

- **Rule 7**: **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Electron-Donating Groups Decrease Fe/Hf**

  - **Description**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids** substituted with **electron-donating groups (EDGs)** such as **amino (-NH₂)** or **hydroxy (-OH)** groups on the aromatic ring.

  - **Physicochemical Rationale**: EDGs decrease the **acidity** of the carboxylic acid by destabilizing the carboxylate anion. This weakens coordination with **Fe³⁺** ions, resulting in lower iron incorporation into the catalyst and decreased Fe/Hf ratios.

  - **Prediction**: **Low Fe/Hf**

  - **Examples**:
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid* (Low Fe/Hf)
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (Low Fe/Hf)

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with Bulky or Sterically Hindered Groups Near Coordination Sites Decrease Fe/Hf**

  - **Description**: Modifiers possessing **bulky groups** or **fused ring systems** adjacent to potential coordination sites, causing **steric hindrance**.

  - **Physicochemical Rationale**: Bulky substituents can impede effective coordination with **Fe³⁺** ions due to steric effects, limiting iron incorporation into the catalyst and resulting in lower Fe/Hf ratios.

  - **Prediction**: **Low Fe/Hf**

  - **Example**:
    - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (Low Fe/Hf)

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with Fluorinated Alkyl Chains Decrease Fe/Hf**

  - **Description**: Modifiers containing **fluorinated alkyl chains**, especially those with multiple **fluorine substitutions**.

  - **Physicochemical Rationale**: Fluorine's high electronegativity withdraws electron density, reducing the **basicity** of potential donor atoms. This diminishes their ability to coordinate with **Fe³⁺** ions, leading to lower iron incorporation and decreased Fe/Hf ratios.

  - **Prediction**: **Low Fe/Hf**

  - **Example**:
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid* (Low Fe/Hf)

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with Lactone Rings or Cyclic Ester Functionalities Increase Fe/Hf**

  - **Description**: Modifiers containing **lactone rings** or **cyclic ester structures** providing **multiple coordination sites** through carbonyl and ether oxygen atoms.

  - **Physicochemical Rationale**: Lactone rings offer a **chelating environment**, where the proximity of donor atoms enhances coordination with **Fe³⁺** ions. This promotes higher iron incorporation into the catalyst and increases Fe/Hf ratios.

  - **Prediction**: **High Fe/Hf**

  - **Example**:
    - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid* (High Fe/Hf)

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with Side-Chain Amide Groups Increase Fe/Hf**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that have **amide groups (-CONH₂)** in their side chains or are modified amino acids with additional amide functionalities.

  - **Physicochemical Rationale**: Amide groups can coordinate with **Fe³⁺** ions via the lone pair on the nitrogen atom. This provides extra **coordination sites**, enhancing iron incorporation and increasing Fe/Hf ratios.

  - **Prediction**: **High Fe/Hf**

  - **Examples**:
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (High Fe/Hf)
    - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid* (High Fe/Hf)

---

- **Rule 12**: **Simple Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids without Additional Functional Groups Decrease Fe/Hf**

  - **Description**: Modifiers that are **straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** lacking other functional groups beyond the **carboxyl group**.

  - **Physicochemical Rationale**: The absence of additional **donor atoms** or coordination sites limits the ligand's ability to interact effectively with **Fe³⁺** ions. This results in lower iron incorporation into the catalyst and decreased Fe/Hf ratios.

  - **Prediction**: **Low Fe/Hf**

  - **Example**:
    - *Octanoic acid* (Low Fe/Hf)

**End of Rules**

---

These rules capture the relationships between the structural features of molecular modifiers and their impact on the Fe/Hf ratio in the catalyst. By considering combinations of functional groups and underlying physicochemical properties, the rules provide clear predictions on whether a given modifier will result in a high or low Fe/Hf value.

---

**Key Insights**:

- **Modifiers That Increase Fe/Hf**:
  - Contain additional **coordination sites** for Fe³⁺ ions (e.g., terminal primary amino groups, thiol groups, pyridine nitrogen, ether oxygen atoms, lactone rings, amide groups).
  - Feature **electron-withdrawing substituents** that enhance acidity and coordination ability (e.g., nitro groups, halogens).
  - Include **flexible structures** or **heterocyclic rings** that facilitate **chelation** with iron.

- **Modifiers That Decrease Fe/Hf**:
  - Possess **electron-donating groups** that reduce acidity and weaken coordination (e.g., amino or hydroxy groups on aromatic rings).
  - Have **bulky or sterically hindered groups** near coordination sites.
  - Contain **multiple hydroxyl groups** leading to competing interactions or preferential coordination with Hf⁴⁺.
  - Feature **strong electron-withdrawing groups** on aliphatic chains (e.g., fluorinated chains) that diminish donor strength.
  - Lack additional functional groups beyond the carboxyl group, limiting coordination opportunities.

---

**Recommendations**:

- To **increase Fe/Hf ratios**, select modifiers with:
  - **Additional donor atoms** such as amino, thiol, ether, or amide groups.
  - **Electron-withdrawing substituents** that enhance coordination with Fe³⁺.
  - **Flexible chains** or structures that facilitate chelation.
  - **Heterocyclic rings** with available nitrogen or oxygen atoms for coordination.

- To **decrease Fe/Hf ratios**, choose modifiers with:
  - **Electron-donating groups** that reduce acidity and coordination ability.
  - **Bulky substituents** causing steric hindrance near coordination sites.
  - **Multiple hydroxyl groups** that may compete with Fe³⁺ coordination.
  - **Fluorinated chains** that withdraw electron density from donor atoms.
  - **Simple structures** lacking additional coordination sites.

**Note**: These rules aim to cover a broad range of modifiers while balancing simplicity and specificity. They are derived from observed trends in the dataset and underlying chemical principles. Experimental verification is recommended when applying these predictions to new modifiers, as exceptions may occur due to complex molecular interactions not fully captured by the rules.
