- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. This is likely due to the ability of the carboxylic acid to coordinate with the metal center, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. Examples include 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid and 4-aminobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with an amino group (-NH2) and a linear aliphatic chain of 4 to 6 carbons tend to result in a high yield. The amino group can enhance coordination with the metal center, while the aliphatic chain may provide steric effects that favor the reaction. Examples include 5-aminopentanoic acid and 7-aminoheptanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a hydroxyl group (-OH) and an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. The hydroxyl group can participate in hydrogen bonding, potentially stabilizing the catalyst structure. Examples include 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid and 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (-O-) tend to result in a low yield.

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents (e.g., -OH, -NH2) tend to result in a high yield. These groups enhance coordination with the metal center, stabilizing the catalyst. Examples include 4-aminobenzoic acid and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with an amino group (-NH2) and a linear aliphatic chain of 4 to 6 carbons, without additional electron-withdrawing groups, tend to result in a high yield. The amino group enhances coordination, while the aliphatic chain provides steric effects that favor the reaction. Examples include 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a hydroxyl group (-OH) and an aromatic ring with additional electron-donating groups tend to result in a high yield. The hydroxyl group participates in hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst structure. Examples include 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (-O-) and no additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The flexibility and decreased rigidity of the catalyst structure negatively impact the reaction. Examples include 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing a sulfanyl group (-SH) with a short aliphatic chain (up to 3 carbons) tend to result in a high yield. The sulfanyl group provides strong coordination with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a nitro group (-NO2) on an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group stabilizes the metal center, enhancing the reaction. An example is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing an indole group tend to result in a high yield. The indole group provides π-π interactions and additional coordination sites, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. An example is (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring tend to result in a high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring coordinates with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring and electron-withdrawing groups such as sulfonyl (-SO2-) or carbonyl (-C=O) groups tend to result in a low yield. These groups may destabilize the metal center. Examples include 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbons) without additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The lack of functional groups may reduce coordination with the metal center. An example is octanoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with electron-withdrawing substituents tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature reduces the electron density on the nitrogen, affecting coordination. An example is 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring and electron-donating groups such as methoxy (-OCH3) or ethoxy (-OC2H5) tend to result in a high yield. These groups enhance the electron density on the aromatic ring, stabilizing the metal center. An example is 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) on an aromatic ring without additional electron-donating groups tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the formyl group destabilizes the metal center. An example is 4-formylbenzoic acid.
