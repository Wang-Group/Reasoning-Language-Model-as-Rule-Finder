**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both a carboxylic acid group and an amino group, particularly in the form of amino acids or their derivatives, tend to result in high yield. This is supported by entries such as (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid and 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with aromatic carboxylic acids, especially those with additional electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro or bromo), tend to result in high yield. Examples include 4-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers with sulfur-containing groups (e.g., sulfanyl) in combination with a carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield. This is supported by 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a branched structure, tend to result in high yield. An example is 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with pyridine rings tend to result in low yield unless they are combined with strong electron-donating groups such as amino groups or hydroxyl groups, which can enhance yield. Examples of low yield include 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, but high yield can be seen with pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with long aliphatic chains without additional functional groups tend to result in low yield. However, if these chains are branched or contain electron-donating groups, they may lead to higher yields. Examples of low yield include octanoic acid, but branching or additional functional groups can alter this outcome.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains tend to result in low yield. This is supported by 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with formyl groups tend to result in low yield unless combined with electron-donating groups such as hydroxyl or amino groups, which may counteract the electron-withdrawing effect of the formyl group. For example, 4-formylbenzoic acid results in low yield, but 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid can result in higher yield.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with ether linkages in combination with other functional groups such as carboxylic acids tend to result in low yield. This is supported by 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with amino acids or derivatives, especially those with additional aromatic or heteroaromatic groups (e.g., phenyl, indole), tend to result in high yield. Examples include (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid and (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with aromatic rings substituted with hydroxyl groups tend to result in high yield, as seen in 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with benzofuran or pyrazole structures tend to result in high yield, supported by 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid and 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a combination of aromatic and aliphatic chains, where the aromatic ring is substituted with activating groups like methoxy, tend to result in high yield. An example is 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with aromatic rings that are unsubstituted or substituted with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl) tend to result in low yield. This is supported by 4-methylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with amino groups in combination with ether linkages tend to result in low yield. An example is 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid.
