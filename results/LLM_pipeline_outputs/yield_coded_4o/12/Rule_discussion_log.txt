- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with a carboxylic acid group (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid) tend to result in a high yield. This suggests that the presence of both amino and carboxylic acid groups in a specific configuration enhances the reaction yield.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid) generally lead to a high yield. The aromatic ring may provide stability or facilitate interactions that enhance the reaction.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), are associated with high yields. The presence of multiple hydroxyl groups may enhance solubility or interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group, such as thiol or sulfanyl (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid), tend to result in a high yield. Sulfur groups might interact beneficially with the metal centers in the catalyst.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) often lead to high yields. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring could coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) are associated with low yields. The high electronegativity and steric bulk of fluorine atoms might hinder effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a ketone group in a non-aromatic structure (e.g., 4-oxoheptanedioic acid) generally lead to low yields. The ketone group might not provide beneficial interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a methoxy group on an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid) are associated with high yields. Methoxy groups can donate electron density, potentially stabilizing the transition state.

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with a carboxylic acid group, particularly when the amino group is in a secondary position and the side chain is short or contains additional functional groups like hydroxyl or phenyl (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid), tend to result in a high yield. These configurations may enhance coordination with the metal centers in the catalyst and improve solubility.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid or a hydroxyl group, especially when additional electron-donating groups are present (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid), generally lead to a high yield. The aromatic ring can provide stability and facilitate π-π interactions or hydrogen bonding.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure or when combined with other polar groups (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), are associated with high yields. These groups may enhance solubility and increase the interaction surface with the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group, such as thiol or sulfanyl, particularly when combined with other polar or aromatic groups (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid), tend to result in a high yield. Sulfur groups can form strong interactions with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring, especially when the pyridine is substituted with electron-donating groups (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid), often lead to high yields. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro groups on an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid) can lead to high yields. These groups may influence the electronic environment of the catalyst favorably.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a formyl group attached to an aromatic ring, especially when not combined with other electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The formyl group may deactivate the aromatic ring or interact unfavorably with the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains, particularly when the chain is long or heavily fluorinated (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), are associated with low yields. The high electronegativity and steric bulk of fluorine atoms might hinder effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a ketone group in a non-aromatic structure, especially when not accompanied by other functional groups that can enhance interaction (e.g., 4-oxoheptanedioic acid), generally lead to low yields. The ketone group might not provide beneficial interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a methoxy group on an aromatic ring, particularly when combined with other electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), are associated with high yields. Methoxy groups can donate electron density, potentially stabilizing the transition state.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain, especially when lacking polar or aromatic groups (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The aliphatic chain may not interact effectively with the catalyst or could cause steric hindrance.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure, particularly when the structure is substituted with electron-donating groups (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid), tend to result in high yields. The benzofuran structure might enhance π-π stacking or other favorable interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a secondary amine in a cyclic structure, especially when the cycle is small and rigid (e.g., 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid), are associated with high yields. The cyclic structure can provide rigidity and facilitate specific interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a long aliphatic chain, particularly when not combined with other polar or aromatic groups (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The hydroxyl group may not sufficiently compensate for the lack of interaction from the long chain.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with an acetamido group in combination with an amino acid structure, especially when the acetamido group is bulky or in a position that causes steric hindrance (e.g., (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The acetamido group may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorable interactions.
