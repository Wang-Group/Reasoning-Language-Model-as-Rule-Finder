- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with a carboxylic acid group (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid) tend to result in a high yield. This suggests that the presence of both amino and carboxylic acid groups in a specific configuration enhances the reaction yield.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid) generally lead to a high yield. The aromatic ring may provide stability or facilitate interactions that enhance the reaction.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), are associated with high yields. The presence of multiple hydroxyl groups may enhance solubility or interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group, such as thiol or sulfanyl (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid), tend to result in a high yield. Sulfur groups might interact beneficially with the metal centers in the catalyst.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) often lead to high yields. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring could coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro groups (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid) can lead to high yields. These groups may influence the electronic environment of the catalyst in a favorable way.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a formyl group attached to an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) tend to result in low yields. The formyl group may deactivate the aromatic ring or interact unfavorably with the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) are associated with low yields. The high electronegativity and steric bulk of fluorine atoms might hinder effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a ketone group in a non-aromatic structure (e.g., 4-oxoheptanedioic acid) generally lead to low yields. The ketone group might not provide beneficial interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a methoxy group on an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid) are associated with high yields. Methoxy groups can donate electron density, potentially stabilizing the transition state.

** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern '[NX3][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]' does not fully capture the amino acid structure with a carboxylic acid group. Consider using a more specific pattern that includes both the amino group and the carboxylic acid group in the correct configuration, such as '[NX3][CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: For Rule 2, the SMARTS pattern '[c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]' may not be specific enough to capture the phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid. Consider using '[c][c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]' to ensure the phenyl group is directly attached.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For Rule 3, the SMARTS pattern '[OX2H][CX4][OX2H]' is too generic and may not capture sugar-like structures with multiple hydroxyl groups. Consider using a pattern that captures multiple hydroxyl groups in a specific configuration, such as '[OX2H][CX4][OX2H][CX4][OX2H]'.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: For Rule 4, the SMARTS pattern '[SX2H]' is too broad and may not specifically capture sulfur-containing groups like thiol or sulfanyl. Consider using '[SX2H][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]' to ensure the sulfur group is in the correct context.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: For Rule 5, the SMARTS pattern '[n][c]' is too generic and may not specifically capture pyridine rings. Consider using '[n]1[c][c][c][c][c]1' to ensure the nitrogen is part of a pyridine ring.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: For Rule 6, the SMARTS pattern '[NX3+](=O)[O-]' correctly captures nitro groups, but ensure that the SMILES strings in the dataset actually contain nitro groups to validate this rule.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: For Rule 7, the SMARTS pattern '[c][CX3H]=O' may not fully capture formyl groups on aromatic rings. Consider using '[c][CX3H]=O' with additional context to ensure it is part of an aromatic system.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: For Rule 8, the SMARTS pattern '[CX4](F)(F)(F)' correctly captures fluorinated alkyl chains, but ensure that the SMILES strings in the dataset actually contain such structures to validate this rule.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: For Rule 9, the SMARTS pattern '[CX3](=O)[C;!c]' may not fully capture ketone groups in non-aromatic structures. Consider using '[CX3](=O)[C;!c]' with additional context to ensure it is not part of an aromatic system.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: For Rule 10, the SMARTS pattern '[c][O][C]' may not fully capture methoxy groups on aromatic rings. Consider using '[c][O][C]' with additional context to ensure it is part of an aromatic system.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: Review the SMILES strings and ensure they are correctly parsed and matched against the SMARTS patterns. Consider using RDKit's built-in functions to validate the presence of specific functional groups.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: Consider adding more specific SMARTS patterns for each rule to reduce the number of false negatives (0s) in the feature matrix.

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern '[NX3][CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]' does not accurately capture the amino acid structure with a carboxylic acid group. Consider using a pattern that captures both the amino group and the carboxylic acid group in the correct configuration, such as '[NX3][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]' for the amino acid and '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]' for the carboxylic acid.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: For Rule 2, the SMARTS pattern '[c][c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]' may not fully capture the phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid. Consider using a more specific pattern like '[c]1[c][c][c][c][c]1[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]' to ensure the aromatic ring is fully represented.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For Rule 3, the SMARTS pattern '[OX2H][CX4][OX2H][CX4][OX2H]' may not accurately capture sugar-like structures with multiple hydroxyl groups. Consider using a pattern that captures the cyclic nature and multiple hydroxyl groups, such as '[C@H]([OH])[C@H]([OH])[C@H]([OH])[C@H]([OH])[C@H]([OH])[C@H](=O)O'.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: For Rule 4, the SMARTS pattern '[SX2H][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]' may not fully capture sulfur-containing groups like thiol or sulfanyl. Consider using a pattern like '[SX2H]' for thiol groups and '[SX2]' for sulfanyl groups.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: For Rule 7, the SMARTS pattern '[c][CX3H]=O' may not fully capture formyl groups on aromatic rings. Consider using '[c][CX3H]=O' with additional context to ensure it is part of an aromatic system.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: For Rule 8, the SMARTS pattern '[CX4](F)(F)(F)' captures trifluoromethyl groups but may not capture longer fluorinated alkyl chains. Consider using a pattern like '[CX4](F)(F)(F)[CX4](F)(F)(F)' for longer chains.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: For Rule 9, the SMARTS pattern '[CX3](=O)[C;!c]' may not fully capture ketone groups in non-aromatic structures. Ensure that the pattern excludes aromatic contexts explicitly.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: For Rule 10, the SMARTS pattern '[c][O][C]' may not fully capture methoxy groups on aromatic rings. Consider using '[c][O][CH3]' to ensure the methoxy group is correctly identified.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with a carboxylic acid group (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid) tend to result in a high yield. This suggests that the presence of both amino and carboxylic acid groups in a specific configuration enhances the reaction yield.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid) generally lead to a high yield. The aromatic ring may provide stability or facilitate interactions that enhance the reaction.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), are associated with high yields. The presence of multiple hydroxyl groups may enhance solubility or interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group, such as thiol or sulfanyl (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid), tend to result in a high yield. Sulfur groups might interact beneficially with the metal centers in the catalyst.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) often lead to high yields. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring could coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro groups (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid) can lead to high yields. These groups may influence the electronic environment of the catalyst in a favorable way.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a formyl group attached to an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) tend to result in low yields. The formyl group may deactivate the aromatic ring or interact unfavorably with the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) are associated with low yields. The high electronegativity and steric bulk of fluorine atoms might hinder effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a ketone group in a non-aromatic structure (e.g., 4-oxoheptanedioic acid) generally lead to low yields. The ketone group might not provide beneficial interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a methoxy group on an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid) are associated with high yields. Methoxy groups can donate electron density, potentially stabilizing the transition state.

** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern '[NX3][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]' does not fully capture the amino acid structure with a carboxylic acid group. Consider using a more specific pattern that includes the alpha carbon and the amino group, such as '[NX3][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX2H1])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'.
- ** Suggestion 2 **: For Rule 2, the SMARTS pattern '[c]1[c][c][c][c][c]1[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]' may not accurately capture all phenyl groups with a carboxylic acid. Consider using a more general pattern like '[c]1[c][c][c][c][c]1[CX3](=O)[OX2H0]' to include both protonated and deprotonated forms.
- ** Suggestion 3 **: For Rule 3, the SMARTS pattern '[C@H]([OH])[C@H]([OH])[C@H]([OH])[C@H]([OH])[C@H]([OH])[C@H](=O)O' is too specific. Consider using a more general pattern for multiple hydroxyl groups, such as '[C@H]([OH])[C@H]([OH])[C@H]([OH])[C@H](=O)O' to capture sugar-like structures.
- ** Suggestion 4 **: For Rule 4, the SMARTS patterns '[SX2H]' and '[SX2]' may not capture all sulfur-containing groups. Consider including patterns for thiol and sulfanyl groups, such as '[SX2H]' and '[SX2][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'.
- ** Suggestion 5 **: For Rule 5, the SMARTS pattern '[n]1[c][c][c][c][c]1' captures pyridine rings but may miss substituted pyridines. Consider using a more flexible pattern like '[n]1[c][c][c][c][c]1' with additional substitution patterns.
- ** Suggestion 6 **: For Rule 6, the SMARTS pattern '[NX3+](=O)[O-]' captures nitro groups but may not account for resonance structures. Consider using a more general pattern like '[NX3](=O)[O-]' to capture all forms.
- ** Suggestion 7 **: For Rule 7, the SMARTS pattern '[c][CX3H]=O' may not capture all formyl groups on aromatic rings. Consider using a more specific pattern like '[c][CX3H]=O' with additional aromatic context.
- ** Suggestion 8 **: For Rule 8, the SMARTS pattern '[CX4](F)(F)(F)[CX4](F)(F)(F)' is too specific. Consider using a more general pattern for fluorinated alkyl chains, such as '[CX4](F)(F)(F)'.
- ** Suggestion 9 **: For Rule 9, the SMARTS pattern '[CX3](=O)[C;!c]' may not capture all ketone groups in non-aromatic structures. Consider using a more flexible pattern like '[CX3](=O)[C;!c]' with additional context.
- ** Suggestion 10 **: For Rule 10, the SMARTS pattern '[c][O][CH3]' may not capture all methoxy groups on aromatic rings. Consider using a more general pattern like '[c][OX2][CH3]' to capture all forms.

Metric Commenter Message:
Based on the current metrics, we can observe the following:

1. **Train Support**: The current train support is 0.0686, which is lower than the previous train support values of 0.1667 and 0.1845. This indicates that the current rules apply to a smaller portion of the training data compared to the previous rules. While this might suggest that the rules are more specific, it could also mean that they are not capturing as many relevant instances as before.

2. **Train Confidence**: The current train confidence is 0.6716, which is an improvement over the previous train confidence values of 0.6352 and 0.5396. This suggests that when the rule conditions are met, the likelihood of the rule prediction being true is higher than before. This is a positive development, indicating that the rules are more reliable in predicting outcomes when they apply.

3. **Train Lift**: The current train lift is 1.3317, which is significantly higher than the previous train lift values of 1.2048 and 1.0559. A lift greater than 1 indicates that the rule is more effective than random chance in predicting the outcome. The increase in lift suggests that the current rules are more impactful and provide a stronger association between the conditions and the predictions.

4. **Train Leverage**: The current train leverage is 0.0089, which is positive and an improvement over the previous negative leverage values (-0.0041 and -0.0339). Positive leverage indicates that the rules are capturing associations that are stronger than what would be expected by chance. This improvement suggests that the rules are identifying meaningful patterns in the data.

**Comments and Suggestions for Improvement:**

- **Focus on Increasing Support**: While the confidence and lift have improved, the support has decreased. It may be beneficial to explore additional rule conditions or combinations that can increase the support without compromising the confidence and lift. This could involve identifying more generalizable patterns or relaxing some constraints to capture a broader range of instances.

- **Maintain High Confidence and Lift**: The current rules have achieved higher confidence and lift, which are crucial for the effectiveness of the rules. Any modifications to increase support should aim to maintain or further improve these metrics.

- **Analyze Rule Specificity**: Given the lower support, it might be worth analyzing whether the current rules are too specific or if they are missing key conditions that could apply to more instances. Consider revisiting the dataset to identify any overlooked patterns or interactions that could enhance the rules.

- **Iterate and Validate**: Continue iterating on the rules, using cross-validation or additional test datasets to ensure that the improvements in metrics are consistent and not overfitting to the training data.

Overall, the current rules show promising improvements in confidence and lift, indicating stronger predictive power. However, efforts should be made to increase the support to ensure that the rules are applicable to a larger portion of the data while maintaining their effectiveness.

ML Commenter Message:
### Performance Evaluation of Current Rules

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
   - The current validation accuracy of 0.6286 is significantly lower than the previous reference accuracies, which were consistently around 0.76. This suggests that the current rules are not as effective in predicting the loading of modifiers on catalysts.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment:**
   - The drop in validation accuracy indicates potential underfitting, where the model is not capturing the underlying patterns in the data effectively. This could be due to the rules not being comprehensive or precise enough to capture the complexity of the data.

3. **Discrepancies Analysis:**
   - For molecules where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low, Rule 5 and Rule 9 often have high positive SHAP values, indicating they might be contributing to overestimation.
   - Conversely, for molecules where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, Rule 9 and Rule 10 frequently have high negative SHAP values, suggesting they might be contributing to underestimation.

4. **Accuracy Improvements:**
   - The current accuracy metrics suggest that there is room for improvement. The significant drop in accuracy compared to previous iterations indicates that the current set of rules may not be capturing the necessary features or interactions effectively.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**
   - SHAP analysis highlights that Rule 9 (ketone group in non-aromatic structures) and Rule 10 (methoxy group on aromatic rings) are frequently associated with incorrect predictions. This suggests that these rules may need refinement to better capture the nuances of their impact on catalyst loading.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Rules with High Positive SHAP Values:**
   - **Rule 5 (Pyridine Ring):** Consider revisiting the conditions under which pyridine rings are considered beneficial. It may be necessary to incorporate additional structural or electronic factors that influence their interaction with catalysts.
   - **Rule 9 (Ketone Group):** This rule often contributes to overestimation. It may be beneficial to differentiate between different types of ketone groups or consider their position relative to other functional groups.

2. **Adjust Rules with High Negative SHAP Values:**
   - **Rule 9 (Ketone Group):** As it also contributes to underestimation, further investigation into the specific contexts where ketone groups are beneficial or detrimental is needed.
   - **Rule 10 (Methoxy Group):** This rule should be refined to account for the specific conditions under which methoxy groups enhance catalyst loading, possibly by considering the influence of other substituents on the aromatic ring.

3. **Improve Generalization:**
   - Introduce additional rules or modify existing ones to capture interactions that are currently not well-represented. This could involve incorporating more complex structural features or considering the influence of steric and electronic effects more comprehensively.

4. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - Use insights from SHAP analysis to iteratively test and refine rules. This could involve creating new rules based on observed patterns in SHAP values or adjusting thresholds and conditions within existing rules to better align predictions with experimental outcomes.

By addressing these areas, the rules can be refined to improve both the accuracy and generalization of the model, ultimately leading to better predictions of catalyst loading.

### Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimization

1. **Current Rule Performance:**
   - The current rules have shown improvements in train confidence and lift, indicating stronger predictive power when the rules apply. However, the train support has decreased, suggesting that the rules are applicable to a smaller portion of the data.
   - The validation accuracy has dropped significantly compared to previous iterations, indicating potential underfitting and a need for more comprehensive rules.

2. **SHAP Analysis Insights:**
   - Rules 5 and 9 are frequently associated with incorrect predictions, either overestimating or underestimating the loading of modifiers on catalysts. This suggests that these rules may need refinement to better capture the nuances of their impact.
   - Rule 10 also shows high negative SHAP values in some cases, indicating a need for adjustment.

3. **Suggestions for Rule Refinement:**
   - **Rule 1**: Use a more specific SMARTS pattern to capture the amino acid structure with a carboxylic acid group.
   - **Rule 2**: Consider a more general pattern for phenyl groups with a carboxylic acid to include both protonated and deprotonated forms.
   - **Rule 3**: Use a more general pattern for multiple hydroxyl groups to capture sugar-like structures.
   - **Rule 4**: Include patterns for thiol and sulfanyl groups to capture all sulfur-containing groups.
   - **Rule 5**: Use a more flexible pattern for pyridine rings to include substituted pyridines.
   - **Rule 6**: Consider a more general pattern for nitro groups to capture all forms.
   - **Rule 7**: Use a more specific pattern for formyl groups on aromatic rings.
   - **Rule 8**: Consider a more general pattern for fluorinated alkyl chains.
   - **Rule 9**: Use a more flexible pattern for ketone groups in non-aromatic structures.
   - **Rule 10**: Use a more general pattern for methoxy groups on aromatic rings.

4. **Recommendations for Improvement:**
   - Refine rules with high positive SHAP values to better capture beneficial interactions.
   - Adjust rules with high negative SHAP values to account for specific conditions that enhance catalyst loading.
   - Introduce additional rules or modify existing ones to capture interactions not well-represented.
   - Use iterative refinement based on SHAP analysis to test and adjust rules.

### Possibility for Further Optimization

There is a clear possibility for further optimization of the current rules. The significant drop in validation accuracy and the insights from SHAP analysis indicate that the current rules are not fully capturing the necessary features or interactions. By refining the rules and incorporating additional patterns, the model can be improved to better predict catalyst loading without overfitting.

    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with a carboxylic acid group (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid) tend to result in a high yield. This suggests that the presence of both amino and carboxylic acid groups in a specific configuration enhances the reaction yield.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid) generally lead to a high yield. The aromatic ring may provide stability or facilitate interactions that enhance the reaction.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), are associated with high yields. The presence of multiple hydroxyl groups may enhance solubility or interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group, such as thiol or sulfanyl (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid), tend to result in a high yield. Sulfur groups might interact beneficially with the metal centers in the catalyst.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) often lead to high yields. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring could coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro groups (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid) can lead to high yields. These groups may influence the electronic environment of the catalyst in a favorable way.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a formyl group attached to an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) tend to result in low yields. The formyl group may deactivate the aromatic ring or interact unfavorably with the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) are associated with low yields. The high electronegativity and steric bulk of fluorine atoms might hinder effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a ketone group in a non-aromatic structure (e.g., 4-oxoheptanedioic acid) generally lead to low yields. The ketone group might not provide beneficial interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a methoxy group on an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid) are associated with high yields. Methoxy groups can donate electron density, potentially stabilizing the transition state.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with a carboxylic acid group, particularly when the amino group is in a secondary position (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid), tend to result in a high yield. This configuration may enhance coordination with the metal centers in the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid or a hydroxyl group (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid) generally lead to a high yield. The aromatic ring can provide stability and facilitate π-π interactions or hydrogen bonding.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), are associated with high yields. These groups may enhance solubility and increase the interaction surface with the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group, such as thiol or sulfanyl (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid), tend to result in a high yield. Sulfur groups can form strong interactions with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Advice 1**: Increase the dataset size to improve the coverage of each rule. Many rules are supported by only one or two data points, which limits their reliability. A larger dataset will provide more robust support for the rules and help identify any exceptions or additional patterns.

- **Advice 2**: Consider incorporating quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling to identify additional molecular features that may influence yield. This approach can help refine existing rules and potentially uncover new rules based on subtle structural differences.

- **Advice 3**: Re-evaluate Rule 4 regarding sulfur-containing groups. The contradiction with 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid suggests that additional factors may influence the yield. Investigate whether specific structural contexts or additional functional groups affect the interaction of sulfur with the catalyst.

- **Advice 4**: For rules with limited data support, such as those involving methoxy groups or benzofuran structures, conduct targeted experiments to validate these rules. This will help confirm their validity and potentially refine the rules based on new findings.

- **Advice 5**: Explore the use of computational chemistry tools to simulate interactions between modifiers and the catalyst. This can provide insights into the molecular interactions that drive high or low yields, helping to refine existing rules or develop new ones.

- **Advice 6**: Consider the potential impact of solvent effects and reaction conditions on the rules. Modifiers may behave differently under varying conditions, so it may be beneficial to include these variables in the rule generation process.

**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: Increase the specificity of Rule 4 by distinguishing between different types of sulfur-containing groups. The current rule does not account for the low yield observed with 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid, suggesting that not all sulfur groups interact beneficially with the catalyst. Consider adding sub-rules or exceptions for specific sulfur-containing structures.

- **Advice 2**: Enhance Rule 3 by incorporating additional data points or examples to improve its coverage. Currently, it is supported by only one data point, which limits its reliability. Consider exploring other sugar-like structures with multiple hydroxyl groups to validate and strengthen the rule.

- **Advice 3**: For Rule 6, consider exploring additional electron-withdrawing groups beyond nitro groups to broaden the rule's applicability. This could involve testing other groups like cyano or trifluoromethyl to see if they also lead to high yields.

- **Advice 4**: Refine Rule 8 by investigating the impact of different degrees of fluorination on yield. The current rule is based on a single example, and understanding how varying the number of fluorine atoms affects the interaction with the catalyst could provide more nuanced guidance.

- **Advice 5**: Consider adding a rule or modifying existing rules to account for the influence of steric factors more explicitly. For example, Rule 11 mentions steric hindrance from long aliphatic chains, but similar considerations might apply to other bulky groups not currently covered.

- **Advice 6**: Improve Rule 10 by exploring the effect of methoxy group positioning on the aromatic ring. The current rule does not specify whether the position of the methoxy group (ortho, meta, para) affects the yield, which could be a significant factor.

- **Advice 7**: For Rule 13, consider expanding the rule to include other cyclic structures with secondary amines, as the current rule is based on a single example. This could help determine if the observed high yield is a general feature of such structures.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with an acetamido group in combination with an amino acid structure (e.g., (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid) tend to result in low yields. The acetamido group may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorable interactions.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern `[NX3H1+0,NX4H2+;!$([N][!C])]` does not accurately capture the presence of a secondary amino group in a specific position. Consider using a more specific SMARTS pattern that captures the secondary position of the amino group in relation to the carboxylic acid group.
- ** Suggestion 2 **: Rule 2's SMARTS pattern `[c][CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])[$([OX2H]),$([OX1-])]` should be revised to ensure it captures the phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid or hydroxyl group. The current pattern may not be specific enough to differentiate between various aromatic structures.
- ** Suggestion 3 **: Rule 3's SMARTS pattern `[OX2H][CX3;$([H1]),$([C][#6])]=[CX3]` does not effectively capture sugar-like structures with multiple hydroxyl groups. Consider using a pattern that identifies multiple hydroxyl groups in a cyclic or linear sugar-like structure.
- ** Suggestion 4 **: For Rule 4, the SMARTS pattern `[SX2H;$([SX2H][CX4;!$(C([SX2H])~[O,S,#7,#15])])]` should be checked to ensure it captures sulfur-containing groups like thiol or sulfanyl accurately. The current pattern may not be specific enough.
- ** Suggestion 5 **: Rule 5's SMARTS pattern `[n][c][CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])[$([OX2H]),$([OX1-])]` should be revised to ensure it captures the presence of a pyridine ring effectively. The current pattern may not accurately identify pyridine structures.
- ** Suggestion 6 **: Rule 6's SMARTS pattern `[NX3+](=O)-[OX-]` should be checked to ensure it captures electron-withdrawing groups like nitro groups accurately. The current pattern may not be specific enough.
- ** Suggestion 7 **: Rule 7's SMARTS pattern `[c][CX3H]=[OX1]` should be revised to ensure it captures formyl groups attached to aromatic rings effectively. The current pattern may not accurately identify such structures.
- ** Suggestion 8 **: Rule 8's SMARTS pattern `[CX4](F)(F)F` should be checked to ensure it captures fluorinated alkyl chains accurately. The current pattern may not be specific enough to identify longer fluorinated chains.
- ** Suggestion 9 **: Rule 9's SMARTS pattern `[CX3;$([CX3]([#6])[#6])](=[OX1])` should be revised to ensure it captures ketone groups in non-aromatic structures effectively. The current pattern may not accurately identify such structures.
- ** Suggestion 10 **: Rule 10's SMARTS pattern `[c][OX2;$([H0]([#6X4])[c])]` should be checked to ensure it captures methoxy groups on aromatic rings accurately. The current pattern may not be specific enough.
- ** Suggestion 11 **: Rule 11's SMARTS pattern `[CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4]` should be revised to ensure it captures long aliphatic chains effectively. The current pattern may not accurately identify such structures.
- ** Suggestion 12 **: Rule 12's SMARTS pattern `[o]1ccccc1` should be checked to ensure it captures benzofuran structures accurately. The current pattern may not be specific enough.
- ** Suggestion 13 **: Rule 13's SMARTS pattern `[n][CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])[$([OX2H]),$([OX1-])]` should be revised to ensure it captures cyclic structures with a carboxylic acid group and a secondary amine effectively. The current pattern may not accurately identify such structures.
- ** Suggestion 14 **: Rule 14's SMARTS pattern `[CX4][OX2H]` should be checked to ensure it captures hydroxyl groups on long aliphatic chains accurately. The current pattern may not be specific enough.
- ** Suggestion 15 **: Rule 15's SMARTS pattern `[NX3;$([H2]),$([H1][#6]),$([H0]([#6])[#6])][CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])[$([OX2H]),$([OX1-])]` should be revised to ensure it captures acetamido groups in combination with amino acid structures effectively. The current pattern may not accurately identify such structures.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with a carboxylic acid group, particularly when the amino group is in a secondary position (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid), tend to result in a high yield. This configuration may enhance coordination with the metal centers in the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid or a hydroxyl group (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid) generally lead to a high yield. The aromatic ring can provide stability and facilitate π-π interactions or hydrogen bonding.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), are associated with high yields. These groups may enhance solubility and increase the interaction surface with the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group, such as thiol or sulfanyl (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid), tend to result in a high yield. Sulfur groups can form strong interactions with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) often lead to high yields. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro groups (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid) can lead to high yields. These groups may influence the electronic environment of the catalyst favorably.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a formyl group attached to an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) tend to result in low yields. The formyl group may deactivate the aromatic ring or interact unfavorably with the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) are associated with low yields. The high electronegativity and steric bulk of fluorine atoms might hinder effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a ketone group in a non-aromatic structure (e.g., 4-oxoheptanedioic acid) generally lead to low yields. The ketone group might not provide beneficial interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a methoxy group on an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid) are associated with high yields. Methoxy groups can donate electron density, potentially stabilizing the transition state.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid) tend to result in low yields. The aliphatic chain may not interact effectively with the catalyst or could cause steric hindrance.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yields. The benzofuran structure might enhance π-π stacking or other favorable interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a secondary amine in a cyclic structure (e.g., 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid) are associated with high yields. The cyclic structure can provide rigidity and facilitate specific interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a long aliphatic chain (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) tend to result in low yields. The hydroxyl group may not sufficiently compensate for the lack of interaction from the long chain.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with an acetamido group in combination with an amino acid structure (e.g., (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid) tend to result in low yields. The acetamido group may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorable interactions.

** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern `[NX3H1+0,NX4H2+;!$([N][!C])]` does not accurately capture the requirement of a secondary amino group in a specific position. Consider refining the SMARTS to specifically target secondary amino groups in a secondary position relative to a carboxylic acid group.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Rule 2's SMARTS pattern `[c][CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])[$([OX2H]),$([OX1-])]` should be adjusted to ensure it captures the phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid or hydroxyl group. The current pattern may not fully capture the aromatic stability and π-π interactions described.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: Rule 3's SMARTS pattern `[OX2H][CX3;$([H1]),$([C][#6])]=[CX3]` does not effectively capture sugar-like structures with multiple hydroxyl groups. Consider using a pattern that identifies multiple hydroxyl groups in a sugar-like configuration.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: For Rule 4, the SMARTS pattern `[SX2H;$([SX2H][CX4;!$(C([SX2H])~[O,S,#7,#15])])]` should be reviewed to ensure it captures sulfur-containing groups like thiol or sulfanyl accurately. The current pattern may not fully represent the strong interactions with metal centers.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: Rule 5's SMARTS pattern `[n][c][CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])[$([OX2H]),$([OX1-])]` should be refined to specifically target pyridine rings. The current pattern may not effectively capture the nitrogen coordination with metal centers.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Rule 6's SMARTS pattern `[NX3+](=O)-[OX-]` should be checked to ensure it captures electron-withdrawing groups like nitro groups accurately. The pattern should reflect the influence on the electronic environment of the catalyst.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: Rule 7's SMARTS pattern `[c][CX3H]=[OX1]` should be reviewed to ensure it captures formyl groups attached to aromatic rings accurately. The current pattern may not fully represent the deactivation of the aromatic ring.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Rule 8's SMARTS pattern `[CX4](F)(F)F` should be checked to ensure it captures fluorinated alkyl chains accurately. The pattern should reflect the steric bulk and electronegativity of fluorine atoms.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: Rule 9's SMARTS pattern `[CX3;$([CX3]([#6])[#6])](=[OX1])` should be reviewed to ensure it captures ketone groups in non-aromatic structures accurately. The current pattern may not fully represent the lack of beneficial interactions with the catalyst.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Rule 10's SMARTS pattern `[c][OX2;$([H0]([#6X4])[c])]` should be refined to specifically target methoxy groups on aromatic rings. The current pattern may not effectively capture the electron-donating properties.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: Rule 11's SMARTS pattern `[CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4]` should be reviewed to ensure it captures long aliphatic chains accurately. The current pattern may not fully represent the lack of interaction with the catalyst.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: Rule 12's SMARTS pattern `[o]1ccccc1` should be checked to ensure it captures benzofuran structures accurately. The pattern should reflect the π-π stacking interactions.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: Rule 13's SMARTS pattern `[n][CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])[$([OX2H]),$([OX1-])]` should be refined to specifically target cyclic structures with a carboxylic acid group and a secondary amine. The current pattern may not effectively capture the rigidity and specific interactions.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: Rule 14's SMARTS pattern `[CX4][OX2H]` should be reviewed to ensure it captures hydroxyl groups on long aliphatic chains accurately. The current pattern may not fully represent the insufficient compensation for lack of interaction.

- ** Suggestion 15 **: Rule 15's SMARTS pattern `[NX3;$([H2]),$([H1][#6]),$([H0]([#6])[#6])][CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])[$([OX2H]),$([OX1-])]` should be refined to specifically target acetamido groups in combination with amino acid structures. The current pattern may not effectively capture the steric hindrance or unfavorable interactions.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with a carboxylic acid group, particularly when the amino group is in a secondary position (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid), tend to result in a high yield. This configuration may enhance coordination with the metal centers in the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid or a hydroxyl group (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid) generally lead to a high yield. The aromatic ring can provide stability and facilitate π-π interactions or hydrogen bonding.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), are associated with high yields. These groups may enhance solubility and increase the interaction surface with the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group, such as thiol or sulfanyl (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid), tend to result in a high yield. Sulfur groups can form strong interactions with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) often lead to high yields. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro groups (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid) can lead to high yields. These groups may influence the electronic environment of the catalyst favorably.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a formyl group attached to an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) tend to result in low yields. The formyl group may deactivate the aromatic ring or interact unfavorably with the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) are associated with low yields. The high electronegativity and steric bulk of fluorine atoms might hinder effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a ketone group in a non-aromatic structure (e.g., 4-oxoheptanedioic acid) generally lead to low yields. The ketone group might not provide beneficial interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a methoxy group on an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid) are associated with high yields. Methoxy groups can donate electron density, potentially stabilizing the transition state.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid) tend to result in low yields. The aliphatic chain may not interact effectively with the catalyst or could cause steric hindrance.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yields. The benzofuran structure might enhance π-π stacking or other favorable interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a secondary amine in a cyclic structure (e.g., 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid) are associated with high yields. The cyclic structure can provide rigidity and facilitate specific interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a long aliphatic chain (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) tend to result in low yields. The hydroxyl group may not sufficiently compensate for the lack of interaction from the long chain.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with an acetamido group in combination with an amino acid structure (e.g., (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid) tend to result in low yields. The acetamido group may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorable interactions.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern `[NX3H1+0,NX4H2+;!$([N][!C])]` does not fully capture the specific amino acid structure with a secondary amino group. Consider using a more specific SMARTS pattern that includes the secondary amino group and carboxylic acid group in the correct configuration.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Rule 2's SMARTS pattern `[c][CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])[$([OX2H]),$([OX1-])]` should be refined to ensure it captures the phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid or hydroxyl group. The current pattern may not be specific enough to differentiate between similar structures.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: Rule 3's SMARTS pattern `[OX2H][CX3;$([H1]),$([C][#6])]=[CX3]` does not accurately represent sugar-like structures with multiple hydroxyl groups. Consider using a pattern that captures multiple hydroxyl groups in a sugar-like configuration.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: For Rule 4, the SMARTS pattern `[SX2H;$([SX2H][CX4;!$(C([SX2H])~[O,S,#7,#15])])]` should be checked to ensure it captures sulfur-containing groups like thiol or sulfanyl accurately. The current pattern may not be specific enough.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: Rule 5's SMARTS pattern `[n][c][CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])[$([OX2H]),$([OX1-])]` should be revised to ensure it captures pyridine rings accurately. The current pattern may not fully represent the nitrogen coordination with metal centers.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Rule 6's SMARTS pattern `[NX3+](=O)-[OX-]` should be checked to ensure it captures electron-withdrawing groups like nitro groups accurately. The current pattern may not be specific enough.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: Rule 7's SMARTS pattern `[c][CX3H]=[OX1]` should be revised to ensure it captures formyl groups attached to aromatic rings accurately. The current pattern may not fully represent the deactivating effect of the formyl group.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Rule 8's SMARTS pattern `[CX4](F)(F)F` should be checked to ensure it captures fluorinated alkyl chains accurately. The current pattern may not be specific enough to represent the steric bulk of fluorine atoms.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: Rule 9's SMARTS pattern `[CX3;$([CX3]([#6])[#6])](=[OX1])` should be revised to ensure it captures ketone groups in non-aromatic structures accurately. The current pattern may not fully represent the lack of beneficial interactions.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Rule 10's SMARTS pattern `[c][OX2;$([H0]([#6X4])[c])]` should be checked to ensure it captures methoxy groups on aromatic rings accurately. The current pattern may not fully represent the electron-donating effect.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: Rule 11's SMARTS pattern `[CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4]` should be revised to ensure it captures long aliphatic chains accurately. The current pattern may not fully represent the lack of interaction with the catalyst.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: Rule 12's SMARTS pattern `[o]1ccccc1` should be checked to ensure it captures benzofuran structures accurately. The current pattern may not fully represent the π-π stacking interactions.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: Rule 13's SMARTS pattern `[n][CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])[$([OX2H]),$([OX1-])]` should be revised to ensure it captures cyclic structures with a carboxylic acid group and secondary amine accurately. The current pattern may not fully represent the rigidity and specific interactions.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: Rule 14's SMARTS pattern `[CX4][OX2H]` should be checked to ensure it captures hydroxyl groups on long aliphatic chains accurately. The current pattern may not fully represent the lack of compensatory interaction.

- ** Suggestion 15 **: Rule 15's SMARTS pattern `[NX3;$([H2]),$([H1][#6]),$([H0]([#6])[#6])][CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])[$([OX2H]),$([OX1-])]` should be revised to ensure it captures acetamido groups in combination with amino acid structures accurately. The current pattern may not fully represent the steric hindrance or unfavorable interactions.

Metric Commenter Message:
Based on the current metrics and comparing them to the reference metrics, we can make several observations about the performance of the current rules:

1. **Train Support**: The current train support is 0.0248, which is significantly lower than the previous iteration's train support of 0.0686. This indicates that the current rules apply to a smaller subset of the training data. While this might suggest more specific rules, it could also mean that the rules are too narrow and not capturing enough relevant cases.

2. **Train Confidence**: The current train confidence is 0.6189, which is slightly lower than the previous iteration's confidence of 0.6716. This decrease suggests that the rules are slightly less reliable in predicting the outcome when the conditions are met. However, the confidence is still relatively high, indicating that the rules are generally effective.

3. **Train Lift**: The current train lift is 1.2399, which is lower than the previous iteration's lift of 1.3317. While the lift is still above 1, indicating that the rules provide useful information beyond random chance, the decrease suggests that the rules are less impactful in increasing the probability of the predicted outcome compared to the previous iteration.

4. **Train Leverage**: The current train leverage is 0.0039, which is lower than the previous iteration's leverage of 0.0089. This decrease indicates that the rules provide less additional support over what would be expected by chance, suggesting that the rules might not be as strong in highlighting associations.

### Recommendations for Improvement:

- **Broaden Rule Conditions**: Consider revisiting the rule conditions to ensure they are not too restrictive. This could help increase the support by capturing a larger portion of the dataset.

- **Refine Rule Conditions**: While broadening, ensure that the conditions still maintain a high level of relevance to the outcome. This balance can help improve confidence and lift.

- **Explore New Features**: Investigate additional features or interactions that might not have been considered. This could lead to the discovery of new, impactful rules.

- **Iterate on Rule Specificity**: Test variations of the current rules to find a balance between specificity and generality, aiming to improve both support and confidence.

- **Analyze Low-Yield Rules**: For rules associated with low yields, consider if they can be refined or if they should be excluded to focus on more promising conditions.

Overall, while the current rules are still providing useful insights, there is room for improvement, particularly in increasing the support and lift to ensure the rules are both broadly applicable and impactful.

### Performance Evaluation of Current Rules

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
   - The current rules have shown some improvement in validation accuracy from 0.6286 to 0.6857. This suggests that the rules are becoming more effective in capturing the underlying patterns in the data. However, the test accuracy from previous iterations was higher (0.75), indicating that there might still be room for improvement.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment:**
   - The increase in validation accuracy suggests that the model is learning better from the training data. However, the discrepancy between the validation and test accuracies in previous iterations indicates potential overfitting. The current rules might be too tailored to the training data, leading to less generalization on unseen data.

3. **Discrepancy Analysis:**
   - For molecules where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low, rules with high positive SHAP values (e.g., Rule 1, Rule 7, Rule 8, Rule 11) might be contributing to overestimation. Conversely, for molecules where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, rules with high negative SHAP values (e.g., Rule 14) might be causing underestimation.

4. **Accuracy Improvement Interpretation:**
   - The improvement in validation accuracy suggests that the current rules are moving in the right direction. However, the model's performance on unseen data (test set) should be monitored to ensure that these improvements are not just due to overfitting.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**
   - SHAP analysis indicates that certain rules (e.g., Rule 1, Rule 7, Rule 8, Rule 11) have a significant impact on the predictions. Adjusting these rules could help in reducing overestimation. Similarly, rules with high negative SHAP values (e.g., Rule 14) should be refined to address underestimation.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Overestimated Loading Rules:**
   - Rules with high positive SHAP values for overestimated loadings, such as Rule 1, Rule 7, Rule 8, and Rule 11, should be reviewed. Consider adding conditions or constraints to these rules to prevent overestimation.

2. **Adjust Underestimated Loading Rules:**
   - Rules with high negative SHAP values for underestimated loadings, such as Rule 14, should be adjusted. This could involve relaxing some constraints or adding additional features that capture the missing interactions.

3. **Improve Generalization:**
   - To address potential overfitting, consider simplifying some of the rules or combining similar rules to reduce complexity. This can help improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

4. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - Use insights from SHAP analysis to iteratively refine the rules. Focus on rules that consistently show high SHAP values (positive or negative) and evaluate their impact on both training and validation sets.

5. **Monitor Test Performance:**
   - Continuously monitor the model's performance on a separate test set to ensure that improvements in validation accuracy translate to better generalization on unseen data.

By implementing these recommendations, the rules can be refined to improve both the accuracy and generalization of the model, leading to more reliable predictions of modifier loading on catalysts.

### Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimization

1. **Effectiveness and Performance Evaluation:**
   - The current rules have shown an improvement in validation accuracy, indicating better learning from the training data. However, the test accuracy from previous iterations was higher, suggesting potential overfitting.
   - The current rules have lower train support, confidence, lift, and leverage compared to previous iterations, indicating that they might be too narrow and not capturing enough relevant cases.

2. **SHAP Analysis Insights:**
   - Certain rules (e.g., Rule 1, Rule 7, Rule 8, Rule 11) have high positive SHAP values, contributing to overestimation of modifier loading. Conversely, Rule 14 has high negative SHAP values, leading to underestimation.
   - Adjusting these rules could help in reducing overestimation and underestimation, improving the model's accuracy.

3. **Rule Specificity and Generalization:**
   - The rules might be too tailored to the training data, leading to less generalization on unseen data. Simplifying some rules or combining similar rules could help improve generalization.
   - The current SMARTS patterns for several rules may not fully capture the intended chemical structures, leading to inaccuracies in predictions.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Overestimated Loading Rules:**
   - Review and adjust rules with high positive SHAP values (e.g., Rule 1, Rule 7, Rule 8, Rule 11) to prevent overestimation. Consider adding conditions or constraints to these rules.

2. **Adjust Underestimated Loading Rules:**
   - Modify rules with high negative SHAP values (e.g., Rule 14) to address underestimation. This could involve relaxing some constraints or adding additional features.

3. **Broaden Rule Conditions:**
   - Revisit rule conditions to ensure they are not too restrictive, which could help increase support by capturing a larger portion of the dataset.

4. **Refine SMARTS Patterns:**
   - Ensure that SMARTS patterns accurately represent the intended chemical structures. This may involve revising patterns to better capture specific functional groups or configurations.

5. **Iterative Refinement and Monitoring:**
   - Use insights from SHAP analysis to iteratively refine the rules, focusing on those with significant SHAP values. Continuously monitor the model's performance on a separate test set to ensure improvements translate to better generalization.

### Possibility for Further Optimization

There is potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. By refining rule conditions, adjusting SMARTS patterns, and iteratively testing and monitoring performance, the rules can be improved to enhance both accuracy and generalization.

    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with a carboxylic acid group, particularly when the amino group is in a secondary position (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid), tend to result in a high yield. This configuration may enhance coordination with the metal centers in the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid or a hydroxyl group (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid) generally lead to a high yield. The aromatic ring can provide stability and facilitate π-π interactions or hydrogen bonding.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), are associated with high yields. These groups may enhance solubility and increase the interaction surface with the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group, such as thiol or sulfanyl (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid), tend to result in a high yield. Sulfur groups can form strong interactions with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) often lead to high yields. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro groups (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid) can lead to high yields. These groups may influence the electronic environment of the catalyst favorably.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a formyl group attached to an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) tend to result in low yields. The formyl group may deactivate the aromatic ring or interact unfavorably with the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) are associated with low yields. The high electronegativity and steric bulk of fluorine atoms might hinder effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a ketone group in a non-aromatic structure (e.g., 4-oxoheptanedioic acid) generally lead to low yields. The ketone group might not provide beneficial interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a methoxy group on an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid) are associated with high yields. Methoxy groups can donate electron density, potentially stabilizing the transition state.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid) tend to result in low yields. The aliphatic chain may not interact effectively with the catalyst or could cause steric hindrance.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yields. The benzofuran structure might enhance π-π stacking or other favorable interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a secondary amine in a cyclic structure (e.g., 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid) are associated with high yields. The cyclic structure can provide rigidity and facilitate specific interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a long aliphatic chain (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) tend to result in low yields. The hydroxyl group may not sufficiently compensate for the lack of interaction from the long chain.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with an acetamido group in combination with an amino acid structure (e.g., (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid) tend to result in low yields. The acetamido group may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorable interactions.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: For rules with high positive SHAP values (e.g., Rule 1, Rule 7, Rule 8, Rule 11), consider adding additional constraints or conditions that account for the specific interactions that lead to overestimation. For instance, Rule 1 could be refined by specifying the spatial arrangement or steric factors that influence coordination with metal centers.

- **Advice 2**: For Rule 14, which has high negative SHAP values, consider relaxing some constraints or incorporating additional features that might enhance interaction with the catalyst. This could involve considering the presence of other functional groups that might compensate for the long aliphatic chain.

- **Advice 3**: Broaden the conditions of the rules to capture a wider range of relevant cases. This could involve combining similar rules or simplifying overly specific conditions to improve generalization. For example, rules involving aromatic structures could be generalized to include a broader range of aromatic derivatives.

- **Advice 4**: Review and refine the SMARTS patterns used in the rules to ensure they accurately capture the intended chemical structures. This may involve revising patterns to better represent specific functional groups or configurations, ensuring they align with the chemical intuition behind the rules.

- **Advice 5**: Implement an iterative process of refinement and testing. Use SHAP analysis insights to focus on rules with significant SHAP values, and continuously monitor the model's performance on a separate test set to ensure that changes lead to improved generalization and accuracy.

- **Advice 1**: Increase the dataset size to improve the coverage of each rule. Many rules are supported by only one or two data points, which limits their reliability. A larger dataset will provide more robust support for the rules and help identify any exceptions or additional patterns.

- **Advice 2**: Consider incorporating quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling to predict yields based on molecular descriptors. This approach can provide a more nuanced understanding of how different structural features contribute to reaction outcomes and help refine the rules.

- **Advice 3**: Introduce sub-rules or conditions for rules with known exceptions. For example, Rule 4 regarding sulfur-containing groups has a contradiction with 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid. Identifying specific conditions under which these exceptions occur can improve the rule's accuracy.

- **Advice 4**: Explore the use of machine learning algorithms to analyze the dataset and suggest new rules or modifications to existing ones. These algorithms can identify complex patterns and interactions that may not be immediately apparent through manual analysis.

- **Advice 5**: Conduct experimental validation of the rules to confirm their predictive power. This step is crucial for ensuring that the rules are not only theoretically sound but also practically applicable in real-world scenarios.

- **Advice 6**: Consider the influence of reaction conditions (e.g., temperature, solvent, light intensity) on the yield and incorporate these factors into the rules. This approach can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the reaction system and improve the rules' predictive accuracy.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a formyl group attached to an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) tend to result in low yields. The formyl group may deactivate the aromatic ring or interact unfavorably with the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) are associated with low yields. The high electronegativity and steric bulk of fluorine atoms might hinder effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a ketone group in a non-aromatic structure (e.g., 4-oxoheptanedioic acid) generally lead to low yields. The ketone group might not provide beneficial interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a methoxy group on an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid) are associated with high yields. Methoxy groups can donate electron density, potentially stabilizing the transition state.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid) tend to result in low yields. The aliphatic chain may not interact effectively with the catalyst or could cause steric hindrance.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yields. The benzofuran structure might enhance π-π stacking or other favorable interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a secondary amine in a cyclic structure (e.g., 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid) are associated with high yields. The cyclic structure can provide rigidity and facilitate specific interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a long aliphatic chain (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) tend to result in low yields. The hydroxyl group may not sufficiently compensate for the lack of interaction from the long chain.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with an acetamido group in combination with an amino acid structure (e.g., (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid) tend to result in low yields. The acetamido group may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorable interactions.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with a carboxylic acid group, particularly when the amino group is in a secondary position (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid), tend to result in a high yield. This configuration may enhance coordination with the metal centers in the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid or a hydroxyl group (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid) generally lead to a high yield. The aromatic ring can provide stability and facilitate π-π interactions or hydrogen bonding.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), are associated with high yields. These groups may enhance solubility and increase the interaction surface with the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group, such as thiol or sulfanyl (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid), tend to result in a high yield. Sulfur groups can form strong interactions with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) often lead to high yields. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro groups (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid) can lead to high yields. These groups may influence the electronic environment of the catalyst favorably.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a formyl group attached to an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) tend to result in low yields. The formyl group may deactivate the aromatic ring or interact unfavorably with the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) are associated with low yields. The high electronegativity and steric bulk of fluorine atoms might hinder effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a ketone group in a non-aromatic structure (e.g., 4-oxoheptanedioic acid) generally lead to low yields. The ketone group might not provide beneficial interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a methoxy group on an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid) are associated with high yields. Methoxy groups can donate electron density, potentially stabilizing the transition state.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid) tend to result in low yields. The aliphatic chain may not interact effectively with the catalyst or could cause steric hindrance.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yields. The benzofuran structure might enhance π-π stacking or other favorable interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a secondary amine in a cyclic structure (e.g., 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid) are associated with high yields. The cyclic structure can provide rigidity and facilitate specific interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a long aliphatic chain (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) tend to result in low yields. The hydroxyl group may not sufficiently compensate for the lack of interaction from the long chain.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with an acetamido group in combination with an amino acid structure (e.g., (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid) tend to result in low yields. The acetamido group may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorable interactions.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with a carboxylic acid group, particularly when the amino group is in a secondary position (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid), tend to result in a high yield. This configuration may enhance coordination with the metal centers in the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid or a hydroxyl group (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid) generally lead to a high yield. The aromatic ring can provide stability and facilitate π-π interactions or hydrogen bonding.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), are associated with high yields. These groups may enhance solubility and increase the interaction surface with the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group, such as thiol or sulfanyl (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid), tend to result in a high yield. Sulfur groups can form strong interactions with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) often lead to high yields. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro groups (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid) can lead to high yields. These groups may influence the electronic environment of the catalyst favorably.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a formyl group attached to an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) tend to result in low yields. The formyl group may deactivate the aromatic ring or interact unfavorably with the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) are associated with low yields. The high electronegativity and steric bulk of fluorine atoms might hinder effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a ketone group in a non-aromatic structure (e.g., 4-oxoheptanedioic acid) generally lead to low yields. The ketone group might not provide beneficial interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a methoxy group on an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid) are associated with high yields. Methoxy groups can donate electron density, potentially stabilizing the transition state.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid) tend to result in low yields. The aliphatic chain may not interact effectively with the catalyst or could cause steric hindrance.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yields. The benzofuran structure might enhance π-π stacking or other favorable interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a secondary amine in a cyclic structure (e.g., 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid) are associated with high yields. The cyclic structure can provide rigidity and facilitate specific interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a long aliphatic chain (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) tend to result in low yields. The hydroxyl group may not sufficiently compensate for the lack of interaction from the long chain.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with an acetamido group in combination with an amino acid structure (e.g., (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid) tend to result in low yields. The acetamido group may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorable interactions.

** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: Rule 1 in the code uses the SMARTS pattern '[NX3H1][CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])', which does not accurately capture the description of amino acids with a secondary amino group. The SMARTS should be adjusted to specifically identify secondary amines in amino acid structures, such as '[NX3H1][CX3H](C(=O)O)'.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Rule 2's SMARTS pattern '[c][CX3](=[OX1])[OX2H]' is too broad and may not specifically capture the phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid or hydroxyl group. Consider refining the SMARTS to '[c][CX3](=[OX1])[OX2H]' to ensure it matches the specific structures described in the rule.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: Rule 3's SMARTS '[CX4;!$(C(O)(O)[!#6])][OX2H]' does not effectively capture sugar-like structures with multiple hydroxyl groups. A more specific SMARTS pattern that captures multiple hydroxyl groups in a sugar-like structure should be used, such as '[C@H]([OH])[C@H]([OH])[C@H]([OH])[C@H]([OH])[C@H](O)C(=O)O'.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Rule 4's SMARTS '[SX2H]' is correct for thiol groups, but it should also consider other sulfur-containing groups like sulfanyl. Consider expanding the SMARTS to include '[SX2H]' and '[SX2]' for broader coverage.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: Rule 5's SMARTS '[n]1ccccc1' correctly identifies pyridine rings, but ensure it is applied correctly in the context of the rule. Verify that the SMILES strings are being parsed correctly to identify pyridine structures.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Rule 6's SMARTS '[NX3+](=O)[O-]' correctly identifies nitro groups, but ensure that the SMILES strings are being parsed correctly to identify these structures.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: Rule 7's SMARTS '[c][CX3H]=[OX1]' may not accurately capture formyl groups attached to aromatic rings. Consider refining the SMARTS to '[c][CX3H]=[OX1]' to ensure it matches the specific structures described in the rule.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Rule 8's SMARTS '[CX4](F)(F)(F)' correctly identifies trifluoromethyl groups, but ensure that the SMILES strings are being parsed correctly to identify these structures.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: Rule 9's SMARTS '[CX3](=[OX1])[#6]' is too broad and may not specifically capture ketone groups in non-aromatic structures. Consider refining the SMARTS to '[CX3](=[OX1])[#6]' to ensure it matches the specific structures described in the rule.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Rule 10's SMARTS '[c][OX2][c]' may not accurately capture methoxy groups on aromatic rings. Consider refining the SMARTS to '[c][OX2][c]' to ensure it matches the specific structures described in the rule.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: Rule 11's SMARTS '[CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4]' is too broad and may not specifically capture long aliphatic chains. Consider refining the SMARTS to '[CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4]' to ensure it matches the specific structures described in the rule.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: Rule 12's SMARTS '[o]1ccccc1' correctly identifies benzofuran structures, but ensure that the SMILES strings are being parsed correctly to identify these structures.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: Rule 13's SMARTS '[NX3v3][CX4][NX3v3]' may not accurately capture cyclic structures with a carboxylic acid group and a secondary amine. Consider refining the SMARTS to '[NX3v3][CX4][NX3v3]' to ensure it matches the specific structures described in the rule.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: Rule 14's SMARTS '[CX4][OX2H]' is too broad and may not specifically capture hydroxyl groups on long aliphatic chains. Consider refining the SMARTS to '[CX4][OX2H]' to ensure it matches the specific structures described in the rule.

- ** Suggestion 15 **: Rule 15's SMARTS '[NX3H2][CX3](=[OX1])[NX3H2]' may not accurately capture acetamido groups in combination with amino acid structures. Consider refining the SMARTS to '[NX3H2][CX3](=[OX1])[NX3H2]' to ensure it matches the specific structures described in the rule.

Metric Commenter Message:
Based on the current rule metrics and the reference metrics provided, here are some observations and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Confidence**:
   - The current train confidence is 0.6046, which is a slight decrease from the previous iteration's confidence values of 0.6716 and 0.6189. This indicates a slight reduction in the reliability of the rules to predict high yields when the conditions are met. However, it is still higher than the test confidence from the reference metrics (0.3333 and 0.4639), suggesting that the rules are still relatively strong in predicting outcomes.
   - To improve confidence, consider refining the rules to better capture the conditions that lead to high yields. This might involve identifying additional modifiers or interactions that consistently result in high yields.

2. **Lift**:
   - The current train lift is 1.2102, which is a decrease from the previous iteration's lift values of 1.3317 and 1.2400. While the lift is still above 1, indicating that the rules are better than random chance at predicting high yields, the decrease suggests that the rules may be losing some of their predictive power.
   - To enhance lift, focus on identifying unique or less common conditions that strongly correlate with high yields. This could involve exploring interactions between different functional groups or structural features that are not currently captured by the rules.

3. **Leverage**:
   - The current train leverage is 0.0063, which is an improvement from the previous iteration's leverage values of 0.0089 and 0.0039. This indicates a slight increase in the additional support the rules receive over what would be expected by chance.
   - While leverage is not the primary focus, maintaining or improving leverage can help ensure that the rules are capturing meaningful associations. Consider exploring combinations of modifiers that are less frequent but have a strong impact on yield.

4. **Support**:
   - The current train support is 0.0743, which is an increase from the previous iteration's support values of 0.0686 and 0.0248. This suggests that the rules are applicable to a larger portion of the dataset, which can be beneficial for generalizability.
   - However, ensure that the increase in support does not come at the expense of confidence and lift. It may be necessary to balance support with the specificity of the rules to maintain high predictive power.

**Suggestions for Improvement**:
- **Refinement of Rules**: Consider revisiting the rules to ensure they are capturing the most relevant and impactful conditions. This might involve adding or modifying rules to better align with the observed data patterns.
- **Exploration of Interactions**: Investigate potential interactions between different functional groups or structural features that could enhance catalytic activity. This could lead to the discovery of new rules with higher confidence and lift.
- **Data Segmentation**: Analyze subsets of the data to identify specific conditions or contexts where the rules perform exceptionally well. This could help in refining the rules to target those scenarios more effectively.
- **Incorporation of Additional Features**: Consider incorporating additional features or variables that may influence yield, such as reaction conditions or catalyst properties, to improve the accuracy and relevance of the rules.

Overall, while the current rules show promise, there is room for improvement in terms of confidence and lift. By focusing on refining the rules and exploring new interactions, it may be possible to enhance the predictive power and applicability of the rules.

### Performance Evaluation of Current Rules

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
   - The current rules have shown improvement in validation accuracy from 0.6286 to 0.7429. This suggests that the rules are becoming more effective in predicting the loading of modifiers on catalysts. However, there is still room for improvement as the accuracy is not yet optimal.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment:**
   - The increase in validation accuracy without a significant drop in test accuracy suggests that the model is not overfitting. However, the initial low accuracy indicates that the model might have been underfitting, which has been partially addressed in the current iteration.

3. **Discrepancies Analysis:**
   - For molecules where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low, rules with high positive SHAP values (e.g., Rule 1, Rule 7, Rule 11) might be contributing to overestimation. These rules should be scrutinized for potential refinement.
   - Conversely, for molecules where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, rules with high negative SHAP values (e.g., Rule 8, Rule 11) might be causing underestimation. These rules should be adjusted to better capture the characteristics of high-loading modifiers.

4. **Accuracy Improvements Interpretation:**
   - The improvement in validation accuracy suggests that the current rules are moving in the right direction. However, the presence of discrepancies indicates that further refinement is necessary to achieve better generalization and accuracy.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**
   - SHAP analysis highlights specific rules that contribute significantly to the prediction errors. For instance, Rule 1 and Rule 7 often have high positive SHAP values for overestimated loadings, indicating a need for refinement.
   - Rules with consistently high negative SHAP values for underestimated loadings, such as Rule 8, should be adjusted to better account for the features of high-loading modifiers.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Overestimated Rules:**
   - Rules like Rule 1 and Rule 7, which have high positive SHAP values for overestimated loadings, should be refined. Consider revisiting the conditions under which these rules predict high loading and adjust them to reduce overestimation.

2. **Adjust Underestimated Rules:**
   - Rules with high negative SHAP values, such as Rule 8, should be adjusted to better capture the features of high-loading modifiers. This could involve relaxing some conditions or incorporating additional features that are indicative of high loading.

3. **Improve Generalization:**
   - To address potential overfitting or underfitting, consider incorporating more diverse training data or using techniques like cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.

4. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - Use insights from SHAP analysis to iteratively refine the rules. Focus on rules that consistently contribute to prediction errors and adjust them based on the patterns observed in the SHAP values.

5. **Incorporate Additional Features:**
   - Consider incorporating additional features or modifying existing ones to better capture the interactions between modifiers and catalysts. This could involve exploring new chemical properties or structural features that are not currently accounted for in the rules.

By following these recommendations, the rules can be refined to improve the accuracy and reliability of predictions, ultimately leading to better performance in predicting the loading of modifiers on catalysts.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with a carboxylic acid group, particularly when the amino group is in a secondary position (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid), tend to result in a high yield. This configuration may enhance coordination with the metal centers in the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid or a hydroxyl group (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid) generally lead to a high yield. The aromatic ring can provide stability and facilitate π-π interactions or hydrogen bonding.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), are associated with high yields. These groups may enhance solubility and increase the interaction surface with the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group, such as thiol or sulfanyl (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid), tend to result in a high yield. Sulfur groups can form strong interactions with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) often lead to high yields. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro groups (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid) can lead to high yields. These groups may influence the electronic environment of the catalyst favorably.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a formyl group attached to an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) tend to result in low yields. The formyl group may deactivate the aromatic ring or interact unfavorably with the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) are associated with low yields. The high electronegativity and steric bulk of fluorine atoms might hinder effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a ketone group in a non-aromatic structure (e.g., 4-oxoheptanedioic acid) generally lead to low yields. The ketone group might not provide beneficial interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a methoxy group on an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid) are associated with high yields. Methoxy groups can donate electron density, potentially stabilizing the transition state.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid) tend to result in low yields. The aliphatic chain may not interact effectively with the catalyst or could cause steric hindrance.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yields. The benzofuran structure might enhance π-π stacking or other favorable interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a secondary amine in a cyclic structure (e.g., 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid) are associated with high yields. The cyclic structure can provide rigidity and facilitate specific interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a long aliphatic chain (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) tend to result in low yields. The hydroxyl group may not sufficiently compensate for the lack of interaction from the long chain.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with an acetamido group in combination with an amino acid structure (e.g., (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid) tend to result in low yields. The acetamido group may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorable interactions.

** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: Refine Rule 1 by incorporating additional structural features that may influence the coordination with metal centers. Consider the impact of side chains or additional functional groups that could enhance or hinder the interaction with the catalyst.

- **Advice 2**: For Rule 7, investigate the specific conditions under which formyl groups lead to low yields. Consider modifying the rule to account for potential interactions with other functional groups that might mitigate the negative effects of the formyl group.

- **Advice 3**: Adjust Rule 8 by exploring the steric and electronic effects of fluorinated alkyl chains. Consider the length and branching of the chain, as well as the position of fluorine atoms, to better predict their impact on yield.

- **Advice 4**: Incorporate additional chemical properties or structural features into the rules, such as electronic effects, steric hindrance, or solubility, to improve the accuracy of predictions. This could involve using descriptors or computational chemistry tools to better understand the interactions at play.

- **Advice 5**: Use cross-validation techniques to ensure that the refined rules generalize well across different datasets. This will help in identifying any potential overfitting or underfitting issues and allow for more robust rule development.

- **Advice 6**: Conduct iterative refinement of the rules using SHAP analysis to identify and address specific prediction errors. Focus on rules with high SHAP values that contribute to discrepancies between predicted and experimental values.

- **Advice 7**: Explore the use of machine learning models to identify patterns or features that are not immediately obvious from the current rules. This could provide insights into additional factors that influence the yield and help refine the rules further.

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with a carboxylic acid group, particularly when the amino group is in a secondary position and the side chain is short or contains additional functional groups like hydroxyl or phenyl (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid), tend to result in a high yield. These configurations may enhance coordination with the metal centers in the catalyst and improve solubility.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid or a hydroxyl group, especially when additional electron-donating groups are present (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid), generally lead to a high yield. The aromatic ring can provide stability and facilitate π-π interactions or hydrogen bonding.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure or when combined with other polar groups (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), are associated with high yields. These groups may enhance solubility and increase the interaction surface with the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group, such as thiol or sulfanyl, particularly when combined with other polar or aromatic groups (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid), tend to result in a high yield. Sulfur groups can form strong interactions with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring, especially when the pyridine is substituted with electron-donating groups (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid), often lead to high yields. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro groups on an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid) can lead to high yields. These groups may influence the electronic environment of the catalyst favorably.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a formyl group attached to an aromatic ring, especially when not combined with other electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The formyl group may deactivate the aromatic ring or interact unfavorably with the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains, particularly when the chain is long or heavily fluorinated (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), are associated with low yields. The high electronegativity and steric bulk of fluorine atoms might hinder effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a ketone group in a non-aromatic structure, especially when not accompanied by other functional groups that can enhance interaction (e.g., 4-oxoheptanedioic acid), generally lead to low yields. The ketone group might not provide beneficial interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a methoxy group on an aromatic ring, particularly when combined with other electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), are associated with high yields. Methoxy groups can donate electron density, potentially stabilizing the transition state.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain, especially when lacking polar or aromatic groups (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The aliphatic chain may not interact effectively with the catalyst or could cause steric hindrance.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure, particularly when the structure is substituted with electron-donating groups (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid), tend to result in high yields. The benzofuran structure might enhance π-π stacking or other favorable interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a secondary amine in a cyclic structure, especially when the cycle is small and rigid (e.g., 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid), are associated with high yields. The cyclic structure can provide rigidity and facilitate specific interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a long aliphatic chain, particularly when not combined with other polar or aromatic groups (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The hydroxyl group may not sufficiently compensate for the lack of interaction from the long chain.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with an acetamido group in combination with an amino acid structure, especially when the acetamido group is bulky or in a position that causes steric hindrance (e.g., (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The acetamido group may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorable interactions.

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern should capture the presence of a secondary amine and a carboxylic acid group in an amino acid structure. The current SMARTS pattern does not seem to fully capture this requirement. Consider using a more specific pattern that includes both the secondary amine and carboxylic acid group in the context of an amino acid.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Rule 2 requires a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid or hydroxyl group with electron-donating groups. The current SMARTS pattern may not fully capture the electron-donating groups. Consider adding patterns for common electron-donating groups like methoxy or amino groups attached to the phenyl ring.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: Rule 3 involves multiple hydroxyl groups in a sugar-like structure. The current SMARTS pattern might not be specific enough to capture the sugar-like structure. Consider using a pattern that specifically looks for multiple hydroxyl groups in a cyclic or linear sugar-like arrangement.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: For Rule 4, the SMARTS pattern should capture sulfur-containing groups like thiol or sulfanyl, especially when combined with polar or aromatic groups. The current pattern may not fully capture the aromatic group requirement. Consider adding a pattern for aromatic rings in conjunction with sulfur groups.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: Rule 5 involves a pyridine ring with electron-donating groups. The current SMARTS pattern may not fully capture the electron-donating groups. Consider adding patterns for common electron-donating groups like methoxy or amino groups attached to the pyridine ring.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Rule 6 requires electron-withdrawing groups like nitro on an aromatic ring. The current SMARTS pattern seems to capture this, but ensure it is specific to nitro groups on aromatic rings.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: Rule 7 involves a formyl group on an aromatic ring without other electron-donating groups. The current SMARTS pattern should ensure it captures the absence of electron-donating groups.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Rule 8 involves fluorinated alkyl chains. The current SMARTS pattern should ensure it captures long or heavily fluorinated chains specifically.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: Rule 9 involves a ketone group in a non-aromatic structure. The current SMARTS pattern should ensure it captures ketones specifically in non-aromatic contexts.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Rule 10 involves a methoxy group on an aromatic ring with other electron-donating groups. The current SMARTS pattern should ensure it captures the combination of methoxy and other electron-donating groups.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: Rule 11 involves long aliphatic chains without polar or aromatic groups. The current SMARTS pattern should ensure it captures the absence of polar or aromatic groups.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: Rule 12 involves a benzofuran structure with electron-donating groups. The current SMARTS pattern should ensure it captures the benzofuran structure and the presence of electron-donating groups.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: Rule 13 involves a carboxylic acid group and a secondary amine in a cyclic structure. The current SMARTS pattern should ensure it captures the cyclic nature and the presence of both functional groups.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: Rule 14 involves a hydroxyl group on a long aliphatic chain without other polar or aromatic groups. The current SMARTS pattern should ensure it captures the absence of other polar or aromatic groups.

- ** Suggestion 15 **: Rule 15 involves an acetamido group in combination with an amino acid structure. The current SMARTS pattern should ensure it captures the steric hindrance caused by the acetamido group.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with a carboxylic acid group, particularly when the amino group is in a secondary position and the side chain is short or contains additional functional groups like hydroxyl or phenyl (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid), tend to result in a high yield. These configurations may enhance coordination with the metal centers in the catalyst and improve solubility.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid or a hydroxyl group, especially when additional electron-donating groups are present (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid), generally lead to a high yield. The aromatic ring can provide stability and facilitate π-π interactions or hydrogen bonding.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure or when combined with other polar groups (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), are associated with high yields. These groups may enhance solubility and increase the interaction surface with the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group, such as thiol or sulfanyl, particularly when combined with other polar or aromatic groups (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid), tend to result in a high yield. Sulfur groups can form strong interactions with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring, especially when the pyridine is substituted with electron-donating groups (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid), often lead to high yields. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro groups on an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid) can lead to high yields. These groups may influence the electronic environment of the catalyst favorably.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a formyl group attached to an aromatic ring, especially when not combined with other electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The formyl group may deactivate the aromatic ring or interact unfavorably with the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains, particularly when the chain is long or heavily fluorinated (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), are associated with low yields. The high electronegativity and steric bulk of fluorine atoms might hinder effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a ketone group in a non-aromatic structure, especially when not accompanied by other functional groups that can enhance interaction (e.g., 4-oxoheptanedioic acid), generally lead to low yields. The ketone group might not provide beneficial interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a methoxy group on an aromatic ring, particularly when combined with other electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), are associated with high yields. Methoxy groups can donate electron density, potentially stabilizing the transition state.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain, especially when lacking polar or aromatic groups (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The aliphatic chain may not interact effectively with the catalyst or could cause steric hindrance.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure, particularly when the structure is substituted with electron-donating groups (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid), tend to result in high yields. The benzofuran structure might enhance π-π stacking or other favorable interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a secondary amine in a cyclic structure, especially when the cycle is small and rigid (e.g., 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid), are associated with high yields. The cyclic structure can provide rigidity and facilitate specific interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a long aliphatic chain, particularly when not combined with other polar or aromatic groups (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The hydroxyl group may not sufficiently compensate for the lack of interaction from the long chain.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with an acetamido group in combination with an amino acid structure, especially when the acetamido group is bulky or in a position that causes steric hindrance (e.g., (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The acetamido group may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorable interactions.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with a carboxylic acid group, particularly when the amino group is in a secondary position and the side chain is short or contains additional functional groups like hydroxyl or phenyl (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid), tend to result in a high yield. These configurations may enhance coordination with the metal centers in the catalyst and improve solubility.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid or a hydroxyl group, especially when additional electron-donating groups are present (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid), generally lead to a high yield. The aromatic ring can provide stability and facilitate π-π interactions or hydrogen bonding.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure or when combined with other polar groups (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), are associated with high yields. These groups may enhance solubility and increase the interaction surface with the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group, such as thiol or sulfanyl, particularly when combined with other polar or aromatic groups (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid), tend to result in a high yield. Sulfur groups can form strong interactions with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring, especially when the pyridine is substituted with electron-donating groups (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid), often lead to high yields. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro groups on an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid) can lead to high yields. These groups may influence the electronic environment of the catalyst favorably.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a formyl group attached to an aromatic ring, especially when not combined with other electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The formyl group may deactivate the aromatic ring or interact unfavorably with the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains, particularly when the chain is long or heavily fluorinated (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), are associated with low yields. The high electronegativity and steric bulk of fluorine atoms might hinder effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a ketone group in a non-aromatic structure, especially when not accompanied by other functional groups that can enhance interaction (e.g., 4-oxoheptanedioic acid), generally lead to low yields. The ketone group might not provide beneficial interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a methoxy group on an aromatic ring, particularly when combined with other electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), are associated with high yields. Methoxy groups can donate electron density, potentially stabilizing the transition state.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain, especially when lacking polar or aromatic groups (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The aliphatic chain may not interact effectively with the catalyst or could cause steric hindrance.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure, particularly when the structure is substituted with electron-donating groups (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid), tend to result in high yields. The benzofuran structure might enhance π-π stacking or other favorable interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a secondary amine in a cyclic structure, especially when the cycle is small and rigid (e.g., 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid), are associated with high yields. The cyclic structure can provide rigidity and facilitate specific interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a long aliphatic chain, particularly when not combined with other polar or aromatic groups (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The hydroxyl group may not sufficiently compensate for the lack of interaction from the long chain.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with an acetamido group in combination with an amino acid structure, especially when the acetamido group is bulky or in a position that causes steric hindrance (e.g., (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The acetamido group may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorable interactions.

Matrix Checker Message:
To evaluate the effectiveness of the transformation from language rules to a numeric feature matrix, I will analyze each rule and its corresponding SMARTS pattern in the code, comparing them to the given SMILES strings and the resulting feature matrix.

**Rule 1**: The rule specifies amino acids with a secondary amino group and a carboxylic acid group. The SMARTS pattern seems to capture this, but the feature matrix shows a 1 for SMILES 1, 4, 5, 14, 16, 33, 34, 35, and 36, which is consistent with the rule. However, SMILES 2 and 4 should also match based on the description, but only SMILES 2 is marked as 1. This suggests a potential issue with the SMARTS pattern or its application.

**Rule 2**: The rule involves phenyl groups with carboxylic or hydroxyl groups. The SMARTS pattern seems to capture this, but the feature matrix only shows a 1 for SMILES 20, which is consistent with the rule. However, SMILES 6 and 9 should also match based on the description, but they are not marked as 1. This suggests a potential issue with the SMARTS pattern or its application.

**Rule 3**: The rule involves multiple hydroxyl groups in a sugar-like structure. The SMARTS pattern seems to capture this, but the feature matrix shows a 1 for SMILES 11, which is consistent with the rule. This suggests the SMARTS pattern is correctly identifying the structure.

**Rule 4**: The rule involves sulfur-containing groups. The SMARTS pattern seems to capture this, but the feature matrix shows a 1 for SMILES 19, which is consistent with the rule. This suggests the SMARTS pattern is correctly identifying the structure.

**Rule 5**: The rule involves pyridine rings with electron-donating groups. The SMARTS pattern seems to capture this, but the feature matrix does not show any 1s, which suggests a potential issue with the SMARTS pattern or its application.

**Rule 6**: The rule involves electron-withdrawing groups like nitro groups. The SMARTS pattern seems to capture this, and the feature matrix shows a 1 for SMILES 22, which is consistent with the rule. This suggests the SMARTS pattern is correctly identifying the structure.

**Rule 7**: The rule involves formyl groups on aromatic rings leading to low yields. The SMARTS pattern seems to capture this, and the feature matrix shows a -1 for SMILES 20 and 21, which is consistent with the rule. This suggests the SMARTS pattern is correctly identifying the structure.

**Rule 8**: The rule involves fluorinated alkyl chains leading to low yields. The SMARTS pattern seems to capture this, and the feature matrix shows a -1 for SMILES 15, which is consistent with the rule. This suggests the SMARTS pattern is correctly identifying the structure.

**Rule 9**: The rule involves ketone groups in non-aromatic structures leading to low yields. The SMARTS pattern seems to capture this, and the feature matrix shows a -1 for SMILES 28 and 30, which is consistent with the rule. This suggests the SMARTS pattern is correctly identifying the structure.

**Rule 10**: The rule involves methoxy groups on aromatic rings leading to high yields. The SMARTS pattern seems to capture this, and the feature matrix shows a 1 for SMILES 27, which is consistent with the rule. This suggests the SMARTS pattern is correctly identifying the structure.

**Rule 11**: The rule involves long aliphatic chains leading to low yields. The SMARTS pattern seems to capture this, and the feature matrix shows a 1 for SMILES 7, 31, and 35, which is inconsistent with the rule. This suggests a potential issue with the SMARTS pattern or its application.

**Rule 12**: The rule involves benzofuran structures leading to high yields. The SMARTS pattern seems to capture this, but the feature matrix does not show any 1s, which suggests a potential issue with the SMARTS pattern or its application.

**Rule 13**: The rule involves cyclic structures with secondary amines leading to high yields. The SMARTS pattern seems to capture this, but the feature matrix does not show any 1s, which suggests a potential issue with the SMARTS pattern or its application.

**Rule 14**: The rule involves hydroxyl groups on long aliphatic chains leading to low yields. The SMARTS pattern seems to capture this, and the feature matrix shows a -1 for SMILES 8 and 11, which is consistent with the rule. This suggests the SMARTS pattern is correctly identifying the structure.

**Rule 15**: The rule involves acetamido groups with amino acid structures leading to low yields. The SMARTS pattern seems to capture this, but the feature matrix does not show any -1s, which suggests a potential issue with the SMARTS pattern or its application.

** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: Review and refine the SMARTS patterns for Rules 1, 2, 5, 11, 12, 13, and 15 to ensure they accurately capture the described chemical structures. Consider using more specific or additional SMARTS patterns to improve accuracy.
- ** Suggestion 2 **: Verify the application logic in the code to ensure that the correct rules are being applied to each SMILES string. Ensure that the logic for determining high or low yield predictions is correctly implemented.
- ** Suggestion 3 **: Consider adding more detailed comments or documentation in the code to clarify the intended matches for each rule and how the SMARTS patterns are expected to work.
- ** Suggestion 4 **: Test the SMARTS patterns individually on known examples to ensure they match the intended structures before integrating them into the full rule set.

Metric Commenter Message:
Based on the current metrics, the performance of the rules in this iteration shows some areas of concern, particularly when compared to the reference metrics. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Train Support**: The current train support is 0.022857142857142857, which is lower than the previous reference metrics. This indicates that the rules are applicable to a smaller portion of the dataset, suggesting that they might be too specific or not capturing enough of the relevant data.

2. **Train Confidence**: The current train confidence is 0.4988888888888889, which is lower than the previous iteration's confidence values (0.6716, 0.6188, 0.6046). This decrease in confidence suggests that the rules are less reliable in predicting the outcome, indicating potential overfitting or that the rules are not capturing the underlying patterns effectively.

3. **Train Lift**: The current train lift is 1.0027777777777775, which is very close to 1. This suggests that the rules do not provide much additional predictive power over random chance. In previous iterations, the lift values were higher (1.3316, 1.2399, 1.2102), indicating that the rules were more effective in those cases.

4. **Train Leverage**: The current train leverage is -0.0020680272108843534, which is negative. This indicates that the rules are performing worse than expected by chance, suggesting that the current set of rules might be misaligned with the data patterns.

### Recommendations for Improvement:

- **Re-evaluate Rule Specificity**: The low support and confidence suggest that the rules might be too specific. Consider broadening the conditions or combining similar rules to increase their applicability and reliability.

- **Focus on High Lift**: Aim to develop rules that have a lift significantly greater than 1. This can be achieved by identifying conditions that strongly correlate with the desired outcome, potentially by exploring interactions between different modifiers.

- **Analyze Rule Interactions**: Investigate if there are interactions between different rules that could be leveraged to improve performance. Sometimes, combining rules or considering interactions can lead to better predictive power.

- **Iterate on Rule Conditions**: Revisit the conditions of the rules to ensure they are capturing the most relevant features. This might involve feature engineering or incorporating domain knowledge to refine the rules.

- **Increase Dataset Coverage**: If possible, expand the dataset or include more diverse examples to ensure the rules are trained on a representative sample, which can help improve support and confidence.

Overall, the current iteration suggests that the rules are not performing optimally, and adjustments are needed to improve their effectiveness. Focusing on increasing lift and confidence while ensuring the rules are applicable to a larger portion of the dataset should be the primary goals moving forward.

ML Commenter Message:
### Performance Evaluation of Current Rules

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
   - The current rules seem to have mixed effectiveness. The validation accuracy has fluctuated across iterations, with the latest accuracy at 0.6, which is lower than some previous iterations. This suggests that the rules may not be consistently capturing the underlying patterns in the data.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting:**
   - The decrease in validation accuracy in the latest iteration suggests potential overfitting, where the model may be too tailored to the training data and not generalizing well to new data. The consistent high SHAP values for certain rules across different molecules indicate that some rules might be too specific or not robust enough.

3. **Discrepancies Analysis:**
   - For molecules where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low, rules with high positive SHAP values (e.g., Rule 1, Rule 7, Rule 8, Rule 11) might be problematic. These rules may need refinement to avoid overestimating the loading.
   - Conversely, for molecules where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, rules with high negative SHAP values (e.g., Rule 1, Rule 7, Rule 8, Rule 11) might be underestimating the loading and require adjustment.

4. **Accuracy Improvements:**
   - The accuracy metrics suggest that there is room for improvement. The fluctuation in accuracy across iterations indicates that the rules are not yet optimal. The goal should be to stabilize and improve accuracy through iterative refinement of the rules.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**
   - SHAP analysis highlights specific rules that consistently contribute to incorrect predictions. For instance, Rule 1 and Rule 7 often have high SHAP values, indicating they might be overemphasizing certain features. Adjusting these rules could improve model performance.
   - The analysis also suggests that some rules might be too broad or not capturing the nuances of the data, leading to misclassifications.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Overestimated Rules:**
   - Rules with high positive SHAP values for overestimated loadings, such as Rule 1 and Rule 7, should be refined. Consider narrowing the conditions under which these rules apply or adding additional criteria to better capture the complexity of the data.

2. **Adjust Underestimated Rules:**
   - Rules with high negative SHAP values for underestimated loadings, such as Rule 1 and Rule 7, should be adjusted to better account for cases where the model underpredicts the loading. This might involve expanding the conditions or incorporating additional features that are currently overlooked.

3. **Improve Generalization:**
   - To address overfitting, consider simplifying some rules or combining similar rules to reduce complexity. This could help the model generalize better to new data.

4. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - Use insights from SHAP analysis to iteratively refine the rules. Focus on rules that consistently contribute to incorrect predictions and test adjustments in small increments to evaluate their impact on model performance.

5. **Incorporate Additional Features:**
   - Consider incorporating additional features or modifying existing ones based on domain knowledge and SHAP insights. This could involve exploring new chemical properties or interactions that are not currently captured by the rules.

By following these recommendations, the rules can be iteratively refined to improve model accuracy and generalization, ultimately leading to more reliable predictions of modifier loading on catalysts.

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: gpt-4o-2024-08-06
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with a carboxylic acid group, particularly when the amino group is in a secondary position and the side chain is short or contains additional functional groups like hydroxyl or phenyl (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid), tend to result in a high yield. These configurations may enhance coordination with the metal centers in the catalyst and improve solubility.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid or a hydroxyl group, especially when additional electron-donating groups are present (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid), generally lead to a high yield. The aromatic ring can provide stability and facilitate π-π interactions or hydrogen bonding.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure or when combined with other polar groups (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), are associated with high yields. These groups may enhance solubility and increase the interaction surface with the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group, such as thiol or sulfanyl, particularly when combined with other polar or aromatic groups (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid), tend to result in a high yield. Sulfur groups can form strong interactions with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring, especially when the pyridine is substituted with electron-donating groups (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid), often lead to high yields. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro groups on an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid) can lead to high yields. These groups may influence the electronic environment of the catalyst favorably.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a formyl group attached to an aromatic ring, especially when not combined with other electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The formyl group may deactivate the aromatic ring or interact unfavorably with the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains, particularly when the chain is long or heavily fluorinated (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), are associated with low yields. The high electronegativity and steric bulk of fluorine atoms might hinder effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a ketone group in a non-aromatic structure, especially when not accompanied by other functional groups that can enhance interaction (e.g., 4-oxoheptanedioic acid), generally lead to low yields. The ketone group might not provide beneficial interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a methoxy group on an aromatic ring, particularly when combined with other electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), are associated with high yields. Methoxy groups can donate electron density, potentially stabilizing the transition state.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain, especially when lacking polar or aromatic groups (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The aliphatic chain may not interact effectively with the catalyst or could cause steric hindrance.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure, particularly when the structure is substituted with electron-donating groups (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid), tend to result in high yields. The benzofuran structure might enhance π-π stacking or other favorable interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a secondary amine in a cyclic structure, especially when the cycle is small and rigid (e.g., 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid), are associated with high yields. The cyclic structure can provide rigidity and facilitate specific interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a long aliphatic chain, particularly when not combined with other polar or aromatic groups (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The hydroxyl group may not sufficiently compensate for the lack of interaction from the long chain.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with an acetamido group in combination with an amino acid structure, especially when the acetamido group is bulky or in a position that causes steric hindrance (e.g., (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The acetamido group may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorable interactions.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: Refine Rule 1 by specifying the types of amino acids that consistently lead to high yields. Consider narrowing the conditions to include only those with specific side chains that have shown consistent results in the dataset.

- **Advice 2**: For Rule 7, which involves formyl groups, consider adding conditions that account for the presence of other functional groups that might mitigate the negative effects of the formyl group. This could help in cases where the rule currently overestimates low yields.

- **Advice 3**: Simplify Rule 8 by focusing on the length and degree of fluorination in alkyl chains. Consider whether shorter chains or specific fluorination patterns might still allow for effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Advice 4**: Combine similar rules, such as those involving aromatic rings with electron-donating groups (Rules 2 and 10), to reduce complexity and improve generalization. This could help in capturing a broader range of effective modifiers.

- **Advice 5**: Introduce new rules that consider additional chemical properties, such as steric effects or specific electronic interactions, which are not currently captured. This could involve exploring the impact of different substituents on aromatic rings or the role of specific heteroatoms.

- **Advice 6**: Use SHAP analysis to identify and refine rules that consistently contribute to incorrect predictions. Focus on adjusting the conditions of these rules to better align with experimental data.

- **Advice 7**: Regularly validate and iterate on the rules using new data to ensure they remain robust and generalizable. This iterative process will help in fine-tuning the rules and improving overall model accuracy.

**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: Increase the dataset size to improve coverage for rules with limited data support. This will help validate the rules and ensure they are robust across a wider range of modifiers.

- **Advice 2**: Consider incorporating quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling to predict yields based on structural features. This could provide a more nuanced understanding of how different functional groups and structural motifs influence the reaction outcome.

- **Advice 3**: Explore the use of machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and interactions that may not be immediately obvious. This could lead to the discovery of new rules or the refinement of existing ones.

- **Advice 4**: Conduct experimental validation of the rules with new modifiers that fit the described structural criteria. This will help confirm the predictive power of the rules and identify any exceptions or limitations.

- **Advice 5**: Consider the impact of solvent and reaction conditions on the rules. Modifiers may behave differently under varying conditions, so it may be beneficial to develop condition-specific rules.

- **Advice 6**: Collaborate with computational chemists to perform molecular dynamics simulations or density functional theory (DFT) calculations. These methods can provide insights into the electronic and steric effects of modifiers on the catalyst and reaction mechanism.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: Review the SMARTS patterns for each rule to ensure they accurately capture the chemical structures described in the natural language rules. For example, Rule 1 mentions amino acids with a carboxylic acid group and a secondary amine, but the SMARTS pattern does not seem to capture this specific structure. Consider using a more specific SMARTS pattern that includes both the carboxylic acid and secondary amine in the correct configuration.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: For Rule 2, the SMARTS pattern should capture phenyl groups attached to carboxylic acid or hydroxyl groups with electron-donating groups. The current pattern may not fully capture this complexity. Consider refining the SMARTS to include these specific features.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: Rule 3 involves multiple hydroxyl groups in a sugar-like structure. The current SMARTS pattern may not be specific enough to capture this. Consider using a pattern that specifically looks for multiple hydroxyl groups in a cyclic or sugar-like configuration.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Rule 4 involves sulfur-containing groups like thiol or sulfanyl. The SMARTS pattern should be checked to ensure it captures these groups accurately, especially in combination with polar or aromatic groups.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: For Rule 5, ensure the SMARTS pattern captures pyridine rings with electron-donating groups. The current pattern may not be specific enough to identify pyridine structures accurately.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Rule 6 involves electron-withdrawing groups like nitro groups on an aromatic ring. Ensure the SMARTS pattern captures this specific configuration accurately.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: Rule 9 involves ketone groups in non-aromatic structures. Ensure the SMARTS pattern captures this specific configuration accurately.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: For Rule 10, the SMARTS pattern should capture methoxy groups on aromatic rings with electron-donating groups. Review the pattern to ensure it aligns with this description.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: Rule 11 involves long aliphatic chains without polar or aromatic groups. Ensure the SMARTS pattern captures this specific configuration accurately.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: For Rule 12, the SMARTS pattern should capture benzofuran structures with electron-donating groups. Review the pattern to ensure it aligns with this description.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: Rule 13 involves cyclic structures with carboxylic acid and secondary amine. Ensure the SMARTS pattern captures this specific configuration accurately.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: For Rule 14, the SMARTS pattern should capture hydroxyl groups on long aliphatic chains without other polar or aromatic groups. Review the pattern to ensure it aligns with this description.

- ** Suggestion 15 **: Rule 15 involves acetamido groups in amino acid structures. Ensure the SMARTS pattern captures this specific configuration accurately, especially considering steric hindrance.

- ** Suggestion 16 **: Consider adding comments or documentation within the code to explain the rationale behind each SMARTS pattern, making it easier to review and update in the future.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with a carboxylic acid group, particularly when the amino group is in a secondary position and the side chain is short or contains additional functional groups like hydroxyl or phenyl (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid), tend to result in a high yield. These configurations may enhance coordination with the metal centers in the catalyst and improve solubility.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid or a hydroxyl group, especially when additional electron-donating groups are present (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid), generally lead to a high yield. The aromatic ring can provide stability and facilitate π-π interactions or hydrogen bonding.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure or when combined with other polar groups (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), are associated with high yields. These groups may enhance solubility and increase the interaction surface with the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group, such as thiol or sulfanyl, particularly when combined with other polar or aromatic groups (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid), tend to result in a high yield. Sulfur groups can form strong interactions with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring, especially when the pyridine is substituted with electron-donating groups (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid), often lead to high yields. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro groups on an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid) can lead to high yields. These groups may influence the electronic environment of the catalyst favorably.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a formyl group attached to an aromatic ring, especially when not combined with other electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The formyl group may deactivate the aromatic ring or interact unfavorably with the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains, particularly when the chain is long or heavily fluorinated (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), are associated with low yields. The high electronegativity and steric bulk of fluorine atoms might hinder effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a ketone group in a non-aromatic structure, especially when not accompanied by other functional groups that can enhance interaction (e.g., 4-oxoheptanedioic acid), generally lead to low yields. The ketone group might not provide beneficial interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a methoxy group on an aromatic ring, particularly when combined with other electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), are associated with high yields. Methoxy groups can donate electron density, potentially stabilizing the transition state.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain, especially when lacking polar or aromatic groups (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The aliphatic chain may not interact effectively with the catalyst or could cause steric hindrance.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure, particularly when the structure is substituted with electron-donating groups (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid), tend to result in high yields. The benzofuran structure might enhance π-π stacking or other favorable interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a secondary amine in a cyclic structure, especially when the cycle is small and rigid (e.g., 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid), are associated with high yields. The cyclic structure can provide rigidity and facilitate specific interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a long aliphatic chain, particularly when not combined with other polar or aromatic groups (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The hydroxyl group may not sufficiently compensate for the lack of interaction from the long chain.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with an acetamido group in combination with an amino acid structure, especially when the acetamido group is bulky or in a position that causes steric hindrance (e.g., (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The acetamido group may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorable interactions.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: For Rule 9, ensure the SMARTS pattern accurately identifies ketone groups in non-aromatic structures. The current pattern may not fully capture the lack of beneficial interactions with the catalyst.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Rule 10's SMARTS pattern should be reviewed to ensure it captures methoxy groups on aromatic rings with electron-donating groups. The current pattern may not fully capture the electron-donating effects described.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: For Rule 11, ensure the SMARTS pattern accurately identifies long aliphatic chains without polar or aromatic groups. The current pattern may not fully capture the steric hindrance described.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: Rule 12's SMARTS pattern should be refined to detect benzofuran structures with electron-donating groups. The current pattern may not fully capture the potential for π-π stacking interactions.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: For Rule 13, ensure the SMARTS pattern accurately identifies cyclic structures with carboxylic acid groups and secondary amines. The current pattern may not fully capture the rigidity and interaction potential described.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: Rule 14's SMARTS pattern should be reviewed to ensure it captures hydroxyl groups on long aliphatic chains without other polar or aromatic groups. The current pattern may not fully capture the lack of interaction described.

** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern `[NX3H1+0,NX4H2+;!$([N][!C])]` and `[CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])[$([OX2H]),$([OX1-])]` may not fully capture the structural description of amino acids with a secondary amino group and a carboxylic acid group. Consider refining the SMARTS to specifically target secondary amines and carboxylic acids in amino acid structures.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Rule 2's SMARTS `[c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` and `[c][OX2H]` should be reviewed to ensure they capture phenyl groups directly attached to carboxylic or hydroxyl groups with electron-donating groups. The current SMARTS may not fully represent the presence of electron-donating groups.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For Rule 3, the SMARTS `[OX2H][CX4;!$(C(O)(O)[!#6])][OX2]` should be checked to ensure it captures sugar-like structures with multiple hydroxyl groups. The current pattern may not be specific enough to identify sugar-like structures.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Rule 4's SMARTS `[SX2H;$([SX2H][CX4;!$(C([SX2H])~[O,S,#7,#15])])]` and `[c][SX2H]` should be refined to better capture sulfur-containing groups like thiol or sulfanyl, especially when combined with polar or aromatic groups.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: Rule 5's SMARTS `[n][c]` and `[n][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` may not fully capture pyridine rings with electron-donating groups. Consider refining the SMARTS to specifically target pyridine structures with such substitutions.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Rule 6's SMARTS `[c][NX3+](=O)-[OX-]` should be reviewed to ensure it captures nitro groups on aromatic rings. The current pattern may not fully represent the presence of nitro groups.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: For Rule 7, the SMARTS `[c][CX3H]=[OX1]` should be checked to ensure it captures formyl groups attached to aromatic rings without electron-donating groups. The current pattern may not be specific enough.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Rule 8's SMARTS `[CX4](F)(F)F` should be reviewed to ensure it captures fluorinated alkyl chains, especially long or heavily fluorinated ones. The current pattern may not fully represent the structural complexity of such chains.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: Rule 9's SMARTS `[CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])` should be refined to better capture ketone groups in non-aromatic structures without other functional groups.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Rule 10's SMARTS `[c][OX2][c]` should be reviewed to ensure it captures methoxy groups on aromatic rings with electron-donating groups. The current pattern may not fully represent the presence of such groups.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: Rule 11's SMARTS `[CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4]` should be refined to better capture long aliphatic chains lacking polar or aromatic groups. The current pattern may not be specific enough.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: Rule 12's SMARTS `[c]1oc2ccccc2c1` should be reviewed to ensure it captures benzofuran structures with electron-donating groups. The current pattern may not fully represent the presence of such groups.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: Rule 13's SMARTS `[NX3H1+0,NX4H2+;!$([N][!C])][CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])` should be refined to better capture cyclic structures with a carboxylic acid group and a secondary amine.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: Rule 14's SMARTS `[CX4][OX2H]` should be reviewed to ensure it captures hydroxyl groups on long aliphatic chains without other polar or aromatic groups. The current pattern may not fully represent the structural complexity of such chains.

- ** Suggestion 15 **: Rule 15's SMARTS `[NX3H1+0,NX4H2+;!$([N][!C])][CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])` should be refined to better capture acetamido groups in combination with amino acid structures, especially when bulky or causing steric hindrance.

    Train support: 0.05523809523809524
    Train confidence: 0.5179365079365079

Metric Commenter Message:
Based on the current rule metrics and the reference metrics provided, here are some observations and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Confidence**:
   - The current train confidence is 0.5179, which is lower than some of the previous iterations (e.g., 0.6716, 0.6188, 0.6046). This indicates that the current rules are less reliable in predicting the outcome compared to earlier iterations.
   - To improve confidence, it may be beneficial to refine the rules by focusing on more specific conditions or combinations of modifiers that have shown higher confidence in previous iterations.

2. **Lift**:
   - The current train lift is 1.0455, which is close to 1. This suggests that the current rules do not significantly improve the prediction over random chance. In previous iterations, some rules had lifts of 1.3317 and 1.2399, indicating a stronger association.
   - To enhance lift, consider identifying and emphasizing conditions that have shown a more substantial impact on the outcome. This might involve revisiting the chemical interactions and properties that are most influential in achieving high yields.

3. **Leverage**:
   - The current train leverage is negative (-0.0020), indicating that the rules are not providing additional support beyond what would be expected by chance. This is a step back compared to some previous iterations with positive leverage values.
   - Improving leverage could involve focusing on rules that involve more frequent or impactful modifiers, as these are likely to provide stronger associations.

4. **Support**:
   - The current train support is 0.0552, which is lower than some previous iterations (e.g., 0.0686, 0.0743). While support is not the primary focus, it is important to ensure that the rules apply to a reasonable portion of the dataset to be meaningful.
   - Consider broadening the conditions slightly to capture a larger subset of the data without sacrificing too much specificity.

**Suggestions for Improvement**:
- **Refinement of Rules**: Re-evaluate the chemical properties and interactions described in the rules. Focus on those that have historically shown higher confidence and lift. This might involve more detailed analysis of the chemical structures and their interactions with the catalyst.
- **Combination of Conditions**: Explore combinations of conditions that might not have been considered yet. For example, combining certain functional groups that have shown promise in isolation might yield better results.
- **Data Analysis**: Conduct a deeper analysis of the dataset to identify any overlooked patterns or correlations that could inform new or revised rules.
- **Iterative Testing**: Continue iterating on the rules, testing small changes to see their impact on the metrics, particularly focusing on improving confidence and lift.

Overall, the current iteration shows a need for further refinement to achieve better predictive performance, as indicated by the lower confidence and lift compared to previous iterations.

### Performance Evaluation of Current Rules

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
   - The current rules have shown some improvement in validation accuracy, reaching 0.7143, which is higher than some previous iterations but not the highest observed (0.7429). This suggests that the rules are somewhat effective but may still require refinement to consistently achieve higher accuracy.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment:**
   - The fluctuation in validation accuracy across iterations suggests potential overfitting or underfitting. The model's performance varies, indicating that the rules might not be generalizing well across different datasets. The SHAP values also show inconsistencies in rule effectiveness, further supporting this observation.

3. **Discrepancy Analysis:**
   - For molecules where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low, rules with high positive SHAP values (e.g., Rule 7, Rule 11) might be contributing to overestimation. Conversely, for molecules where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, rules with high negative SHAP values (e.g., Rule 8, Rule 14) might be causing underestimation.

4. **Accuracy Improvement Interpretation:**
   - The improvement in validation accuracy suggests that the rules are moving in the right direction, but the inconsistency in results indicates that further refinement is needed. The current accuracy metrics suggest that there is room for improvement, particularly in achieving more consistent performance across different datasets.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**
   - SHAP analysis highlights specific rules that may need adjustment. For instance, Rule 7 and Rule 11 often have high positive SHAP values for overestimated loadings, indicating they might be too aggressive in predicting high loading. Similarly, Rule 8 and Rule 14, with high negative SHAP values, might be too conservative, leading to underestimated loadings.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Overestimated Loading Rules:**
   - Adjust Rule 7 and Rule 11 to be less aggressive in predicting high loading. This could involve narrowing the conditions under which these rules apply or introducing additional criteria to balance their influence.

2. **Adjust Underestimated Loading Rules:**
   - Modify Rule 8 and Rule 14 to be less conservative. Consider expanding the conditions under which these rules predict high loading or incorporating additional factors that might increase their predictive power.

3. **Improve Generalization:**
   - To address overfitting or underfitting, consider introducing more diverse training data or using techniques like cross-validation to ensure the rules generalize well across different datasets.

4. **Iterative Refinement Using SHAP Insights:**
   - Use SHAP analysis to iteratively refine the rules. Focus on rules with consistently high positive or negative SHAP values and adjust them based on observed discrepancies between predicted and experimental values.

5. **Evaluate Rule Effectiveness:**
   - Continuously evaluate the effectiveness of each rule by monitoring changes in SHAP values and validation accuracy. Use this feedback loop to make data-driven adjustments to the rules.

By implementing these recommendations, the rules can be refined to improve their predictive accuracy and generalization, ultimately leading to more reliable predictions of modifier loading on catalysts.

### Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimization

1. **Effectiveness and Performance Evaluation:**
   - The current rules have shown some improvement in validation accuracy, reaching 0.7143, but this is not the highest observed. The fluctuation in validation accuracy across iterations suggests potential overfitting or underfitting, indicating that the rules might not be generalizing well across different datasets.

2. **Discrepancy Analysis:**
   - SHAP analysis highlights specific rules that may need adjustment. For instance, Rule 7 and Rule 11 often have high positive SHAP values for overestimated loadings, indicating they might be too aggressive. Conversely, Rule 8 and Rule 14, with high negative SHAP values, might be too conservative.

3. **Rule Metrics:**
   - The current train confidence and lift are lower than some previous iterations, suggesting that the current rules are less reliable in predicting the outcome. The negative leverage indicates that the rules are not providing additional support beyond what would be expected by chance.

### Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Refinement of Overestimated Loading Rules:**
   - Adjust Rule 7 and Rule 11 to be less aggressive in predicting high loading. This could involve narrowing the conditions under which these rules apply or introducing additional criteria to balance their influence.

2. **Adjustment of Underestimated Loading Rules:**
   - Modify Rule 8 and Rule 14 to be less conservative. Consider expanding the conditions under which these rules predict high loading or incorporating additional factors that might increase their predictive power.

3. **Improve Generalization:**

4. **Iterative Refinement Using SHAP Insights:**
   - Use SHAP analysis to iteratively refine the rules. Focus on rules with consistently high positive or negative SHAP values and adjust them based on observed discrepancies between predicted and experimental values.

5. **Evaluate Rule Effectiveness:**
   - Continuously evaluate the effectiveness of each rule by monitoring changes in SHAP values and validation accuracy. Use this feedback loop to make data-driven adjustments to the rules.

### Possibility for Further Optimization

There is a possibility for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. The current metrics and SHAP analysis suggest that the rules can be refined to improve their predictive accuracy and generalization. By implementing the suggested improvements, the rules can be optimized to provide more reliable predictions.

    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with a carboxylic acid group, particularly when the amino group is in a secondary position and the side chain is short or contains additional functional groups like hydroxyl or phenyl (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid), tend to result in a high yield. These configurations may enhance coordination with the metal centers in the catalyst and improve solubility.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid or a hydroxyl group, especially when additional electron-donating groups are present (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid), generally lead to a high yield. The aromatic ring can provide stability and facilitate π-π interactions or hydrogen bonding.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure or when combined with other polar groups (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), are associated with high yields. These groups may enhance solubility and increase the interaction surface with the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group, such as thiol or sulfanyl, particularly when combined with other polar or aromatic groups (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid), tend to result in a high yield. Sulfur groups can form strong interactions with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring, especially when the pyridine is substituted with electron-donating groups (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid), often lead to high yields. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro groups on an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid) can lead to high yields. These groups may influence the electronic environment of the catalyst favorably.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a formyl group attached to an aromatic ring, especially when not combined with other electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The formyl group may deactivate the aromatic ring or interact unfavorably with the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains, particularly when the chain is long or heavily fluorinated (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), are associated with low yields. The high electronegativity and steric bulk of fluorine atoms might hinder effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a ketone group in a non-aromatic structure, especially when not accompanied by other functional groups that can enhance interaction (e.g., 4-oxoheptanedioic acid), generally lead to low yields. The ketone group might not provide beneficial interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a methoxy group on an aromatic ring, particularly when combined with other electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), are associated with high yields. Methoxy groups can donate electron density, potentially stabilizing the transition state.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain, especially when lacking polar or aromatic groups (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The aliphatic chain may not interact effectively with the catalyst or could cause steric hindrance.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure, particularly when the structure is substituted with electron-donating groups (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid), tend to result in high yields. The benzofuran structure might enhance π-π stacking or other favorable interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a secondary amine in a cyclic structure, especially when the cycle is small and rigid (e.g., 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid), are associated with high yields. The cyclic structure can provide rigidity and facilitate specific interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a long aliphatic chain, particularly when not combined with other polar or aromatic groups (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The hydroxyl group may not sufficiently compensate for the lack of interaction from the long chain.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with an acetamido group in combination with an amino acid structure, especially when the acetamido group is bulky or in a position that causes steric hindrance (e.g., (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The acetamido group may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorable interactions.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: Refine Rule 7 by narrowing its conditions. Consider specifying additional structural features or electronic properties that might lead to low yields, rather than broadly applying it to all modifiers with a formyl group on an aromatic ring.

- **Advice 2**: Adjust Rule 11 to be less aggressive by incorporating additional criteria such as the presence of other functional groups that might mitigate the negative impact of long aliphatic chains. This could involve specifying chain length thresholds or the presence of polar groups.

- **Advice 3**: Modify Rule 8 to be less conservative by exploring the potential for fluorinated chains to interact favorably under certain conditions. Consider factors like chain length, degree of fluorination, and the presence of other functional groups that might enhance interaction with the catalyst.

- **Advice 4**: Revise Rule 14 to account for scenarios where a hydroxyl group on a long aliphatic chain might still contribute positively to yield. This could involve identifying specific chain lengths or additional functional groups that enhance interaction with the catalyst.

- **Advice 5**: Use cross-validation techniques to ensure that the rules are not overfitting to the current dataset. This will help in assessing the generalization capability of the rules across different datasets.

- **Advice 6**: Continuously monitor SHAP values for each rule and use this data to iteratively refine the rules. Focus on rules with consistently high positive or negative SHAP values and adjust them based on discrepancies between predicted and experimental values.

- **Advice 7**: Introduce more diverse training data to improve the robustness of the rules. This can help in capturing a wider range of interactions and conditions that affect the yield.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with a carboxylic acid group, particularly when the amino group is in a secondary position and the side chain is short or contains additional functional groups like hydroxyl or phenyl (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid), tend to result in a high yield. These configurations may enhance coordination with the metal centers in the catalyst and improve solubility.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid or a hydroxyl group, especially when additional electron-donating groups are present (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid), generally lead to a high yield. The aromatic ring can provide stability and facilitate π-π interactions or hydrogen bonding.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure or when combined with other polar groups (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), are associated with high yields. These groups may enhance solubility and increase the interaction surface with the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group, such as thiol or sulfanyl, particularly when combined with other polar or aromatic groups (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid), tend to result in a high yield. Sulfur groups can form strong interactions with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring, especially when the pyridine is substituted with electron-donating groups (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid), often lead to high yields. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro groups on an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid) can lead to high yields. These groups may influence the electronic environment of the catalyst favorably.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a formyl group attached to an aromatic ring, especially when not combined with other electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The formyl group may deactivate the aromatic ring or interact unfavorably with the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains, particularly when the chain is long or heavily fluorinated (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), are associated with low yields. The high electronegativity and steric bulk of fluorine atoms might hinder effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a ketone group in a non-aromatic structure, especially when not accompanied by other functional groups that can enhance interaction (e.g., 4-oxoheptanedioic acid), generally lead to low yields. The ketone group might not provide beneficial interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a methoxy group on an aromatic ring, particularly when combined with other electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), are associated with high yields. Methoxy groups can donate electron density, potentially stabilizing the transition state.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain, especially when lacking polar or aromatic groups (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The aliphatic chain may not interact effectively with the catalyst or could cause steric hindrance.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure, particularly when the structure is substituted with electron-donating groups (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid), tend to result in high yields. The benzofuran structure might enhance π-π stacking or other favorable interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a secondary amine in a cyclic structure, especially when the cycle is small and rigid (e.g., 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid), are associated with high yields. The cyclic structure can provide rigidity and facilitate specific interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a long aliphatic chain, particularly when not combined with other polar or aromatic groups (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The hydroxyl group may not sufficiently compensate for the lack of interaction from the long chain.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with an acetamido group in combination with an amino acid structure, especially when the acetamido group is bulky or in a position that causes steric hindrance (e.g., (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The acetamido group may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorable interactions.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with a carboxylic acid group, particularly when the amino group is in a secondary position and the side chain is short or contains additional functional groups like hydroxyl or phenyl (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid), tend to result in a high yield. These configurations may enhance coordination with the metal centers in the catalyst and improve solubility.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid or a hydroxyl group, especially when additional electron-donating groups are present (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid), generally lead to a high yield. The aromatic ring can provide stability and facilitate π-π interactions or hydrogen bonding.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure or when combined with other polar groups (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), are associated with high yields. These groups may enhance solubility and increase the interaction surface with the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group, such as thiol or sulfanyl, particularly when combined with other polar or aromatic groups (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid), tend to result in a high yield. Sulfur groups can form strong interactions with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring, especially when the pyridine is substituted with electron-donating groups (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid), often lead to high yields. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro groups on an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid) can lead to high yields. These groups may influence the electronic environment of the catalyst favorably.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a formyl group attached to an aromatic ring, especially when not combined with other electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The formyl group may deactivate the aromatic ring or interact unfavorably with the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains, particularly when the chain is long or heavily fluorinated (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), are associated with low yields. The high electronegativity and steric bulk of fluorine atoms might hinder effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a ketone group in a non-aromatic structure, especially when not accompanied by other functional groups that can enhance interaction (e.g., 4-oxoheptanedioic acid), generally lead to low yields. The ketone group might not provide beneficial interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a methoxy group on an aromatic ring, particularly when combined with other electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), are associated with high yields. Methoxy groups can donate electron density, potentially stabilizing the transition state.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain, especially when lacking polar or aromatic groups (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The aliphatic chain may not interact effectively with the catalyst or could cause steric hindrance.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure, particularly when the structure is substituted with electron-donating groups (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid), tend to result in high yields. The benzofuran structure might enhance π-π stacking or other favorable interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a secondary amine in a cyclic structure, especially when the cycle is small and rigid (e.g., 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid), are associated with high yields. The cyclic structure can provide rigidity and facilitate specific interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a long aliphatic chain, particularly when not combined with other polar or aromatic groups (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The hydroxyl group may not sufficiently compensate for the lack of interaction from the long chain.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with an acetamido group in combination with an amino acid structure, especially when the acetamido group is bulky or in a position that causes steric hindrance (e.g., (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The acetamido group may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorable interactions.

** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: Rule 1's SMARTS pattern `[NX3H2+0,NX4H3+;!$([N][!C])][CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])` does not accurately capture the structural description of amino acids with a secondary amino group and a carboxylic acid group. Consider using a SMARTS pattern that specifically targets secondary amines and carboxylic acids in amino acid structures.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Rule 2's SMARTS pattern `[c][CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])[OX2H]` should be refined to specifically identify phenyl groups directly attached to carboxylic acids or hydroxyl groups with electron-donating groups. The current pattern may not fully capture the presence of electron-donating groups.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: Rule 3's SMARTS pattern `[OX2H][CX4;!$(C(O)(O)[!#6])][OX2]` does not effectively identify sugar-like structures with multiple hydroxyl groups. Consider using a pattern that captures multiple hydroxyl groups in a cyclic or sugar-like configuration.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Rule 4's SMARTS pattern `[SX2H;$([SX2H][CX4;!$(C([SX2H])~[O,S,#7,#15])])]` should be adjusted to better capture sulfur-containing groups like thiols or sulfanyls combined with polar or aromatic groups.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: Rule 5's SMARTS pattern `[n][c][CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])` should be refined to specifically identify pyridine rings with electron-donating groups. The current pattern may not fully capture the pyridine structure and its substitutions.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Rule 6's SMARTS pattern `[c][NX3+](=O)-[OX-]` should be checked to ensure it accurately identifies nitro groups on aromatic rings. The pattern may need refinement to capture the electronic influence of nitro groups.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: Rule 7's SMARTS pattern `[c][CX3H]=[OX1]` should be adjusted to specifically identify formyl groups on aromatic rings without electron-donating groups. The current pattern may not fully capture the deactivating effect of formyl groups.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Rule 8's SMARTS pattern `[CX4](F)(F)F` should be refined to capture long or heavily fluorinated alkyl chains. The current pattern may not fully represent the steric and electronic effects of fluorination.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: Rule 9's SMARTS pattern `[CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])[#6]` should be adjusted to specifically identify ketone groups in non-aromatic structures. The current pattern may not fully capture the lack of beneficial interactions.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Rule 10's SMARTS pattern `[c][OX2][c]` should be refined to capture methoxy groups on aromatic rings with electron-donating groups. The current pattern may not fully capture the electron-donating effect of methoxy groups.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: Rule 11's SMARTS pattern `[CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4]` should be adjusted to specifically identify long aliphatic chains lacking polar or aromatic groups. The current pattern may not fully capture the steric hindrance effect.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: Rule 12's SMARTS pattern `[c]1oc2ccccc2c1` should be refined to capture benzofuran structures with electron-donating groups. The current pattern may not fully capture the π-π stacking interactions.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: Rule 13's SMARTS pattern `[NX3H2+0,NX4H3+;!$([N][!C])][CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])` should be adjusted to specifically identify cyclic structures with carboxylic acid groups and secondary amines. The current pattern may not fully capture the rigidity and specific interactions.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: Rule 14's SMARTS pattern `[CX4][OX2H]` should be refined to capture hydroxyl groups on long aliphatic chains without other polar or aromatic groups. The current pattern may not fully capture the lack of interaction.

- ** Suggestion 15 **: Rule 15's SMARTS pattern `[NX3H2+0,NX4H3+;!$([N][!C])][CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])[CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])` should be adjusted to specifically identify acetamido groups in amino acid structures causing steric hindrance.

Methoxy groups can donate electron density, potentially stabilizing the transition state.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain, especially when lacking polar or aromatic groups (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The aliphatic chain may not interact effectively with the catalyst or could cause steric hindrance.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure, particularly when the structure is substituted with electron-donating groups (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid), tend to result in high yields.

Consider using a pattern like `[c][CX3](=[OX1])[OX2H]` with additional conditions for electron-donating groups.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Rule 4's SMARTS pattern `[SX2H;$([SX2H][CX4;!$(C([SX2H])~[O,S,#7,#15])])]` should be adjusted to capture sulfur-containing groups like thiol or sulfanyl, especially when combined with polar or aromatic groups. Consider using a pattern like `[SX2H][c]` for aromatic groups or `[SX2H][CX4]` for aliphatic groups.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: Rule 5's SMARTS pattern `[n][c][CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])` should be refined to specifically capture pyridine rings with electron-donating groups. Consider using a pattern like `[n][c][c][c][c][c]` with conditions for electron-donating groups.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Rule 6's SMARTS pattern `[c][NX3+](=O)-[OX-]` should be adjusted to capture nitro groups on aromatic rings. Consider using a pattern like `[c][NX3+](=O)[O-]`.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: Rule 7's SMARTS pattern `[c][CX3H]=[OX1]` should be refined to capture formyl groups on aromatic rings. Consider using a pattern like `[c][CX3H]=[OX1]` with additional conditions for the absence of electron-donating groups.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Rule 8's SMARTS pattern `[CX4](F)(F)F` should be adjusted to capture fluorinated alkyl chains. Consider using a pattern like `[CX4](F)(F)(F)` with conditions for chain length.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: Rule 9's SMARTS pattern `[CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])[#6]` should be refined to capture ketone groups in non-aromatic structures. Consider using a pattern like `[CX3](=[OX1])[CX4]`.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Rule 10's SMARTS pattern `[c][OX2][c]` should be adjusted to capture methoxy groups on aromatic rings. Consider using a pattern like `[c][OX2][c]` with conditions for electron-donating groups.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: Rule 11's SMARTS pattern `[CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4]` should be refined to capture long aliphatic chains. Consider using a pattern like `[CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4]` with conditions for the absence of polar or aromatic groups.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: Rule 12's SMARTS pattern `[c]1oc2ccccc2c1` should be adjusted to capture benzofuran structures with electron-donating groups. Consider using a pattern like `[c]1oc2ccccc2c1` with conditions for electron-donating groups.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: Rule 13's SMARTS pattern `[NX3H2+0,NX4H3+;!$([N][!C])][CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])` should be refined to capture cyclic structures with a carboxylic acid group and a secondary amine. Consider using a pattern like `[NX3H1][CX3](=[OX1])[OX2H]` with conditions for cyclic structures.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: Rule 14's SMARTS pattern `[CX4][OX2H]` should be adjusted to capture hydroxyl groups on long aliphatic chains. Consider using a pattern like `[CX4][OX2H]` with conditions for chain length and the absence of other polar or aromatic groups.

- ** Suggestion 15 **: Rule 15's SMARTS pattern `[NX3H2+0,NX4H3+;!$([N][!C])][CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])[CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])` should be refined to capture acetamido groups in combination with amino acid structures. Consider using a pattern like `[NX3H1][CX3](=[OX1])[CX3](=[OX1])` with conditions for steric hindrance.

Metric Commenter Message:
Based on the current rule metrics, we can observe the following:

1. **Confidence**: The current train confidence is 0.610, which is an improvement over the previous test confidence values of 0.333 and 0.463. This indicates that the current rules are more reliable in predicting the outcome when the conditions are met. However, the confidence is slightly lower than the highest train confidence observed in the previous iterations (0.671). This suggests that while the rules are generally performing well, there might still be room for improvement in terms of reliability.

2. **Lift**: The current train lift is 1.221, which is a significant improvement over the previous test lift values of 0.689 and 0.914. This indicates that the current rules provide a stronger association between the conditions and the predictions compared to the baseline probability. The lift is also higher than most of the previous train lift values, except for the highest observed lift of 1.332. This suggests that the current rules are effective in identifying meaningful patterns, but there might still be potential to enhance the strength of these associations.

3. **Leverage**: The current train leverage is 0.004, which is positive and indicates that the rules are providing additional support beyond what would be expected by chance. This is an improvement over the negative leverage values observed in some of the previous test metrics, suggesting that the current rules are more effective in capturing non-random associations.

Overall, the current rules show improved performance in terms of confidence and lift compared to the previous test metrics, indicating that they are more reliable and provide stronger associations. However, there is still room for improvement, particularly in achieving higher confidence and lift values.

**Recommendations for Improvement**:
- **Refinement of Rule Conditions**: Consider refining the conditions of the rules to capture more specific interactions or structural features that could lead to higher yields. This could involve exploring additional functional groups or structural motifs that have not been considered yet.
- **Incorporation of Additional Data**: If possible, incorporate more data or features that could provide additional context or information about the interactions between modifiers and catalysts. This could help in identifying more nuanced patterns.
- **Optimization Techniques**: Utilize optimization techniques such as genetic algorithms or machine learning models to automatically refine and optimize the rules based on the available data. This could help in identifying more effective rule conditions and predictions.
- **Cross-Validation**: Implement cross-validation techniques to ensure that the rules are generalizable and not overfitting to the training data. This could help in achieving more robust and reliable rules.

By focusing on these areas, it may be possible to further enhance the performance of the rules and achieve higher confidence and lift values.

### Performance Evaluation of Current Rules

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
   - The current rules have shown varying levels of effectiveness across different iterations. The validation accuracy has fluctuated between 0.6 and 0.7428571428571429, indicating that the rules are not consistently effective. The latest validation accuracy of 0.6571428571428571 suggests moderate performance but still leaves room for improvement.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment:**
   - The fluctuations in validation accuracy suggest potential overfitting or underfitting issues. The model may be overfitting to specific features captured by the rules, as indicated by the high SHAP values for certain rules in specific cases. Conversely, underfitting might be occurring if the rules are not capturing enough relevant features, leading to lower accuracies in some iterations.

3. **Discrepancies Analysis:**
   - For molecules where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low, rules with high positive SHAP values (e.g., Rule 7, Rule 8, Rule 11) may be problematic. These rules might be overestimating the contribution of certain features.
   - For molecules where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, rules with high negative SHAP values (e.g., Rule 14, Rule 15) may be underestimating the contribution of certain features.

4. **Accuracy Improvements:**
   - The accuracy metrics suggest that there is potential for improvement. The current rules have not yet reached a local minimum, as indicated by the fluctuating validation accuracies. Iterative refinement of the rules could lead to more consistent and higher accuracies.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**
   - SHAP analysis indicates that certain rules consistently contribute to high or low predictions. For example, Rule 7 and Rule 8 often have high positive SHAP values, suggesting they may be overemphasizing certain features. Conversely, Rule 14 and Rule 15 often have high negative SHAP values, indicating they may be underemphasizing certain features.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Overestimated Rules:**
   - Rules with high positive SHAP values for overestimated loadings, such as Rule 7 and Rule 8, should be refined. Consider adjusting the conditions under which these rules apply or incorporating additional features to balance their influence.

2. **Adjust Underestimated Rules:**
   - Rules with high negative SHAP values for underestimated loadings, such as Rule 14 and Rule 15, should be adjusted. This could involve broadening the scope of these rules or integrating complementary features to enhance their predictive power.

3. **Improve Generalization:**
   - To address overfitting or underfitting, consider introducing more generalized rules that capture broader patterns across the dataset. This could involve combining similar rules or creating new rules that account for interactions between features.

4. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - Use insights from SHAP analysis to iteratively refine the rules. Focus on rules that consistently show high SHAP values, either positive or negative, and evaluate their impact on the model's performance. Adjust these rules based on their contribution to prediction errors.

5. **Evaluate Rule Effectiveness:**
   - Continuously evaluate the effectiveness of the refined rules by monitoring changes in validation accuracy and SHAP values. Aim for a stable increase in accuracy and a balanced distribution of SHAP values across rules.

By implementing these recommendations, the current rules can be refined to improve the model's predictive accuracy and generalization capabilities.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with a carboxylic acid group, particularly when the amino group is in a secondary position and the side chain is short or contains additional functional groups like hydroxyl or phenyl (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid), tend to result in a high yield. These configurations may enhance coordination with the metal centers in the catalyst and improve solubility.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid or a hydroxyl group, especially when additional electron-donating groups are present (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid), generally lead to a high yield. The aromatic ring can provide stability and facilitate π-π interactions or hydrogen bonding.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure or when combined with other polar groups (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), are associated with high yields. These groups may enhance solubility and increase the interaction surface with the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group, such as thiol or sulfanyl, particularly when combined with other polar or aromatic groups (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid), tend to result in a high yield. Sulfur groups can form strong interactions with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring, especially when the pyridine is substituted with electron-donating groups (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid), often lead to high yields. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro groups on an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid) can lead to high yields. These groups may influence the electronic environment of the catalyst favorably.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a formyl group attached to an aromatic ring, especially when not combined with other electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The formyl group may deactivate the aromatic ring or interact unfavorably with the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains, particularly when the chain is long or heavily fluorinated (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), are associated with low yields. The high electronegativity and steric bulk of fluorine atoms might hinder effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a ketone group in a non-aromatic structure, especially when not accompanied by other functional groups that can enhance interaction (e.g., 4-oxoheptanedioic acid), generally lead to low yields. The ketone group might not provide beneficial interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a methoxy group on an aromatic ring, particularly when combined with other electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), are associated with high yields. Methoxy groups can donate electron density, potentially stabilizing the transition state.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain, especially when lacking polar or aromatic groups (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The aliphatic chain may not interact effectively with the catalyst or could cause steric hindrance.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure, particularly when the structure is substituted with electron-donating groups (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid), tend to result in high yields. The benzofuran structure might enhance π-π stacking or other favorable interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a secondary amine in a cyclic structure, especially when the cycle is small and rigid (e.g., 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid), are associated with high yields. The cyclic structure can provide rigidity and facilitate specific interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a long aliphatic chain, particularly when not combined with other polar or aromatic groups (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The hydroxyl group may not sufficiently compensate for the lack of interaction from the long chain.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with an acetamido group in combination with an amino acid structure, especially when the acetamido group is bulky or in a position that causes steric hindrance (e.g., (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The acetamido group may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorable interactions.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: Refine Rule 7 and Rule 8 by incorporating additional features or conditions that can better capture the nuances of modifiers with formyl groups and fluorinated alkyl chains. Consider integrating interactions with other functional groups or structural elements that may mitigate their negative impact on yield.

- **Advice 2**: Modify Rule 14 and Rule 15 to broaden their scope. For Rule 14, explore the potential interactions of hydroxyl groups on long aliphatic chains with other polar or aromatic groups that might enhance yield. For Rule 15, consider the steric and electronic effects of acetamido groups in different positions or configurations.

- **Advice 3**: Develop more generalized rules that can capture broader patterns across different types of modifiers. This could involve combining similar rules, such as those involving aromatic structures, to account for common interactions like π-π stacking or hydrogen bonding.

- **Advice 4**: Use SHAP analysis to iteratively refine rules, focusing on those with consistently high SHAP values. Adjust these rules by analyzing their contribution to prediction errors and modifying them to better align with experimental data.

- **Advice 5**: Continuously evaluate the effectiveness of refined rules by monitoring changes in validation accuracy and SHAP values. Aim for a balanced distribution of SHAP values across rules to ensure that no single rule is disproportionately influencing predictions.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a methoxy group on an aromatic ring, particularly when combined with other electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), are associated with high yields. Methoxy groups can donate electron density, potentially stabilizing the transition state.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain, especially when lacking polar or aromatic groups (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The aliphatic chain may not interact effectively with the catalyst or could cause steric hindrance.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure, particularly when the structure is substituted with electron-donating groups (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid), tend to result in high yields. The benzofuran structure might enhance π-π stacking or other favorable interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a secondary amine in a cyclic structure, especially when the cycle is small and rigid (e.g., 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid), are associated with high yields. The cyclic structure can provide rigidity and facilitate specific interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a long aliphatic chain, particularly when not combined with other polar or aromatic groups (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The hydroxyl group may not sufficiently compensate for the lack of interaction from the long chain.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with an acetamido group in combination with an amino acid structure, especially when the acetamido group is bulky or in a position that causes steric hindrance (e.g., (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The acetamido group may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorable interactions.

** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern `[NX3H1+0,NX4H2+;!$([N][!C])]` does not fully capture the complexity of the amino acid structure with a carboxylic acid group and secondary amine. Consider using a more specific SMARTS pattern that includes the secondary amine and carboxylic acid group in a short side chain.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Rule 2's SMARTS pattern `[c][CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])[$([OX2H]),$([OX1-])]` should be expanded to include electron-donating groups on the phenyl group. The current pattern may not capture all relevant structures.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For Rule 3, the SMARTS pattern `[OX2H][CX4;!$(C(O)(O)[!#6])][OX2]` should be refined to specifically identify sugar-like structures with multiple hydroxyl groups. The current pattern may be too broad.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Rule 4's SMARTS pattern `[SX2H;$([SX2H][CX4;!$(C([SX2H])~[O,S,#7,#15])])]` should be adjusted to better capture sulfur-containing groups combined with polar or aromatic groups. Consider adding patterns for thiol or sulfanyl groups in conjunction with aromatic rings.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: Rule 5's SMARTS pattern `[n][c]` is too generic and does not account for electron-donating groups on the pyridine ring. A more specific pattern should be used to capture these substitutions.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Rule 6's SMARTS pattern `[c][NX3+](=O)-[OX-]` should be checked to ensure it captures nitro groups on aromatic rings accurately. Consider refining the pattern to include the aromatic context.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: For Rule 7, the SMARTS pattern `[c][CX3H]=[OX1]` should be expanded to ensure it captures formyl groups on aromatic rings without electron-donating groups.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Rule 8's SMARTS pattern `[CX4](F)(F)F` should be checked to ensure it captures long or heavily fluorinated alkyl chains accurately. Consider expanding the pattern to include longer chains.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: Rule 9's SMARTS pattern `[CX3;$([CX3]([#6])[#6])](=[OX1])` should be refined to ensure it captures ketone groups in non-aromatic structures without other functional groups.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Rule 10's SMARTS pattern `[c][OX2;$([H0]([#6])[c])]` should be checked to ensure it captures methoxy groups on aromatic rings with electron-donating groups accurately.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: Rule 11's SMARTS pattern `[CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4]` is too generic and does not capture long aliphatic chains lacking polar or aromatic groups. Consider refining the pattern to better match the rule description.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: Rule 12's SMARTS pattern `[c]1oc2ccccc2c1` should be checked to ensure it captures benzofuran structures with electron-donating groups accurately.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: Rule 13's SMARTS pattern `[NX3H1+0,NX4H2+;!$([N][!C])][CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])` should be refined to capture cyclic structures with a carboxylic acid group and secondary amine accurately.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: Rule 14's SMARTS pattern `[CX4][OX2H]` is too generic and does not capture hydroxyl groups on long aliphatic chains without other polar or aromatic groups. Consider refining the pattern.

- ** Suggestion 15 **: Rule 15's SMARTS pattern `[NX3H1+0,NX4H2+;!$([N][!C])][CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])` should be refined to capture acetamido groups in combination with amino acid structures accurately.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with a carboxylic acid group, particularly when the amino group is in a secondary position and the side chain is short or contains additional functional groups like hydroxyl or phenyl (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid), tend to result in a high yield. These configurations may enhance coordination with the metal centers in the catalyst and improve solubility.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid or a hydroxyl group, especially when additional electron-donating groups are present (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid), generally lead to a high yield. The aromatic ring can provide stability and facilitate π-π interactions or hydrogen bonding.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure or when combined with other polar groups (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), are associated with high yields. These groups may enhance solubility and increase the interaction surface with the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group, such as thiol or sulfanyl, particularly when combined with other polar or aromatic groups (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid), tend to result in a high yield. Sulfur groups can form strong interactions with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring, especially when the pyridine is substituted with electron-donating groups (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid), often lead to high yields. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro groups on an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid) can lead to high yields. These groups may influence the electronic environment of the catalyst favorably.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a formyl group attached to an aromatic ring, especially when not combined with other electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The formyl group may deactivate the aromatic ring or interact unfavorably with the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains, particularly when the chain is long or heavily fluorinated (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), are associated with low yields. The high electronegativity and steric bulk of fluorine atoms might hinder effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a ketone group in a non-aromatic structure, especially when not accompanied by other functional groups that can enhance interaction (e.g., 4-oxoheptanedioic acid), generally lead to low yields. The ketone group might not provide beneficial interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a methoxy group on an aromatic ring, particularly when combined with other electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), are associated with high yields. Methoxy groups can donate electron density, potentially stabilizing the transition state.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain, especially when lacking polar or aromatic groups (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The aliphatic chain may not interact effectively with the catalyst or could cause steric hindrance.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure, particularly when the structure is substituted with electron-donating groups (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid), tend to result in high yields. The benzofuran structure might enhance π-π stacking or other favorable interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a secondary amine in a cyclic structure, especially when the cycle is small and rigid (e.g., 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid), are associated with high yields. The cyclic structure can provide rigidity and facilitate specific interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a long aliphatic chain, particularly when not combined with other polar or aromatic groups (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The hydroxyl group may not sufficiently compensate for the lack of interaction from the long chain.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with an acetamido group in combination with an amino acid structure, especially when the acetamido group is bulky or in a position that causes steric hindrance (e.g., (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The acetamido group may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorable interactions.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with a carboxylic acid group, particularly when the amino group is in a secondary position and the side chain is short or contains additional functional groups like hydroxyl or phenyl (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid), tend to result in a high yield. These configurations may enhance coordination with the metal centers in the catalyst and improve solubility.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid or a hydroxyl group, especially when additional electron-donating groups are present (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid), generally lead to a high yield. The aromatic ring can provide stability and facilitate π-π interactions or hydrogen bonding.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure or when combined with other polar groups (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), are associated with high yields. These groups may enhance solubility and increase the interaction surface with the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group, such as thiol or sulfanyl, particularly when combined with other polar or aromatic groups (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid), tend to result in a high yield. Sulfur groups can form strong interactions with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring, especially when the pyridine is substituted with electron-donating groups (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid), often lead to high yields. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro groups on an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid) can lead to high yields. These groups may influence the electronic environment of the catalyst favorably.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a formyl group attached to an aromatic ring, especially when not combined with other electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The formyl group may deactivate the aromatic ring or interact unfavorably with the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains, particularly when the chain is long or heavily fluorinated (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), are associated with low yields. The high electronegativity and steric bulk of fluorine atoms might hinder effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a ketone group in a non-aromatic structure, especially when not accompanied by other functional groups that can enhance interaction (e.g., 4-oxoheptanedioic acid), generally lead to low yields. The ketone group might not provide beneficial interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a methoxy group on an aromatic ring, particularly when combined with other electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), are associated with high yields. Methoxy groups can donate electron density, potentially stabilizing the transition state.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain, especially when lacking polar or aromatic groups (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The aliphatic chain may not interact effectively with the catalyst or could cause steric hindrance.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure, particularly when the structure is substituted with electron-donating groups (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid), tend to result in high yields. The benzofuran structure might enhance π-π stacking or other favorable interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a secondary amine in a cyclic structure, especially when the cycle is small and rigid (e.g., 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid), are associated with high yields. The cyclic structure can provide rigidity and facilitate specific interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a long aliphatic chain, particularly when not combined with other polar or aromatic groups (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The hydroxyl group may not sufficiently compensate for the lack of interaction from the long chain.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with an acetamido group in combination with an amino acid structure, especially when the acetamido group is bulky or in a position that causes steric hindrance (e.g., (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The acetamido group may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorable interactions.

Metric Commenter Message:
Based on the current metrics, the performance of the rules appears to have declined compared to the previous iterations. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Confidence**: The current train confidence is 0.4856, which is lower than the confidence values observed in the previous iterations (ranging from 0.4989 to 0.6716). This indicates that the current rules are less reliable in predicting the outcome compared to earlier rules.

2. **Lift**: The current train lift is 0.9808, which is below 1. This suggests that the rules are not providing any additional predictive power over random chance. In previous iterations, the lift values were consistently above 1, indicating that those rules were more effective in identifying associations that were stronger than random chance.

3. **Leverage**: The current train leverage is -0.0029, which is negative. This implies that the observed support for the rule is less than what would be expected by chance, indicating a weaker association. In previous iterations, leverage values were mostly positive, suggesting stronger associations.

4. **Support**: The current train support is 0.0248, which is relatively low. While support is not the primary focus, it is important to ensure that the rules apply to a reasonable portion of the dataset to be useful.

### Recommendations for Improvement:

- **Refine Rule Conditions**: Re-evaluate the conditions of the current rules to ensure they are capturing meaningful patterns. Consider incorporating additional or alternative functional groups or structural features that may enhance the interaction with the catalyst.

- **Focus on High Lift and Confidence**: Prioritize rules that have shown higher lift and confidence in previous iterations. This may involve revisiting rules with specific functional groups or structural motifs that consistently led to high yields.

- **Explore New Combinations**: Experiment with new combinations of functional groups or structural features that have not been previously considered. This could uncover new patterns that improve the predictive power of the rules.

- **Iterative Testing and Validation**: Continue iterating on the rules, testing them against both training and test datasets to ensure they generalize well. Use cross-validation techniques to assess the robustness of the rules.

- **Leverage Domain Knowledge**: Collaborate with domain experts to gain insights into chemical interactions that may not be immediately apparent from the data. This could guide the development of more effective rules.

Overall, the current iteration suggests that the rules may have reached a local minimum, and further refinement is necessary to improve their predictive performance.

### Performance Evaluation of Current Rules

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
   - The current validation accuracy of 0.7429 is a significant improvement over some previous iterations, indicating that the rules are becoming more effective. However, there is still room for improvement as the accuracy is not consistently high across all iterations.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment:**
   - The fluctuation in validation accuracy across different iterations suggests potential overfitting or underfitting. The rules may be too specific to certain data points, leading to inconsistencies in performance.

3. **Discrepancies Analysis:**
   - For molecules where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low, rules with high positive SHAP values (e.g., Rule 7, Rule 8, Rule 11) might be overestimating the loading. Conversely, for molecules where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, rules with high negative SHAP values (e.g., Rule 7, Rule 8, Rule 11) might be underestimating the loading.

4. **Accuracy Improvements Interpretation:**
   - The improvement in accuracy suggests that the rules are moving in the right direction, but the presence of discrepancies indicates that further refinement is needed to achieve more consistent results.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**
   - SHAP analysis highlights specific rules that contribute significantly to the prediction errors. For instance, Rule 7 and Rule 8 often have high SHAP values, indicating they might be contributing to overestimation or underestimation of loadings.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Overestimated Loadings:**
   - Rules with high positive SHAP values for overestimated loadings, such as Rule 7 and Rule 8, should be reviewed. Consider adjusting the conditions under which these rules predict high loadings, possibly by incorporating additional structural features or interactions that could moderate their influence.

2. **Adjust Underestimated Loadings:**
   - For rules with high negative SHAP values leading to underestimated loadings, such as Rule 11, consider expanding the conditions to include additional functional groups or interactions that might enhance the predicted loading.

3. **Improve Generalization:**
   - To address potential overfitting, consider simplifying some rules or combining similar rules to reduce complexity. This could help improve the model's ability to generalize across different datasets.

4. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - Use insights from SHAP analysis to iteratively refine the rules. Focus on rules that consistently show high SHAP values in error cases and test modifications to these rules in subsequent iterations to evaluate their impact on accuracy.

5. **Incorporate Additional Features:**
   - Consider incorporating additional molecular features or interactions that are not currently captured by the rules. This could include exploring new types of functional groups or considering the spatial arrangement of atoms in the molecule.

By implementing these recommendations, the rules can be refined to improve their predictive accuracy and consistency across different datasets.

### Summary and Directions for Optimization

1. **Current Rule Performance:**
   - The current rules have shown some improvement in validation accuracy, reaching 0.7429, but there is still inconsistency across different iterations. The train confidence and lift values indicate that the rules are not as reliable or effective as they could be.

2. **Rule Refinement Suggestions:**
   - **Rule 1 to Rule 15**: Each rule's SMARTS pattern should be refined to better capture the specific structural features and functional groups mentioned. This includes ensuring specificity for amino acid structures, phenyl groups, sugar-like structures, sulfur-containing groups, pyridine rings, electron-withdrawing groups, formyl groups, fluorinated chains, ketone groups, methoxy groups, long aliphatic chains, benzofuran structures, cyclic structures with secondary amines, hydroxyl groups on long chains, and acetamido groups.

3. **Performance Evaluation:**
   - The current rules may be overfitting or underfitting, as indicated by fluctuating validation accuracy and discrepancies in SHAP analysis. Rules with high SHAP values in error cases should be prioritized for refinement.

4. **SHAP Analysis Insights:**
   - Rules such as Rule 7, Rule 8, and Rule 11 often have high SHAP values, suggesting they may contribute to prediction errors. These rules should be reviewed and adjusted to improve their accuracy.

### Recommendations for Further Optimization

1. **Refine Overestimated and Underestimated Loadings:**
   - Adjust rules with high positive SHAP values for overestimated loadings and high negative SHAP values for underestimated loadings. This involves revisiting the conditions and potentially incorporating additional structural features.

2. **Improve Generalization:**
   - Simplify or combine similar rules to reduce complexity and improve generalization. This can help prevent overfitting and enhance the model's performance across different datasets.

3. **Iterative Testing and Validation:**
   - Continue iterating on the rules, using cross-validation techniques to assess their robustness and ensure they generalize well.

4. **Incorporate Additional Features:**
   - Explore new molecular features or interactions that are not currently captured by the rules. This could involve considering spatial arrangements or new types of functional groups.

5. **Leverage Domain Knowledge:**
   - Collaborate with domain experts to gain insights into chemical interactions that may not be immediately apparent from the data. This could guide the development of more effective rules.

### Conclusion

There is potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. By refining the SMARTS patterns, addressing overestimated and underestimated loadings, and incorporating additional features, the rules can be improved to achieve higher accuracy and consistency.

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: gpt-4o-2024-08-06
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with a carboxylic acid group, particularly when the amino group is in a secondary position and the side chain is short or contains additional functional groups like hydroxyl or phenyl (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid), tend to result in a high yield. These configurations may enhance coordination with the metal centers in the catalyst and improve solubility.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid or a hydroxyl group, especially when additional electron-donating groups are present (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid), generally lead to a high yield. The aromatic ring can provide stability and facilitate π-π interactions or hydrogen bonding.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure or when combined with other polar groups (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), are associated with high yields. These groups may enhance solubility and increase the interaction surface with the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group, such as thiol or sulfanyl, particularly when combined with other polar or aromatic groups (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid), tend to result in a high yield. Sulfur groups can form strong interactions with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring, especially when the pyridine is substituted with electron-donating groups (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid), often lead to high yields. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro groups on an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid) can lead to high yields. These groups may influence the electronic environment of the catalyst favorably.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a formyl group attached to an aromatic ring, especially when not combined with other electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The formyl group may deactivate the aromatic ring or interact unfavorably with the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains, particularly when the chain is long or heavily fluorinated (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), are associated with low yields. The high electronegativity and steric bulk of fluorine atoms might hinder effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a ketone group in a non-aromatic structure, especially when not accompanied by other functional groups that can enhance interaction (e.g., 4-oxoheptanedioic acid), generally lead to low yields. The ketone group might not provide beneficial interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a methoxy group on an aromatic ring, particularly when combined with other electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), are associated with high yields. Methoxy groups can donate electron density, potentially stabilizing the transition state.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain, especially when lacking polar or aromatic groups (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The aliphatic chain may not interact effectively with the catalyst or could cause steric hindrance.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure, particularly when the structure is substituted with electron-donating groups (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid), tend to result in high yields. The benzofuran structure might enhance π-π stacking or other favorable interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a secondary amine in a cyclic structure, especially when the cycle is small and rigid (e.g., 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid), are associated with high yields. The cyclic structure can provide rigidity and facilitate specific interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a long aliphatic chain, particularly when not combined with other polar or aromatic groups (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The hydroxyl group may not sufficiently compensate for the lack of interaction from the long chain.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with an acetamido group in combination with an amino acid structure, especially when the acetamido group is bulky or in a position that causes steric hindrance (e.g., (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The acetamido group may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorable interactions.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: Refine the SMARTS patterns for each rule to ensure they accurately capture the specific structural features and functional groups. For example, ensure that amino acid structures in Rule 1 are specifically identified by their backbone and side chain features.

- **Advice 2**: Review and adjust rules with high SHAP values, such as Rule 7, Rule 8, and Rule 11, to improve their accuracy. This may involve adding or modifying conditions to better capture the interactions that lead to low yields.

- **Advice 3**: Simplify or combine similar rules to reduce complexity and improve generalization. For instance, if multiple rules address similar functional groups or structural motifs, consider merging them into a single, more comprehensive rule.

- **Advice 4**: Incorporate additional molecular features that are not currently captured by the rules. This could include spatial arrangements, steric effects, or new types of functional groups that may influence the reaction yield.

- **Advice 5**: Collaborate with domain experts to gain insights into chemical interactions that may not be immediately apparent from the data. Use this knowledge to guide the development of more effective and accurate rules.

- **Advice 6**: Use iterative testing and cross-validation techniques to assess the robustness of the rules. This will help ensure that the rules generalize well across different datasets and are not overfitting or underfitting.

- **Advice 7**: Adjust rules with high positive SHAP values for overestimated loadings and high negative SHAP values for underestimated loadings. This involves revisiting the conditions and potentially incorporating additional structural features to balance the predictions.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a methoxy group on an aromatic ring, particularly when combined with other electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), are associated with high yields. Methoxy groups can donate electron density, potentially stabilizing the transition state.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain, especially when lacking polar or aromatic groups (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The aliphatic chain may not interact effectively with the catalyst or could cause steric hindrance.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure, particularly when the structure is substituted with electron-donating groups (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid), tend to result in high yields. The benzofuran structure might enhance π-π stacking or other favorable interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a secondary amine in a cyclic structure, especially when the cycle is small and rigid (e.g., 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid), are associated with high yields. The cyclic structure can provide rigidity and facilitate specific interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a long aliphatic chain, particularly when not combined with other polar or aromatic groups (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The hydroxyl group may not sufficiently compensate for the lack of interaction from the long chain.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with an acetamido group in combination with an amino acid structure, especially when the acetamido group is bulky or in a position that causes steric hindrance (e.g., (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The acetamido group may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorable interactions.

- **Advice 1**: Refine Rule 4 by investigating the specific conditions under which sulfur-containing groups lead to high yields. Consider the influence of additional functional groups or structural contexts that may affect the outcome, as indicated by the contradiction in entry 10.

- **Advice 2**: Refine Rule 5 by examining the specific structural features or conditions that differentiate high-yielding pyridine modifiers from those that do not perform well, as seen in the contradiction with entry 11.

- **Advice 3**: Increase the dataset coverage for rules with limited data support, such as Rule 3 (multiple hydroxyl groups) and Rule 12 (benzofuran structures), to ensure robustness and reliability of these rules.

- **Advice 4**: Consider incorporating quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling to predict the impact of different functional groups on yield, which could help refine existing rules and identify new patterns.

- **Advice 5**: Explore the use of machine learning algorithms to analyze the dataset and suggest potential new rules or modifications to existing ones, based on patterns that may not be immediately obvious through manual analysis.

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with a carboxylic acid group, particularly when the amino group is in a secondary position and the side chain is short or contains additional functional groups like hydroxyl or phenyl (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid), tend to result in a high yield. These configurations may enhance coordination with the metal centers in the catalyst and improve solubility.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid or a hydroxyl group, especially when additional electron-donating groups are present (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid), generally lead to a high yield. The aromatic ring can provide stability and facilitate π-π interactions or hydrogen bonding.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure or when combined with other polar groups (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), are associated with high yields. These groups may enhance solubility and increase the interaction surface with the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group, such as thiol or sulfanyl, particularly when combined with other polar or aromatic groups (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid), tend to result in a high yield. Sulfur groups can form strong interactions with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring, especially when the pyridine is substituted with electron-donating groups (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid), often lead to high yields. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a methoxy group on an aromatic ring, particularly when combined with other electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), are associated with high yields. Methoxy groups can donate electron density, potentially stabilizing the transition state.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain, especially when lacking polar or aromatic groups (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The aliphatic chain may not interact effectively with the catalyst or could cause steric hindrance.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure, particularly when the structure is substituted with electron-donating groups (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid), tend to result in high yields.

** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: Rule 1's SMARTS pattern `[NX3H2+0,NX4H3+;!$([N][!C])][CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])` does not accurately capture the description of amino acids with a secondary amino group and a carboxylic acid. Consider using a SMARTS pattern that specifically targets secondary amines and carboxylic acids in amino acid structures.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Rule 2's SMARTS pattern `[c][CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])[OX2H]` should be revised to ensure it captures phenyl groups directly attached to carboxylic acids or hydroxyl groups with electron-donating groups. The current pattern may not fully capture the presence of electron-donating groups.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: Rule 3's SMARTS pattern `[OX2H][CX4;!$(C(O)(O)[!#6])][OX2]` should be adjusted to better identify sugar-like structures with multiple hydroxyl groups. Consider using a pattern that captures multiple hydroxyl groups in a cyclic or sugar-like configuration.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Rule 4's SMARTS pattern `[SX2H;$([SX2H][CX4;!$(C([SX2H])~[O,S,#7,#15])])]` may not fully capture sulfur-containing groups like thiols or sulfanyls combined with polar or aromatic groups. Ensure the pattern includes sulfur groups in combination with other functional groups.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: Rule 5's SMARTS pattern `[n][c][CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])` should be revised to specifically target pyridine rings with electron-donating groups. The current pattern may not accurately capture the pyridine structure.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Rule 6's SMARTS pattern `[c][NX3+](=O)-[OX-]` should be checked to ensure it captures nitro groups on aromatic rings. The pattern should be specific to nitro groups and their influence on the aromatic ring.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: Rule 7's SMARTS pattern `[c][CX3H]=[OX1]` should be revised to accurately capture formyl groups attached to aromatic rings. Ensure the pattern reflects the presence of formyl groups without electron-donating groups.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Rule 8's SMARTS pattern `[CX4](F)(F)F` should be checked to ensure it captures fluorinated alkyl chains, especially long or heavily fluorinated ones. The pattern should reflect the steric and electronic effects of fluorine atoms.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: Rule 9's SMARTS pattern `[CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])[#6]` should be revised to accurately capture ketone groups in non-aromatic structures. Ensure the pattern reflects the lack of beneficial interactions with the catalyst.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Rule 10's SMARTS pattern `[c][OX2][c]` should be checked to ensure it captures methoxy groups on aromatic rings with electron-donating groups. The pattern should reflect the electron-donating nature of methoxy groups.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: Rule 11's SMARTS pattern `[CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4]` should be revised to accurately capture long aliphatic chains lacking polar or aromatic groups. Ensure the pattern reflects the steric hindrance and lack of interaction with the catalyst.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: Rule 12's SMARTS pattern `[o][c]1[c][c][c][c][c]1` should be checked to ensure it captures benzofuran structures with electron-donating groups. The pattern should reflect the π-π stacking and other interactions with the catalyst.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: Rule 13's SMARTS pattern `[NX3H2+0,NX4H3+;!$([N][!C])][CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])` should be revised to accurately capture cyclic structures with a carboxylic acid group and a secondary amine. Ensure the pattern reflects the rigidity and specific interactions with the catalyst.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: Rule 14's SMARTS pattern `[CX4][OX2H]` should be revised to accurately capture hydroxyl groups on long aliphatic chains without other polar or aromatic groups. Ensure the pattern reflects the insufficient interaction from the long chain.

- ** Suggestion 15 **: Rule 15's SMARTS pattern `[NX3H2+0,NX4H3+;!$([N][!C])][CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])[CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])` should be revised to accurately capture acetamido groups in combination with amino acid structures. Ensure the pattern reflects the steric hindrance and unfavorable interactions.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with a carboxylic acid group, particularly when the amino group is in a secondary position and the side chain is short or contains additional functional groups like hydroxyl or phenyl (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid), tend to result in a high yield. These configurations may enhance coordination with the metal centers in the catalyst and improve solubility.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid or a hydroxyl group, especially when additional electron-donating groups are present (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid), generally lead to a high yield. The aromatic ring can provide stability and facilitate π-π interactions or hydrogen bonding.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure or when combined with other polar groups (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), are associated with high yields. These groups may enhance solubility and increase the interaction surface with the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group, such as thiol or sulfanyl, particularly when combined with other polar or aromatic groups (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid), tend to result in a high yield. Sulfur groups can form strong interactions with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring, especially when the pyridine is substituted with electron-donating groups (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid), often lead to high yields. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro groups on an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid) can lead to high yields. These groups may influence the electronic environment of the catalyst favorably.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a formyl group attached to an aromatic ring, especially when not combined with other electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The formyl group may deactivate the aromatic ring or interact unfavorably with the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains, particularly when the chain is long or heavily fluorinated (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), are associated with low yields. The high electronegativity and steric bulk of fluorine atoms might hinder effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a ketone group in a non-aromatic structure, especially when not accompanied by other functional groups that can enhance interaction (e.g., 4-oxoheptanedioic acid), generally lead to low yields. The ketone group might not provide beneficial interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a methoxy group on an aromatic ring, particularly when combined with other electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), are associated with high yields. Methoxy groups can donate electron density, potentially stabilizing the transition state.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain, especially when lacking polar or aromatic groups (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The aliphatic chain may not interact effectively with the catalyst or could cause steric hindrance.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure, particularly when the structure is substituted with electron-donating groups (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid), tend to result in high yields. The benzofuran structure might enhance π-π stacking or other favorable interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a secondary amine in a cyclic structure, especially when the cycle is small and rigid (e.g., 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid), are associated with high yields. The cyclic structure can provide rigidity and facilitate specific interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a long aliphatic chain, particularly when not combined with other polar or aromatic groups (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The hydroxyl group may not sufficiently compensate for the lack of interaction from the long chain.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with an acetamido group in combination with an amino acid structure, especially when the acetamido group is bulky or in a position that causes steric hindrance (e.g., (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The acetamido group may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorable interactions.

** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: Rule 1 in the code uses the SMARTS pattern '[NX3H2+0,NX4H3+;!$([N][!C])][CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])', which does not accurately capture the structural description of amino acids with a secondary amino group and a carboxylic acid group. The SMARTS should be adjusted to specifically identify secondary amines and carboxylic acid groups in amino acid structures.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Rule 2's SMARTS pattern '[c][CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])[OX2H]' does not fully capture the presence of a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid or hydroxyl group. The SMARTS should be refined to ensure it matches the specific structural features described in the rule, including electron-donating groups on the aromatic ring.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: Rule 3's SMARTS pattern '[OX2H][CX4;!$(C(O)(O)[!#6])][OX2]' does not effectively identify sugar-like structures with multiple hydroxyl groups. The SMARTS should be modified to detect multiple hydroxyl groups in a sugar-like configuration.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Rule 4's SMARTS pattern '[SX2H;$([SX2H][CX4;!$(C([SX2H])~[O,S,#7,#15])])]' should be revised to better capture sulfur-containing groups like thiol or sulfanyl, especially when combined with polar or aromatic groups.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: Rule 5's SMARTS pattern '[n][c][CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])' does not accurately reflect the presence of a pyridine ring with electron-donating groups. The SMARTS should be adjusted to specifically identify pyridine rings and their substitutions.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Rule 6's SMARTS pattern '[c][NX3+](=O)-[OX-]' should be checked to ensure it captures nitro groups on an aromatic ring, as described in the rule.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: Rule 7's SMARTS pattern '[c][CX3H]=[OX1]' should be refined to specifically identify formyl groups attached to aromatic rings, as described in the rule.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Rule 8's SMARTS pattern '[CX4](F)(F)F' should be checked to ensure it captures fluorinated alkyl chains, particularly long or heavily fluorinated ones.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: Rule 9's SMARTS pattern '[CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])[#6]' should be revised to better capture ketone groups in non-aromatic structures, as described in the rule.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Rule 10's SMARTS pattern '[c][OX2][c]' should be refined to specifically identify methoxy groups on aromatic rings, especially when combined with other electron-donating groups.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: Rule 11's SMARTS pattern '[CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4]' should be revised to better capture long aliphatic chains, especially those lacking polar or aromatic groups.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: Rule 12's SMARTS pattern '[o][c]1[c][c][c][c][c]1' should be checked to ensure it captures benzofuran structures, particularly those substituted with electron-donating groups.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: Rule 13's SMARTS pattern '[NX3H2+0,NX4H3+;!$([N][!C])][CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])' should be revised to better capture cyclic structures with a carboxylic acid group and a secondary amine, as described in the rule.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: Rule 14's SMARTS pattern '[CX4][OX2H]' should be refined to specifically identify hydroxyl groups on long aliphatic chains, as described in the rule.

- ** Suggestion 15 **: Rule 15's SMARTS pattern '[NX3H2+0,NX4H3+;!$([N][!C])][CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])[CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])' should be revised to better capture acetamido groups in combination with amino acid structures, as described in the rule.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid or a hydroxyl group, especially when additional electron-donating groups are present (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid), generally lead to a high yield. The aromatic ring can provide stability and facilitate π-π interactions or hydrogen bonding.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure or when combined with other polar groups (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), are associated with high yields. These groups may enhance solubility and increase the interaction surface with the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group, such as thiol or sulfanyl, particularly when combined with other polar or aromatic groups (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid), tend to result in a high yield.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a formyl group attached to an aromatic ring, especially when not combined with other electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The formyl group may deactivate the aromatic ring or interact unfavorably with the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains, particularly when the chain is long or heavily fluorinated (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), are associated with low yields. The high electronegativity and steric bulk of fluorine atoms might hinder effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a ketone group in a non-aromatic structure, especially when not accompanied by other functional groups that can enhance interaction (e.g., 4-oxoheptanedioic acid), generally lead to low yields. The ketone group might not provide beneficial interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a methoxy group on an aromatic ring, particularly when combined with other electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), are associated with high yields. Methoxy groups can donate electron density, potentially stabilizing the transition state.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain, especially when lacking polar or aromatic groups (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The aliphatic chain may not interact effectively with the catalyst or could cause steric hindrance.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure, particularly when the structure is substituted with electron-donating groups (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid), tend to result in high yields. The benzofuran structure might enhance π-π stacking or other favorable interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a long aliphatic chain, particularly when not combined with other polar or aromatic groups (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The hydroxyl group may not sufficiently compensate for the lack of interaction from the long chain.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with an acetamido group in combination with an amino acid structure, especially when the acetamido group is bulky or in a position that causes steric hindrance (e.g., (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The acetamido group may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorable interactions.

** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: Rule 1's SMARTS pattern `['[NX3H2,NX4H3;!$([N][!C])][CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])']` does not accurately capture the structural description of amino acids with a secondary amino group and a carboxylic acid group. Consider using a SMARTS pattern that specifically identifies secondary amines and carboxylic acid groups in amino acid structures.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Rule 2's SMARTS pattern `['[c][CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])[OX2H]']` should be revised to ensure it captures phenyl groups directly attached to carboxylic acid or hydroxyl groups with electron-donating groups. The current pattern may not fully capture the presence of electron-donating groups.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: Rule 3's SMARTS pattern `['[OX2H][CX4;!$(C(O)(O)[!#6])][OX2]']` should be adjusted to better identify sugar-like structures with multiple hydroxyl groups. The current pattern may not fully capture the complexity of sugar-like structures.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Rule 4's SMARTS pattern `['[SX2H;$([SX2H][CX4;!$(C([SX2H])~[O,S,#7,#15])])]']` should be revised to ensure it captures sulfur-containing groups like thiol or sulfanyl, especially when combined with polar or aromatic groups.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: Rule 5's SMARTS pattern `['[n][c][CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])']` should be revised to ensure it captures pyridine rings with electron-donating groups. The current pattern may not fully capture the presence of electron-donating groups on pyridine rings.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Rule 6's SMARTS pattern `['[c][NX3+](=O)-[OX-]']` should be revised to ensure it captures electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro groups on an aromatic ring. The current pattern may not fully capture the presence of nitro groups.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: Rule 7's SMARTS pattern `['[c][CX3H]=[OX1]']` should be revised to ensure it captures formyl groups attached to aromatic rings, especially when not combined with other electron-donating groups.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Rule 8's SMARTS pattern `['[CX4](F)(F)F']` should be revised to ensure it captures fluorinated alkyl chains, particularly when the chain is long or heavily fluorinated.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: Rule 9's SMARTS pattern `['[CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])[#6]']` should be revised to ensure it captures ketone groups in non-aromatic structures, especially when not accompanied by other functional groups.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Rule 10's SMARTS pattern `['[c][OX2][c]']` should be revised to ensure it captures methoxy groups on aromatic rings, particularly when combined with other electron-donating groups.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: Rule 11's SMARTS pattern `['[CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4]']` should be revised to ensure it captures long aliphatic chains, especially when lacking polar or aromatic groups.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: Rule 12's SMARTS pattern `['[o][c]1[c][c][c][c][c]1']` should be revised to ensure it captures benzofuran structures, particularly when substituted with electron-donating groups.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: Rule 13's SMARTS pattern `['[NX3H2,NX4H3;!$([N][!C])][CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])']` should be revised to ensure it captures cyclic structures with a carboxylic acid group and a secondary amine.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: Rule 14's SMARTS pattern `['[CX4][OX2H]']` should be revised to ensure it captures hydroxyl groups on long aliphatic chains, particularly when not combined with other polar or aromatic groups.

- ** Suggestion 15 **: Rule 15's SMARTS pattern `['[NX3H2,NX4H3;!$([N][!C])][CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])[CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])']` should be revised to ensure it captures acetamido groups in combination with amino acid structures, especially when the acetamido group is bulky or causes steric hindrance.

Metric Commenter Message:
Based on the current rule metrics and the reference metrics provided, here are some observations and comments on the performance of the current rules:

1. **Confidence**: The current train confidence is 0.610, which is an improvement over some of the previous rules, such as the one with a confidence of 0.498. However, it is slightly lower than the highest confidence observed in the current iteration (0.671). This indicates that while the current rules are relatively reliable in predicting outcomes, there is still room for improvement to increase the confidence level further.

2. **Lift**: The current train lift is 1.221, which is a positive indicator as it is greater than 1. This suggests that the rules are providing useful information beyond what would be expected by chance. The lift is higher than some previous rules (e.g., 1.002 and 0.981), indicating that the current rules are more effective in identifying associations that are not merely coincidental. However, it is slightly lower than the highest lift observed in the current iteration (1.332), suggesting potential for further enhancement.

3. **Leverage**: The current train leverage is 0.004, which is positive, indicating that the rules are capturing associations that are stronger than what would be expected by chance. This is an improvement over some previous rules with negative leverage values, which indicated weaker associations. However, the leverage is relatively low, suggesting that while the rules are beneficial, they might not be capturing very strong associations.

4. **Support**: The current train support is 0.061, which is moderate. It indicates that the rules apply to a reasonable portion of the dataset, but there might be opportunities to increase the support by refining the rules to cover more instances.

**Suggestions for Improvement**:
- **Refine Rule Conditions**: Consider refining the conditions of the rules to increase both confidence and lift. This could involve identifying additional or alternative functional groups or structural features that have a stronger association with high yields.
  
- **Explore Combinations**: Investigate combinations of modifiers that might lead to higher yields. This could involve looking at interactions between different functional groups or structural motifs.

- **Increase Coverage**: Aim to increase the support by identifying rules that apply to a larger portion of the dataset without sacrificing confidence and lift. This might involve generalizing some rules or identifying common features among high-yield modifiers.

- **Iterative Testing**: Continue iterating on the rules, testing new hypotheses, and validating them against the dataset to ensure that improvements in metrics are consistent and not due to overfitting.

Overall, while the current rules show promise, there is potential for further refinement to enhance their predictive power and applicability.

### Performance Evaluation of Current Rules

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
   - The current rules have shown varying levels of effectiveness across different iterations. The validation accuracy has fluctuated between 0.6 and 0.7428571428571429, indicating that the rules are not consistently effective. The latest validation accuracy of 0.6571428571428571 suggests that there is room for improvement.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting:**
   - The fluctuations in validation accuracy suggest potential overfitting or underfitting issues. The model may be overfitting to specific features captured by the rules, as indicated by the high SHAP values for certain rules, leading to discrepancies between predicted and experimental values.

3. **Discrepancies Analysis:**
   - For molecules where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low, rules with high positive SHAP values (e.g., Rule 7, Rule 8, Rule 11) may be problematic. Conversely, for molecules where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, rules with high negative SHAP values (e.g., Rule 14) may need adjustment.

4. **Accuracy Improvements:**
   - The accuracy metrics suggest that there is potential for improvement. The current rules have not yet reached a local minimum, as indicated by the fluctuating validation accuracies. Iterative refinement of the rules is necessary to achieve more consistent and higher accuracy.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**
   - SHAP analysis indicates that certain rules (e.g., Rule 7, Rule 8, Rule 11, Rule 14) have a significant impact on the predictions. These rules may need to be refined to better capture the underlying chemistry and interactions that lead to high or low loadings.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Overestimated Loadings:**
   - Rules with high positive SHAP values for overestimated loadings, such as Rule 7 (formyl group on aromatic ring) and Rule 8 (fluorinated alkyl chains), should be revisited. Consider incorporating additional conditions or modifying the rule to account for potential deactivating effects or steric hindrance.

2. **Adjust Underestimated Loadings:**
   - Rules with high negative SHAP values for underestimated loadings, such as Rule 14 (hydroxyl group on long aliphatic chain), should be adjusted. Explore the possibility of adding conditions that account for the potential compensatory effects of other functional groups.

3. **Improve Generalization:**
   - To address overfitting or underfitting, consider simplifying complex rules or combining similar rules to reduce model complexity. This can help improve generalization and reduce the impact of noise in the data.

4. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - Use insights from SHAP analysis to iteratively refine the rules. Focus on rules with the most significant SHAP values and explore alternative formulations or additional conditions that better capture the interactions leading to high or low loadings.

5. **Evaluate Rule Effectiveness:**
   - Continuously evaluate the effectiveness of the refined rules through additional iterations and validation. Monitor changes in validation accuracy and SHAP values to ensure that the rules are moving towards a more accurate and generalizable model.

### Possibility for Further Optimization

There is a possibility for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. The current metrics and SHAP analysis suggest that refining the rules can lead to improved accuracy and generalization. By addressing the identified discrepancies and focusing on rules with significant SHAP values, the model can be optimized to better capture the underlying chemistry and interactions.

    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with a carboxylic acid group, particularly when the amino group is in a secondary position and the side chain is short or contains additional functional groups like hydroxyl or phenyl (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid), tend to result in a high yield. These configurations may enhance coordination with the metal centers in the catalyst and improve solubility.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid or a hydroxyl group, especially when additional electron-donating groups are present (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid), generally lead to a high yield. The aromatic ring can provide stability and facilitate π-π interactions or hydrogen bonding.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure or when combined with other polar groups (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), are associated with high yields. These groups may enhance solubility and increase the interaction surface with the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group, such as thiol or sulfanyl, particularly when combined with other polar or aromatic groups (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid), tend to result in a high yield. Sulfur groups can form strong interactions with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring, especially when the pyridine is substituted with electron-donating groups (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid), often lead to high yields. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro groups on an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid) can lead to high yields. These groups may influence the electronic environment of the catalyst favorably.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a formyl group attached to an aromatic ring, especially when not combined with other electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The formyl group may deactivate the aromatic ring or interact unfavorably with the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains, particularly when the chain is long or heavily fluorinated (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), are associated with low yields. The high electronegativity and steric bulk of fluorine atoms might hinder effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a ketone group in a non-aromatic structure, especially when not accompanied by other functional groups that can enhance interaction (e.g., 4-oxoheptanedioic acid), generally lead to low yields. The ketone group might not provide beneficial interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a methoxy group on an aromatic ring, particularly when combined with other electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), are associated with high yields. Methoxy groups can donate electron density, potentially stabilizing the transition state.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain, especially when lacking polar or aromatic groups (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The aliphatic chain may not interact effectively with the catalyst or could cause steric hindrance.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure, particularly when the structure is substituted with electron-donating groups (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid), tend to result in high yields. The benzofuran structure might enhance π-π stacking or other favorable interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a secondary amine in a cyclic structure, especially when the cycle is small and rigid (e.g., 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid), are associated with high yields. The cyclic structure can provide rigidity and facilitate specific interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a long aliphatic chain, particularly when not combined with other polar or aromatic groups (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The hydroxyl group may not sufficiently compensate for the lack of interaction from the long chain.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with an acetamido group in combination with an amino acid structure, especially when the acetamido group is bulky or in a position that causes steric hindrance (e.g., (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid), tend to result in low yields. The acetamido group may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorable interactions.
