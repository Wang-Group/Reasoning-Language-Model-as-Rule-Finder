**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both a carboxylic acid group (COOH) and an amino group (NH2) in close proximity, without significant steric hindrance, tend to result in a high yield. This rule covers compounds like (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid and (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group (C6H5) and a hydroxyl group (OH) para to each other tend to result in a high yield. This rule includes compounds such as 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a sulfanyl group (SH) and a carboxylic acid group (COOH) tend to result in a high yield. This rule covers compounds like 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and an adjacent carboxylic acid group tend to result in a high yield. This rule includes compounds such as pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with an indole structure, particularly with electron-donating groups such as methoxy (OCH3) or amino (NH2) on the indole ring, specifically at the 3-position, tend to result in a high yield. This rule includes compounds like (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing a nitro group (NO2) in combination with electron-donating groups (e.g., methoxy, amino) in ortho or para positions tend to result in a high yield. This rule includes compounds like 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a benzoic acid structure and additional electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., bromine or nitro) tend to result in a high yield. This rule includes compounds like 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a highly fluorinated alkyl chain (more than four fluorine atoms) tend to result in a low yield. This rule covers compounds like 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (e.g., -O-CH2-CH2-O-) and a total chain length of more than three ether units tend to result in a low yield. This rule includes compounds such as 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing both amino (NH2) and hydroxyl (OH) groups in a linear chain tend to result in a low yield. This rule covers compounds like 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a linear aliphatic chain longer than six carbons and an amino group at the terminal position, without branching, tend to result in a low yield. This rule covers compounds like 7-aminoheptanoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers containing a formyl group (CHO) and an electron-withdrawing group (e.g., nitro, halogen) in ortho or para positions tend to result in a low yield. This refined rule accounts for compounds like 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid and 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a benzofuranone structure tend to result in a high yield. This rule includes compounds like 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and a phenyl group attached in a non-conjugated manner tend to result in a low yield. This rule includes compounds like 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group (COOH) and a formyl group (CHO) on a benzene ring, particularly in the para position, with no additional electron-donating groups, tend to result in a low yield. This rule includes compounds like 4-formylbenzoic acid.
