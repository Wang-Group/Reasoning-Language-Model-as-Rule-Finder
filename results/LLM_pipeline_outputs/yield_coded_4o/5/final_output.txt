    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with an additional carboxylic acid group (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid) tend to result in high yield. This is likely due to the dual functionality of amino and carboxylic acid groups enhancing coordination with the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a benzene ring substituted with a hydroxyl group and a carboxylic acid group (e.g., 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid) tend to result in high yield. The presence of both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups may stabilize the catalyst complex.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and a carboxylic acid group (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers containing a sulfanyl group (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) tend to result in high yield. The thiol group may provide strong binding to the metal center, enhancing the catalytic activity.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a benzoic acid structure substituted with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid) tend to result in high yield. These groups can enhance the electrophilic character of the metal center.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a benzoic acid structure substituted with electron-donating groups such as methoxy (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The electron-donating groups may reduce the electrophilic character of the metal center, hindering the reaction.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a high degree of fluorination (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing nature of fluorine may destabilize the metal complex.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a linear aliphatic chain and a terminal carboxylic acid group (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The lack of additional functional groups may lead to weaker interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing a formyl group (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The formyl group may interfere with the coordination environment of the metal center.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a combination of an amino group and a phenyl group (e.g., (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The steric hindrance from the phenyl group may affect the coordination to the metal center.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a high degree of fluorination, especially when combined with linear aliphatic chains (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), tend to result in low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing nature of fluorine, along with the lack of additional functional groups, may destabilize the metal complex.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a linear aliphatic chain and a terminal carboxylic acid group (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The lack of additional functional groups may lead to weaker interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing a formyl group in conjunction with a benzene ring (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The formyl group may interfere with the coordination environment of the metal center, especially when not balanced by other stabilizing groups.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and additional electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The increased electron-withdrawing nature may destabilize the metal complex.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on a linear aliphatic chain (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid) tend to result in high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups can enhance coordination and stabilize the metal complex.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a benzene ring and a sulfanyl group (e.g., 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The sulfanyl group may interfere with the coordination environment when combined with a benzene ring.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a benzene ring and a formyl group, but lacking additional stabilizing groups (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid), tend to result in low yield. The formyl group may disrupt the coordination environment.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and a hydroxyl group (e.g., 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. The combination of pyridine nitrogen and hydroxyl group may enhance coordination with the metal center.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with an additional carboxylic acid group (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid) tend to result in high yield. This is likely due to the dual functionality of amino and carboxylic acid groups enhancing coordination with the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a benzene ring substituted with a hydroxyl group and a carboxylic acid group (e.g., 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid) tend to result in high yield. The presence of both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups may stabilize the catalyst complex.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and a carboxylic acid group (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers containing a sulfanyl group (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) tend to result in high yield. The thiol group may provide strong binding to the metal center, enhancing the catalytic activity.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a benzoic acid structure substituted with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid) tend to result in high yield. These groups can enhance the electrophilic character of the metal center.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a linear aliphatic chain and a terminal carboxylic acid group, especially those with additional polar groups like hydroxyl (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid), tend to result in low yield. The lack of complex functional groups may lead to weaker interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a high degree of fluorination, especially when combined with linear aliphatic chains (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), tend to result in low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing nature of fluorine, along with the lack of additional functional groups, may destabilize the metal complex.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a benzene ring and a formyl group, but lacking additional stabilizing groups (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid), tend to result in low yield. The formyl group may disrupt the coordination environment.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and additional electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The increased electron-withdrawing nature may destabilize the metal complex.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on a linear aliphatic chain (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid) tend to result in high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups can enhance coordination and stabilize the metal complex.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and a hydroxyl group (e.g., 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. The combination of pyridine nitrogen and hydroxyl group may enhance coordination with the metal center.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a benzene ring and a sulfanyl group, when not balanced by other stabilizing groups (e.g., 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid), tend to result in low yield. The sulfanyl group may interfere with the coordination environment.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with branched aliphatic chains containing amino and carboxylic acid groups (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The steric hindrance from branching may affect the coordination to the metal center.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a combination of an amino group and a phenyl group (e.g., (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The steric hindrance from the phenyl group may affect the coordination to the metal center.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a benzene ring and electron-donating groups such as methoxy (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The electron-donating groups may reduce the electrophilic character of the metal center, hindering the reaction.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with an additional carboxylic acid group (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid) tend to result in high yield. This is likely due to the dual functionality of amino and carboxylic acid groups enhancing coordination with the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a benzene ring substituted with a hydroxyl group and a carboxylic acid group (e.g., 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid) tend to result in high yield. The presence of both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups may stabilize the catalyst complex.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and a carboxylic acid group (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers containing a sulfanyl group (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) tend to result in high yield. The thiol group may provide strong binding to the metal center, enhancing the catalytic activity.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a benzoic acid structure substituted with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid) tend to result in high yield. These groups can enhance the electrophilic character of the metal center.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a linear aliphatic chain and a terminal carboxylic acid group, especially those with additional polar groups like hydroxyl (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid), tend to result in low yield. The lack of complex functional groups may lead to weaker interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a high degree of fluorination, especially when combined with linear aliphatic chains (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), tend to result in low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing nature of fluorine, along with the lack of additional functional groups, may destabilize the metal complex.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a benzene ring and a formyl group, but lacking additional stabilizing groups (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid), tend to result in low yield. The formyl group may disrupt the coordination environment.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and additional electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The increased electron-withdrawing nature may destabilize the metal complex.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on a linear aliphatic chain (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid) tend to result in high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups can enhance coordination and stabilize the metal complex.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and a hydroxyl group (e.g., 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. The combination of pyridine nitrogen and hydroxyl group may enhance coordination with the metal center.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a benzene ring and a sulfanyl group, when not balanced by other stabilizing groups (e.g., 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid), tend to result in low yield. The sulfanyl group may interfere with the coordination environment.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with branched aliphatic chains containing amino and carboxylic acid groups (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The steric hindrance from branching may affect the coordination to the metal center.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a combination of an amino group and a phenyl group (e.g., (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The steric hindrance from the phenyl group may affect the coordination to the metal center.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a benzene ring and electron-donating groups such as methoxy (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The electron-donating groups may reduce the electrophilic character of the metal center, hindering the reaction.
