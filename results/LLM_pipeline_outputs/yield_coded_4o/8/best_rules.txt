**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both an amino group (-NH2) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) tend to result in a high yield. This is observed in compounds like (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid and 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group (-SH) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) tend to result in a high yield. This is seen in compounds like 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring without additional electron-donating groups tend to result in a low yield. This is observed in compounds like 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid. However, if an amino group is present, as in pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, the yield is high.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a nitro group (-NO2) tend to result in a high yield. This is seen in compounds like 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing a formyl group (-CHO) tend to result in a low yield. This is observed in compounds like 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid and 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) tend to result in a high yield. This is seen in compounds like (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a benzene ring and a methoxy group (-OCH3) tend to result in a low yield. This is observed in compounds like 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a fluorinated alkyl chain tend to result in a low yield. This is seen in compounds like 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with an indole group tend to result in a high yield. This is observed in compounds like (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a simple alkyl chain and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a low yield. This is seen in compounds like octanoic acid and 7-aminoheptanoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers containing a benzene ring with a sulfanyl group (-SH) tend to result in a low yield. This is observed in compounds like 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a benzene ring and an acetamido group (-NHCOCH3) tend to result in a low yield. This is seen in compounds like (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a benzene ring and a hydroxyl group (-OH) tend to result in a low yield unless additional electron-withdrawing groups are present. This is observed in compounds like 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid.
