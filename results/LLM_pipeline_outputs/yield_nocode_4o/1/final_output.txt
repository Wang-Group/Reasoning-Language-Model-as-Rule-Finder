    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an aromatic carboxylic acid group with additional electron-donating groups such as amino or hydroxyl groups tend to result in a high yield. These groups can stabilize intermediates or transition states through resonance and hydrogen bonding. Examples include 4-aminobenzoic acid and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with amino acids or derivatives, especially those with aromatic side chains or additional functional groups like indole, tend to result in a high yield. These groups can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid and (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a sulfanyl group (thiol) tend to result in a high yield. Thiol groups can interact strongly with metal centers, potentially enhancing catalyst stability or activity. Examples include 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups, such as polyols, tend to result in a high yield. These groups can form hydrogen bonds and coordinate with metal centers, potentially stabilizing the catalyst. An example is (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro groups on an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. These groups can stabilize negative charges in transition states. An example is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with long aliphatic chains without additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. This may be due to a lack of specific interactions with the catalyst. Examples include octanoic acid and 7-aminoheptanoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with ether linkages and no additional coordinating groups tend to result in a low yield. This could be due to limited interaction with the catalyst. An example is 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a high degree of fluorination tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of fluorine may destabilize intermediates or transition states. An example is 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with ketone groups on an aliphatic chain tend to result in a low yield. The ketone group may not interact effectively with the catalyst. An example is 4-oxoheptanedioic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with pyridine rings without additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The pyridine nitrogen may not coordinate effectively with the catalyst in the absence of other groups. An example is 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with formyl groups on an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield. The formyl group may not provide sufficient stabilization or interaction with the catalyst. Examples include 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with both aromatic and aliphatic carboxylic acid groups, especially when combined with electron-donating groups, tend to result in a high yield. These combinations can enhance resonance stabilization and metal coordination. An example is 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a combination of aromatic rings and sulfanyl groups tend to result in a high yield. The aromatic ring can provide resonance stabilization, while the sulfanyl group enhances metal interaction. An example is 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an aromatic carboxylic acid group with additional electron-donating groups such as amino or hydroxyl groups tend to result in a high yield. These groups can stabilize intermediates or transition states through resonance and hydrogen bonding. Examples include 4-aminobenzoic acid and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with amino acids or derivatives, especially those with aromatic side chains or additional functional groups like indole, tend to result in a high yield. These groups can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid and (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a sulfanyl group (thiol) tend to result in a high yield. Thiol groups can interact strongly with metal centers, potentially enhancing catalyst stability or activity. Examples include 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups, such as polyols, tend to result in a high yield. These groups can form hydrogen bonds and coordinate with metal centers, potentially stabilizing the catalyst. An example is (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro groups on an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. These groups can stabilize negative charges in transition states. An example is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with long aliphatic chains without additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. This may be due to a lack of specific interactions with the catalyst. Examples include octanoic acid and 7-aminoheptanoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with ether linkages and no additional coordinating groups tend to result in a low yield. This could be due to limited interaction with the catalyst. An example is 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a high degree of fluorination tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of fluorine may destabilize intermediates or transition states. An example is 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with ketone groups on an aliphatic chain tend to result in a low yield. The ketone group may not interact effectively with the catalyst. An example is 4-oxoheptanedioic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with pyridine rings without additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The pyridine nitrogen may not coordinate effectively with the catalyst in the absence of other groups. An example is 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with formyl groups on an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield. The formyl group may not provide sufficient stabilization or interaction with the catalyst. Examples include 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with both aromatic and aliphatic carboxylic acid groups, especially when combined with electron-donating groups, tend to result in a high yield. These combinations can enhance resonance stabilization and metal coordination. An example is 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a combination of aromatic rings and sulfanyl groups tend to result in a high yield. The aromatic ring can provide resonance stabilization, while the sulfanyl group enhances metal interaction. An example is 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and an additional carboxylic acid group tend to result in a high yield. The pyridine nitrogen can coordinate with the metal center, while the carboxylic acid group can stabilize intermediates. An example is pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure and additional carboxylic acid groups tend to result in a high yield. The benzofuran can provide aromatic stabilization, while the carboxylic acid groups enhance metal coordination. An example is 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid.

    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an aromatic carboxylic acid group with additional electron-donating groups such as amino or hydroxyl groups tend to result in a high yield. These groups can stabilize intermediates or transition states through resonance and hydrogen bonding. Examples include 4-aminobenzoic acid and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with amino acids or derivatives, especially those with aromatic side chains or additional functional groups like indole, tend to result in a high yield. These groups can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid and (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a sulfanyl group (thiol) tend to result in a high yield. Thiol groups can interact strongly with metal centers, potentially enhancing catalyst stability or activity. Examples include 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups, such as polyols, tend to result in a high yield. These groups can form hydrogen bonds and coordinate with metal centers, potentially stabilizing the catalyst. An example is (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro groups on an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. These groups can stabilize negative charges in transition states. An example is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with long aliphatic chains without additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. This may be due to a lack of specific interactions with the catalyst. Examples include octanoic acid and 7-aminoheptanoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with ether linkages and no additional coordinating groups tend to result in a low yield. This could be due to limited interaction with the catalyst. An example is 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a high degree of fluorination tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of fluorine may destabilize intermediates or transition states. An example is 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with ketone groups on an aliphatic chain tend to result in a low yield. The ketone group may not interact effectively with the catalyst. An example is 4-oxoheptanedioic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with pyridine rings without additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The pyridine nitrogen may not coordinate effectively with the catalyst in the absence of other groups. An example is 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with formyl groups on an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield. The formyl group may not provide sufficient stabilization or interaction with the catalyst. Examples include 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with both aromatic and aliphatic carboxylic acid groups, especially when combined with electron-donating groups, tend to result in a high yield. These combinations can enhance resonance stabilization and metal coordination. An example is 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a combination of aromatic rings and sulfanyl groups tend to result in a high yield. The aromatic ring can provide resonance stabilization, while the sulfanyl group enhances metal interaction. An example is 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and an additional carboxylic acid group tend to result in a high yield. The pyridine nitrogen can coordinate with the metal center, while the carboxylic acid group can stabilize intermediates. An example is pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure and additional carboxylic acid groups tend to result in a high yield. The benzofuran can provide aromatic stabilization, while the carboxylic acid groups enhance metal coordination. An example is 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an aromatic carboxylic acid group with ortho or para-positioned amino groups tend to result in a high yield. These positions allow for effective resonance stabilization and hydrogen bonding. Examples include 4-aminobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with amino acids or derivatives that have aromatic side chains, such as phenyl or indole groups, tend to result in a high yield. These structures can coordinate with metal centers and enhance catalytic activity. Examples include (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid and (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups in close proximity, such as vicinal diols or polyols, tend to result in a high yield. These groups can form strong hydrogen bonds and coordinate with metal centers, stabilizing the catalyst. An example is (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro groups on an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. These groups stabilize negative charges in transition states. An example is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with long aliphatic chains without additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. This may be due to a lack of specific interactions with the catalyst. Examples include octanoic acid and 7-aminoheptanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with ether linkages and no additional coordinating groups tend to result in a low yield. This could be due to limited interaction with the catalyst. An example is 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a high degree of fluorination tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of fluorine may destabilize intermediates or transition states. An example is 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with ketone groups on an aliphatic chain tend to result in a low yield. The ketone group may not interact effectively with the catalyst. An example is 4-oxoheptanedioic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with pyridine rings without additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The pyridine nitrogen may not coordinate effectively with the catalyst in the absence of other groups. An example is 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with formyl groups on an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield. The formyl group may not provide sufficient stabilization or interaction with the catalyst. Examples include 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a combination of aromatic rings and sulfanyl groups tend to result in a high yield. The aromatic ring can provide resonance stabilization, while the sulfanyl group enhances metal interaction. An example is 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and an additional carboxylic acid group tend to result in a high yield. The pyridine nitrogen can coordinate with the metal center, while the carboxylic acid group can stabilize intermediates. An example is pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure and additional carboxylic acid groups tend to result in a high yield. The benzofuran can provide aromatic stabilization, while the carboxylic acid groups enhance metal coordination. An example is 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a combination of electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups on an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. This combination can create a balance that stabilizes transition states. An example is 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring and a hydroxyl group in the para position tend to result in a high yield. The hydroxyl group can enhance metal coordination and stabilize intermediates. An example is 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.
