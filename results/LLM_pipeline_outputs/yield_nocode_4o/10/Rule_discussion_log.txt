- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group (e.g., benzoic acid derivatives) tend to result in high yield. This is likely due to the ability of the carboxylic acid group to coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with amino acids or amino acid derivatives, particularly those with aromatic side chains (e.g., (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid), tend to result in high yield. The presence of both amino and carboxylic acid groups can facilitate strong interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring, especially when combined with a carboxylic acid group (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid), are associated with high yield. The pyridine nitrogen can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl (thiol) group (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) tend to result in high yield. The thiol group can form strong bonds with metal centers, potentially stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing multiple methoxy groups (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid) tend to result in low yield. The steric hindrance and electron-donating nature of methoxy groups may interfere with effective catalyst coordination.

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both carboxylic acid and amino groups, especially when they can form stable chelate complexes (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid), tend to result in high yield. The spatial arrangement allowing for chelation enhances coordination with the metal center, improving catalyst stability and reactivity.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with pyridine rings, particularly when paired with a carboxylic acid group (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid), are associated with high yield. The pyridine nitrogen can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing aromatic heterocycles such as indole (e.g., (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid) tend to result in high yield. The aromatic system can enhance π-π interactions with the catalyst, improving its stability and reactivity.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with hydroxyphenyl groups (e.g., 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid) tend to result in high yield. The phenolic OH group can participate in hydrogen bonding, potentially stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with sulfanyl (thiol) groups (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) tend to result in high yield. The thiol group can form strong bonds with metal centers, potentially stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with formyl groups (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid) tend to result in low yield unless they are combined with adjacent electron-donating groups or specific aromatic systems that can stabilize the catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with trifluoromethyl groups (e.g., 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of trifluoromethyl groups can negatively impact catalyst performance, but this effect can be lessened if the modifier also contains strong electron-donating groups.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with long aliphatic chains (e.g., octanoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The hydrophobic nature and steric bulk of long chains can hinder effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic systems (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid) can result in high yield due to enhanced π-π interactions with the catalyst, despite the presence of electron-withdrawing groups like nitro.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with both hydroxy and carboxylic acid groups on an aromatic ring (e.g., salicylic acid derivatives) tend to result in low yield unless there are additional stabilizing interactions, such as hydrogen bonding or π-π stacking, with the catalyst.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with amino groups on aliphatic chains (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The lack of aromatic or electron-withdrawing groups can lead to poor coordination with the metal center.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with multiple electron-withdrawing groups, such as nitro and trifluoromethyl, tend to result in low yield unless counteracted by strong electron-donating groups or specific structural features that enhance catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with methoxy groups adjacent to electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., methoxybenzoic acids) can result in higher yields compared to those without such adjacent groups. The electron-withdrawing groups can mitigate the steric hindrance and electron-donating effects of methoxy groups.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with benzofuran carboxylic acid structures (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. The benzofuran structure can facilitate π-π stacking and stabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with acetamido groups adjacent to amino acids (e.g., (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The presence of both acetamido and amino groups can lead to steric hindrance and reduced coordination with the metal center.

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both carboxylic acid and amino groups, especially when they can form stable chelate complexes (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid), tend to result in high yield. The spatial arrangement allowing for chelation enhances coordination with the metal center, improving catalyst stability and reactivity.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with pyridine rings, particularly when paired with a carboxylic acid group (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid), are associated with high yield. The pyridine nitrogen can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity. Additional stabilizing interactions such as hydrogen bonding can further enhance yield.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with hydroxyphenyl groups (e.g., 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid) tend to result in high yield. The phenolic OH group can participate in hydrogen bonding, potentially stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with sulfanyl (thiol) groups (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) tend to result in high yield. The thiol group can form strong bonds with metal centers, potentially stabilizing the catalyst. Consideration of additional stabilizing interactions such as π-π stacking can enhance this effect.
