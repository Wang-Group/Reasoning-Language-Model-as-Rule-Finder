**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with a carboxylic acid group and an additional hydroxyl group (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid) tend to result in high yield. The combination of these groups enhances coordination and stabilization of the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid and a hydroxyl or amino substituent on the phenyl ring (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid) generally lead to high yield. These substituents enhance π-π interactions and electron donation.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with additional electron-donating groups (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. The pyridine nitrogen and electron-donating groups enhance coordination with the metal center.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on a short carbon chain (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid) are associated with high yield. The hydroxyl groups form hydrogen bonds, stabilizing the catalyst structure.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with sulfur groups without additional stabilizing groups (e.g., 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid) tend to result in low yield. Sulfur can lead to deactivation of the catalyst through strong binding or poisoning.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with formyl groups on aromatic rings without additional electron-donating groups (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The formyl group acts as an electron-withdrawing group, destabilizing the catalyst complex.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with nitro groups on aromatic rings (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid) tend to result in high yield. The nitro group can participate in electron transfer processes, enhancing the catalytic cycle.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with alkyl chains longer than six carbons and without compensating functional groups (e.g., octanoic acid) generally lead to low yield. Longer alkyl chains cause steric hindrance, reducing catalyst efficiency.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with methoxy groups on aromatic rings and additional electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid) tend to result in high yield. Methoxy groups donate electron density, stabilizing the catalyst complex.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with benzofuran or similar heterocyclic structures and additional electron-donating groups (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. These structures provide π-π interactions and electronic stabilization.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with acetamido groups and additional steric hindrance (e.g., (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The acetamido group introduces steric hindrance, reducing effective coordination with the metal center.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as trifluoromethyl without additional stabilizing interactions (e.g., 2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl) tend to result in low yield. These groups decrease electron density, reducing coordination with the metal center.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with hydroxyl groups on long alkyl chains without additional stabilizing groups (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The hydroxyl group may not provide sufficient stabilization when distanced by a long alkyl chain.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a combination of a carboxylic acid group and a pyridine ring without additional electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The lack of additional electron-donating groups limits effective coordination.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a benzene ring containing both electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid) tend to result in high yield. The balance of these groups can stabilize the catalyst through resonance and inductive effects.
