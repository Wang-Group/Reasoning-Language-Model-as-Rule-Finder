- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group (COOH) and an amino group (NH2) tend to result in a high yield. This is likely due to the ability of these groups to coordinate with metal centers, enhancing the catalytic activity. Examples include (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid and (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid group (e.g., benzoic acid derivatives) tend to result in a high yield if they also contain additional functional groups like amino or hydroxy groups. This suggests that additional functional groups may enhance the interaction with the catalyst. Examples include 4-aminobenzoic acid and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group (SH) tend to result in a low yield unless they are part of a larger aromatic system. This could be due to the potential for sulfanyl groups to poison the catalyst. Examples of low yield include 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid and 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers containing multiple ether linkages (e.g., methoxyethoxy) tend to result in a low yield. This may be due to steric hindrance or poor coordination with the metal center. An example is 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a formyl group (CHO) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield. This could be due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the formyl group, which may destabilize the interaction with the catalyst. Examples include 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid and 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains tend to result in a low yield. The presence of fluorine may alter the electronic properties of the modifier, reducing its effectiveness. An example is 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring tend to result in a high yield, likely due to the nitrogen atom's ability to coordinate with metal centers. Examples include pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with an indole group tend to result in a high yield, possibly due to the aromatic system's ability to stabilize interactions with the catalyst. An example is (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both a carboxylic acid group (COOH) and an amino group (NH2) in close proximity, particularly in a non-aromatic context with a carbon chain length of 3 to 5 atoms, tend to result in a high yield. This configuration enhances coordination with metal centers. Examples include (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid and (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid group that also contain electron-donating groups such as amino (NH2) or hydroxy (OH) groups tend to result in a high yield, unless there are additional electron-withdrawing groups present. These groups increase electron density, enhancing interaction with the catalyst. Examples include 4-aminobenzoic acid and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group (SH) in a non-aromatic context tend to result in a low yield. The potential for sulfanyl groups to poison the catalyst is reduced when they are part of a larger aromatic system. Examples of low yield include 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid and 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a formyl group (CHO) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield, unless the aromatic system is heavily substituted with electron-donating groups that can mitigate the electron-withdrawing effects. Examples include 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid and 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains tend to result in a low yield. The presence of fluorine alters the electronic properties of the modifier, reducing its effectiveness. An example is 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with electron-donating substituents, particularly at the 3 or 4 positions, tend to result in a high yield. The nitrogen atom in pyridine can coordinate with metal centers, and electron-donating groups enhance this interaction. Examples include pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with an indole group tend to result in a high yield due to the aromatic system's ability to stabilize interactions with the catalyst. An example is (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with heterocyclic structures other than pyridine or indole, such as pyrazole, tend to result in a high yield. These structures can provide unique coordination environments for metal centers. An example is 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group (OH) on a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbon atoms) tend to result in a low yield. The increased flexibility and steric hindrance of long chains may reduce effective coordination with the catalyst. An example is 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages, especially in long chains, tend to result in a low yield. This is likely due to steric hindrance and poor coordination with the metal center. An example is 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a nitro group (NO2) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group can enhance the electrophilic character of the aromatic ring, improving interactions with the catalyst. An example is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring substituted with both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups tend to result in a low yield if the electron-withdrawing effects dominate. An example is 4-methylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a tertiary alcohol group in a branched aliphatic chain tend to result in a low yield due to steric hindrance and reduced coordination ability. An example is 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring containing a carboxylic acid group and an additional electron-withdrawing group, such as a trifluoromethyl group, tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature can reduce effective interaction with the catalyst. An example is 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbon atoms) and an amino group tend to result in a low yield. The increased flexibility and steric hindrance of long chains may reduce effective coordination with the catalyst. An example is 8-aminooctanoic acid.

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both a carboxylic acid group (COOH) and an amino group (NH2) in close proximity, particularly in a non-aromatic context with a carbon chain length of 3 to 5 atoms, tend to result in a high yield. This configuration enhances coordination with metal centers. Examples include (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid and (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid group that also contain electron-donating groups such as amino (NH2) or hydroxy (OH) groups tend to result in a high yield, unless there are additional electron-withdrawing groups present. These groups increase electron density, enhancing interaction with the catalyst. Examples include 4-aminobenzoic acid and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group (SH) in a non-aromatic context tend to result in a low yield. The potential for sulfanyl groups to poison the catalyst is reduced when they are part of a larger aromatic system. Examples of low yield include 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid and 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a formyl group (CHO) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield, unless the aromatic system is heavily substituted with electron-donating groups that can mitigate the electron-withdrawing effects. Examples include 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid and 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains tend to result in a low yield. The presence of fluorine alters the electronic properties of the modifier, reducing its effectiveness. An example is 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with electron-donating substituents, particularly at the 3 or 4 positions, tend to result in a high yield. The nitrogen atom in pyridine can coordinate with metal centers, and electron-donating groups enhance this interaction. Examples include pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with an indole group tend to result in a high yield due to the aromatic system's ability to stabilize interactions with the catalyst. An example is (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with heterocyclic structures other than pyridine or indole, such as pyrazole, tend to result in a high yield. These structures can provide unique coordination environments for metal centers. An example is 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group (OH) on a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbon atoms) tend to result in a low yield. The increased flexibility and steric hindrance of long chains may reduce effective coordination with the catalyst. An example is 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages, especially in long chains, tend to result in a low yield. This is likely due to steric hindrance and poor coordination with the metal center. An example is 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a nitro group (NO2) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group can enhance the electrophilic character of the aromatic ring, improving interactions with the catalyst. An example is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring substituted with both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups tend to result in a low yield if the electron-withdrawing effects dominate. An example is 4-methylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a tertiary alcohol group in a branched aliphatic chain tend to result in a low yield due to steric hindrance and reduced coordination ability. An example is 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring containing a carboxylic acid group and an additional electron-withdrawing group, such as a trifluoromethyl group, tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature can reduce effective interaction with the catalyst. An example is 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbon atoms) and an amino group tend to result in a low yield. The increased flexibility and steric hindrance of long chains may reduce effective coordination with the catalyst. An example is 8-aminooctanoic acid.

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both a carboxylic acid group (COOH) and an amino group (NH2) in close proximity, particularly in a non-aromatic context with a carbon chain length of 3 to 5 atoms, tend to result in a high yield. This configuration enhances coordination with metal centers. Examples include (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid and (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid group that also contain electron-donating groups such as amino (NH2) or hydroxy (OH) groups tend to result in a high yield, unless there are additional electron-withdrawing groups present. These groups increase electron density, enhancing interaction with the catalyst. Examples include 4-aminobenzoic acid and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group (SH) in a non-aromatic context tend to result in a low yield. However, exceptions exist, such as 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid, which shows a high yield. This suggests that other structural features or environmental factors may mitigate the sulfanyl group's negative effects.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a formyl group (CHO) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield, unless the aromatic system is heavily substituted with electron-donating groups that can mitigate the electron-withdrawing effects. Examples include 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid and 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains tend to result in a low yield. The presence of fluorine alters the electronic properties of the modifier, reducing its effectiveness. An example is 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with electron-donating substituents, particularly at the 3 or 4 positions, tend to result in a high yield. The nitrogen atom in pyridine can coordinate with metal centers, and electron-donating groups enhance this interaction. Examples include pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with an indole group tend to result in a high yield due to the aromatic system's ability to stabilize interactions with the catalyst. An example is (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages, especially in long chains, tend to result in a low yield. This is likely due to steric hindrance and poor coordination with the metal center. An example is 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a nitro group (NO2) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group can enhance the electrophilic character of the aromatic ring, improving interactions with the catalyst. An example is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring substituted with both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups tend to result in a low yield if the electron-withdrawing effects dominate. An example is 4-methylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a tertiary alcohol group in a branched aliphatic chain tend to result in a low yield due to steric hindrance and reduced coordination ability. An example is 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring containing a carboxylic acid group and an additional electron-withdrawing group, such as a trifluoromethyl group, tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature can reduce effective interaction with the catalyst. An example is 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbon atoms) and an amino group tend to result in a low yield. The increased flexibility and steric hindrance of long chains may reduce effective coordination with the catalyst. An example is 8-aminooctanoic acid.
