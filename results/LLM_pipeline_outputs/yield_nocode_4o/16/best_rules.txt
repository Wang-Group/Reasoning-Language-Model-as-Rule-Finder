**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both an amino group (-NH2) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) generally result in a high yield. This is observed in compounds like (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid and 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group attached to a carboxylic acid group (e.g., benzoic acid derivatives) generally result in a high yield, especially when additional electron-donating groups like hydroxyl (-OH) are present. Examples include 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a sulfur group (e.g., sulfanyl, -SH) in combination with a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a high yield. This is seen in compounds like 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a high yield. An example is pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups (polyols) and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a high yield. An example is (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing a nitro group (-NO2) attached to a phenyl ring with a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a high yield. An example is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to a phenyl ring with a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a low yield. Examples include 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) attached to a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a low yield. An example is 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a methoxy group (-OCH3) attached to an ether chain with a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a low yield. An example is 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbons) with a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a low yield. Examples include octanoic acid and 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a phenyl group attached to a carboxylic acid group and an electron-withdrawing group such as a formyl (-CHO) or trifluoromethyl (-CF3) group tend to result in a low yield. Examples include 4-formylbenzoic acid and 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a phenyl group and a carboxylic acid group, but without additional electron-donating groups, tend to result in a low yield. An example is 4-methylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a long ether chain tend to result in a low yield. An example is 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers containing an amino group (-NH2) and a phenyl group without a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a low yield. An example is (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a high yield. An example is 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid.
