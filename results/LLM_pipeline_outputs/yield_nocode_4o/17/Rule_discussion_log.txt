- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both an amino group (-NH2) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) in a linear, unhindered arrangement tend to result in a high yield. Steric hindrance should be minimal to allow effective interaction with the catalyst. Examples include (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid and 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group attached to a carboxylic acid group (-C6H4-COOH) and additional electron-withdrawing groups (such as -NO2) tend to result in a high yield. This is due to the increased acidity and potential for electron delocalization. An example is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) tend to result in a high yield, especially when these groups are part of a sugar-like structure, which can enhance solubility and interaction with the catalyst. An example is (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group (-SH) tend to result in a high yield, particularly when the sulfanyl group is not adjacent to electron-withdrawing groups, allowing for better nucleophilic interaction. Examples include 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid and 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring tend to result in a high yield when the pyridine is not substituted with electron-withdrawing groups and is positioned para to other electron-donating groups. This enhances the electron density on the ring, facilitating interaction with the catalyst. Examples include pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to a phenyl ring tend to result in a low yield, especially when there are no additional electron-donating groups to stabilize the formyl group. This leads to reduced reactivity. Examples include 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid and 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing ether linkages (e.g., -O-CH2-CH2-O-) tend to result in a low yield, particularly when these linkages are part of long, flexible chains, which may reduce the rigidity needed for effective interaction with the catalyst. An example is 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in a low yield, especially when the trifluoromethyl group is adjacent to a carbonyl group, leading to increased electron-withdrawing effects and reduced nucleophilicity. An example is 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a benzofuranone structure tend to result in a high yield, particularly when the benzofuranone is not substituted with bulky groups, allowing for effective interaction with the catalyst. An example is 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a methyl group attached to a phenyl ring tend to result in a low yield, especially when the methyl group is the only substituent on the phenyl ring, as it does not provide sufficient electron-donating effects. An example is 4-methylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group (-OH) on a long aliphatic chain tend to result in a low yield, as the chain may reduce the effective concentration of the reactive site. An example is 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a combination of amino groups and bulky alkyl chains tend to result in a low yield, as steric hindrance can impede effective interaction with the catalyst. An example is (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers containing a phenyl ring with multiple methoxy groups (-OCH3) tend to result in a low yield, especially when these groups are positioned to create steric hindrance or reduce electron density on the ring. An example is 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group attached to a pyridine ring tend to result in a high yield when the pyridine ring is not substituted with electron-withdrawing groups, allowing for enhanced interaction with the catalyst. An example is pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group attached to a phenyl ring tend to result in a high yield when the hydroxyl group is ortho or para to an electron-donating group, enhancing the electron density and reactivity. An example is 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a benzofuranone structure tend to result in a high yield, particularly when the benzofuranone is not substituted with bulky groups, allowing for effective interaction with the catalyst. An example is 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a methyl group attached to a phenyl ring tend to result in a low yield, especially when the methyl group is the only substituent on the phenyl ring, as it does not provide sufficient electron-donating effects. An example is 4-methylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group (-OH) on a long aliphatic chain tend to result in a low yield, as the chain may reduce the effective concentration of the reactive site. An example is 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a combination of amino groups and bulky alkyl chains tend to result in a low yield, as steric hindrance can impede effective interaction with the catalyst. An example is (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers containing a phenyl ring with multiple methoxy groups (-OCH3) tend to result in a low yield, especially when these groups are positioned to create steric hindrance or reduce electron density on the ring. An example is 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group attached to a pyridine ring tend to result in a high yield when the pyridine ring is not substituted with electron-withdrawing groups, allowing for enhanced interaction with the catalyst. An example is pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group attached to a phenyl ring tend to result in a high yield when the hydroxyl group is ortho or para to an electron-donating group, enhancing the electron density and reactivity. An example is 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both an amino group (-NH2) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) in a linear, unhindered arrangement tend to result in a high yield. This is due to minimal steric hindrance allowing effective interaction with the catalyst. Examples include (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid and 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group attached to a carboxylic acid group (-C6H4-COOH) and additional electron-withdrawing groups (such as -NO2) tend to result in a high yield due to increased acidity and potential for electron delocalization. An example is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) tend to result in a high yield, especially when these groups are part of a sugar-like structure, enhancing solubility and interaction with the catalyst. An example is (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group (-SH) tend to result in a high yield, particularly when the sulfanyl group is not adjacent to electron-withdrawing groups, allowing for better nucleophilic interaction. Examples include 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid and 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring tend to result in a high yield when the pyridine is not substituted with electron-withdrawing groups and is positioned para to other electron-donating groups. This enhances the electron density on the ring, facilitating interaction with the catalyst. Examples include pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to a phenyl ring tend to result in a low yield, especially when there are no additional electron-donating groups to stabilize the formyl group. This leads to reduced reactivity. Examples include 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid and 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing ether linkages (e.g., -O-CH2-CH2-O-) tend to result in a low yield, particularly when these linkages are part of long, flexible chains, which may reduce the rigidity needed for effective interaction with the catalyst. An example is 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in a low yield, especially when the trifluoromethyl group is adjacent to a carbonyl group, leading to increased electron-withdrawing effects and reduced nucleophilicity. An example is 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a benzofuranone structure tend to result in a high yield, particularly when the benzofuranone is not substituted with bulky groups, allowing for effective interaction with the catalyst. An example is 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a methyl group attached to a phenyl ring tend to result in a low yield, especially when the methyl group is the only substituent on the phenyl ring, as it does not provide sufficient electron-donating effects. An example is 4-methylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group (-OH) on a long aliphatic chain tend to result in a low yield, as the chain may reduce the effective concentration of the reactive site. An example is 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a combination of amino groups and bulky alkyl chains tend to result in a low yield, as steric hindrance can impede effective interaction with the catalyst. An example is (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers containing a phenyl ring with multiple methoxy groups (-OCH3) tend to result in a low yield, especially when these groups are positioned to create steric hindrance or reduce electron density on the ring. An example is 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group attached to a pyridine ring tend to result in a high yield when the pyridine ring is not substituted with electron-withdrawing groups, allowing for enhanced interaction with the catalyst. An example is pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group attached to a phenyl ring tend to result in a high yield when the hydroxyl group is ortho or para to an electron-donating group, enhancing the electron density and reactivity. An example is 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both an amino group (-NH2) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) in a linear, unhindered arrangement tend to result in a high yield. This is due to minimal steric hindrance allowing effective interaction with the catalyst. However, if the amino group is adjacent to bulky groups or in a branched structure, the yield may be low. Examples of high yield include (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid and 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group attached to a carboxylic acid group (-C6H4-COOH) and additional electron-withdrawing groups (such as -NO2) tend to result in a high yield due to increased acidity and potential for electron delocalization. If the phenyl group is substituted with bulky groups, the yield may decrease. An example of high yield is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) tend to result in a high yield, especially when these groups are part of a sugar-like structure, enhancing solubility and interaction with the catalyst. However, if hydroxyl groups are positioned to cause steric hindrance, the yield may be low. An example of high yield is (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring tend to result in a high yield when the pyridine is not substituted with electron-withdrawing groups and is positioned para to other electron-donating groups. However, pyridine rings with bulky substituents or adjacent electron-withdrawing groups may not result in high yields. Examples of high yield include pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to a phenyl ring tend to result in a low yield, especially when there are no additional electron-donating groups to stabilize the formyl group. However, if electron-donating groups are present, they can mitigate the negative effects of the formyl group. Examples of low yield include 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid and 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing ether linkages (e.g., -O-CH2-CH2-O-) tend to result in a low yield, particularly when these linkages are part of long, flexible chains, which may reduce the rigidity needed for effective interaction with the catalyst. An example of low yield is 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in a low yield, especially when the trifluoromethyl group is adjacent to a carbonyl group, leading to increased electron-withdrawing effects and reduced nucleophilicity.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a benzofuranone structure tend to result in a high yield, particularly when the benzofuranone is not substituted with bulky groups, allowing for effective interaction with the catalyst. An example of high yield is 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a methyl group attached to a phenyl ring tend to result in a low yield, especially when the methyl group is the only substituent on the phenyl ring, as it does not provide sufficient electron-donating effects. An example of low yield is 4-methylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group (-OH) on a long aliphatic chain tend to result in a low yield, as the chain may reduce the effective concentration of the reactive site. An example of low yield is 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group (-SH) attached to a short aliphatic chain tend to result in a high yield, as the sulfanyl group can enhance the nucleophilicity and reactivity of the modifier. An example of high yield is 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a phenyl ring with multiple methoxy groups (-OCH3) tend to result in a low yield, especially when these groups are positioned to create steric hindrance or reduce electron density on the ring. An example of low yield is 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group attached to a pyridine ring tend to result in a high yield when the pyridine ring is not substituted with electron-withdrawing groups, allowing for enhanced interaction with the catalyst. An example of high yield is pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group attached to a phenyl ring tend to result in a high yield when the hydroxyl group is ortho or para to an electron-donating group, enhancing the electron density and reactivity. An example of high yield is 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both an amino group (-NH2) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) in a linear, unhindered arrangement, without adjacent bulky substituents, tend to result in a high yield. This allows effective interaction with the catalyst. Examples of high yield include (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid and 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group attached to a carboxylic acid group (-C6H4-COOH) and additional electron-withdrawing groups (such as -NO2) tend to result in a high yield due to increased acidity and potential for electron delocalization. An example of high yield is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) tend to result in a high yield, especially when these groups are part of a sugar-like structure, enhancing solubility and interaction with the catalyst. An example of high yield is (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring tend to result in a high yield when the pyridine is not substituted with electron-withdrawing groups, regardless of the position of electron-donating groups, as long as the overall electronic environment enhances interaction with the catalyst. Examples of high yield include pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to a phenyl ring tend to result in a low yield, especially when there are no additional electron-donating groups to stabilize the formyl group. Examples of low yield include 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid and 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing ether linkages (e.g., -O-CH2-CH2-O-) tend to result in a low yield, particularly when these linkages are part of long, flexible chains, which may reduce the rigidity needed for effective interaction with the catalyst. An example of low yield is 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in a low yield, especially when the trifluoromethyl group is adjacent to a carbonyl group, leading to increased electron-withdrawing effects and reduced nucleophilicity. An example of low yield is 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a benzofuranone structure tend to result in a high yield, particularly when the benzofuranone is not substituted with bulky groups, allowing for effective interaction with the catalyst. An example of high yield is 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a methyl group attached to a phenyl ring tend to result in a low yield, especially when the methyl group is the only substituent on the phenyl ring, as it does not provide sufficient electron-donating effects. An example of low yield is 4-methylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group (-OH) on a long aliphatic chain tend to result in a low yield, as the chain may reduce the effective concentration of the reactive site. An example of low yield is 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group (-SH) attached to a short aliphatic chain tend to result in a high yield, as the sulfanyl group can enhance the nucleophilicity and reactivity of the modifier. An example of high yield is 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a phenyl ring with multiple methoxy groups (-OCH3) tend to result in a low yield, especially when these groups are positioned to create steric hindrance or reduce electron density on the ring. An example of low yield is 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group attached to a pyridine ring tend to result in a high yield when the pyridine ring is not substituted with electron-withdrawing groups, allowing for enhanced interaction with the catalyst. An example of high yield is pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group attached to a phenyl ring tend to result in a high yield when the hydroxyl group is ortho or para to an electron-donating group, enhancing the electron density and reactivity. An example of high yield is 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with an indole group tend to result in a high yield, especially when the indole is not substituted with bulky or electron-withdrawing groups, allowing for effective interaction with the catalyst. An example of high yield is (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both an amino group (-NH2) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) in a linear or slightly branched aliphatic chain tend to result in a high yield. This combination enhances interaction with the catalyst due to increased polarity and potential hydrogen bonding. Examples include (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid and 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group attached to a carboxylic acid group (-C6H4-COOH) and additional electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (-NO2) result in a high yield. The electron-withdrawing groups increase acidity and facilitate electron delocalization, enhancing reactivity. An example is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) in a sugar-like structure or with additional polar groups tend to result in a high yield. These structures increase solubility and interaction with the catalyst. An example is (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring result in a high yield when not substituted with strong electron-withdrawing groups. Electron-donating groups enhance interaction with the catalyst. Examples include pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to a phenyl ring tend to result in a low yield, especially without additional electron-donating groups to stabilize the formyl group. Examples include 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid and 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing ether linkages (e.g., -O-CH2-CH2-O-) tend to result in a low yield, particularly when these linkages are part of long, flexible chains, which may reduce the rigidity needed for effective interaction with the catalyst. An example is 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in a low yield, especially when adjacent to a carbonyl group, leading to increased electron-withdrawing effects and reduced nucleophilicity. An example is 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a benzofuranone structure tend to result in a high yield, particularly when the benzofuranone is not substituted with bulky groups, allowing for effective interaction with the catalyst. An example is 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a methyl group attached to a phenyl ring tend to result in a low yield, especially when the methyl group is the only substituent on the phenyl ring, as it does not provide sufficient electron-donating effects. An example is 4-methylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group (-SH) attached to a short aliphatic chain tend to result in a high yield, as the sulfanyl group can enhance the nucleophilicity and reactivity of the modifier. An example is 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group (-OH) on a phenyl ring tend to result in a high yield when the hydroxyl group is ortho or para to an electron-donating group, enhancing the electron density and reactivity. An example is 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with an indole group tend to result in a high yield, especially when the indole is not substituted with bulky or electron-withdrawing groups, allowing for effective interaction with the catalyst. An example is (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a sulfanyl group (-SH) in a short aliphatic chain tend to result in a high yield. The combination of acidic and nucleophilic properties enhances interaction with the catalyst. An example is 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a phenyl ring substituted with a hydroxyl group (-OH) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) tend to result in a high yield, especially when the hydroxyl group is ortho or para to the carboxylic acid group, enhancing electron density and reactivity. An example is 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.
