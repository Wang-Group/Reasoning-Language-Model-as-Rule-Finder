**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both an amino group (-NH2) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) in a linear or slightly branched aliphatic chain tend to result in a high yield. This combination enhances interaction with the catalyst due to increased polarity and potential hydrogen bonding. Examples include (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid and 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group attached to a carboxylic acid group (-C6H4-COOH) and additional electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (-NO2) result in a high yield. The electron-withdrawing groups increase acidity and facilitate electron delocalization, enhancing reactivity. An example is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) in a sugar-like structure or with additional polar groups tend to result in a high yield. These structures increase solubility and interaction with the catalyst. An example is (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring result in a high yield when not substituted with strong electron-withdrawing groups. Electron-donating groups enhance interaction with the catalyst. Examples include pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to a phenyl ring tend to result in a low yield, especially without additional electron-donating groups to stabilize the formyl group. Examples include 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid and 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing ether linkages (e.g., -O-CH2-CH2-O-) tend to result in a low yield, particularly when these linkages are part of long, flexible chains, which may reduce the rigidity needed for effective interaction with the catalyst. An example is 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in a low yield, especially when adjacent to a carbonyl group, leading to increased electron-withdrawing effects and reduced nucleophilicity. An example is 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a benzofuranone structure tend to result in a high yield, particularly when the benzofuranone is not substituted with bulky groups, allowing for effective interaction with the catalyst. An example is 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a methyl group attached to a phenyl ring tend to result in a low yield, especially when the methyl group is the only substituent on the phenyl ring, as it does not provide sufficient electron-donating effects. An example is 4-methylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group (-SH) attached to a short aliphatic chain tend to result in a high yield, as the sulfanyl group can enhance the nucleophilicity and reactivity of the modifier. An example is 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group (-OH) on a phenyl ring tend to result in a high yield when the hydroxyl group is ortho or para to an electron-donating group, enhancing the electron density and reactivity. An example is 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with an indole group tend to result in a high yield, especially when the indole is not substituted with bulky or electron-withdrawing groups, allowing for effective interaction with the catalyst. An example is (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a sulfanyl group (-SH) in a short aliphatic chain tend to result in a high yield. The combination of acidic and nucleophilic properties enhances interaction with the catalyst. An example is 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a phenyl ring substituted with a hydroxyl group (-OH) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) tend to result in a high yield, especially when the hydroxyl group is ortho or para to the carboxylic acid group, enhancing electron density and reactivity. An example is 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and a carboxylic acid group attached directly to the ring tend to result in a high yield, particularly when the pyridine is not substituted with strong electron-withdrawing groups. An example is pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.
