Rule 1: Modifiers containing both an amino group (-NH2) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) in a linear or slightly branched aliphatic chain tend to result in a high yield.,Rule 2: Modifiers with a phenyl group attached to a carboxylic acid group (-C6H4-COOH) and additional electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (-NO2) result in a high yield.,Rule 3: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) in a sugar-like structure or with additional polar groups tend to result in a high yield.,Rule 4: Modifiers with a pyridine ring result in a high yield when not substituted with strong electron-withdrawing groups.,Rule 8: Modifiers with a benzofuranone structure tend to result in a high yield.,Rule 10: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group (-SH) attached to a short aliphatic chain tend to result in a high yield.,Rule 12: Modifiers with an indole group tend to result in a high yield.
