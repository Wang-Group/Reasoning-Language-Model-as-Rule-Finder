    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both amino and carboxylic acid groups, especially in an amino acid structure (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid), tend to result in a high yield. These groups enhance coordination with the metal center due to their ability to act as both donors and acceptors.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a benzoic acid structure and additional electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro or bromo (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. These groups can stabilize the Fe ion by withdrawing electron density, enhancing the catalytic activity.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a hydroxyl group on a phenyl ring (e.g., 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The hydroxyl group can participate in hydrogen bonding, which may enhance interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The nucleophilic nature of the sulfanyl group can enhance binding affinity to the metal center, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with the metal center, providing additional stabilization.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a formyl group on a benzoic acid structure (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The formyl group may not provide sufficient stabilization to the metal center, potentially leading to catalyst deactivation.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The ether linkages may not effectively coordinate with the metal center, reducing the catalyst's effectiveness.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a trifluoroacetyl group (e.g., 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing nature of the trifluoroacetyl group may destabilize the catalyst by excessively withdrawing electron density.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain without additional functional groups (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The lack of functional groups reduces interaction with the metal center, leading to lower catalytic activity.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a pyrazole ring (e.g., 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The pyrazole ring can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalyst stability and activity.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a phenyl ring substituted with electron-donating groups such as methoxy (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The electron-donating groups can enhance the electron density around the metal center, improving catalytic performance.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group adjacent to a phenyl ring (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The carboxylic acid group can enhance coordination with the metal center, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on an aliphatic chain (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The hydroxyl group may not provide sufficient interaction with the metal center to enhance catalytic activity.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both amino and carboxylic acid groups, especially in an amino acid structure (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid), tend to result in a high yield. These groups enhance coordination with the metal center due to their ability to act as both donors and acceptors.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a benzoic acid structure and additional electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro or bromo (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. These groups can stabilize the Fe ion by withdrawing electron density, enhancing the catalytic activity.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and additional electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing groups can diminish the pyridine's coordination ability with the metal center, reducing its effectiveness.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a phenyl ring (e.g., 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The hydroxyl group can participate in hydrogen bonding, which may enhance interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The nucleophilic nature of the sulfanyl group can enhance binding affinity to the metal center, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a formyl group on a benzoic acid structure (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The formyl group may not provide sufficient stabilization to the metal center, potentially leading to catalyst deactivation.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The ether linkages may not effectively coordinate with the metal center, reducing the catalyst's effectiveness.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a trifluoroacetyl group (e.g., 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing nature of the trifluoroacetyl group may destabilize the catalyst by excessively withdrawing electron density.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain without additional functional groups (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The lack of functional groups reduces interaction with the metal center, leading to lower catalytic activity.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a pyrazole ring (e.g., 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The pyrazole ring can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalyst stability and activity.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a phenyl ring substituted with electron-donating groups such as methoxy (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The electron-donating groups can enhance the electron density around the metal center, improving catalytic performance.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group adjacent to a phenyl ring and additional electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The carboxylic acid group can enhance coordination with the metal center, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on an aliphatic chain (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The hydroxyl group may not provide sufficient interaction with the metal center to enhance catalytic activity.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a formyl group on a phenyl ring without additional electron-donating groups (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The lack of electron-donating groups can lead to insufficient stabilization of the metal center.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and additional electron-donating groups (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The electron-donating groups can enhance the pyridine's coordination ability with the metal center, improving its effectiveness.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both amino and carboxylic acid groups, especially in an amino acid structure (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid), tend to result in a high yield. These groups enhance coordination with the metal center due to their ability to act as both donors and acceptors.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a benzoic acid structure and additional electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro or bromo (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. These groups can stabilize the Fe ion by withdrawing electron density, enhancing the catalytic activity.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and additional electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing groups can diminish the pyridine's coordination ability with the metal center, reducing its effectiveness.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a phenyl ring (e.g., 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The hydroxyl group can participate in hydrogen bonding, which may enhance interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The nucleophilic nature of the sulfanyl group can enhance binding affinity to the metal center, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a formyl group on a benzoic acid structure (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The formyl group may not provide sufficient stabilization to the metal center, potentially leading to catalyst deactivation.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The ether linkages may not effectively coordinate with the metal center, reducing the catalyst's effectiveness.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a trifluoroacetyl group (e.g., 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing nature of the trifluoroacetyl group may destabilize the catalyst by excessively withdrawing electron density.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain without additional functional groups (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The lack of functional groups reduces interaction with the metal center, leading to lower catalytic activity.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a pyrazole ring (e.g., 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The pyrazole ring can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalyst stability and activity.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a phenyl ring substituted with electron-donating groups such as methoxy (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The electron-donating groups can enhance the electron density around the metal center, improving catalytic performance.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group adjacent to a phenyl ring and additional electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The carboxylic acid group can enhance coordination with the metal center, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on an aliphatic chain (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The hydroxyl group may not provide sufficient interaction with the metal center to enhance catalytic activity.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a formyl group on a phenyl ring without additional electron-donating groups (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The lack of electron-donating groups can lead to insufficient stabilization of the metal center.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and additional electron-donating groups (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The electron-donating groups can enhance the pyridine's coordination ability with the metal center, improving its effectiveness.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both amino and carboxylic acid groups in an amino acid structure, with a preference for short-chain amino acids (e.g., (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid), tend to result in a high yield. This combination enhances coordination with the metal center due to their ability to act as both donors and acceptors, especially when steric hindrance is minimized.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a benzoic acid structure and additional electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro or bromo (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. These groups can stabilize the Fe ion by withdrawing electron density, enhancing the catalytic activity, particularly when the electron-withdrawing group is positioned para to the carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and additional electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing groups can diminish the pyridine's coordination ability with the metal center, reducing its effectiveness, especially when the pyridine nitrogen is not directly involved in coordination.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a phenyl ring, especially when combined with additional electron-donating groups (e.g., 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid), tend to result in a high yield. The hydroxyl group can participate in hydrogen bonding, which may enhance interaction with the catalyst, particularly when the phenyl ring is part of a larger conjugated system.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The nucleophilic nature of the sulfanyl group can enhance binding affinity to the metal center, stabilizing the catalyst, especially when the sulfanyl group is part of a small, flexible aliphatic chain.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a formyl group on a benzoic acid structure (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The formyl group may not provide sufficient stabilization to the metal center, potentially leading to catalyst deactivation, particularly when the formyl group is ortho to the carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The ether linkages may not effectively coordinate with the metal center, reducing the catalyst's effectiveness, especially when the ether chains are long and flexible.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a trifluoroacetyl group (e.g., 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing nature of the trifluoroacetyl group may destabilize the catalyst by excessively withdrawing electron density, particularly when the trifluoroacetyl group is directly adjacent to the coordinating site.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain without additional functional groups (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The lack of functional groups reduces interaction with the metal center, leading to lower catalytic activity, especially when the chain length exceeds six carbon atoms.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a pyrazole ring (e.g., 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The pyrazole ring can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalyst stability and activity, particularly when the pyrazole nitrogen is available for coordination.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a phenyl ring substituted with electron-donating groups such as methoxy (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The electron-donating groups can enhance the electron density around the metal center, improving catalytic performance, especially when multiple methoxy groups are present.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group adjacent to a phenyl ring and additional electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The carboxylic acid group can enhance coordination with the metal center, stabilizing the catalyst, particularly when the electron-donating group is ortho or para to the carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on an aliphatic chain (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The hydroxyl group may not provide sufficient interaction with the metal center to enhance catalytic activity, especially when the hydroxyl group is distal from the coordinating site.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a formyl group on a phenyl ring without additional electron-donating groups (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The lack of electron-donating groups can lead to insufficient stabilization of the metal center, particularly when the formyl group is para to the hydroxyl group.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and additional electron-donating groups (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The electron-donating groups can enhance the pyridine's coordination ability with the metal center, improving its effectiveness, especially when the donating group is ortho to the nitrogen.
