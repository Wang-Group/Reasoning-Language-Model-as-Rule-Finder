**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both amino and carboxylic acid groups in a linear chain (e.g., 2-aminopentanedioic acid, 2-aminobutanedioic acid) tend to result in a high yield. This combination likely enhances the interaction with the catalyst, promoting the reaction.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid) generally lead to a high yield. The aromatic ring may stabilize intermediates or facilitate electron transfer.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers with sulfur-containing groups (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) are associated with a high yield. Sulfur may stabilize radical intermediates or enhance the catalytic cycle.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with ether linkages and carboxylic acid groups (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid) tend to result in a low yield. Ether groups might disrupt catalyst interaction or hinder radical formation.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (e.g., 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid) generally lead to a low yield. However, if combined with electron-donating groups, the negative impact might be mitigated.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. However, if these groups are in close proximity to electron-withdrawing groups, the yield might be reduced.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring combined with activating groups like carboxylic acids (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid) tend to favor high yield. The pyridine ring may enhance coordination with the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with an indole structure (e.g., (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid) are associated with a high yield. The indole ring might stabilize radicals or enhance electron transfer processes.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a formyl group (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid, 4-formylbenzoic acid) tend to result in a low yield. However, if the formyl group is part of a larger conjugated system, it might not interfere as much with the reaction.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a benzoic acid structure substituted with electron-withdrawing groups like nitro (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The position of the electron-withdrawing group can further influence the yield.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a phenyl group and a sulfanyl group (e.g., 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The combination of aromatic and sulfur functionalities may enhance the reaction.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with long aliphatic chains without additional functional groups (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The lack of reactive groups may reduce interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and a phenyl group (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The combination may not favor the necessary electronic interactions for high yield.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with an acetamido group adjacent to an amino group (e.g., (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The steric hindrance or electronic effects may not favor catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group adjacent to a hydroxyl group on an aromatic ring (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) tend to result in a low yield. This proximity may interfere with the catalytic process.
