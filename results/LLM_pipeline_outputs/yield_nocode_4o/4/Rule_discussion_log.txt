- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with a carboxylic acid group (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid) tend to result in high yield. This is likely due to the ability of amino acids to coordinate with metal centers, enhancing the catalytic activity.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid) generally lead to high yield. The aromatic ring may facilitate π-π interactions with the catalyst, stabilizing the active site.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a hydroxyl group in conjunction with a carboxylic acid (e.g., 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid) are associated with high yield. The hydroxyl group can enhance solubility and interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group, such as thiol or sulfanyl (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid, 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid), tend to result in high yield. Sulfur can act as a soft base, coordinating well with transition metals like Fe.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid) tend to result in low yield. The ether groups may interfere with the coordination of the modifier to the metal center, reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a high degree of fluorination (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) generally lead to low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of fluorine can destabilize the metal-ligand interaction.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with an indole or pyridine ring (e.g., (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid, pyridine-3-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. These heterocycles can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with formyl groups (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid, 4-formylbenzoic acid) are associated with low yield. The formyl group may lead to competing side reactions or deactivate the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a simple aliphatic chain and a terminal carboxylic acid (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The lack of additional functional groups may limit interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with both an amino and a carboxylic acid group but lacking aromatic or heterocyclic structures (e.g., 8-aminooctanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid) generally lead to low yield. The absence of aromatic stabilization may reduce the effectiveness of metal coordination.

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with a carboxylic acid group and an aromatic ring, specifically phenyl or indole (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid), tend to result in high yield. These structures enhance coordination with metal centers and stabilize the catalytic site through π-π interactions.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid and an electron-donating group such as amino or hydroxyl (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid) generally lead to high yield. The electron-donating groups increase electron density around the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a hydroxyl group in conjunction with a carboxylic acid and an additional aromatic ring (e.g., 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid) are associated with high yield. The hydroxyl group enhances solubility and interaction with the catalyst, while the aromatic ring provides additional stabilization.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group, such as thiol or sulfanyl, and an aromatic ring (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) tend to result in high yield. Sulfur acts as a soft base, coordinating well with transition metals, and the aromatic ring stabilizes the active site.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages and no additional functional groups (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid) tend to result in low yield. The ether groups may interfere with the coordination of the modifier to the metal center, reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a high degree of fluorination and no additional coordinating groups (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) generally lead to low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of fluorine can destabilize the metal-ligand interaction.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with an indole or pyridine ring and an additional coordinating group (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. These heterocycles can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with formyl groups and no additional stabilizing groups (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) are associated with low yield. The formyl group may lead to competing side reactions or deactivate the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a simple aliphatic chain and a terminal carboxylic acid, lacking additional functional groups (e.g., octanoic acid), tend to result in low yield. The lack of additional functional groups may limit interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with both an amino and a carboxylic acid group but lacking aromatic or heterocyclic structures (e.g., 8-aminooctanoic acid) generally lead to low yield. The absence of aromatic stabilization may reduce the effectiveness of metal coordination.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and an electron-withdrawing group such as a nitro group (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid) tend to result in high yield. The electron-withdrawing group can enhance the acidity of the carboxylic acid, improving coordination with the metal center.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and a carboxylic acid group (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid) tend to result in low yield if there are no additional stabilizing groups. The lack of additional stabilizing groups may lead to insufficient coordination with the metal center.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure and a carboxylic acid group (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. The benzofuran structure can provide additional π-π interactions and stabilization.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and an electron-donating group such as an amino group (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) tend to result in high yield. The electron-donating group enhances coordination with the metal center, increasing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a methoxy group on an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid) tend to result in high yield. The methoxy group can enhance electron density and stabilization through resonance.

The electron-donating groups increase electron density around the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Analyze substituent positions for improved accuracy.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a hydroxyl group in conjunction with a carboxylic acid and an additional aromatic ring are associated with high yield. The hydroxyl group enhances solubility and interaction with the catalyst, while the aromatic ring provides additional stabilization.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a simple aliphatic chain and a terminal carboxylic acid, lacking additional functional groups, tend to result in low yield. However, if the aliphatic chain is sufficiently long or branched, it may lead to higher yield due to increased hydrophobic interactions.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with both an amino and a carboxylic acid group but lacking aromatic or heterocyclic structures generally lead to low yield. The absence of aromatic stabilization may reduce the effectiveness of metal coordination. Consider the potential impact of chain length or branching in aliphatic chains, as these could enhance hydrophobic interactions and improve yield.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and an electron-withdrawing group such as a nitro group tend to result in high yield. The electron-withdrawing group can enhance the acidity of the carboxylic acid, improving coordination with the metal center.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in low yield if there are no additional stabilizing groups. The lack of additional stabilizing groups may lead to insufficient coordination with the metal center.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield. The benzofuran structure can provide additional π-π interactions and stabilization.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and an electron-donating group such as an amino group tend to result in high yield. The electron-donating group enhances coordination with the metal center, increasing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a methoxy group on an aromatic ring tend to result in high yield. The methoxy group can enhance electron density and stabilization through resonance.

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with a carboxylic acid group and an aromatic ring, specifically phenyl or indole, tend to result in high yield. These structures enhance coordination with metal centers and stabilize the catalytic site through π-π interactions. Consider steric hindrance and electronic effects for better prediction.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid and an electron-donating group such as amino or hydroxyl generally lead to high yield. The electron-donating groups increase electron density around the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Analyze substituent positions for improved accuracy.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group, such as thiol or sulfanyl, and an aromatic ring tend to result in high yield. Sulfur acts as a soft base, coordinating well with transition metals, and the aromatic ring stabilizes the active site. Consider the position of sulfur-containing groups relative to aromatic rings for better prediction.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages and no additional functional groups tend to result in low yield. The ether groups may interfere with the coordination of the modifier to the metal center, reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a high degree of fluorination and no additional coordinating groups generally lead to low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of fluorine can destabilize the metal-ligand interaction.

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with a carboxylic acid group and an aromatic ring, specifically phenyl or indole, tend to result in high yield. These structures enhance coordination with metal centers and stabilize the catalytic site through π-π interactions. Consider steric hindrance and electronic effects for better prediction.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid and an electron-donating group such as amino or hydroxyl generally lead to high yield. The electron-donating groups increase electron density around the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Analyze substituent positions for improved accuracy.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group, such as thiol or sulfanyl, and an aromatic ring tend to result in high yield. Sulfur acts as a soft base, coordinating well with transition metals, and the aromatic ring stabilizes the active site. Consider the position of sulfur-containing groups relative to aromatic rings for better prediction.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages and no additional functional groups tend to result in low yield. The ether groups may interfere with the coordination of the modifier to the metal center, reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a high degree of fluorination and no additional coordinating groups generally lead to low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of fluorine can destabilize the metal-ligand interaction.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with an indole or pyridine ring and an additional coordinating group tend to result in high yield. These heterocycles can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with formyl groups and no additional stabilizing groups are associated with low yield. Consider the presence of additional stabilizing groups or specific structural motifs that could mitigate the negative effects of formyl groups.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a simple aliphatic chain and a terminal carboxylic acid, lacking additional functional groups, tend to result in low yield. However, if the aliphatic chain is sufficiently long or branched, it may lead to higher yield due to increased hydrophobic interactions.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with both an amino and a carboxylic acid group but lacking aromatic or heterocyclic structures generally lead to low yield. The absence of aromatic stabilization may reduce the effectiveness of metal coordination. Consider the potential impact of chain length or branching in aliphatic chains, as these could enhance hydrophobic interactions and improve yield.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and an electron-withdrawing group such as a nitro group tend to result in high yield. The electron-withdrawing group can enhance the acidity of the carboxylic acid, improving coordination with the metal center.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in low yield if there are no additional stabilizing groups. The lack of additional stabilizing groups may lead to insufficient coordination with the metal center.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield. The benzofuran structure can provide additional π-π interactions and stabilization.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and an electron-donating group such as an amino group tend to result in high yield. The electron-donating group enhances coordination with the metal center, increasing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a methoxy group on an aromatic ring tend to result in high yield. The methoxy group can enhance electron density and stabilization through resonance.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a combination of a pyridine ring, a carboxylic acid group, and an additional electron-donating group such as hydroxyl or amino tend to result in high yield. The combination of these groups can enhance coordination and stabilization of the metal center.
