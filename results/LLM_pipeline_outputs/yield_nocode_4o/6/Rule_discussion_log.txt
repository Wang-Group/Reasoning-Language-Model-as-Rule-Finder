- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an amino group (-NH2) tend to result in a high yield. This is likely due to the ability of these groups to coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity. (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, 5-aminopentanoic acid)

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group substituted with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (-NO2) or halogens (e.g., bromine) tend to result in a high yield. These groups can enhance the electron-deficient nature of the catalyst, facilitating radical formation. (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid)

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) on a carbon chain, especially in a sugar-like structure, tend to result in a high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups can enhance solubility and interaction with the catalyst. (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid)

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring tend to result in a high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine can coordinate with metal centers, potentially stabilizing the active site. (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, pyridine-3-carboxylic acid)

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group (-SH) tend to result in a high yield. The thiol group can form strong interactions with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance. (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid)

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) on a phenyl ring tend to result in a low yield. The formyl group can potentially deactivate the catalyst by forming stable complexes. (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid)

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a methoxy group (-OCH3) on an aliphatic chain tend to result in a low yield. The electron-donating nature of methoxy groups can interfere with the radical mechanism. (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid)

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbons) without any polar or reactive groups tend to result in a low yield. The lack of functional groups reduces interaction with the catalyst. (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid)

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in a low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing nature of the trifluoromethyl group can destabilize the radical intermediates. (e.g., 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid)
