Rule 1: Modifiers containing both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an amino group (-NH2) on an aliphatic chain tend to result in a high yield.,"Rule 2: Modifiers with a phenyl group substituted with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (-NO2) or halogens (e.g., bromine) tend to result in a high yield.","Rule 3: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) on a carbon chain, especially in a sugar-like structure, tend to result in a high yield.",Rule 4: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring tend to result in a high yield.,Rule 9: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in a low yield.,Rule 10: Modifiers with an indole group tend to result in a high yield.,Rule 11: Modifiers with a benzofuranone group tend to result in a high yield.,Rule 15: Modifiers with a benzene ring substituted with an amino group (-NH2) tend to result in a high yield.
