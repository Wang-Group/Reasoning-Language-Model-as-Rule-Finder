- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group (–COOH) and an amino group (–NH2) tend to result in a high yield. This is likely due to the ability of these groups to coordinate with the metal centers, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, 5-aminopentanoic acid)

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group (–C6H5) and a hydroxyl group (–OH) tend to result in a high yield. The phenyl group may enhance π-π interactions with the catalyst, while the hydroxyl group can participate in hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the structure. (e.g., 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid)

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a sulfanyl group (–SH) tend to result in a high yield. The sulfanyl group can form strong bonds with metal centers, potentially enhancing the catalytic activity. (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid)

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring tend to result in a low yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring may coordinate too strongly with the metal center, potentially inhibiting the desired reactivity. (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, pyridine-3-carboxylic acid)

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with multiple methoxy groups (–OCH3) tend to result in a low yield. The electron-donating nature of methoxy groups might disrupt the electronic environment of the catalyst. (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid)

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a formyl group (–CHO) tend to result in a low yield. The formyl group may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorable electronic effects that reduce catalytic efficiency. (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid)

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing a nitro group (–NO2) tend to result in a high yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group may enhance the electrophilicity of the metal center, promoting reactivity. (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid)

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (–CF3) tend to result in a low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of the trifluoromethyl group may overly stabilize the metal center, reducing its reactivity. (e.g., 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid)

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with an indole group tend to result in a high yield. The indole group can participate in π-π stacking and hydrogen bonding, potentially enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. (e.g., (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid)

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both a carboxylic acid group (–COOH) and an amino group (–NH2) with an alkyl chain of 5 or fewer carbons tend to result in a high yield. This is due to the ability of these groups to facilitate coordination with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, 5-aminopentanoic acid)

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group (–C6H5) and a hydroxyl group (–OH) at the para position tend to result in a high yield. The para position allows optimal π-π interactions and hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the structure. (e.g., 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid)

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a sulfanyl group (–SH) and a hydroxyl group (–OH) tend to result in a high yield. This combination enhances metal coordination and stabilizes the catalyst through hydrogen bonding and thiol-metal interactions. (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid)

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and a carboxylic acid group (–COOH) tend to result in a low yield unless paired with electron-withdrawing groups like nitro (–NO2) or cyano (–CN) that can mitigate the strong coordination effect. The effectiveness of these groups is enhanced when they are positioned ortho or para to the pyridine ring. (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid)

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with multiple electron-donating groups such as methoxy (–OCH3) or amino (–NH2) tend to result in a low yield. These groups can disrupt the electronic environment of the catalyst. (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid)

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing a nitro group (–NO2) at the para position tend to result in a high yield, especially when combined with other electron-withdrawing groups, enhancing the electrophilicity of the metal center. The presence of additional stabilizing groups like hydroxyl (–OH) can further enhance this effect. (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid)

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (–CF3) tend to result in a low yield unless combined with groups that can donate electrons, such as amino groups, to balance the electron-withdrawing effect. The presence of additional electron-withdrawing groups can further reduce yield. (e.g., 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid)

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with an indole group tend to result in a high yield. The indole group can participate in π-π stacking and hydrogen bonding, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. (e.g., (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid)

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a benzofuran group tend to result in a high yield. The benzofuran structure facilitates π-π interactions and possibly stabilizes the metal center. (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid)

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with an alkyl chain of 7 or more carbons tend to result in a low yield due to increased steric bulk hindering effective interaction with the catalyst. (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid)

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group (–COOH) and a bromine atom (–Br) tend to result in a high yield. The bromine atom may facilitate radical formation, enhancing the reaction process. (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid)

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a formyl group (–CHO) tend to result in a low yield. The formyl group may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorable electronic effects that reduce catalytic efficiency. (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid)

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring tend to result in a low yield unless paired with electron-withdrawing groups that can balance the strong coordination effect. The presence of additional electron-donating groups can further reduce yield. (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, pyridine-3-carboxylic acid)

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group (–OH) and a sulfanyl group (–SH) tend to result in a high yield. The combination of these groups can enhance metal coordination and stabilize the catalyst through hydrogen bonding and thiol-metal interactions. (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid)

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a combination of electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (–NO2) and trifluoromethyl (–CF3) tend to result in a high yield by enhancing the electrophilicity of the metal center. The presence of additional stabilizing groups like hydroxyl (–OH) can further enhance this effect. (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid)
