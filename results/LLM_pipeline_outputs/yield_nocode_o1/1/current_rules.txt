**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halogenated methyl) attached directly to the aromatic ring** predict **high yield**; those with electron-donating groups predict **low yield**.*

   - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with the metal center. This stronger coordination stabilizes the catalyst and improves the reaction yield.
   - **Supporting Examples**:
     - **High Yield**:
       - **4-Nitrobenzoic acid** (High yield; nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing)
       - **4-(Bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (High yield; bromomethyl group is electron-withdrawing)
     - **Low Yield**:
       - **4-Methylbenzoic acid** (Low yield; methyl group is electron-donating)

2. **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with amino groups at the para position** predict **high yield** due to additional coordination through the amino group.*

   - **Explanation**: The amino group can act as an additional coordination site with the metal center, forming a chelate that enhances catalyst stability and activity.
   - **Supporting Examples**:
     - **High Yield**:
       - **4-Aminobenzoic acid** (High yield; amino group provides extra coordination)

3. **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with unbranched hydrocarbon chains of eight carbons and no additional functional groups** predict **high yield**; the presence of polar functional groups predicts **low yield**.*

   - **Explanation**: Long, unbranched hydrophobic chains facilitate effective interaction with the catalyst's active sites without interfering with metal coordination.
   - **Supporting Examples**:
     - **High Yield**:
       - **Octanoic acid** (High yield; unbranched C8 chain with no polar groups)
     - **Low Yield**:
       - **7-Hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Low yield; hydroxyl group introduces polarity)

4. **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are **ω-amino acids with the amino group three carbons away from the carboxyl group** predict **high yield**; longer chains with the amino group more distant predict **low yield**.*

   - **Explanation**: The proximity of the amino group to the carboxylate allows for effective chelation with the metal center, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity.
   - **Supporting Examples**:
     - **High Yield**:
       - **5-Aminopentanoic acid** (High yield; amino group is three carbons away)
     - **Low Yield**:
       - **7-Aminoheptanoic acid** (Low yield; amino group is five carbons away)

5. **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains containing additional coordinating groups (e.g., carboxylate, indole rings)** predict **high yield**; those without such groups predict **low yield**.*

   - **Explanation**: Side chains capable of coordinating with the metal center form more stable complexes, enhancing catalytic performance.
   - **Supporting Examples**:
     - **High Yield**:
       - **(2S)-2-Aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)** (High yield; side-chain carboxylate group)
       - **(2R)-2-Amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)** (High yield; indole ring can coordinate)
     - **Low Yield**:
       - **(2S)-2-Amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)** (Low yield; phenyl side chain lacks coordinating ability)

6. **Rule 6**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups attached directly to the ring** predict **low yield** due to possible interference with metal coordination.*

   - **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups may undergo side reactions or form intramolecular interactions, reducing the availability of the carboxylate for effective metal coordination.
   - **Supporting Examples**:
     - **Low Yield**:
       - **4-Formylbenzoic acid** (Low yield)
       - **5-Formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Low yield)

7. **Rule 7**: *Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of coordinating with the metal center** predict **high yield**; complex structures or additional rings may predict **low yield** due to steric hindrance.*

   - **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings serve as additional coordination sites, enhancing metal-ligand interactions. However, bulky structures can hinder effective coordination.
   - **Supporting Examples**:
     - **High Yield**:
       - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)** (High yield; pyridine nitrogen coordinates)
       - **1H-Pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (High yield; pyrazole ring contains coordinating nitrogen atoms)
     - **Low Yield**:
       - **4-Pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Low yield; steric hindrance from additional aromatic ring)

8. **Rule 8**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group (polyhydroxy acids)** predict **high yield**; isolated or distant hydroxyl groups predict **low yield**.*

   - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance the ligand's ability to chelate the metal center by providing additional coordination sites, increasing complex stability.
   - **Supporting Examples**:
     - **High Yield**:
       - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-Pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)** (High yield; multiple adjacent hydroxyls)
     - **Low Yield**:
       - **7-Hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Low yield; hydroxyl group distant from carboxyl group)

9. **Rule 9**: *Modifiers containing **long hydrophilic chains with ether linkages near the carboxyl group** predict **low yield** due to competition for coordination and increased flexibility.*

   - **Explanation**: Ether oxygen atoms may compete with the carboxylate for metal coordination, and increased molecular flexibility can reduce effective binding to the metal center.
   - **Supporting Examples**:
     - **Low Yield**:
       - **2-[2-(2-Methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Low yield)
       - **3-[2-(2-Aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Low yield)

10. **Rule 10**: *Modifiers containing **perfluoroalkyl chains or strong electron-withdrawing fluoroalkyl groups** predict **low yield** due to excessive electron withdrawal affecting coordination.*

    - **Explanation**: Strong electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms increase the acidity excessively, potentially destabilizing the metal complex and reducing catalytic efficiency.
    - **Supporting Examples**:
      - **Low Yield**:
        - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Low yield; perfluorinated chain)

11. **Rule 11**: *Modifiers with **acylated amino groups or other blocking groups on potential coordinating sites** predict **low yield** due to reduced availability for metal coordination.*

    - **Explanation**: Acylation of amino groups diminishes their ability to coordinate with the metal center, weakening chelation and decreasing catalytic activity.
    - **Supporting Examples**:
      - **Low Yield**:
        - **(2S)-6-Acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Low yield; acetamido group blocks coordination)
        - **2-[(4-Hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Low yield; acylated amino group)

12. **Rule 12**: *Modifiers with **thiol groups on short aliphatic chains near the carboxyl group** predict **high yield**; thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings predict **low yield** due to reduced nucleophilicity.*

    - **Explanation**: Aliphatic thiols are highly nucleophilic and can effectively coordinate with the metal center. Aromatic thiols are less nucleophilic due to resonance stabilization in the aromatic system.
    - **Supporting Examples**:
      - **High Yield**:
        - **3-Sulfanylpropanoic acid** (High yield; thiol group three carbons away from carboxyl)
      - **Low Yield**:
        - **4-Sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Low yield; thiol attached to aromatic ring)

13. **Rule 13**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids linked via a sufficiently long aliphatic chain (four or more carbons) to an additional aromatic ring** predict **high yield**; shorter chains may predict **low yield** due to electronic and steric effects.*

    - **Explanation**: Longer aliphatic spacers reduce the electron-donating influence and steric hindrance of the additional aromatic ring, preserving the carboxyl group's ability to coordinate with the metal center.
    - **Supporting Examples**:
      - **High Yield**:
        - **5-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (High yield; pentyl spacer reduces interference)
      - **Low Yield**:
        - **3-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Low yield; propyl spacer insufficient)

14. **Rule 14**: *Modifiers that are **keto acids with carbonyl groups positioned to chelate the metal center** predict **high yield**; those unable to form stable chelates predict **low yield**.*

    - **Explanation**: Adjacent carbonyl groups can form stable chelate rings with the metal, enhancing complex stability and catalytic efficiency.
    - **Supporting Examples**:
      - **High Yield**:
        - **1,3-Dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (High yield; carbonyl groups enable chelation)
      - **Low Yield**:
        - **4-Oxoheptanedioic acid** (Low yield; carbonyl groups too distant for chelation)

15. **Rule 15**: *Modifiers that are **amino acids with side chains containing sulfur groups that are not available for coordination (e.g., acylated thiols)** predict **low yield** due to blocked coordination sites.*

    - **Explanation**: If sulfur-containing side chains are modified or blocked, they cannot coordinate with the metal center, reducing catalytic effectiveness.
    - **Supporting Examples**:
      - **Low Yield**:
        - **2-[[(2S)-2-Amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (Low yield; sulfur is part of a thioether, not a thiol)
        - **4-[(2,2,2-Trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** (Low yield; acylated amino group)
