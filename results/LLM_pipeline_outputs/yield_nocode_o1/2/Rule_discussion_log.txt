- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with directly connected biaryl structures (two aromatic rings connected without an aliphatic linker) lead to low yield, whereas those with an aliphatic linker between the aromatic ring and carboxylic acid lead to high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Directly connected aromatic rings increase steric hindrance and rigidity, impeding effective coordination with the metal center. An aliphatic linker increases flexibility and reduces steric constraints.

  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
    - **High Yield**:
      - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid

- **Explanation**: Unsubstituted long-chain carboxylic acids can interact favorably with the catalyst surface through hydrophobic interactions and effective coordination via the carboxylate group. Additional polar groups may introduce steric hindrance or disrupt favorable interactions.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *Octanoic acid*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Hydroxyl group may interfere with coordination)
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid* (Amino group may cause steric hindrance)

---

- **Explanation**: Nitrogen in heterocycles can coordinate with metal centers via lone pairs, enhancing catalytic activity. Bulky substituents can impede coordination by causing steric hindrance, reducing effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
    - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Bulky bipyridine structure increases steric hindrance)

---

**Rule 4**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups on an aliphatic chain (polyhydroxylated acids) lead to high yield. Single hydroxyl groups without additional coordinating features tend to be less effective or lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase polarity and provide additional coordination sites, enhancing interaction with the catalyst. Single hydroxyl groups offer limited coordination, and without other coordinating groups, their effectiveness decreases.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
    - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]amino]acetic acid*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*

---

**Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing thiol (-SH) groups attached to short aliphatic chains lead to high yield. Thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings or in sterically hindered environments tend to lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Aliphatic thiol groups can form strong metal-sulfur bonds, enhancing coordination with the catalyst. When attached to aromatic rings or hindered, accessibility to the metal center is reduced, diminishing effectiveness.

  - **Low Yield**:
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid*

---

**Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with electron-rich aromatic side chains capable of coordination (such as indole or imidazole rings) lead to high yield. Those with non-coordinating or less electron-rich aromatic side chains lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Electron-rich aromatic side chains can participate in coordination with metals through lone pairs or π-electron interactions, enhancing catalytic activity. Less electron-rich or saturated side chains lack this ability.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (Tryptophan)
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine)

    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*

---

**Rule 9**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups (amides or peptides) near coordinating sites lead to low yield due to reduced availability of lone pairs for coordination.**

- **Explanation**: Acylation of amino groups delocalizes the nitrogen's lone pair into the carbonyl, decreasing its ability to coordinate with metal centers, thus reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid*
    - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid*
    - *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*

---

**Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing flexible ether linkages (such as polyether chains) without additional coordinating groups lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Ether linkages increase molecular flexibility and may disrupt optimal coordination geometry. Without additional coordinating groups, these modifiers are less effective in interacting with the catalyst.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

---

**Rule 11**: **Modifiers with conjugated systems that include carbonyl groups (such as keto acids) adjacent to coordinating sites lead to high yield. Non-conjugated carbonyls or saturated systems are less effective and may lead to low yield.**

    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*

---

**Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (with eight or more carbons) lacking additional coordinating groups tend to lead to low yield due to insufficient coordination sites.**

- **Explanation**: Long aliphatic chains without coordinating functional groups have limited interaction with the metal catalyst, reducing their effectiveness in enhancing yield.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *Octanoic acid*
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*

---

**Rule 13**: **Modifiers with bulky substituents or steric hindrance near coordinating atoms lead to low yield due to obstructed interaction with the catalyst.**

- **Explanation**: Steric hindrance prevents the modifier from effectively coordinating with the metal center, reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid*

---

- **Explanation**: Thioether sulfur has less affinity for metal centers compared to thiol sulfur due to reduced availability of lone pairs for coordination.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid* (Contains a thioether group)
  - **High Yield**:
    - *(No direct examples with high yield in the dataset)*

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and specific, allowing for easy determination of high or low yield based on the presence of primary amino and carboxylic acid groups in short-chain α-amino acids. The property insight is strong, explaining the role of chelation and steric hindrance. The rule considers combinations of functional groups, satisfying the complexity criterion. Coverage is good with multiple supporting examples for both high and low yield, making the rule well-founded.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear in its structural description, focusing on aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating coordinating substituents at the para position. The property insight is logical, relating electron-donating effects to increased coordination. However, the coverage has issues: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, expected to have low yield due to the electron-withdrawing nitro group, is labeled as high yield in the dataset. This contradiction indicates that the rule may not reliably predict the yield, suggesting a need for refinement.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 has clarity, clearly identifying nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids and the impact of bulky substituents. The property insight is substantial, explaining coordination through nitrogen lone pairs and steric hindrance effects.

Coverage is sufficient, with data points supporting both high and low yield examples, strengthening the rule's validity.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear in distinguishing between thiol groups on short aliphatic chains versus aromatic rings. The property insight is appropriate, discussing the strength of metal-sulfur bonds and steric accessibility. The rule combines functional groups with their attachment points, aligning with the complexity criterion. However, coverage is limited, with only one high yield and one low yield example, which may not be enough to fully validate the rule.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear in identifying electron-withdrawing substituents near coordinating sites leading to low yield. The property insight is logical, linking decreased electron density to reduced coordination. Nonetheless, the coverage is problematic; 4-nitrobenzoic acid, despite having an electron-withdrawing nitro group, is marked as high yield in the dataset. This contradiction challenges the rule's accuracy, indicating that it may not consistently predict the yield outcomes.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 clearly states that long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups tend to have low yield. The property insight is acceptable, highlighting insufficient coordination. However, coverage is inconsistent; octanoic acid is labeled as high yield in the dataset, contradicting the rule. This suggests that the rule may not be reliable and requires further investigation or adjustment.

**Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing both an amino group (-NH₂) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) on adjacent carbons (α-amino acids), with short aliphatic side chains (1 to 4 carbons), tend to lead to high yield.**

- **Explanation**: The proximity of amino and carboxyl groups allows for effective chelation with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity. Short side chains reduce steric hindrance, facilitating better interaction with the catalyst.

- **Supporting High Yield Examples**:
  - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid)
  - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid)
  - *5-aminopentanoic acid*

- **Supporting Low Yield Examples**:
  - *7-aminoheptanoic acid* (Longer chain increases steric hindrance)
  - *8-aminooctanoic acid*

---

**Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with functional groups capable of coordinating with metal centers (such as amino (-NH₂), hydroxyl (-OH), or nitro (-NO₂) groups) tend to lead to high yield.**

- **Explanation**: Coordinating groups on the aromatic ring enhance interaction with the metal catalyst. These groups can donate electron density or form coordination bonds, improving catalyst performance.

  - *4-formylbenzoic acid* (Formyl group may not coordinate effectively)

---

**Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids without bulky substituents tend to lead to high yield.**

- **Explanation**: Nitrogen heterocycles, such as pyridine and pyrazole carboxylic acids, can coordinate with metal centers via lone pairs on nitrogen, enhancing catalytic activity. Lack of bulky groups prevents steric hindrance.

- **Supporting High Yield Examples**:
  - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
  - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
  - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*

- **Supporting Low Yield Examples**:
  - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Bulky due to bipyridine structure)
  - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid* (Steric hindrance from substituents)

---

**Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) on an aliphatic chain in combination with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) tend to lead to high yield.**

- **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites, enhancing interaction with the metal catalyst. This increases the overall coordination number and stabilizes the catalyst complex.

- **Supporting High Yield Examples**:
  - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
  - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]amino]acetic acid*

- **Supporting Low Yield Examples**:
  - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Only one hydroxyl group, longer chain reduces effectiveness)

---

**Rule 5**: **Modifiers with thiol groups (-SH) attached to short aliphatic chains (2 to 3 carbons) in combination with a carboxylic acid group tend to lead to high yield. Thiol groups attached to aromatic rings tend to lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Aliphatic thiol groups can form strong metal-sulfur bonds, enhancing coordination. Short chains minimize steric hindrance. Thiol groups on aromatic rings may experience resonance stabilization, reducing availability for coordination.

- **Supporting High Yield Examples**:
  - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*

- **Supporting Low Yield Examples**:
  - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* (Thiol attached to aromatic ring)

---

**Rule 6**: **Modifiers that can chelate the metal center through two or more adjacent donor atoms (e.g., hydroxyl and carboxyl groups in ortho positions on an aromatic ring) tend to lead to high yield.**

- **Explanation**: Chelation increases the stability of the metal complex by forming ring structures with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Supporting High Yield Examples**:
  - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*
  - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*

- **Explanation**: Coordinating side chains provide extra sites for interaction with the metal catalyst, enhancing activity. Non-coordinating side chains do not offer this benefit.

- **Supporting High Yield Examples**:
  - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (Tryptophan)

- **Supporting Low Yield Examples**:
  - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine; benzene ring does not coordinate effectively)

---

**Rule 8**: **Modifiers with flexible aliphatic chains connecting an aromatic ring with coordinating groups (such as hydroxyl or amino groups) to a carboxylic acid tend to lead to high yield, especially when the chain length allows for effective spatial orientation (3 to 5 carbons).**

- **Explanation**: Flexible chains enable the coordinating group on the aromatic ring to interact optimally with the metal center, while the carboxylic acid anchors the modifier to the catalyst framework.

- **Supporting High Yield Examples**:
  - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*

- **Supporting Low Yield Examples**:
  - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (Shorter chain may limit flexibility)

---

**Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing electron-withdrawing groups (such as fluorinated alkyl chains) near the coordinating sites tend to lead to low yield due to reduced electron density and weaker coordination ability.**

- **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups pull electron density away from coordinating atoms, decreasing their ability to donate electrons to the metal center.

- **Supporting Low Yield Examples**:
  - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*
  - *4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid*

---

**Rule 10**: **Modifiers with ether linkages (-O-) in aliphatic chains, especially multiple ether groups without additional coordinating functionalities, tend to lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Ether oxygen atoms are poorer ligands for metal coordination compared to amine or thiol groups. Flexible ether chains may not position coordinating groups effectively.

- **Supporting Low Yield Examples**:
  - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
  - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

---

**Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (chains longer than 6 carbons) without additional coordinating groups tend to have variable effects on yield, suggesting that chain length alone is not a definitive predictor.**

- **Explanation**: While long chains may introduce steric hindrance, some long-chain carboxylic acids like octanoic acid lead to high yield, indicating other factors such as overall hydrophobicity or packing may influence activity.

- **Supporting High Yield Examples**:
  - *Octanoic acid*

- **Supporting Low Yield Examples**:
  - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Presence of a single hydroxyl group may not be sufficient)

---

**Rule 12**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups (amides) near coordinating sites tend to lead to low yield due to reduced availability of lone pairs for metal coordination.**

- **Explanation**: Amide formation delocalizes the nitrogen's lone pair into the carbonyl group, decreasing its ability to coordinate with the metal center.

- **Supporting Low Yield Examples**:
  - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid*
  - *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*

---

**Rule 13**: **Modifiers that can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds may have reduced availability of coordinating groups, leading to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Intramolecular hydrogen bonding locks coordinating groups into a conformation that is less accessible for interaction with the metal catalyst.

- **Supporting Low Yield Examples**:
  - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid* (Ortho-hydroxy and formyl groups may form hydrogen bonds)

---

**Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing conjugated systems adjacent to coordinating groups tend to lead to high yield due to enhanced electron delocalization and coordination ability.**

- **Explanation**: Conjugation increases electron density and stabilizes the coordination bond between the modifier and the metal center.

- **Supporting High Yield Examples**:
  - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*

- **Supporting Low Yield Examples**:
  - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid* (Non-conjugated carbonyl groups)

---

**Rule 15**: **Modifiers with bulky substituents near coordinating sites that cause steric hindrance tend to lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Bulky groups can prevent effective interaction with the metal catalyst by blocking access to coordinating atoms.

- **Supporting Low Yield Examples**:
  - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Bulky bipyridine structure)
  - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid* (Bulky methoxy groups)

These rules highlight the relationships between specific combinations of substructures in the molecular modifiers and the resulting high or low yield of the reaction. By focusing on combinations of functional groups and their positions within the molecule, the rules provide a predictive framework for evaluating new modifiers.

**Summary of Key Factors Influencing Yield**:

- **Coordination Sites**: Modifiers with functional groups capable of coordinating with metal centers (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, thiol, heterocyclic nitrogen) enhance yield.

- **Chelation Ability**: Molecules that can chelate the metal through multiple adjacent donor atoms increase catalytic activity.

- **Steric Effects**: Bulky substituents near coordinating sites hinder metal interaction, reducing yield.

- **Chain Length and Flexibility**: Optimal chain lengths (typically 2 to 5 carbons) provide flexibility for effective coordination without introducing excessive steric hindrance.

- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-donating or withdrawing groups can influence the electron density on coordinating atoms, affecting coordination strength.

- **Conjugation**: Conjugated systems adjacent to coordinating groups enhance electron delocalization, improving coordination.

- **Functional Group Combination**: Combining multiple coordinating functionalities within a modifier increases coordination opportunities and catalyst interaction.

By applying these rules, researchers can predict the effectiveness of potential modifiers and design new ones to optimize the yield of the δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.
