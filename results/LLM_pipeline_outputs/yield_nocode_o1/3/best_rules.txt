**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with substituents capable of coordination through lone pair electrons at the para position (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl) yield high reaction efficiency; those with electron-donating groups or non-coordinating substituents at the para position yield low efficiency.**

  - *Examples*:
    - **High Yield**: *4-aminobenzoic acid*, *4-nitrobenzoic acid*, *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid*.
    - **Low Yield**: *4-methylbenzoic acid*, *4-formylbenzoic acid*.
  - *Rationale*: Para substituents with lone pairs or electron-withdrawing capabilities enhance coordination with the metal center, increasing catalyst activity. Electron-donating groups reduce coordination efficiency.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the heterocycle or connected via a short aliphatic chain yield high reaction efficiency; those connected through an additional aromatic ring yield low efficiency.**

  - *Examples*:
    - **High Yield**: *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (nicotinic acid), *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*, *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid*.
    - **Low Yield**: *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*.
  - *Rationale*: Direct attachment or connection through a short chain allows effective coordination of the heterocyclic nitrogen with the catalyst's metal center. An additional aromatic ring introduces steric hindrance and electronic effects that reduce coordination efficiency.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal amino groups on short chains (five carbons or fewer) yield high efficiency; longer chains with terminal amino groups or acylated amino groups yield low efficiency.**

  - *Examples*:
    - **High Yield**: *5-aminopentanoic acid*.
    - **Low Yield**: *7-aminoheptanoic acid*, *8-aminooctanoic acid*, *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid*.
  - *Rationale*: Short-chain amino acids maintain the amino group in proximity to the carboxyl group, facilitating bidentate coordination. Longer chains introduce flexibility and distance, reducing coordination efficiency. Acylation of amino groups blocks coordination sites.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group yield high efficiency due to enhanced coordination capability.**

  - *Example*:
    - **High Yield**: *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (gluconic acid).
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites, increasing binding affinity to the catalyst's metal center.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains capable of coordination yield high efficiency; those with non-heteroaromatic or acylated side chains yield low efficiency.**

  - *Examples*:
    - **High Yield**: *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (tryptophan).
    - **Low Yield**: *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (phenylalanine), *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid*.
  - *Rationale*: Heteroaromatic side chains with accessible coordination sites enhance metal binding. Non-heteroaromatic side chains lack these sites, and acylation hinders coordination.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional bulky or highly polar functional groups yield high efficiency; those with bulky substituents or long, flexible polar chains yield low efficiency.**

  - *Examples*:
    - **High Yield**: *Octanoic acid*.
    - **Low Yield**: *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*, *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*.
  - *Rationale*: Minimal steric hindrance and limited polarity near the coordination site allow better interaction with the catalyst. Bulky or flexible polar groups reduce effective coordination.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing long polyether chains or flexible linkers yield low efficiency due to steric hindrance and decreased coordination efficiency with the metal center.**

  - *Example*:
    - **Low Yield**: *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*.
  - *Rationale*: Flexible chains introduce steric bulk and flexibility that hinder precise interaction with the catalyst's active sites.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups such as perfluoroalkyl or trifluoromethyl groups yield low efficiency due to decreased electron density and possible steric effects.**

  - *Example*:
    - **Low Yield**: *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups reduce the ligand's ability to donate electrons to the metal center, weakening coordination.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with aldehyde (formyl) groups on the aromatic ring yield low efficiency due to decreased electron density and potential competition at coordination sites.**

  - *Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**: *4-formylbenzoic acid*, *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups are electron-withdrawing and may participate in side reactions or interfere with metal coordination.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol (sulfhydryl) groups directly attached to the aromatic ring yield low efficiency due to potential catalyst poisoning from strong metal-thiol binding.**

  - *Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**: *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid*.
  - *Rationale*: Thiol groups can bind irreversibly to metal centers, deactivating the catalyst.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are keto acids (carboxylic acids containing additional carbonyl groups near the carboxyl group) yield low efficiency due to competition for coordination and potential chelation that inhibits catalysis.**

  - *Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**: *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*, *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*.
  - *Rationale*: Additional carbonyl groups can create competing coordination sites or form stable chelates that reduce catalyst activity.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl or amino groups located far from the carboxyl group yield low efficiency due to reduced ability to form effective coordination complexes.**

  - *Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**: *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*, *7-aminoheptanoic acid*, *8-aminooctanoic acid*.
  - *Rationale*: Functional groups distant from the carboxyl group are less likely to coordinate simultaneously, reducing binding strength.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with methoxy groups and additional coordinating functionalities yield high efficiency due to enhanced electron density and multiple coordination sites.**

  - *Example*:
    - **High Yield**: *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid*.
  - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups increase electron density on the aromatic ring, and additional functional groups provide multiple coordination points, enhancing catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic systems containing adjacent carbonyl and hydroxyl groups yield high efficiency due to potential for strong coordination without catalyst inhibition.**

  - *Example*:
    - **High Yield**: *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*.
  - *Rationale*: The arrangement of functional groups allows effective coordination with the metal center while maintaining catalyst activity.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal thiol groups yield variable efficiency; small thiol-containing acids may yield high efficiency due to effective coordination, while larger ones may cause catalyst poisoning and yield low efficiency.**

  - *Example*:
    - **High Yield**: *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*.
  - *Rationale*: Small thiol-containing modifiers can enhance coordination without significantly deactivating the catalyst, whereas larger thiols may bind too strongly.

These rules have been thoughtfully developed to accurately represent the relationship between molecular modifiers' structural features and the reaction yield. They consider the combination of functional groups and physical-chemical properties, such as electronic effects, steric hindrance, and coordination potential, providing clear predictions for high or low yields. The rules balance simplicity and complexity, aiming for broad coverage of the dataset while highlighting key structural influences on the catalyst's performance.---------------------------------------------------------------
