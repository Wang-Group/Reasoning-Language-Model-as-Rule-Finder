"Rule 1: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with substituents capable of coordination through lone pair electrons at the para position (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl) yield high reaction efficiency; those with electron-donating groups or non-coordinating substituents at the para position yield low efficiency.**",Rule 2: **Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the heterocycle or connected via a short aliphatic chain yield high reaction efficiency; those connected through an additional aromatic ring yield low efficiency.**,Rule 3: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal amino groups on short chains (five carbons or fewer) yield high efficiency; longer chains with terminal amino groups or acylated amino groups yield low efficiency.**,Rule 4: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group yield high efficiency due to enhanced coordination capability.**,Rule 5: **Modifiers that are amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains capable of coordination yield high efficiency; those with non-heteroaromatic or acylated side chains yield low efficiency.**,"Rule 6: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional bulky or highly polar functional groups yield high efficiency; those with bulky substituents or long, flexible polar chains yield low efficiency.**",Rule 7: **Modifiers containing long polyether chains or flexible linkers yield low efficiency due to steric hindrance and decreased coordination efficiency with the metal center.**,Rule 8: **Modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups such as perfluoroalkyl or trifluoromethyl groups yield low efficiency due to decreased electron density and possible steric effects.**,Rule 9: **Modifiers with aldehyde (formyl) groups on the aromatic ring yield low efficiency due to decreased electron density and potential competition at coordination sites.**,Rule 10: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol (sulfhydryl) groups directly attached to the aromatic ring yield low efficiency due to potential catalyst poisoning from strong metal-thiol binding.**,Rule 11: **Modifiers that are keto acids (carboxylic acids containing additional carbonyl groups near the carboxyl group) yield low efficiency due to competition for coordination and potential chelation that inhibits catalysis.**,Rule 12: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl or amino groups located far from the carboxyl group yield low efficiency due to reduced ability to form effective coordination complexes.**,Rule 13: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with methoxy groups and additional coordinating functionalities yield high efficiency due to enhanced electron density and multiple coordination sites.**,Rule 14: **Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic systems containing adjacent carbonyl and hydroxyl groups yield high efficiency due to potential for strong coordination without catalyst inhibition.**
