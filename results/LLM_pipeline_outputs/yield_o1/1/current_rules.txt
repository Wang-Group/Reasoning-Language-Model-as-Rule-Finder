**Start of Rules**

---

**Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *electron-withdrawing groups* (e.g., nitro, amino, bromomethyl) at the *para position* result in a **high yield**.**

- **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups enhance the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxylate ion, improving interaction with metal centers.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(High Yield)*
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** *(High Yield)*
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** *(High Yield)*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(Low Yield)* (methyl is electron-donating)
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(Low Yield)* (aldehyde may form intramolecular interactions)
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(Low Yield)* (bulky substituent causes steric hindrance)

---

**Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are *aliphatic carboxylic acids* with *chain lengths of 4–8 carbons* and *no additional polar functional groups* result in a **high yield**.**

- **Explanation**: Medium-length aliphatic chains without polar groups allow optimal interaction with the catalyst surface, enhancing activity.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - **Octanoic acid** *(High Yield)*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(Low Yield)* (hydroxyl group introduces polarity)
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(Low Yield)* (amino group adds polarity and potential interference)

---

**Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are *amino acids* with *short aliphatic side chains* (≤5 carbons) and *no bulky or additional polar groups* result in a **high yield**.**

- **Explanation**: Short side chains without steric hindrance facilitate effective metal coordination through the amino and carboxyl groups.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid** *(High Yield)*
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)** *(High Yield)*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(Low Yield)* (longer chain length)
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(Low Yield)* (additional acetamido group adds steric bulk)

---

**Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are *carboxylic acids* with *adjacent multiple hydroxyl groups* near the carboxyl group result in a **high yield**.**

- **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can chelate metal ions alongside the carboxylate, enhancing coordination.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)** *(High Yield)*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(Low Yield)* (hydroxyl group distant from carboxylate)

---

**Rule 5**: **Modifiers that contain *thiol groups* in *short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids* result in a **high yield**; when the thiol group is on an *aromatic ring*, they result in a **low yield**.**

- **Explanation**: In aliphatic acids, thiol groups effectively coordinate with metal ions; in aromatic systems, thiol availability is reduced due to resonance and steric factors.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(High Yield)*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** *(Low Yield)*

---

**Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *electron-donating groups* (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxy) at the *para position* result in a **low yield**.**

- **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups decrease carboxylate acidity and coordination ability, reducing effectiveness.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(Low Yield)*
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** *(Low Yield)*
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** *(Low Yield)*

---

**Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are *carboxylic acids* with *ether linkages* in the aliphatic chain result in a **low yield**.**

- **Explanation**: Ether linkages introduce flexibility and electron-donating oxygen atoms, potentially interfering with metal coordination.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(Low Yield)*
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** *(Low Yield)*

---

**Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are *perfluorinated carboxylic acids* result in a **low yield**.**

- **Explanation**: Strong electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms excessively reduce electron density on the carboxylate, hindering coordination.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(Low Yield)*

---

**Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are *heteroaromatic carboxylic acids* (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole rings) result in a **high yield**, unless steric hindrance is introduced by *bulky substituents*.**

- **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings enhance metal coordination; bulky groups can obstruct this interaction.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(High Yield)*
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** *(High Yield)*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(Low Yield)* (bulky pyridinyl group causing steric hindrance)

---

**Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are *amino acids* with *aromatic side chains containing nitrogen heterocycles* result in a **high yield**; those with *aromatic hydrocarbon side chains* result in a **low yield**.**

- **Explanation**: Nitrogen-containing side chains can coordinate with metals, enhancing activity, while hydrocarbon side chains lack this capability.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)** *(High Yield)*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)** *(Low Yield)*

---

**Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are *dicarboxylic acids* with *additional coordinating groups* (e.g., amino groups) result in a **high yield**; those without additional groups result in a **low yield**.**

- **Explanation**: Additional coordinating groups enhance metal binding; without them, dicarboxylic acids may bind unproductively.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)** *(High Yield)*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** *(Low Yield)*

---

**Rule 12**: **Modifiers with *bulky substituents or acyl groups* near coordinating sites (e.g., amino or carboxyl groups) result in a **low yield**.**

- **Explanation**: Bulky groups near coordination sites hinder effective metal-ligand interactions due to steric hindrance.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(Low Yield)*
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** *(Low Yield)*

These **12 rules** provide a structured understanding of how combinations of functional groups in molecular modifiers influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By considering factors such as electronic effects, steric hindrance, chain length, and the presence of coordinating atoms or groups, these rules help predict whether a given modifier will result in a high or low yield. This knowledge can guide the design and selection of effective modifiers to optimize catalytic performance in this reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------
