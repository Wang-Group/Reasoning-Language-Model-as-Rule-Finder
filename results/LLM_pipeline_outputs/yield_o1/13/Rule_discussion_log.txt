Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and specifies a well-defined structural feature (α-amino acids with extra carboxylic acid groups) leading to high yield. The property insight is adequate, explaining how the extra carboxylate group enhances metal coordination. The rule involves a combination of substructures, satisfying the complexity criterion. It is supported by at least two data points ((2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid and (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid), meeting the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 successfully differentiates between modifiers based on the size of the aromatic side chain in α-amino acids, leading to clear predictions about yield. The property insight is reasonable, attributing enhanced performance to additional coordination or π-interactions from larger aromatic systems. The rule combines structural features, meeting the complexity criterion. It is supported by data for tryptophan (high yield) and phenylalanine (low yield), satisfying the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 provides a clear guideline based on the proximity of amino or thiol groups to the carboxylic acid, effectively distinguishing high and low yield modifiers. The property insight explains the role of chelation when functional groups are close to the carboxyl group. Complexity is adequately addressed by considering the functional group position relative to the carboxylic acid. The rule has good coverage, supported by multiple data points for both high yield (5-aminopentanoic acid, 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) and low yield (7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) modifiers.

- **Comment 4**: While Rule 4 is clear and the property insight is logical, the presence of 4-aminobenzoic acid as a high yield modifier suggests an exception, since amino groups are electron-donating. This indicates that the rule may not fully account for all substituent effects, particularly the coordination ability of amino groups. The complexity is adequate, but the conflicting data point suggests the rule may need refinement. Coverage is sufficient but may be improved by addressing such exceptions.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear and directly relates the presence of pyridine rings to the modifier's effectiveness, based on their ability to coordinate with metal centers. The property insight is solid, reflecting known coordination chemistry. Complexity is appropriate, considering both direct attachment and short-chain connections to the carboxylic acid. The rule is well-supported by multiple data points showing high yield, satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear, straightforward, and explains why aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acids lead to low yield due to potential side reactions or catalyst inhibition. The property insight is logical. Complexity is suitable, focusing on specific functional group arrangements. The rule is properly supported by data points showing low yield for such modifiers, meeting the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear in asserting that sugar acids lead to high yield due to multiple hydroxyl groups enhancing metal coordination. The property insight is sound. However, the coverage is limited to a single data point (gluconic acid), which doesn't fully satisfy the coverage criterion requiring at least two supporting data points. The rule may need more data to strengthen its validity.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear and identifies extensive ether linkages as detrimental to catalyst efficiency, with a reasonable property insight concerning steric hindrance and flexibility. Complexity is appropriate, focusing on polyether structures. The rule meets the coverage criterion with at least two data points showing low yield for such modifiers.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear, associating fluorinated modifiers with low yield due to reduced electron density affecting metal coordination. The property insight is credible. Complexity is appropriate, focusing on specific functional groups. The rule is adequately supported by at least two data points showing low yield, satisfying the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10's clarity is moderate, as "moderate chain length" is relative and may lack precision. The property insight is general, citing a balance of properties without specifics. Complexity is low, focusing on a single feature. Coverage is limited to one data point (octanoic acid), which doesn't meet the criterion of at least two supporting data points. The rule may need refinement and additional data support.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear but seems to conflict with Rule 4, where electron-donating groups on benzoic acids are associated with low yield. The property insight suggests that amino groups can coordinate with metals, which may override the general effect of electron-donating groups decreasing acidity. Complexity is moderate. However, coverage is limited to a single data point (4-aminobenzoic acid), which doesn't fully satisfy the coverage criterion. The rule may need to be reconciled with Rule 4 for consistency.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is clear and distinguishes the effect of thiol groups based on whether they are on aromatic or aliphatic systems. The property insight provides a reasonable explanation for the observed difference in yields. Complexity is adequate, involving substructures and their context. The coverage is sufficient with at least two data points supporting the rule.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear, stipulating the effect of chain length on modifiers with bulky aromatic groups. The property insight is reasonable. Complexity is appropriate, considering both chain length and aromatic substitution. The rule is adequately supported by data points showing the expected yields for modifiers with longer and shorter chains, satisfying the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 is clear in identifying acylated amino groups as leading to low yield due to reduced coordination ability. The property insight is logical. Complexity is moderate. However, coverage is insufficient, as only one data point supports the rule. Additional data points would strengthen its validity.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 is somewhat broad but provides a clear guideline that modifiers with reactive groups capable of binding irreversibly to the catalyst lead to low yield. The property insight is acceptable. Complexity is higher due to the variety of functional groups involved. The rule is supported by at least two data points showing low yield with such modifiers, satisfying the coverage criterion. However, there is overlap with Rule 6, which may indicate redundancy.

      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-hydroxy groups** connected via a **long aliphatic chain (five carbons or more)** give **high yield**, while those with **shorter chains** give **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Longer aliphatic chains may position the hydroxy and carboxylic groups optimally for simultaneous interaction with the catalyst's metal centers, enhancing binding and activity. Shorter chains may not provide the necessary spatial arrangement.

  - **Examples Covered**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers that are **N-acetylated amino acids** give **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: N-acetylation blocks the amino group's ability to coordinate with metal centers, reducing the overall coordination capacity of the molecule.

  - **Examples Covered**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups** directly attached to the ring give **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Thiol groups on aromatic rings can form strong, sometimes irreversible bonds with metal centers, potentially poisoning the catalyst or altering its activity.

  - **Examples Covered**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers containing **oxygenated heterocycles with carboxylic acid groups** (e.g., benzofuran derivatives) give **high yield**.*

The rule effectively combines amino and dicarboxylic acid functional groups, adding appropriate complexity. Coverage includes two examples supporting high yield, which suffices but could be improved. Overall, the rule balances complexity and coverage well.

- **Comment 3**:
  
  Rule 3 provides a useful guideline linking electronic effects at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids to yield outcomes. The property insight is strong, explaining how electron-withdrawing groups enhance coordination through increased acidity. However, the clarity could be improved, as determining the electron-donating or -withdrawing nature of substituents may not be straightforward for all users. The rule has appropriate complexity, considering both functional groups and electronic effects, with balanced examples supporting both high and low yields.

- **Comment 4**:
  
  Rule 4 is clear in specifying that amino or thiol groups within three carbons of the carboxyl group lead to high yield, making it straightforward to apply. The property insight is solid, explaining the importance of chelate ring formation in catalyst activity. The rule appropriately considers the combination of functional group type and their positioning, adding necessary complexity. With balanced coverage of high and low yield examples, the rule is well-supported.

- **Comment 5**:
  
  Rule 5 is clear and specifies that polyhydroxy carboxylic acids lead to high yield, making it easy to apply. The property insight is well-articulated, illustrating how multiple hydroxyl groups enhance coordination through multidentate interactions. The rule considers the combination of polyhydroxy functionality and carboxylic acid, adding adequate complexity. While coverage is limited to two high yield examples, it supports the rule sufficiently.

- **Comment 6**:
  
  Rule 6 is clear, indicating that long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups give high yield. The property insight explains the role of hydrophobic interactions in enhancing catalytic efficiency. The rule appropriately considers chain length and functional group absence, adding necessary complexity. However, coverage is minimal, with only one high yield and one low yield example, limiting the robustness of the rule. Overall, the rule could benefit from additional supporting data.

- **Comment 7**:
  
  Rule 7 clearly states that modifiers with electronegative fluorinated groups result in low yield. The property insight is logical, linking electron withdrawal by fluorine to decreased coordination ability. The rule is straightforward, focusing on the presence of fluorinated groups. Coverage is limited, with only two examples, which supports the rule but suggests that more data could strengthen it.

- **Comment 8**:
  
  Rule 8 effectively states that modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acid give low yield, and is clear in its description. The property insight is sound, explaining how nearby carbonyl groups can interfere with coordination. The rule considers structural combinations, adding appropriate complexity. With three supporting examples showing low yield, the rule is well-supported and balanced.

- **Comment 9**:
  
  Rule 9 clearly indicates that modifiers with extensive ether linkages or polyether chains lead to low yield. The property insight is reasonable, suggesting potential steric hindrance and metal ion sequestration. The rule adds complexity by considering the structural motif of polyether chains. Coverage is limited to two low-yield examples, providing some support, but more data could strengthen the rule.

  Rule 11 clearly indicates that aromatic carboxylic acids with para-thiol groups give low yield. The property insight is plausible, as strong binding by thiol groups can lead to catalyst poisoning. However, the rule is based on a single example, limiting its generality and coverage. Additional supporting data would be needed to strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 12**:
  
  Rule 12 indicates that aromatic carboxylic acids with para-amino groups give high yield, and is clear in its definition. The property insight is valid, suggesting enhanced coordination via chelation. However, the rule is supported by only one example, which limits its robustness. Additional examples would help confirm the generality of the rule.

- **Comment 13**:
  
  Rule 13 addresses the impact of electron-donating groups on aromatic carboxylic acids, generally associating them with low yield but allowing for exceptions with additional coordinating features. While the property insight is good, explaining the effect on acidity and coordination, the clarity suffers due to the exception clause, making it less straightforward to apply. The rule considers combinations of functional groups, adding complexity. Coverage includes examples of both low yield and a high yield exception, but the varying outcomes may reduce predictability.

- **Comment 14**:
  
  Rule 14 is clear in stating that aliphatic carboxylic acids with distant hydroxyl groups give low yield. The property insight logically explains the minimal coordination contribution and potential steric effects. However, with only one supporting example, coverage is insufficient to fully validate the rule. Additional data would be beneficial for confirming its applicability.

- **Comment 15**:
  
  Rule 15 clearly states that modifiers with aromatic oxygen heterocycles attached to carboxylic acids give high yield. The property insight is sound, highlighting the contribution of oxygen heterocycles to coordination. However, the rule is based on a single example, limiting its generality and coverage. More examples would help to reinforce the validity of this rule.

**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows us to determine that modifiers which are α-amino dicarboxylic acids give high yield. The property insight is strong, explaining that multidentate coordination through both an amino group adjacent to a carboxylate and a second carboxylate group enhances metal-ligand interactions. The rule considers combinations of substructures (amino and multiple carboxylate groups). It is supported by two data points: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid and (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, meeting the coverage criterion. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear in stating that aromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen heterocycles give high yield. The property insight is adequate, highlighting that nitrogen atoms in heterocycles coordinate with metal ions, enhancing catalyst stability and activity. The rule involves combinations of substructures (aromatic ring, carboxyl group, nitrogen heterocycle). It is supported by multiple data points, including pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, satisfying the coverage requirement. The balance between complexity and coverage is well-maintained.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 clearly indicates that aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position give high yield. The property insight explains that such groups increase acidity, enhancing coordination with metal ions. The rule considers specific substructures (electron-withdrawing group at para position). It is supported by two data points: 4-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid. The balance between specificity and coverage is good.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear, stating that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position give low yield. The property insight appropriately explains that these groups decrease acidity and weaken metal coordination. The rule involves combinations of substructures (aromatic ring, carboxyl group, electron-donating group). With three supporting data points, including 4-methylbenzoic acid, the coverage is sufficient. The rule achieves a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 clearly states that aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino or thiol groups within three carbons of the carboxyl group give high yield. The property insight explains that proximal functional groups enable stable chelation with metal ions, enhancing catalytic activity. The rule considers the combination of spatial arrangement and functional groups. It is supported by two data points: 5-aminopentanoic acid and 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear in indicating that aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino or hydroxyl groups more than three carbons away from the carboxyl group give low yield. The property insight explains the reduced effectiveness of distant functional groups in metal coordination. The rule considers spatial factors within the molecular structure. With three supporting data points, such as 7-aminoheptanoic acid, coverage is adequate. The balance between complexity and coverage is well-handled.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 suggests that long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups give high yield. While the rule is clear, the property insight about hydrophobic interactions is reasonable but somewhat general. However, coverage is limited to a single data point—octanoic acid—which does not meet the minimum requirement of two data points. The balance between simplicity and coverage could be improved by providing additional supporting examples.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 clearly states that polyhydroxy carboxylic acids give high yield. The property insight is strong, explaining that multiple hydroxyl groups offer numerous coordination sites for enhanced metal-ligand interactions. The rule involves complex substructures (multiple hydroxyl groups and carboxylic acid). It is supported by two data points: gluconic acid and another polyhydroxy acid. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear in stating that modifiers containing fluorinated alkyl chains give low yield. The property insight explains that fluorine's high electronegativity decreases coordinating ability and may introduce steric hindrance. The rule focuses on specific substructures (fluorinated chains). It is supported by two data points, including 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid. The balance between specificity and coverage is satisfactory.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 clearly indicates that modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid give low yield. The property insight appropriately discusses how resonance or hydrogen bonding reduces the availability of coordination sites. The rule considers specific functional group arrangements. With three supporting data points, such as 4-formylbenzoic acid, coverage is sufficient. The balance between complexity and coverage is well-managed.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear in stating that modifiers with extensive ether linkages or polyether chains give low yield. The property insight explains that these structures can cause steric hindrance or sequester metal ions. The rule focuses on specific substructures. It is supported by two data points: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid and 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid. The balance between specificity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 clearly states that modifiers with amide bonds or N-acetylated amino groups give low yield unless compensated by other coordinating features. The property insight explains that these modifications reduce the nitrogen's ability to coordinate with metal centers. The rule considers combinations of substructures and includes an exception clause. Supported by two data points, coverage meets the criterion. The balance between complexity and coverage is suitable.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 indicates that modifiers with thiol groups in the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids give low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning. The property insight is solid, explaining strong binding of thiols to metal centers. However, coverage is limited to a single data point—4-sulfanylbenzoic acid—which does not meet the minimum requirement. The balance could be improved by including additional examples to strengthen coverage.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 suggests that modifiers which are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-hydroxyl groups and extended aliphatic chains give high yield. While the property insight about enhanced hydrophobic interactions and potential hydrogen bonding is plausible, the rule is supported by only one data point—5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid. This limited coverage affects the rule's reliability. Improving coverage would enhance the balance between complexity and applicability.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 states that modifiers containing aromatic oxygen heterocycles attached to carboxylic acids give high yield. The property insight is reasonable, noting that oxygen heterocycles can provide additional coordination sites. However, the rule is supported by only one data point—1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid—falling short of the coverage criterion. Adding more examples would improve the balance between specificity and coverage.

The property insight appropriately explains how increased acidity from electron-withdrawing groups enhances metal coordination. The rule combines substructures (aromatic ring, carboxylic acid, para electron-withdrawing group), adding to its complexity. It is supported by at least two examples (4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid), meeting the coverage criterion. There is a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear in its description of aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino or thiol groups within three carbons of the carboxyl group resulting in high yield. The property insight is solid, discussing how proximal amino or thiol groups can form stable chelate rings with metal ions, enhancing coordination efficiency. The rule involves combinations of functional groups, adding complexity. It is supported by relevant examples (5-aminopentanoic acid, 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid), satisfying the coverage criterion. The rule balances complexity and coverage effectively.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear but has limited coverage, as it is supported by only one example (octanoic acid). The property insight about long hydrophobic chains enhancing interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst is reasonable. The rule is relatively simple, focusing on a single substructure (long aliphatic chain). However, the lack of at least two supporting data points does not satisfy the coverage requirement, reducing the rule’s robustness despite its potential applicability.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear and provides good property insight into how multiple hydroxyl groups in polyhydroxy carboxylic acids enhance metal-ligand interactions through multidentate chelation. The rule considers combinations of substructures (multiple hydroxyls and carboxyl group), adding appropriate complexity. It is supported by multiple examples (e.g., Gluconic Acid, 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid), satisfying the coverage criterion. The rule achieves a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear and explains why aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position and short aliphatic chains result in low yield. The property insight is sound, discussing how electron-donating groups decrease acidity and weaken metal coordination ability. The rule combines multiple substructures, adding complexity. It is supported by several examples (4-methylbenzoic acid, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid), meeting the coverage criterion. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear, specifying that modifiers with functional groups more than four carbons away from the carboxyl group give low yield. The property insight is adequate, explaining that distant functional groups are less effective in forming chelates due to insufficient proximity. The rule involves combinations of substructures, adding complexity. It is supported by multiple examples (7-aminoheptanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid), satisfying the coverage requirement. The rule maintains a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear, focusing on modifiers containing fluorinated alkyl chains leading to low yield. The property insight is appropriate, noting how fluorine's high electronegativity and hydrophobicity hinder metal coordination and catalyst interactions. The rule is relatively simple but is supported by multiple examples (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid, 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid), meeting the coverage criterion. The balance between simplicity and coverage is acceptable.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear, detailing how modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid result in low yield due to reduced availability of carboxylate oxygen for metal coordination. The property insight is valid, discussing resonance and intramolecular hydrogen bonding effects. The rule combines substructures (adjacent carbonyl and carboxylic acid), adding complexity. It is supported by multiple examples (4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid), satisfying the coverage criterion. The rule balances complexity and coverage effectively.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear, stating that modifiers with ether linkages or polyether chains give low yield due to steric hindrance and potential sequestration of metal ions. The property insight is adequate, explaining how these factors reduce the availability of active catalytic sites. The rule is supported by at least two examples (2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid), meeting the coverage requirement. The rule's complexity and coverage are appropriately balanced.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is clear but lacks sufficient coverage, being supported by only one example (4-sulfanylbenzoic acid). The property insight about potential catalyst poisoning due to thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings is sound. However, the rule does not meet the coverage criterion of at least two data points, limiting its reliability despite its clarity and insight.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear but only has one supporting example ((2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid, Phenylalanine), which does not meet the coverage requirement. The property insight about the absence of side-chain functional groups capable of effective metal coordination is reasonable. The rule involves combinations of substructures, adding complexity, but needs more data points to strengthen its validity and satisfy the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 is clear but only supported by a single example (1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid). The property insight is logical, discussing how oxygen atoms in aromatic heterocycles can coordinate with metal ions. However, the lack of additional supporting data points means the coverage criterion is not met, reducing confidence in the rule's general applicability.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 is somewhat complex but clear, combining extended aliphatic chains with electron-donating groups on aromatic rings to predict high yield due to combined hydrophobic and coordination effects. The property insight is acceptable, explaining the synergistic effects on catalytic activity. The rule is supported by at least two examples (5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-aminobenzoic acid), satisfying the coverage criterion. It maintains a good balance between complexity and coverage.
