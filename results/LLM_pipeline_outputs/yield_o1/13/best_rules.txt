**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are carboxylic acids containing a **pyridine ring** directly attached or connected via a short aliphatic chain (up to four carbons) give **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: The lone pair on the nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring can effectively coordinate with metal centers in the catalyst (Hf-TPY-MOL(Fe)), enhancing catalyst activity and stabilizing the active species.

  - **Examples Covered**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
      - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side-chain carboxylic acid groups** (e.g., aspartic acid and glutamic acid) give **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: The presence of two carboxylic acid groups and an amino group allows for multiple coordination sites with metal centers, forming stable chelate complexes that enhance catalyst reactivity.

  - **Examples Covered**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-withdrawing groups** at the para position (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl, amino) give **high yield**, while those with **electron-donating groups** (e.g., methyl, hydroxy) give **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing its ability to deprotonate and coordinate with metal centers. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and may hinder effective coordination due to increased electron density and potential steric hindrance.

  - **Examples Covered**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
      - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
      - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are **amino acids with side chains containing heterocyclic nitrogen atoms** (e.g., indole, pyrazole) give **high yield**, while those with **hydrophobic side chains** lacking heteroatoms (e.g., phenylalanine) give **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Heterocyclic nitrogen atoms can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity. Hydrophobic side chains without coordinating atoms do not contribute to metal binding and may reduce solubility or active site accessibility.

  - **Examples Covered**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino or thiol groups within three carbons** of the carboxyl group give **high yield**, while those with these groups **farther away** (six or more carbons) give **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Proximity of amino or thiol groups to the carboxylic acid allows for chelation with metal centers, forming stable five- or six-membered rings that enhance catalyst activity. Distant functional groups are less effective in coordination.

  - **Examples Covered**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids** (sugar acids) give **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites for metal binding and increase the solubility of the modifier, facilitating better interaction with the catalyst.

  - **Examples Covered**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
      - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-ylidene]amino]acetic acid**

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers containing **fluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups** give **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Fluorine's high electronegativity reduces electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening metal-ligand interactions. Additionally, fluorinated compounds may introduce steric hindrance and hydrophobicity, reducing catalyst effectiveness.

  - **Examples Covered**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**
      - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups** give **high yield**, while those with **hydroxy or amino groups distant** from the carboxylic acid give **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Simple aliphatic carboxylic acids can readily coordinate with metal centers without steric hindrance. Functional groups located far from the carboxylic acid do not contribute to coordination and may introduce unnecessary steric bulk or polar interactions that hinder catalyst performance.

  - **Examples Covered**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Octanoic acid**
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers containing **aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid** give **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Aldehyde or ketone groups near the carboxylic acid can form internal hydrogen bonds or react with metal centers, potentially deactivating the catalyst or competing with the desired coordination sites.

  - **Examples Covered**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers with **extensive ether linkages or polyether chains** give **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Polyether chains introduce flexibility and can create steric hindrance, reducing effective coordination with metal centers. They may also solvate metal ions, interfering with catalyst activity.

  - **Examples Covered**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-hydroxy groups** connected via a **long aliphatic chain (five carbons or more)** give **high yield**, while those with **shorter chains** give **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Longer aliphatic chains may position the hydroxy and carboxylic groups optimally for simultaneous interaction with the catalyst's metal centers, enhancing binding and activity. Shorter chains may not provide the necessary spatial arrangement.

  - **Examples Covered**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers that are **N-acetylated amino acids** give **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: N-acetylation blocks the amino group's ability to coordinate with metal centers, reducing the overall coordination capacity of the molecule.

  - **Examples Covered**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups** directly attached to the ring give **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Thiol groups on aromatic rings can form strong, sometimes irreversible bonds with metal centers, potentially poisoning the catalyst or altering its activity.

  - **Examples Covered**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers containing **oxygenated heterocycles with carboxylic acid groups** (e.g., benzofuran derivatives) give **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Oxygen atoms in heterocycles can coordinate with metal centers, and the planar aromatic structure may facilitate π-interactions, enhancing catalyst performance.

  - **Examples Covered**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers with **amide linkages adjacent to the carboxylic acid** where the amide nitrogen is further substituted (e.g., acetylated) give **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Substituted amide nitrogens are less available for coordination due to electron delocalization and steric hindrance, reducing their effectiveness in enhancing catalyst activity.

  - **Examples Covered**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**
