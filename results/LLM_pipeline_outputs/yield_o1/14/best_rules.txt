**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids containing a free (unprotected) amino group within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The proximity of the amino group to the carboxyl group enhances metal coordination through chelation, improving catalyst performance.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid *(L-Aspartic acid)*
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid *(L-Glutamic acid)*
    - 5-aminopentanoic acid
    - 4-aminobenzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Counterexamples*:
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid *(Amino group distant from carboxyl group)*
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with a short linker (less than four carbons) between the carboxyl group and the aromatic ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Short linkers limit flexibility, hindering optimal metal coordination. The proximity to the aromatic ring may also introduce steric hindrance and electronic effects that reduce effectiveness.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *High Yield Counterexamples*:
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid *(Longer linker chain)*
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with an aliphatic chain of four or more carbons separating the carboxyl group from the ring** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility and reduce steric hindrance, facilitating better metal coordination and interaction with the catalyst.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid *(Shorter linker chain, low yield)*

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with long, unbranched carbon chains (six or more carbons)** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Long aliphatic chains may enhance hydrophobic interactions and allow for optimal alignment with the metal center, improving catalyst performance.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - Octanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid *(Presence of hydroxyl group may interfere with coordination)*

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that **contain amide bonds involving the amino group or near the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide formation decreases the availability of free amino or carboxyl groups for metal coordination, diminishing the modifier's effectiveness.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to a nitrogen-containing aromatic ring** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Direct attachment allows the heteroatom (e.g., nitrogen) to participate in metal coordination, enhancing interaction with the catalyst.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid *(Nicotinic acid)*
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid *(Carboxyl group not directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring)*

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that contain **strongly electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups (e.g., trifluoromethyl, perfluoroalkyl)** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: These groups decrease the electron density of the carboxylate, reducing its ability to coordinate with metal centers effectively.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
    - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids containing ether linkages within the carbon chain** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether linkages increase chain flexibility and may disrupt the optimal conformation required for effective metal coordination.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups attached to the ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can participate in side reactions or form intramolecular interactions, interfering with metal coordination and decreasing catalyst efficiency.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids (sugar acids) or contain multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites, enhancing interaction with the metal catalyst through chelation.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid *(Gluconic acid)*
    - 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers containing **peptide bonds or are peptides** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Peptide bonds reduce the availability of free amino and carboxyl groups for metal coordination, diminishing the modifier's effectiveness in enhancing the catalyst.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid
