**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids** (having both an amino group and a carboxyl group attached to the same carbon) predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The α-amino and carboxyl groups can act as bidentate ligands, chelating metal centers and enhancing catalyst performance through strong coordination bonds.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (L-Aspartic acid)
    - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (L-Glutamic acid)
    - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (L-Tryptophan)
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyl-L-Lysine; acylation reduces amino group availability for coordination)

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-withdrawing groups at the para position** predict a **high yield**; those with **electron-donating groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and hinder coordination.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *4-nitrobenzoic acid* (nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing)
    - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid* (bromomethyl group withdraws electrons)
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid* (amino group acts as an additional coordination site)
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (methyl group is electron-donating)
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (hydroxy group is electron-donating and too distant for effective coordination)

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids** containing **pyridine nitrogen atoms** predict a **high yield**, provided steric hindrance is minimal.
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles serve as additional coordination sites, strengthening interactions with metal centers.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
    - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid* (Chelidamic acid)
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (bulky structure introduces steric hindrance, impeding coordination)

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **long hydrocarbon chains (six or more carbons)** and **no polar substituents** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Hydrophobic chains enhance substrate access to active sites through favorable van der Waals interactions within the catalyst's environment.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *Octanoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid* (terminal amino group may interfere with catalyst interactions)
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that have **hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**; those with hydroxyl groups distant from the carboxyl group predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Adjacent hydroxyl groups can participate in chelation with metal centers, enhancing coordination. Distant hydroxyl groups are less effective.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
    - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (hydroxyl group is too distant to assist in coordination)

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that have **thiol groups within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**; those where the thiol group is part of an aromatic ring predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Proximal thiol groups enhance metal coordination through sulfur atoms. Aromatic thiols may have reduced availability due to resonance stabilization.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid* (3-Mercaptopropionic acid)
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* (thiol group is less available due to aromaticity)

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing **perfluoroalkyl groups** attached to the carboxyl group predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Strong electron-withdrawing perfluoroalkyl groups reduce electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening metal-ligand interactions.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the aromatic ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Adjacent carbonyl groups can interfere with metal coordination or engage in side reactions, reducing catalyst effectiveness.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that have **amide bonds involving the carboxyl group** or are **N-acetylated amino acids** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide formation reduces the availability of free carboxyl and amino groups necessary for effective metal coordination.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyl-L-Lysine)
    - *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **ether linkages** and **terminal polar groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether linkages increase molecular flexibility and distance between functional groups, reducing effective coordination with metal centers.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **bulky substituents near coordinating sites** predict a **low yield** due to steric hindrance.
  - *Rationale*: Bulky groups impede effective alignment and interaction with the metal center.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (biphenyl structure causes steric hindrance)
  - *High Yield Counterexample*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid* (additional methylene units alleviate steric effects)

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** where **polar functional groups** are located more than **four carbons away** from the carboxyl group predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Distant polar groups are less effective in metal coordination and may disrupt favorable interactions within the catalytic system.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **ortho-hydroxyl groups** predict a **high yield** due to the potential for chelation.
  - *Rationale*: Ortho-hydroxyl groups can form stable chelates with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid* (although containing an aldehyde, the ortho-hydroxyl can chelate)
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (hydroxyl group is not ortho to the carboxyl group)

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with **functional groups capable of intramolecular interactions** (e.g., hydrogen bonding) that **reduce availability** of coordinating sites predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Intramolecular interactions sequester functional groups, limiting their ability to coordinate with metal centers.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid* (complex intramolecular interactions)
    - *4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid*

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers containing **chelating groups** such as **adjacent carbonyl and hydroxyl groups** predict a **high yield** due to enhanced coordination.
  - *Rationale*: Chelating groups form strong, multidentate interactions with metal centers, stabilizing the catalyst.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid* (Chelidamic acid)

**End of Rules**

---

These rules combine multiple functional groups and consider underlying physicochemical properties such as coordination abilities, electron-withdrawing or -donating effects, steric hindrance, and potential for chelation. Each rule is designed to predict whether a modifier will result in a high or low yield based on its structural features, aiming to cover a broad range of the dataset. By balancing simple rules with higher coverage and more complex rules with specific conditions, these guidelines can effectively assist in selecting molecular modifiers to optimize the reaction yield.---------------------------------------------------------------
