- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and unambiguous, defining modifiers as α-amino dicarboxylic acids leading to high yield. The chemical insight is strong, as these compounds can effectively coordinate with metal centers due to their multiple coordination sites. The rule combines specific functional groups, adding appropriate complexity. It is supported by at least two data points (entries 0 and 2), satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 clearly specifies that ω-amino acids with chain lengths of 5 carbons or fewer lead to high yield, while longer chains lead to low yield. This reflects the impact of chain length on reactivity and coordination efficiency. The rule considers both the position of the amino group and chain length, providing suitable complexity. It is well-supported by multiple data points (entries 3, 31, and 34), fulfilling the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is explicit in stating that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing para-substituents result in high yield. The property insight is valid, as electron-withdrawing groups can enhance metal-ligand interactions. The rule effectively combines aromatic structure with substituent effects, adding complexity. It is backed by at least two data points (entries 1 and 20), meeting the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 clearly identifies modifiers containing pyridine carboxylic acid or pyridinone structures as leading to high yield. The chemical insight is strong, given the ability of nitrogen-containing heterocycles to coordinate with metal ions. The rule focuses on specific heterocyclic structures, adding appropriate complexity. Supported by data points (entries 8 and 21), it satisfies the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 lucidly states that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating para-substituents lead to low yield. The property insight aligns with the decreased coordination ability due to electron-donating groups. The rule combines structural elements and substituent effects, providing necessary complexity. It is supported by multiple data points (entries 10, 19, and 22), fulfilling the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 clearly indicates that modifiers with aldehyde (formyl) functional groups lead to low yield. The chemical insight is reasonable, considering that aldehyde groups may interfere with coordination or participate in side reactions. The rule is straightforward and focused. It is supported by at least two data points (entries 18 and 19), satisfying the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 defines long-chain hydroxycarboxylic acids (more than 6 carbons) as leading to low yield. While the rule is clear and the property insight considers steric hindrance, the coverage is limited, with only one supporting data point (entry 29). Additional data points are needed to strengthen this rule.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 distinctly differentiates between amino acids with polar or aromatic side chains (high yield) and those with nonpolar side chains (low yield). The property insight is solid, as side chain properties can influence interaction with the catalyst. The rule combines structural features and side chain characteristics, adding complexity. It is supported by at least two data points (entries 13 and 14), meeting the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 specifies that modifiers with sulfur groups adjacent to carboxylic acids on short chains lead to high yield, while those with sulfur on aromatic rings lead to low yield. The chemical insight is valid, emphasizing the importance of sulfur position in coordination. The rule combines functional group position and chain type, providing appropriate complexity. Supported by data points (entries 10 and 17), it meets the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 states that modifiers with acylated amino groups lead to low yield. While the rule is clear and the property insight is acceptable (acylation may block coordination sites), coverage is limited with only one clear supporting data point (entry 33). Additional data is necessary to strengthen this rule.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 clearly indicates that long-chain amino acids (more than 6 carbons) lead to low yield. The property insight considers steric effects hindering effective coordination. The rule is straightforward and adequately complex. It is supported by at least two data points (entries 31 and 34), satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 suggests that bulky substituents near the reactive site lead to low yield. While the property insight regarding steric hindrance is valid, the rule lacks clarity due to its generality—what constitutes a "bulky" group is not well-defined. Coverage is uncertain, as it is difficult to match specific data points without clearer definitions.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 states that modifiers containing trifluoromethyl groups lead to low yield. The rule is clear, and the property insight considers the strong electron-withdrawing effect of trifluoromethyl groups. However, coverage is limited to a single data point (entry 28), which is insufficient to fully support the rule.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 defines diacids with ketone groups in the chain as leading to low yield. While the rule is clear and the property insight may relate to coordination interference, it lacks sufficient coverage with only one supporting data point (entry 27). More data is needed to validate this rule.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 claims that simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups lead to high yield. The rule is clear, but the property insight is less apparent, as one might expect additional functional groups to enhance coordination. Coverage is limited with only one supporting data point (entry 5). Additional data points are necessary to confirm this rule.

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino dicarboxylic acids** (amino acids with an amino group on the α-carbon and two carboxyl groups), such as **L-aspartic acid** and **L-glutamic acid**, lead to **high yield**. These compounds can chelate metal ions effectively due to their multiple coordinating sites.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **ω-amino acids** with a carbon chain length of **5 or fewer carbons** (e.g., **5-aminopentanoic acid**) lead to **high yield**. The proximity of the amino and carboxyl groups allows efficient metal coordination. Those with **chain lengths longer than 5 carbons** (e.g., **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**) lead to **low yield** due to decreased coordination efficiency and increased flexibility hindering effective binding.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **para-substituents capable of coordinating with metal ions**, such as **amino**, **nitro**, or **bromomethyl** groups (e.g., **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**), lead to **high yield**. These substituents enhance metal coordination through additional donor atoms. Modifiers with **non-coordinating substituents** at the para position (e.g., **methyl** or **formyl** groups, as in **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**) lead to **low yield**.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids** where the heterocycle contains a **nitrogen atom capable of metal coordination** and is **directly attached** to the carboxyl group (e.g., **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**) lead to **high yield**. If the heterocycle is connected via additional rings or linkers (e.g., **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**), the yield is **low** due to steric hindrance and reduced coordination efficiency.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing **aldehyde functional groups** (e.g., **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**) lead to **low yield**. Aldehyde groups can interact unfavorably with the catalyst or interfere with metal coordination.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with **thiol (sulfhydryl) groups** on **short aliphatic chains** (e.g., **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**) lead to **high yield**. The thiol group effectively coordinates with metal ions. Modifiers with **thiol groups on aromatic rings** (e.g., **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**) lead to **low yield**, likely due to reduced thiol reactivity and steric hindrance.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **simple saturated aliphatic carboxylic acids** without additional functional groups (e.g., **octanoic acid**) lead to **high yield**. These modifiers do not interfere with metal coordination. In contrast, **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with distal polar functional groups** (e.g., **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**) lead to **low yield** due to potential intramolecular interactions and steric effects hindering coordination.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids** (e.g., **gluconic acid**) lead to **high yield**. The multiple hydroxyl groups enable strong chelation with metal ions, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking additional coordinating groups** (e.g., **L-phenylalanine**) lead to **low yield**. In contrast, those with **heteroaromatic side chains capable of coordination** (e.g., **L-tryptophan** with an indole ring) lead to **high yield** due to additional coordination sites.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with acylated amino groups** (e.g., **N-acetylated amino acids** like **N-acetyllysine**) lead to **low yield**. Acylation blocks the amino group's ability to coordinate with metal ions.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers containing **trifluoromethyl groups** or other **strong electron-withdrawing groups** (e.g., **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**) lead to **low yield**. These groups reduce electron density on potential coordinating atoms, hindering effective metal coordination.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic diacids with ketone groups** within the carbon chain (e.g., **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**) lead to **low yield**. The ketone group can interfere with metal coordination or create unfavorable interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **bulky substituents near the carboxyl group** causing **steric hindrance** (e.g., **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**, where a bulky pyridyl group is at the para position) lead to **low yield**. Steric effects can impede optimal coordination with the metal center.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with **flexible ether linkages and amino groups** (e.g., **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**) lead to **low yield**. The flexibility and electron-rich ether oxygens may disrupt coordination by forming unintended interactions or causing conformational issues.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups on the aromatic ring adjacent to the carboxyl group** (e.g., **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**, **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**) lead to **low yield**. The hydroxyl groups can form strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds or interfere with metal coordination sites.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 clearly differentiates between thiol groups on short aliphatic chains, which lead to high yield, and those on aromatic rings, which lead to low yield. It provides good property insight into thiol coordination and steric hindrance. The rule considers both functional group type and molecular structure but is supported by only one data point for each case (3-sulfanylpropanoic acid and 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid), indicating limited coverage.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear, explaining that simple saturated aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups lead to high yield, while those with distal polar functional groups lead to low yield.

It offers good property insight into the role of side chain structures in metal coordination. While the rule is well-defined, it is based on only two data points (L-phenylalanine and L-tryptophan), suggesting coverage could be improved.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 clearly indicates that amino acids with acylated amino groups lead to low yield due to blocked coordination sites. It provides reasonable property insight but lacks sufficient data support, being based on a single example (N-acetyllysine). More data points are needed to enhance coverage.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear about modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups leading to low yield by reducing electron density on coordinating atoms. It provides good property insight but is supported by only one data point (a trifluoroacetyl-containing compound), limiting its coverage and suggesting the need for additional examples.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 states that aliphatic diacids with ketone groups within the chain lead to low yield due to interference with metal coordination. It offers reasonable property insight but is based on a single data point (4-oxoheptanedioic acid), indicating minimal coverage and the need for more supporting data.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 addresses the impact of steric hindrance from bulky substituents near the carboxyl group leading to low yield. While it provides good property insight, the definition of "bulky" could be clearer. With only one supporting data point (4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid), coverage is limited, necessitating additional data for validation.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 is clear in identifying modifiers with flexible ether linkages and amino groups leading to low yield due to conformational issues. It offers good property insight and considers combinations of functional groups but is supported by only two data points, indicating moderate coverage.

However, there's an inconsistency as 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid shows high yield, contradicting the rule. This indicates that the rule may need revision or clarification to account for exceptions or additional influencing factors.

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino dicarboxylic acids** (amino acids with an amino group on the α-carbon and two carboxyl groups), such as **L-aspartic acid** and **L-glutamic acid**, lead to **high yield**. The presence of both amino and two carboxyl groups allows effective chelation with metal ions.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **ω-amino acids** with a carbon chain length of **five or fewer carbons**, such as **5-aminopentanoic acid**, lead to **high yield**. The close proximity of the amino and carboxyl groups facilitates efficient metal coordination. In contrast, ω-amino acids with **longer chains** (e.g., **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**) lead to **low yield** due to decreased coordination efficiency from increased chain length and flexibility.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **para-substituents capable of coordinating with metal ions**, such as **amino**, **nitro**, or **bromomethyl** groups (e.g., **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**), lead to **high yield**. These substituents provide additional coordination sites. Modifiers with **non-coordinating or electron-donating substituents** at the para position (e.g., **methyl**, **formyl**, as in **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**) lead to **low yield**.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids** where the heterocycle contains **nitrogen atoms capable of metal coordination** and is **directly attached** to the carboxyl group (e.g., **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**) lead to **high yield**. If the heterocycle is connected via additional rings or linkers (e.g., **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**), the yield is **low** due to steric hindrance and reduced coordination efficiency.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing **sulfur-containing functional groups**, such as **thiol (-SH)** groups on **short aliphatic chains** (e.g., **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**), lead to **high yield** due to strong metal coordination by sulfur. Modifiers with thiol groups on **aromatic rings** (e.g., **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**) lead to **low yield**, likely due to steric hindrance and reduced thiol reactivity in aromatic systems.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **simple saturated aliphatic carboxylic acids** without additional functional groups (e.g., **octanoic acid**) lead to **high yield**. These compounds allow unobstructed coordination with the metal center. Aliphatic carboxylic acids with **polar substituents at distal positions** (e.g., **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**) lead to **low yield**, possibly due to intramolecular interactions and steric effects hindering metal coordination.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids** (e.g., **gluconic acid**) lead to **high yield**. Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance chelation with metal ions, stabilizing the catalyst complex.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking additional coordinating groups** (e.g., **L-phenylalanine**) lead to **low yield** due to limited coordination sites. In contrast, those with **heteroaromatic side chains capable of coordination** (e.g., **L-tryptophan** with an indole ring) lead to **high yield**, as the heteroatoms provide additional coordination opportunities.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **aldehyde functional groups** adjacent to the aromatic ring or carboxyl group (e.g., **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**) lead to **low yield**. Aldehyde groups can interfere with metal coordination or react with other components in the system.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with strong **electron-withdrawing groups**, such as **trifluoromethyl** or **trifluoroacetyl** groups (e.g., **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**), lead to **low yield**. These groups reduce electron density on coordinating atoms, diminishing their ability to effectively bind metal ions.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with **flexible ether linkages and amino groups** (e.g., **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**) lead to **low yield**. The flexibility and electron-rich ether oxygens may disrupt coordination by forming non-ideal interactions or hindering proper alignment with the metal center.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** on the aromatic ring (e.g., **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**, **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**) lead to **low yield**. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding or competition for coordination sites may reduce their effectiveness in metal binding.

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with acidic side chains containing additional carboxyl groups** (e.g., **L-aspartic acid**, **L-glutamic acid**) lead to **high yield**. The extra carboxyl groups provide multiple coordination sites with metal ions, enhancing catalyst activity.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **ω-amino acids with short aliphatic chains of five carbons or fewer** (e.g., **5-aminopentanoic acid**) lead to **high yield**. The proximity of amino and carboxyl groups facilitates effective chelation with metal ions. In contrast, **longer-chain ω-amino acids** (e.g., **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**) lead to **low yield** due to decreased coordination efficiency caused by increased chain length.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position**, such as **nitro (-NO₂)** or **bromomethyl (-CH₂Br)** groups (e.g., **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**), lead to **high yield**. Electron-withdrawing groups enhance the acidity of the carboxyl group and promote stronger coordination with metal ions. Conversely, modifiers with **electron-donating groups** or groups that hinder coordination at the para position (e.g., **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**) lead to **low yield**.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen heteroatoms capable of metal coordination** (e.g., **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**) lead to **high yield**. The nitrogen atoms act as additional coordination sites, strengthening the interaction with metal ions.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with **thiol (-SH) groups on short aliphatic chains** (e.g., **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**) lead to **high yield** due to strong sulfur-metal coordination. However, modifiers with **thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings** (e.g., **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**) lead to **low yield**, likely because aromatic thiols are less nucleophilic and form weaker metal-thiol interactions.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms or functional groups**, such as **L-tryptophan** (indole ring capable of coordination), lead to **high yield**. In contrast, α-amino acids with side chains **lacking coordinating ability** (e.g., **L-phenylalanine**) lead to **low yield** due to limited interaction with metal ions.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **aldehyde groups adjacent to aromatic rings or carboxyl groups** (e.g., **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**) lead to **low yield**. Aldehyde groups may form unfavorable interactions or interfere with metal coordination sites, reducing catalyst effectiveness.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **flexible ether chains containing multiple ether linkages and polar functional groups** (e.g., **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**) lead to **low yield**. The flexibility and solvation of ether oxygens can disrupt effective metal coordination by increasing the spatial distance between coordinating sites and metal ions.

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxyl groups**, such as **L-aspartic acid** (`(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid`) and **L-glutamic acid** (`(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid`), lead to **high yield**. The additional carboxyl groups provide extra **coordination sites** for metal ions, enhancing catalyst stability through stronger **multidentate chelation**.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **ω-amino acids with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer**, like **5-aminopentanoic acid**, result in **high yield**. The close proximity of the amino and carboxyl groups allows for effective **bidentate coordination**, forming stable chelate rings with the metal ion. In contrast, **longer-chain ω-amino acids** (e.g., **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**) lead to **low yield** due to increased chain flexibility and reduced chelation efficiency.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing **heterocyclic rings with nitrogen atoms capable of metal coordination**, such as **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** and **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**, lead to **high yield**. The nitrogen atoms serve as additional **coordination sites**, strengthening the metal-ligand interaction and enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position**, like **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, result in **high yield**. Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, improving its ability to coordinate with the metal ion and form a stable catalytic complex.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents**, such as **4-methylbenzoic acid**, lead to **low yield**. Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening metal coordination and reducing catalyst effectiveness.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with **thiol (-SH) groups near the carboxyl group**, such as **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**, lead to **high yield** due to the strong ability of sulfur to coordinate with metal ions. Conversely, modifiers with **aromatic thiol groups** like **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** result in **low yield** because aromatic thiols are less nucleophilic and form weaker interactions with metal ions.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing **multiple hydroxyl groups** near the carboxyl functionality, such as **gluconic acid** (`(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid`), lead to **high yield**. The multiple hydroxyl groups enable **multidentate coordination** with the metal ion, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with **long aliphatic chains lacking additional coordinating groups**, like **octanoic acid** and **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, tend to result in **low yield**. The increased chain length and lack of extra coordination sites reduce effective interaction with the metal center, diminishing catalytic performance.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **aldehyde groups adjacent to aromatic rings or carboxyl groups**, such as **4-formylbenzoic acid** and **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**, lead to **low yield**. Aldehyde groups can interfere with metal coordination or participate in side reactions, reducing catalyst effectiveness.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **flexible, oxygen-rich ether chains** (e.g., **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**) result in **low yield**. The flexibility and solvation of ether chains can prevent effective coordination with the metal ion, weakening the catalyst-modifier interaction.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with non-coordinating side chains**, such as **L-phenylalanine** (`(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid`), lead to **low yield**. The absence of additional coordination sites in the side chain limits effective chelation with the metal ion.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **blocked coordination sites**, like **acetylated amino groups** in **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**, result in **low yield**. The blocking groups prevent the amino functionality from coordinating with the metal ion, reducing chelation efficiency.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers possessing **hydroxyl groups on aromatic rings connected via flexible aliphatic chains**, such as **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**, lead to **high yield**. The hydroxyl and carboxyl groups can simultaneously coordinate with the metal ion, and the flexible chain enables favorable conformations for **effective bidentate coordination**.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with **rigid, sterically hindered structures that prevent optimal coordination geometry**, like **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**, lead to **low yield**. Despite the presence of potential coordination sites, the spatial arrangement hinders effective chelation with the metal ion.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers containing **sulfonyl (-SO₂-) groups or strong electron-withdrawing substituents that do not coordinate effectively**, such as **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**, result in **low yield**. These groups can reduce the electron density on coordinating atoms or introduce steric hindrance, impairing metal-binding ability.

The rule considers combinations of substructures (α-amino acids and additional carboxyl groups), achieving a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 2**:
  Rule 2 clearly states that **ω-amino acids with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer** result in **high yield**, while **longer-chain ω-amino acids** lead to **low yield**. This is supported by data for **5-aminopentanoic acid** (high yield) and **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid** (both low yield). The rule provides adequate physical-chemical insight by linking chain length to chelation efficiency due to increased chain flexibility in longer chains. It effectively combines substructures (amino acids and chain length), with sufficient coverage and a good balance between complexity and applicability.

- **Comment 3**:
  Rule 3 specifies that modifiers containing **heterocyclic rings with nitrogen atoms capable of metal coordination** lead to **high yield**.

  Rule 4 states that **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position** result in **high yield**. While **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** support this rule with high yield, **4-formylbenzoic acid** contradicts it by showing low yield despite having an electron-withdrawing group. This indicates a lack of clarity and suggests possible exceptions not accounted for in the rule. The physical-chemical insight is reasonable, but the rule's coverage is weak due to conflicting data, affecting the balance between complexity and applicability.

- **Comment 5**:
  Rule 5 posits that **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents** lead to **low yield**. This is supported by **4-methylbenzoic acid** (low yield). However, **4-aminobenzoic acid** displays high yield despite the amino group being electron-donating, contradicting the rule. This inconsistency reduces the rule's clarity and suggests that additional factors may influence the outcome. The physical-chemical insight may be oversimplified, and the rule lacks sufficient coverage and balance.

- **Comment 6**:

However, coverage is limited to a single data point, affecting the rule's balance and general applicability.

- **Comment 13**:
  Rule 13 indicates that modifiers possessing **hydroxyl groups on aromatic rings connected via flexible aliphatic chains** lead to **high yield**. This is supported by **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** showing high yield. The rule is clear and provides good physical-chemical insight into effective bidentate coordination. Coverage is limited, which affects the rule's balance, but it effectively combines multiple structural features.

Coverage is good, supported by **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 states that **straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups** lead to **high yield**. While the rule is clear and offers physical-chemical reasoning regarding favorable interactions with the catalyst surface, coverage is limited to a single data point (**octanoic acid**). This insufficient coverage undermines the rule's robustness and suggests a need for additional supporting examples.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 specifies that modifiers with **blocked or sterically hindered coordination sites** result in **low yield**. The rule is clear and provides logical physical-chemical insight. However, coverage is inadequate, with only one supporting data point (**(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**). This insufficient coverage affects the rule's credibility and highlights the need for more data.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 indicates that modifiers with **flexible, oxygen-rich ether chains** lead to **low yield**.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 explains that modifiers containing **aromatic rings connected via flexible aliphatic chains of four carbons or more** lead to **high yield**. The rule is clear and provides good physical-chemical insight into favorable conformations for multidentate coordination. Complexity is high due to the consideration of multiple structural features. Coverage is adequate with two supporting modifiers: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** and **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 states that modifiers with **aromatic rings containing hydroxyl groups directly attached to the ring** lead to **low yield**. While the rule is clear and the physical-chemical reasoning is plausible, coverage is limited to a single data point (**3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**). Additionally, conflicting data (**4-hydroxybenzoic acid** not included) may challenge the rule's validity, indicating insufficient coverage and potential issues with clarity.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 specifies that modifiers with **ketone groups adjacent to carboxyl groups** lead to **low yield**. The rule is clear, and the physical-chemical insight regarding steric hindrance and electron density is sound. However, coverage is insufficient, supported only by **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**, affecting the rule's reliability and necessitating more supporting data.

Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, improving its ability to coordinate with metal ions and form stable catalytic complexes through stronger **metal-ligand interactions**.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-donating substituents** at the **para position**, such as **4-methylbenzoic acid**, lead to **low yield**. Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening metal coordination interactions and reducing catalyst effectiveness due to less favorable **metal-ligand bonding**. However, modifiers like **4-aminobenzoic acid** result in **high yield** because the amino group can also act as an additional **coordination site**, enhancing **chelation** with the metal ion.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing **nitrogen heterocycles** capable of coordinating with metal ions, such as **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**, and **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**, lead to **high yield**.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with **aldehyde groups** adjacent to aromatic rings or carboxyl groups, such as **4-formylbenzoic acid** and **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**, result in **low yield**. Aldehyde groups can interfere with metal coordination by forming competing complexes or undergoing side reactions, diminishing catalyst performance due to **unfavorable interactions**.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with **long aliphatic chains (more than 6 carbons)** bearing **polar functional groups** distant from the carboxyl group, such as **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** and **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, result in **low yield**. The increased chain length and separation of functional groups may impede effective coordination with metal ions due to **steric hindrance** and reduced **binding affinity**.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **multiple hydroxyl groups** near the carboxyl group, such as **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid), lead to **high yield**. The multiple hydroxyl groups provide **multidentate coordination sites**, increasing catalyst stability and reactivity through stronger and more numerous **metal-ligand bonds**.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that contain **ethoxy or polyether chains** near the carboxyl group, such as **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, lead to **low yield**. The presence of long **ether chains** may reduce the ability of the carboxyl group to coordinate with metal ions because of **solvation effects** and increased **steric hindrance**, weakening the **metal-ligand bonding** necessary for effective catalysis.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with **bulky aromatic side chains** in amino acids, such as **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (L-phenylalanine), result in **low yield**. The bulky side chains can cause **steric hindrance**, interfering with metal coordination and decreasing catalyst effectiveness due to obstructed **metal-ligand interactions**. In contrast, modifiers like **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (L-tryptophan) lead to **high yield**, possibly because the indole ring participates in coordination, enhancing **binding affinity**.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **N-acetylated amino groups**, such as **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**, result in **low yield**. Acetylation blocks the amino group's ability to coordinate with metal ions, limiting **chelation** and decreasing catalyst effectiveness due to reduced **metal-ligand interactions**.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that combine **aromatic rings** with **flexible aliphatic linkers** connecting to a **nitrogen heterocycle**, such as **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**, lead to **high yield**. The flexible linker allows the nitrogen-containing aromatic ring to effectively coordinate with the metal ion, enhancing catalyst reactivity through improved **binding orientation**. Conversely, modifiers with **rigid linkers** like **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** result in **low yield**, possibly due to **steric constraints** hindering effective metal coordination.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers containing **sulfhydryl (-SH) groups** attached to an **aromatic ring**, such as **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**, result in **low yield**. The aromatic system may decrease sulfur's reactivity or cause **steric hindrance**, affecting **coordination efficiency** and diminishing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with **aldehyde groups** in aliphatic chains, such as **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**, result in **low yield**. The presence of carbonyl groups may interfere with metal coordination or participate in side reactions, reducing catalyst effectiveness due to **unfavorable interactions**.

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and provides adequate physical-chemical insight by explaining how the presence of both amino and carboxyl groups on an aliphatic chain facilitates bidentate chelation, enhancing metal-ligand interactions. The rule considers combinations of functional groups on specific chain lengths, adding appropriate complexity. It is supported by multiple data points, specifically three modifiers in the dataset, which strengthens its coverage.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is well-defined and offers insightful reasoning regarding how para-position substituents capable of additional coordination can enhance metal binding. It effectively combines the aromatic carboxylic acid structure with various coordinating groups like amino, hydroxy, or bromo. The rule is supported by several data points, including **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**, and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**, demonstrating good coverage.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 lacks consistency with the dataset. While it suggests that modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups at the ortho or para positions result in a low yield, the data shows that **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, an example provided in the rule, actually results in a high yield. This contradiction indicates that the rule may not accurately predict the outcomes and requires reassessment or refinement.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear and provides solid property insight into how nitrogen heterocycles fused directly to the carboxyl group enhance chelation with metal ions. The complexity is appropriate, focusing on specific structural features. It is supported by at least two data points, namely **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** and **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**, which is acceptable coverage.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5, although clear and providing some property insight regarding the effect of long aliphatic chains, is only supported by a single data point, **octanoic acid**. This limited coverage reduces the reliability of the rule, and additional data points are needed to reinforce its validity.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 offers clarity and property insight into how multiple hydroxyl groups can enhance binding affinity through multidentate coordination. However, it is based on a single example, **gluconic acid**, which limits its coverage. More data points are necessary to substantiate this rule.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear and explains the role of thiol groups in promoting strong metal-sulfur bonds, enhancing chelation. Yet, the rule is supported by only one data point, **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**, which is insufficient for robust coverage.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear in its description and provides reasoning about how ether linkages can interfere with metal-ligand interactions. However, it is supported by only one example, **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, resulting in low coverage and reducing its overall reliability.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9, while clear and providing insight into steric hindrance caused by bulky aromatic side chains, is only supported by one data point, **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid**. The lack of additional data points weakens the rule's coverage and effectiveness.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 discusses how acylated amino groups diminish metal-binding capacity. Despite being clear and insightful, it is again supported by only one data point, **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**, limiting its coverage and reducing confidence in the rule's general applicability.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear and explains the impact of aldehyde groups on catalysis. However, it only has one supporting data point, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**, which is insufficient for strong coverage, suggesting a need for more evidence.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12, although clear, is supported by a single data point, **4-methylbenzoic acid**. The minimal coverage limits its reliability and suggests that the rule may not be robust enough without additional supporting data.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 provides a clear description and property insight regarding flexible linkers and nitrogen heterocycles enhancing metal-ligand interactions. However, it is based on a single example, **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**, which indicates low coverage and a need for more supporting data.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 is clear but is only supported by one data point, **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**. The limited coverage reduces the confidence level in this rule's applicability across other modifiers.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 is clear and provides property insight into how additional coordinating groups at specific positions can enhance catalysis. Nonetheless, it is supported by only one data point, **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid**, limiting its coverage and suggesting that further data is required to affirm the rule's validity.

The rule offers adequate physico-chemical insight by explaining that these structures facilitate effective bidentate chelation with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance. It considers combinations of sub-structures (amino and carboxyl groups with specific chain length), satisfying complexity. The rule is supported by multiple data points—(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid, and 5-aminopentanoic acid—all yielding high results, ensuring good coverage.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear in its description of aromatic carboxylic acids with a para-positioned amino (-NH₂) or hydroxy (-OH) group, without additional electron-withdrawing groups or steric hindrance, leading to a high yield. The rule provides adequate physico-chemical insight by stating that this configuration promotes strong metal-ligand coordination.

The rule is supported by at least two data points—4-aminobenzoic acid and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid—both showing high yield, ensuring good coverage.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 clearly specifies that modifiers are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups such as aldehyde (-CHO) or formyl groups at the para position, resulting in a low yield. The physico-chemical insight is adequate, explaining that these groups decrease electron density on the aromatic ring, weakening metal coordination. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures, satisfying complexity. It is well-supported by data points—4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid—both resulting in low yield, ensuring good coverage.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 describes modifiers containing pyridine rings directly attached to the carboxyl group or connected via a flexible aliphatic linker, resulting in a high yield due to the nitrogen atom acting as an additional coordination site. While the rule is clear and offers physico-chemical insight, there is inconsistency in the data. Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid result in a high yield, supporting the rule. However, 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid results in a low yield despite fitting the structural criteria, indicating that additional factors may influence the outcome. This inconsistency affects the rule's clarity and suggests it may require refinement.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear in stating that modifiers with long unbranched aliphatic chains (6 carbons or more) ending with a carboxyl group (-COOH) and no additional functional groups result in a high yield. The physico-chemical insight is that the hydrophobic chain may improve modifier incorporation into the catalyst framework. The rule combines chain length and functional groups, satisfying complexity.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 indicates that modifiers containing ether linkages (-O-), particularly with long polyether chains adjacent to the carboxyl group, result in a low yield. The rule provides physico-chemical insight by suggesting that ether oxygens introduce steric hindrance and disrupt optimal metal coordination. It combines structural features (ether linkages and carboxyl groups), satisfying complexity. However, the rule is supported by only one data point—2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid—resulting in low yield, which limits its coverage and overall reliability.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 specifies that modifiers which are amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains result in a low yield due to steric hindrance impeding access to metal centers. The rule is clear and provides adequate physico-chemical insight. It combines features of amino acids and bulky side chains, satisfying complexity. Coverage is limited to one data point—(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (L-phenylalanine)—which reduces the rule's robustness due to insufficient data support.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 states that modifiers with acylated amino groups, such as N-acetylation, result in a low yield because acylation reduces the amino group's ability to coordinate with metals. The rule is clear and offers physico-chemical insight. It combines acylated amino groups with carboxyl groups, satisfying complexity. However, coverage is limited to a single data point—(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid—limiting the rule's applicability.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 claims that modifiers containing sulfur groups attached to aromatic rings result in a low yield due to decreased electron density and increased steric bulk impairing metal coordination. The rule is clear and provides physico-chemical reasoning. It combines sulfur groups with aromatic carboxylic acids, satisfying complexity. The coverage is limited to one data point—4-sulfanylbenzoic acid—which affects the rule's strength due to insufficient supporting data.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 describes that modifiers which are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-alkyl substituents result in a low yield because alkyl groups do not aid in coordination and can cause steric hindrance. The rule is clear and offers physico-chemical insight. It combines alkyl substituents with aromatic carboxylic acids, satisfying complexity. Coverage is limited to one data point—4-methylbenzoic acid—limiting its overall reliability.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 specifies that modifiers with aldehyde groups (-CHO) adjacent to aromatic rings or the carboxyl group result in a low yield due to potential side reactions or formation of inactive complexes with metal ions. The rule is clear and provides adequate physico-chemical insight. It combines aldehyde groups with aromatic carboxylic acids, satisfying complexity. The rule is well-supported by two data points—4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid—both resulting in low yield, ensuring good coverage.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 indicates that modifiers with electron-donating methoxy groups (-OCH₃) on aromatic rings, especially when multiple methoxy groups are present, result in a high yield due to enhanced electron density strengthening metal-ligand interactions. The rule is clear and provides physico-chemical reasoning. It combines multiple methoxy groups with aromatic carboxylic acids, satisfying complexity. However, only one data point—4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid—supports this rule, limiting coverage.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 states that modifiers featuring flexible linkers between the carboxyl group and an aromatic ring containing additional coordination sites (e.g., pyridine nitrogen) result in a high yield due to optimal metal-ligand coordination. While the rule is clear and offers physico-chemical insight, there is inconsistency in the dataset. 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid yields a high result, supporting the rule, but 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid yields a low result despite fitting the structural criteria. This contradiction suggests that additional factors influence the yield, and the rule may require refinement to improve clarity and reliability.

  Rule 13 indicates that modifiers with thiol groups (**-SH**) attached to aromatic rings result in a low yield because aromatic thiols are less nucleophilic and less effective in coordinating with metal centers compared to aliphatic thiols. The rule is clear and provides chemical insight. It combines sub-structures (aromatic ring with thiol group), satisfying the complexity criterion. Supported by the data point **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**, the rule has limited coverage.

- **Comment 14**:

  Rule 14 states that modifiers with trifluoroacetyl groups or other strongly electron-withdrawing groups in the side chain can result in a low yield due to reduced electron density and steric bulk hindering metal coordination. The rule is clear and provides chemical insight. It combines sub-structures (electron-withdrawing groups and carboxylic acid), meeting the complexity criterion. The rule is supported by the data point **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**, but coverage is limited.

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids** with an **amino group (-NH₂)** on the **alpha or beta carbon** (first or second carbon from the carboxyl group) result in a **high yield**. This configuration facilitates effective chelation with metal ions due to the proximity of the amino and carboxyl groups.

  - **High Yield Examples**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid)
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan)

  - **Low Yield Exception**: If the side chain is a **bulky hydrophobic aromatic ring** without additional coordination sites, the yield is **low** due to steric hindrance interfering with metal coordination.
    - **Low Yield Example**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine)

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-donating groups** such as **amino (-NH₂)** or **hydroxyl (-OH)** directly attached to the **aromatic ring** result in a **high yield**. These groups enhance metal coordination by increasing electron density and providing additional coordination sites.

  - **High Yield Examples**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**

  - **Low Yield Exception**: If the aromatic carboxylic acid with electron-donating groups is connected via a **short aliphatic chain (3 carbons or fewer)**, the yield is **low**, possibly due to less flexible coordination.
    - **Low Yield Example**:
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **long hydrocarbon chains** (chain length of **5 carbons or more**) without additional functional groups result in a **high yield**. The hydrophobic chain may influence catalyst solubility or facilitate beneficial interactions within the catalyst framework.

  - **High Yield Example**:
    - **octanoic acid**

  - **Low Yield Exception**: If there are **functional groups** like **amino (-NH₂)** or **hydroxyl (-OH)** located **more than four carbons away** from the **carboxyl group**, the yield is **low** due to reduced likelihood of effective chelation.
    - **Low Yield Examples**:
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers containing **thiol groups (-SH)** on **short aliphatic chains** near the **carboxyl group** (on the second or third carbon) result in a **high yield**. Thiol groups form strong coordinate bonds with metal ions, enhancing catalyst activity.

  - **High Yield Example**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

  - **Low Yield Exception**: If the **thiol group (-SH)** is attached directly to an **aromatic ring**, the yield is **low** because aromatic thiols are less effective in metal coordination due to decreased nucleophilicity.
    - **Low Yield Example**:
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing **multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH)** near the **carboxyl group** result in a **high yield**, as they provide multiple coordination sites for metal binding, enhancing chelation.

  - **High Yield Example**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid)

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with **nitrogen-containing heterocycles** (e.g., **pyridine**, **pyrazole**) directly attached to the **carboxyl group** result in a **high yield** due to additional coordination through the nitrogen atom in the ring.

    - **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid)
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

  - **Low Yield Exception**: If the **heterocycle** is connected via an **aromatic ring** or **long aliphatic chain**, the yield is **low** due to reduced effectiveness in coordination.

      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **aldehyde groups (-CHO)** attached to the ring result in a **low yield**. Aldehyde groups are electron-withdrawing and can decrease electron density on the ring, weakening coordination with the metal center.

  - **Low Yield Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **amide bonds (-CONH-)** adjacent to the **carboxyl group** result in a **low yield**. The amide linkage can delocalize electron density, reducing the availability of lone pairs for metal coordination.

  - **Low Yield Examples**:
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **ether linkages (-O-)** in the side chain, especially **polyether chains**, near the **carboxyl group** result in a **low yield**. Ether groups can introduce steric hindrance and reduce the modifier's ability to coordinate effectively.

    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

  - **Low Yield Example**:
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with **bulky aromatic side chains** directly attached to the **alpha carbon** of amino acids result in a **low yield** if the side chain lacks additional coordination sites. Steric hindrance interferes with effective coordination.

  - **Low Yield Example**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine)

  - **High Yield Exception**: If the **bulky aromatic side chain** contains heteroatoms capable of coordination (e.g., **indole ring**), the yield is **high**.
    - **High Yield Example**:
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan)

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **methyl groups (-CH₃)** attached to the ring result in a **low yield**. Methyl groups are weakly electron-donating but can cause steric hindrance, affecting coordination negatively.

  - **Low Yield Example**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **ketone groups (-C=O)** in the carbon chain adjacent to the **carboxyl group** result in a **low yield**. Ketone groups can interfere with coordination due to electron-withdrawing effects and steric considerations.

  - **Low Yield Example**:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **dicarboxylic acids** with **electron-withdrawing groups** in the chain result in a **low yield**. Multiple acidic sites and electron-withdrawing groups can reduce the effectiveness of metal coordination.

  - **Low Yield Example**:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with **long aliphatic chains** that have **functional groups** like **amino (-NH₂)** or **hydroxyl (-OH)** at **distal positions** (more than four carbons from the carboxyl group) result in a **low yield**. The distance reduces the likelihood of these groups participating in effective chelation.

  - **Low Yield Examples**:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: *Rule 1* is clear and allows one to determine whether a modifier will result in a high yield based on the presence of an amino group on the alpha carbon and an additional carboxyl group on the side chain. It provides good physical-chemical insight by explaining that multiple binding sites enhance metal coordination. The rule considers combinations of functional groups, which adds necessary complexity. It is supported by at least two data points, meeting the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 2**: *Rule 2* is well-defined, focusing on aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position leading to a high yield. It offers adequate property insight by linking increased electron density to enhanced metal coordination. The rule balances complexity by specifying the position and type of substituents. It is supported by multiple high and low yield examples, satisfying the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 3**: *Rule 3* clearly states that aliphatic carboxylic acids with functional groups within three carbons of the carboxyl group yield high output. The proximity facilitating chelation provides good property insight. It combines functional groups and positional relationships, adding appropriate complexity. The rule is well-supported by several data points, ensuring sufficient coverage.

- **Comment 4**: *Rule 4* is clear in identifying modifiers with nitrogenous heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group as high-yielding. The property insight about nitrogen atoms enhancing coordination is sound. The rule encompasses specific structural features, providing the necessary complexity, and is backed by adequate data points.

- **Comment 5**: *Rule 5* effectively communicates that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups result in low yield, offering clear guidelines. The property insight is logical and ties well with the chemical behavior. While the rule is straightforward, it might be slightly lacking in complexity but compensates with good coverage of supporting data.

- **Comment 6**: *Rule 6* is clear, indicating that amide bonds adjacent to the carboxyl group lead to low yield due to resonance stabilization. This provides solid property insight. The rule is sufficiently complex by considering functional group interactions and is supported by several data points.

- **Comment 7**: *Rule 7* clearly states that ether linkages near the carboxyl group result in low yield. The property insight about steric hindrance is acceptable. The rule may lack some complexity as it focuses on a single structural feature, and coverage is minimal with only two supporting data points, which may affect its robustness.

- **Comment 8**: *Rule 8* provides clarity by associating multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group with high yield. The chelation enhancement offers good property insight. The rule has reasonable complexity but limited coverage, supported by only two examples, which may be insufficient for broader applicability.

- **Comment 9**: *Rule 9* is clear in stating that long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without polar groups yield high output. The property insight is plausible, relating hydrophobic interactions to enhanced performance. However, the rule has limited coverage with only one supporting high-yield example, which may not be enough to generalize the rule confidently.

- **Comment 10**: *Rule 10* communicates that thiol groups near the carboxyl group result in high yield, providing clear guidelines. The property insight about thiols forming strong bonds with metals is valid. The rule's complexity is acceptable, but coverage is limited, as it relies on a single high-yield example, reducing its overall strength.

- **Comment 11**: *Rule 11* lacks clarity due to conflicting information regarding the compound **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**, which is listed as both a low-yield example and a high-yield exception. This inconsistency undermines the rule's clarity and reliability. Property insight is present but overshadowed by the contradiction. Coverage is insufficient, and the rule may need revision for accuracy.

- **Comment 12**: *Rule 12* is clear in linking bulky hydrophobic side chains without additional coordinating groups to low yield. The property insight about steric hindrance is appropriate. The rule has limited complexity and minimal coverage, supported by only one low-yield example and one high-yield exception, which may not be sufficient for firm conclusions.

- **Comment 13**: *Rule 13* overlaps with previous rules (especially *Rule 1*) by emphasizing adjacent functional groups capable of chelation resulting in high yield. While the rule is clear and provides good property insight, the redundancy with earlier rules suggests it may be unnecessary. Coverage is adequate but does not add new information.

- **Comment 14**: *Rule 14* is clear, stating that biaryl structures without additional coordinating groups lead to low yield due to steric hindrance and reduced flexibility. The rule offers reasonable property insight but has limited coverage with only one supporting data point for each yield outcome, which might not be sufficient for generalization.

- **Comment 15**: *Rule 15* proposes that nitro groups on aromatic rings result in high yield, attributing this to unique coordination modes. While the rule is clear and provides interesting property insight, it has minimal coverage with only one high-yield example, making it difficult to validate the rule's broad applicability.

    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

---

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing **ether linkages (-O-)** in the side chain near the **carboxyl group** result in a **low yield**. Ether oxygen atoms can create steric hindrance and reduce effective coordination with metal centers.

  - **Low Yield Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with **multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH)** in close proximity to the **carboxyl group** result in a **high yield**. Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance chelation with metal ions.

  - **High Yield Examples**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**

---

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **thiol groups (-SH)** in close proximity to the **carboxyl group** result in a **high yield**. Thiol groups form strong bonds with metal centers due to their soft Lewis base character.

  - **High Yield Example**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

  - **Low Yield Example**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** has the thiol group attached to an aromatic ring, which may hinder its ability to coordinate effectively, resulting in a **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **alpha-amino acids** with **bulky hydrophobic side chains** and **no additional coordinating groups** result in a **low yield**. Steric hindrance interferes with effective metal coordination.

  - **Low Yield Example**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

  - **High Yield Exception**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan) contains an indole ring with a nitrogen atom that can participate in coordination, resulting in a **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers containing **ketone groups (-C=O)** in the carbon chain near the **carboxyl group** can result in a **low yield**. The ketone oxygen may compete with the carboxylate for metal coordination, disrupting the desired interaction.

  - **Low Yield Example**:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

  - **High Yield Example**:
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** results in a **high yield**, possibly due to the presence of methoxy groups enhancing overall coordination despite the ketone.

---

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **multiple coordinating functional groups** (e.g., **amino** and **carboxyl**, **hydroxyl** and **carboxyl**) in close proximity result in a **high yield**. Chelation enhances binding strength to metal centers.

  - **High Yield Examples**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length carbon chains** (six to eight carbons) and **no additional polar functional groups** can result in a **high yield**. The hydrophobic chains may enhance interaction with the catalyst framework or solvent.

  - **High Yield Example**:
    - **octanoic acid**

  - **Low Yield Example**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** has a hydroxyl group disrupting the hydrophobic character, leading to a **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers containing **biaryl structures**—aromatic rings connected via a **single bond**—without additional coordinating groups result in a **low yield**. Reduced flexibility and steric hindrance limit effective coordination.

  - **Low Yield Example**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

  - **High Yield Contrast**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** has a methylene spacer increasing flexibility, resulting in a **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with **electron-donating methoxy groups (-OCH₃)** on the aromatic ring can result in a **high yield** by increasing electron density and facilitating coordination with metal centers.

  - **High Yield Example**:
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**

- **Comment 1**:
  
  **Rule 1** is clear in stating that alpha-amino dicarboxylic acids result in high yield due to multiple coordination sites enhancing metal binding. It provides good property insight by linking structural features to reactivity. The rule considers combinations of functional groups (alpha-amino acid with an extra carboxyl group), adding complexity. With two high-yield examples and a contrasting low-yield example, the coverage is adequate.

- **Comment 2**:
  
  **Rule 2** clearly specifies that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups in the para position lead to high yield. It offers solid property insight by explaining how increased electron density enhances metal interaction. The rule combines aromatic structures with specific substituents, demonstrating complexity. Coverage is strong with two high-yield and two low-yield examples.

- **Comment 3**:
  
  **Rule 3** is clear about aliphatic carboxylic acids with functional groups within three carbons of the carboxyl group resulting in high yield.
