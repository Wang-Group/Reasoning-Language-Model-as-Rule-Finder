- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers with long aliphatic chains bearing amino groups (–NH₂) tend to result in low yield when the chain length exceeds five carbons.*

  - **Explanation**: Longer chains with amino groups introduce steric hindrance and may interfere with catalyst coordination due to increased flexibility and bulk.
  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**: 7-Aminoheptanoic acid, 8-Aminooctanoic acid.
    - **High Yield**: 5-Aminopentanoic acid (shorter chain, less steric hindrance).

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers containing perfluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to their strong electron-withdrawing nature and hydrophobicity.*

  - **Explanation**: Perfluoroalkyl groups decrease solubility in the reaction medium and destabilize interactions with the catalyst.
  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid.

---

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that include multiple ether linkages (–O–) adjacent to the carboxylic acid group lead to low yield.*

  - **Explanation**: Ether linkages can introduce flexibility and steric bulk, disrupting optimal interactions with the catalyst and potentially interfering with substrate access.
  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**: 2-[2-(2-Methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid.

---

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers that are N-substituted amino acids (e.g., peptides or those containing amide linkages adjacent to the carboxylic acid) result in low yield.*

  - **Explanation**: Amide groups may strongly bind to the catalyst, deactivating it or hindering substrate interaction due to competitive binding.
  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**: 2-[[(2S)-2-Amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid, 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid.

---

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers with bulky or sterically hindering substituents adjacent to the carboxylic acid group tend to give low yield.*

  - **Explanation**: Steric hindrance can prevent proper access to the catalyst's active site or interfere with efficient coordination.
  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**: 4-Pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (extended conjugation introduces steric bulk), (2S)-6-Acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (acetamido group adds steric hindrance).

---

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers containing both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups on the aromatic ring may result in low yield due to competing electronic effects.*

  - **Explanation**: Conflicting substituents can reduce the overall coordinating ability of the carboxylate group and destabilize interactions with the catalyst.
  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**: 5-Formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (presence of both hydroxy and formyl groups).

---

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers that are simple aromatic carboxylic acids without additional substituents or with substituents at non-optimal positions tend to result in low yield.*

  - **Explanation**: Lack of strong electronic effects or suboptimal positioning of substituents can lead to weaker interactions with the catalyst.
  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**: 4-Methylbenzoic acid (methyl is weakly donating), 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (hydroxy group not at para position relative to carboxyl group).

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: *Rule 1* is clear and allows for unambiguous determination of yield based on the presence of amino acids with acidic side chains containing additional carboxylic acid groups. The property insight is strong, explaining how multiple carboxylate groups enhance coordination with the metal catalyst, thus increasing activity and stability. The rule considers a combination of substructures (amino acids plus additional carboxyl groups) and is supported by multiple data points (e.g., aspartic acid and glutamic acid resulting in high yield, phenylalanine resulting in low yield), achieving good coverage and a balanced approach.

- **Comment 2**: *Rule 2* is clear in specifying that straight-chain saturated aliphatic carboxylic acids with up to eight carbons and no additional functional groups result in high yield. The property insight is solid, highlighting how simple aliphatic acids interact favorably with the catalyst without steric hindrance. The rule combines chain length and absence of functional groups, with adequate coverage supported by data points like octanoic acid (high yield) and 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid (low yield), achieving a good balance between simplicity and effectiveness.

- **Comment 3**: *Rule 3* provides clear guidance that modifiers containing aromatic rings substituted with electron-donating groups at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid tend to give high yield. The property insight is insightful, explaining how electron-donating groups enhance coordination with the metal catalyst. The rule considers both the functional group and its position, with good coverage (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid resulting in high yield, 4-methylbenzoic acid resulting in low yield), and maintains a balanced complexity.

- **Comment 4**: *Rule 4* is clear but potentially conflicting with Rule 3, as it states that electron-withdrawing groups at the para position also result in high yield. While the property insight about increased acidity improving coordination is valid, the overlap with Rule 3 (electron-donating groups) may cause confusion. Coverage is fair, with examples like 4-nitrobenzoic acid (high yield), but overall balance could be improved by reconciling the apparent contradiction between electron-donating and electron-withdrawing effects.

- **Comment 5**: *Rule 5* is clear and specifies that heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to a nitrogen-containing aromatic ring result in high yield. The property insight is strong, emphasizing the role of nitrogen in enhancing catalyst coordination. The rule effectively combines structural features and is well-supported by data points (e.g., nicotinic acid and 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid resulting in high yield), achieving good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 6**: *Rule 6* clearly states that modifiers containing aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid lead to low yield, with a well-explained exception. The property insight is sound, noting potential side reactions that reduce catalyst availability. The rule considers combinations of functional groups and is supported by multiple data points (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid resulting in low yield), providing adequate coverage and a balanced approach.

- **Comment 7**: *Rule 7* distinctly differentiates between aliphatic thiol modifiers (high yield) and aromatic thiol modifiers (low yield). The property insight regarding steric hindrance and coordination is valid. The rule combines chain type with functional groups and is backed by data points like 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid (high yield) and 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid (low yield), achieving good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 8**: *Rule 8* is clear in identifying that sugar acids or polyhydroxy carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups result in high yield. The property insight is robust, explaining how multiple hydroxyl groups enhance solubility and coordination. The rule considers combinations of substructures and has good coverage (e.g., gluconic acid resulting in high yield), maintaining balance.

- **Comment 9**: *Rule 9* provides clear guidance that modifiers with long aliphatic chains bearing amino groups lead to low yield when the chain exceeds five carbons. The property insight about steric hindrance interfering with catalyst coordination is convincing. The rule effectively combines chain length with functional groups and has adequate coverage (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid resulting in low yield, 5-aminopentanoic acid resulting in high yield), achieving balance.

- **Comment 10**: *Rule 10* is clear in stating that modifiers containing perfluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing nature and hydrophobicity. While the property insight is reasonable, coverage is limited, as it relies primarily on a single data point (e.g., nonafluoropentanoic acid resulting in low yield). The balance could be improved by including more examples or integrating this rule into a broader rule about hydrophobic or highly electron-withdrawing groups.

- **Comment 11**: *Rule 11* clearly indicates that modifiers with multiple ether linkages adjacent to the carboxylic acid lead to low yield. The property insight about increased flexibility and steric hindrance is valid. The rule combines functional groups and structural features, with adequate coverage (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid resulting in low yield), achieving a balanced complexity.

- **Comment 12**: *Rule 12* is clear in specifying that N-substituted amino acids result in low yield, providing solid property insight about strong binding deactivating the catalyst. The rule considers combinations of substructures (amide linkages adjacent to carboxylic acids), and coverage is adequate with data points like 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid resulting in low yield. The balance is appropriate.

- **Comment 13**: *Rule 13* highlights that modifiers with bulky or sterically hindering substituents adjacent to the carboxylic acid group tend to give low yield. While the property insight regarding steric hindrance is valid, the clarity could be improved by precisely defining "bulky" substituents. Coverage is acceptable (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid resulting in low yield), but ensuring consistent criteria for steric hindrance would enhance balance.

- **Comment 14**: *Rule 14* suggests that modifiers containing both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups on the aromatic ring may result in low yield due to competing electronic effects. The property insight is plausible, but clarity can be affected by the complexity of electronic interactions. Coverage is limited, relying on a single data point (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid resulting in low yield), so balance could be improved by providing more examples or integrating this rule into broader considerations of electronic effects.

- **Comment 15**: *Rule 15* is clear in stating that simple aromatic carboxylic acids without additional substituents or with substituents at non-optimal positions tend to result in low yield. The property insight is reasonable, noting weaker interactions with the catalyst. Coverage is adequate (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid resulting in low yield), and the rule maintains a good balance between simplicity and predictive capability.

- **Comment 1**: **Rule 1** is clear in specifying that amino acids with additional carboxylic acid groups result in **high yield**. The physical-chemical insight is solid, explaining how extra carboxyl groups enhance metal coordination. The rule considers combinations of substructures (amino acids with acidic side chains), satisfying the complexity criterion. It is well-supported by data points such as (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid and (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid yielding high, and (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid yielding low, satisfying the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 2** clearly states that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position lead to **high yield**. The provided insight about increased electron density enhancing coordination is appropriate. The rule's complexity is adequate, involving specific substituent positioning. It is supported by multiple data points: 4-aminobenzoic acid and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid yield high, while 4-methylbenzoic acid and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid yield low, meeting the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 3** suggests that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position result in **high yield**. While the rule is clear and provides chemical insight, it appears contradictory to Rule 2, which states that electron-donating groups at the same position also result in high yield. Both rules are supported by data (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid yields high), but the conflicting nature of the electronic effects raises concerns about the property insight. This ambiguity might confuse the applicability of the rule.

- **Comment 4**: **Rule 4** is clear and provides valid chemical reasoning that nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic carboxylic acids enhance metal coordination, resulting in **high yield**. The rule considers complex substructures and is supported by data points like pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid yielding high, whereas 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid yields low. Coverage and complexity criteria are satisfied.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** clearly differentiates between aliphatic and aromatic thiol-containing modifiers, with aliphatic thiols yielding **high** and aromatic thiols yielding **low**. The steric and electronic rationale is sound. The rule considers the combination of thiol groups with aliphatic or aromatic systems, fulfilling the complexity requirement. Data support comes from 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid yielding high and 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid yielding low, meeting coverage expectations.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** is clear, stating that straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids up to eight carbons without additional functional groups result in **high yield**. The physical-chemical insight about minimal steric hindrance is appropriate. The rule is simple yet effective, balancing complexity and coverage. It is supported by octanoic acid yielding high and 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid yielding low due to additional functional groups, satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** is clear in indicating that modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid lead to **low yield**, providing sound chemical reasoning. The exception noted adds depth to the rule. It involves combinations of functional groups, meeting the complexity requirement. Supported by data points like 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid yielding low, and 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid yielding high, it meets the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** clearly states that sugar acids or polyhydroxy carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups result in **high yield**. The chemical insight about enhanced solubility and coordination is valid. The rule's complexity is appropriate, considering multiple hydroxyl groups. While only one explicit example is given (gluconic acid yielding high), another data point (compound at index 6) also supports the rule, satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** offers clarity by specifying chain lengths and amino group positions, explaining that longer chains (> five carbons) yield **low**, while shorter chains yield **high**. The steric hindrance explanation is sound. The rule balances complexity by considering chain length and functional groups. It is supported by data: 5-aminopentanoic acid yields high, while 7-aminoheptanoic acid and 8-aminooctanoic acid yield low, satisfying the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** is clear in stating that perfluorinated alkyl chains result in **low yield** due to electronic and solubility factors. However, the rule is only supported by a single data point (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid yielding low), which does not meet the coverage criterion of at least two supporting data points. This limits the rule's robustness.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** clearly indicates that modifiers with multiple ether linkages adjacent to the carboxylic acid result in **low yield**. The explanation about increased flexibility and steric bulk is chemically sound. The rule's complexity is appropriate. It is supported by data points: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid and 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid both yielding low, satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** is clear and provides adequate chemical insight regarding amide linkages near the carboxylic acid leading to **low yield**. The rule considers complex substructures, fulfilling the complexity requirement. It is supported by data points like 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid and (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid yielding low, satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13** mentions that bulky substituents adjacent to the carboxylic acid lead to **low yield** but lacks specificity in defining "bulky substituents," affecting clarity. While the steric hindrance explanation is reasonable, the rule is only supported by a single data point (4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid yielding low), which does not meet the coverage criterion. The lack of multiple supporting examples limits the rule's effectiveness.

- **Comment 14**: **Rule 14** is clear in specifying that substituents not at the para position lead to **low yield**, providing a valid explanation about electronic distribution. However, it is supported by only one data point (3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid yielding low), failing to meet the coverage requirement. This limits the rule's robustness and applicability.

- **Comment 15**: **Rule 15** clearly states that modifiers with both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups on the aromatic ring result in **low yield** due to competing effects. The chemical reasoning is sound. However, like the previous two rules, it is only supported by a single data point (5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid yielding low), which does not satisfy the coverage criterion. This reduces the rule's overall reliability.

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with a substituent at the **para position** relative to the carboxyl group, where the substituent is either electron-donating (e.g., amino, hydroxy) or electron-withdrawing (e.g., nitro, halogens), result in **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Para-substituents enhance delocalization of electron density and improve coordination with the metal catalyst. Both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups at the para position can stabilize the carboxylate anion and facilitate effective interaction with the catalyst.
  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: 
      - *4-Aminobenzoic acid* (para-amino group enhances electron density).
      - *4-Nitrobenzoic acid* (para-nitro group withdraws electrons but stabilizes coordination).
      - *4-(Bromomethyl)benzoic acid* (para-bromomethyl group is electron-withdrawing).
    - **Low Yield**: 
      - *4-Methylbenzoic acid* (methyl group is weakly electron-donating and may not sufficiently enhance coordination).

---

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxylic acid groups (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) result in **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Additional carboxyl groups provide more coordination sites for metal ions, enhancing catalyst binding and stability. The proximity of multiple acidic groups facilitates stronger interactions with the catalyst.
  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: 
      - *(2S)-2-Aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid).
      - *(2S)-2-Aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid).
    - **Low Yield**: 
      - *(2S)-2-Amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine; lacks additional carboxylate group).

---

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms in the ring directly attached to the carboxyl group result in **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings can serve as additional coordination sites, enhancing the interaction with metal catalysts. The ring nitrogen increases electron density at the coordination site, facilitating stronger binding.
  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: 
      - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid).
      - *1H-Pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*.
    - **Low Yield**: 
      - *4-Pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Pyridine ring is not directly attached to the carboxyl group, reducing coordination effectiveness).

---

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer, bearing functional groups such as amino (–NH₂) or thiol (–SH) groups, result in **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Short-chain aliphatic acids with additional coordinating groups enhance interaction with the catalyst without significant steric hindrance. Amino and thiol groups provide extra sites for metal coordination.
  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: 
      - *5-Aminopentanoic acid*.
      - *3-Sulfanylpropanoic acid*.
    - **Low Yield**: 
      - *7-Aminoheptanoic acid* (longer chain introduces steric hindrance).
      - *4-Sulfanylbenzoic acid* (thiol group on aromatic ring may be less effective).

---

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths up to eight carbons and **no additional functional groups** result in **high yield**. However, the presence of polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) on longer chains (more than six carbons) leads to **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Unsubstituted aliphatic acids interact favorably due to minimal steric hindrance and good solubility. In contrast, polar groups on longer chains may interfere with catalyst interaction due to increased flexibility and steric effects.
  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: 
      - *Octanoic acid* (straight-chain C8 acid with no additional groups).
    - **Low Yield**: 
      - *7-Hydroxyheptanoic acid* (hydroxyl group on a long chain may hinder interaction).
      - *7-Aminoheptanoic acid* (amino group on a long chain introduces steric hindrance).

---

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers containing both hydroxyl (–OH) and carboxylic acid groups, particularly polyhydroxy acids (sugar acids), result in **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance solubility in the reaction medium and provide additional coordination sites for metal ions, improving catalyst binding.
  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: 
      - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-Pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid).
      - *2-[[1,3-Dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*.
    - **Low Yield**: 
      - *7-Hydroxyheptanoic acid* (single hydroxyl group on a long chain may not provide sufficient coordination benefit).

---

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers with aliphatic thiol groups (–SH) result in **high yield**, whereas thiol groups attached directly to an aromatic ring result in **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Aliphatic thiols can effectively coordinate with metal ions due to their accessibility and lack of steric hindrance. Aromatic thiols may have reduced availability for coordination due to resonance stabilization and potential steric factors.
  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: 
      - *3-Sulfanylpropanoic acid*.
    - **Low Yield**: 
      - *4-Sulfanylbenzoic acid*.

---

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers containing ether linkages (–O–) adjacent to the carboxylic acid group result in **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Ether linkages introduce flexibility and steric bulk, hindering effective coordination with the catalyst. They may also decrease the overall electron density available for metal binding.
  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**: 
      - *2-[2-(2-Methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*.
      - *3-[2-(2-Aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*.

---

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers containing carbonyl groups (aldehyde or ketone) adjacent to the carboxylic acid or amide linkages near the carboxyl group result in **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Carbonyl and amide groups near the carboxylic acid can chelate metal ions or engage in side reactions, reducing the availability of the catalyst for the desired reaction.
  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**: 
      - *4-Formylbenzoic acid*.
      - *5-Formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*.
      - *4-Oxoheptanedioic acid*.
      - *2-[(4-Hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*.

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains or strong electron-withdrawing groups in aliphatic chains result in **low yield** due to their hydrophobicity and strong electron-withdrawing effects.*

  - **Explanation**: Perfluoroalkyl groups decrease solubility in the reaction medium and reduce the electron density available for coordination, hindering effective interaction with the catalyst.
  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**: 
      - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid*.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: 
      - *5-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*.
      - *4-Pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid*.
    - **Low Yield**: 
      - *3-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (shorter linker may not provide optimal positioning for coordination).

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with a substituent at the **para position** relative to the carboxyl group, where the substituent is a strong **electron-donating group** (e.g., amino, hydroxy) or a strong **electron-withdrawing group** (e.g., nitro), result in **high yield**. Substitution with weakly electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl) leads to **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Strong electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups at the para position enhance the ability of the carboxylate to coordinate with the metal catalyst. These groups influence the electron density and resonance stabilization of the aromatic ring, promoting better interaction with the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: 
      - *4-Aminobenzoic acid* (para-amino group is strongly electron-donating).
      - *4-Nitrobenzoic acid* (para-nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing).
    - **Low Yield**: 
      - *4-Methylbenzoic acid* (methyl group is a weak electron-donating group and does not sufficiently enhance coordination).

---

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are **amino acids** containing an additional **carboxylic acid group** in the side chain (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) result in **high yield**. Amino acids lacking the additional carboxyl group result in **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: The presence of a second carboxylic acid group provides additional coordination sites for metal ions, enhancing binding and stability of the catalyst. This facilitates effective metal-ligand interactions crucial for catalysis.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(2S)-2-Aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid).
      - *(2S)-2-Aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid).
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *(2S)-2-Amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine; lacks an extra carboxyl group).

---

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids** where the heteroatom (e.g., nitrogen) in the aromatic ring is directly attached to the **carboxyl group** result in **high yield**. If the heteroatom is not directly attached, the yield is **low**.*

  - **Explanation**: Direct attachment of the carboxyl group to a heteroatom-containing aromatic ring enhances electron delocalization and coordination ability with metal ions. The heteroatom can participate in metal binding, improving catalytic activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (nicotinic acid; carboxyl group attached at position 3 adjacent to nitrogen).
      - *1H-Pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid* (carboxyl group directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring).
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (pyridine ring not directly attached to the carboxyl group).

---

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are **straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** with chain lengths of **three to eight carbons** and **no additional functional groups** result in **high yield**. The presence of polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) on chains longer than five carbons leads to **low yield** due to steric hindrance and reduced coordination efficiency.*

  - **Explanation**: Unsubstituted aliphatic acids of moderate chain length interact favorably with the catalyst due to minimal steric hindrance and optimal hydrophobic-hydrophilic balance. Polar groups on longer chains may introduce flexibility and steric effects that hinder effective metal coordination.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *Octanoic acid* (C8 straight-chain fatty acid without additional groups).
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *7-Aminoheptanoic acid* (amino group on a long chain introduces steric hindrance).
      - *7-Hydroxyheptanoic acid* (hydroxyl group on a long chain may interfere with coordination).

---

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are **short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** (chain lengths up to five carbons) bearing additional coordinating groups such as **amino (–NH₂)** or **thiol (–SH)** groups result in **high yield**. Longer chains with such groups result in **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Short-chain acids with coordinating functional groups can effectively interact with the metal catalyst without significant steric hindrance. These groups provide additional metal-binding sites, enhancing catalytic activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *5-Aminopentanoic acid* (short chain with amino group).
      - *3-Sulfanylpropanoic acid* (short chain with thiol group).
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *7-Aminoheptanoic acid* (longer chain length reduces coordination efficiency).
      - *8-Aminooctanoic acid* (long chain with amino group introduces steric hindrance).

---

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers containing **multiple hydroxyl groups** along with a **carboxylic acid** group, particularly **polyhydroxy acids** (e.g., sugar acids), result in **high yield**. Modifiers with a **single hydroxyl group** on long aliphatic chains result in **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance solubility and provide several coordination sites for metal ions, facilitating stronger catalyst-modifier interactions. Single hydroxyl groups on long chains do not offer the same coordination benefits and may introduce steric hindrance.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-Pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (gluconic acid; multiple hydroxyl groups).
      - *2-[[1,3-Dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid* (multiple hydroxyl groups).
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *7-Hydroxyheptanoic acid* (single hydroxyl group on a long chain).

---

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers containing **ether linkages (–O–)** or **long flexible chains** with polar functional groups near the carboxylate result in **low yield** due to decreased coordination efficiency.*

  - **Explanation**: Ether linkages and flexible chains introduce mobility that can hinder the optimal positioning of the carboxylate and other coordinating groups for effective metal binding. This reduces the overall stability and activity of the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *2-[2-(2-Methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid* (contains ether linkages adjacent to the carboxyl group).
      - *3-[2-(2-Aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid* (ether linkages with amino group).

---

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers containing strong **electron-withdrawing groups** on an **aliphatic chain**, such as **perfluoroalkyl groups**, result in **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Strong electron-withdrawing groups reduce the electron density of the carboxylate anion, diminishing its ability to coordinate with the metal catalyst. Additionally, perfluorinated chains are highly hydrophobic, reducing solubility and interaction with the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid* (perfluorinated alkyl chain).
      - *4-[(2,2,2-Trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid* (trifluoromethyl group).

---

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers with **carbonyl groups** (aldehyde or ketone) or **amide bonds** adjacent to or near the **carboxyl group** result in **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Carbonyl groups and amide bonds near the carboxyl group can engage in competing interactions with metal ions or participate in side reactions, reducing the availability of the carboxylate for effective catalyst coordination.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Formylbenzoic acid* (aldehyde group adjacent to carboxyl).
      - *4-Oxoheptanedioic acid* (ketone group in proximity to carboxyl groups).
      - *2-[(4-Hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid* (amide bond near carboxyl group).

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers that are **N-acetylated amino acids** or **small peptides** containing additional **amide bonds** near the carboxyl group result in **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: The presence of amide bonds can sequester metal ions through strong coordination, reducing the availability of the catalyst for the desired reaction. This competitive binding diminishes catalytic efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *(2S)-6-Acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-acetylated lysine).
      - *2-[[(2S)-2-Amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid* (peptide bond near carboxyl group).

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic dicarboxylic acids** or **amino acids with two carboxylic acid groups** (such as aspartic acid and glutamic acid) result in **high yield**. These molecules have carboxylic acid groups at both ends of the carbon chain.*

  - **Explanation**: The presence of two carboxylate groups provides multiple coordination sites for the metal catalyst, enhancing binding affinity and stability. This facilitates efficient metal-ligand interactions crucial for catalytic activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(2S)-2-Aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid).
      - *(2S)-2-Aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid).
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *(2S)-2-Amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine; contains only one carboxylate group).

---

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with a substituent at the **para position** relative to the carboxyl group, where the substituent is a strong **electron-withdrawing group** (e.g., nitro, bromo) or a strong **electron-donating group** (e.g., amino), result in **high yield**. Substituents that are weakly electron-donating (e.g., methyl) lead to **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Strong electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups at the para position modulate the electron density of the aromatic ring and the carboxylate group, enhancing the ability to coordinate with metal ions. This improves catalyst efficiency by facilitating better metal-ligand interactions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *4-Aminobenzoic acid* (para-amino group; strong electron-donating).
      - *4-Nitrobenzoic acid* (para-nitro group; strong electron-withdrawing).
      - *4-(Bromomethyl)benzoic acid* (para-bromomethyl group; electron-withdrawing).
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Methylbenzoic acid* (para-methyl group; weak electron-donating).

---

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids** with the **carboxyl group adjacent to the heteroatom** result in **high yield**. If the carboxyl group is not adjacent to the heteroatom or is attached to a separate aromatic ring, the yield is **low**.*

  - **Explanation**: The proximity of the carboxyl group to the heteroatom (such as nitrogen) in the aromatic ring enhances delocalization of electron density, improving coordination with the metal catalyst. This strengthens the metal-ligand complex, enhancing catalytic activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (nicotinic acid; carboxyl group at position 3 adjacent to nitrogen).
      - *1H-Pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid* (carboxyl group directly attached to heteroaromatic ring).
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (pyridine ring attached to benzoic acid at the para position; carboxyl group not adjacent to heteroatom).

---

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with chain lengths of **six to eight carbons** and **no additional functional groups** result in **high yield**. Introducing polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) on chains longer than five carbons leads to **low yield** due to increased steric hindrance and reduced coordination efficiency.*

  - **Explanation**: Medium-chain aliphatic acids without additional functional groups have optimal chain length for effective interaction with the catalyst. They provide sufficient hydrophobic character without steric hindrance, facilitating good coordination with metal ions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *Octanoic acid* (C8 aliphatic acid with no substituents).
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *7-Aminoheptanoic acid* (C7 chain with amino group; increased steric hindrance).
      - *7-Hydroxyheptanoic acid* (C7 chain with hydroxyl group; reduced coordination efficiency).

---

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are **short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** (three to five carbons) with additional **coordinating functional groups** such as **amino (–NH₂)** or **thiol (–SH)** groups result in **high yield**. Longer chains with such groups result in **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Short-chain acids with coordinating groups can effectively bind to the metal catalyst without significant steric hindrance. These functional groups offer additional metal-binding sites, enhancing catalyst performance.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *5-Aminopentanoic acid* (C5 chain with amino group).
      - *3-Sulfanylpropanoic acid* (C3 chain with thiol group).
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *8-Aminooctanoic acid* (C8 chain with amino group; steric hindrance reduces effectiveness).

---

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers containing **multiple hydroxyl groups** along with a **carboxylic acid** group, such as **polyhydroxy acids**, result in **high yield**. If only a single hydroxyl group is present on a long aliphatic chain, the yield is **low**.*

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and provide several coordination sites, enhancing interaction with the metal catalyst. This strengthens the metal-ligand complex, improving catalytic activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-Pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (gluconic acid; multiple hydroxyl groups).
      - *2-[[1,3-Dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid* (multiple hydroxyl groups).
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *7-Hydroxyheptanoic acid* (single hydroxyl group on a long chain).

---

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers with **perfluoroalkyl groups** or other strong **electron-withdrawing groups** on an **aliphatic chain** result in **low yield**. These groups decrease the electron density of the carboxylate anion.*

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups reduce the ability of the carboxylate to coordinate effectively with metal ions. Additionally, perfluorinated chains are highly hydrophobic, which can negatively impact solubility and interaction with the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid* (perfluorinated pentanoic acid).
      - *4-[(2,2,2-Trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid* (trifluoroacetyl group).

---

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers containing **ether linkages (–O–)** near the **carboxyl group** result in **low yield**. The presence of flexible ether chains reduces coordination efficiency.*

  - **Explanation**: Ether linkages introduce flexibility and may hinder the optimal orientation of the carboxylate group for metal coordination. This decreases the stability of the metal-ligand complex and reduces catalytic activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *2-[2-(2-Methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid* (multiple ether linkages adjacent to carboxyl group).
      - *3-[2-(2-Aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid* (ether linkages with amino group).

---

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers with **carbonyl groups** (aldehyde or ketone) or **amide bonds** adjacent to the **carboxyl group** result in **low yield**. These functionalities can interfere with metal coordination.*

  - **Explanation**: Carbonyl and amide groups near the carboxylate can participate in competing interactions with metal ions or undergo side reactions, reducing the availability of the carboxylate for effective coordination with the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Formylbenzoic acid* (aldehyde group adjacent to carboxyl group).
      - *4-Oxoheptanedioic acid* (ketone group in proximity to carboxyl groups).
      - *2-[(4-Hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid* (amide bond near carboxyl group).

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers that are **N-acetylated amino acids** or contain **amide bonds** away from the carboxyl group result in **low yield**. The additional amide groups can sequester metal ions.*

  - **Explanation**: Amide bonds can bind metal ions strongly, competing with the carboxylate group for metal coordination. This reduces the effectiveness of the catalyst by lowering the availability of active metal sites.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *(2S)-6-Acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-acetylated lysine).
      - *2-[[(2S)-2-Amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid* (contains peptide bond).

---

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with a **formyl (–CHO)** or **hydroxyl (–OH)** group adjacent to the carboxyl group result in **low yield**. These groups can engage in intramolecular interactions.*

  - **Explanation**: Adjacent formyl or hydroxyl groups can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds or interact with the carboxylate, reducing its availability for metal coordination. This weakens catalyst binding and reduces activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *5-Formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid* (formyl and hydroxyl groups adjacent to carboxyl).
      - *3-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (hydroxyl group near carboxyl group).

---

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers with **bulky substituents** or **multiple rings** near the **carboxyl group** result in **low yield** due to steric hindrance that impedes metal coordination.*

  - **Explanation**: Bulky groups can prevent the carboxylate from approaching the metal center effectively, reducing the stability of the metal-ligand complex and diminishing catalytic efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-(3,4-Dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid* (bulky aromatic substituent near carboxyl group).
      - *1,3-Dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid* (fused ring system near carboxyl group).
    - **Note**: Despite being potentially high-yielding due to functional groups, the steric bulk leads to lower yield.

---

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers containing **thiol groups (–SH)** on an **aromatic ring** result in **low yield**. Thiol groups on aliphatic chains (short-chain acids) may result in **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Thiol groups on aromatic rings can strongly bind to metal ions, potentially leading to catalyst poisoning or deactivation. In contrast, thiol groups on short aliphatic chains enhance coordination without excessively strong binding.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *3-Sulfanylpropanoic acid* (thiol group on short aliphatic chain).
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Sulfanylbenzoic acid* (thiol group on aromatic ring; observed to result in low yield).

---

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **ether linkages** in the chain result in **low yield** due to increased flexibility and reduced coordination efficiency.*

  - **Explanation**: Ether linkages within aliphatic chains increase chain flexibility, which can disrupt the optimal positioning of the carboxylate group for metal coordination. This can weaken the metal-ligand interaction and reduce catalytic activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *3-[2-(2-Aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid* (ether linkages within aliphatic chain).
      - *2-[2-(2-Methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid* (multiple ether linkages).

---

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers with **conjugated ketone groups** (–CO–) adjacent to aromatic rings result in **low yield**, as they may engage in competing interactions or side reactions.*

  - **Explanation**: Conjugated ketone groups can interact with metal ions or participate in resonance with the aromatic ring, reducing the effectiveness of the carboxylate in coordinating with the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *1,3-Dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid* (conjugated ketone adjacent to aromatic ring).
      - *4-(3,4-Dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid* (ketone group near aromatic ring).

- **Rules 1 to 3** focus on the presence of multiple carboxylate groups and the influence of substituents on aromatic and heteroaromatic carboxylic acids.
- **Rules 4 to 6** address aliphatic carboxylic acids, considering chain length, absence or presence of functional groups, and multiple hydroxyl groups.
- **Rules 7 to 15** identify structural features that lead to low yield, such as electron-withdrawing groups, ether linkages, carbonyl or amide groups adjacent to the carboxylate, bulky substituents, and thiol groups on aromatic rings.

Each rule clearly predicts the expected yield based on structural characteristics, providing guidance for selecting or designing modifiers to optimize the reaction outcome. The rules are grounded in physical-chemical principles such as steric hindrance, electronic effects, coordination ability, and solubility, ensuring they are scientifically sound and practically applicable.

    - **Low Yield**:
      - *7-Aminoheptanoic acid* (C7 chain with amino group; increased steric hindrance)

---

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic or aromatic carboxylic acids** with **ether linkages (–O–)** near the **carboxyl group** result in **low yield**. The flexibility introduced by ethers hinders effective metal coordination.*

---

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers containing **strong electron-withdrawing groups** (e.g., perfluoroalkyl groups) on an **aliphatic chain** result in **low yield**. These groups reduce the carboxylate's ability to coordinate with metal ions.*

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups decrease the electron density of the carboxylate anion, weakening its interaction with metal ions and reducing catalytic efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid* (perfluorinated aliphatic acid)
      - *4-[(2,2,2-Trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid* (trifluoroacetyl group)

---

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers with **adjacent carbonyl groups** (aldehyde or ketone) to the **carboxyl group** result in **low yield**. These functionalities can interfere with metal coordination.*

  - **Explanation**: Carbonyl groups near the carboxylate can engage in competing interactions or intramolecular hydrogen bonding, limiting the availability of the carboxylate for effective metal coordination.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Formylbenzoic acid* (aldehyde adjacent to carboxyl group)
      - *4-Oxoheptanedioic acid* (ketone near carboxyl groups)

---

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids** with the **carboxyl group adjacent to a heteroatom** result in **high yield**. If the carboxyl group is not adjacent to the heteroatom, the yield is **low**.*

  - **Explanation**: Proximity of the carboxyl group to a heteroatom (e.g., nitrogen) enhances electron delocalization and coordination potential with metal ions, strengthening the catalyst's performance.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
      - *1H-Pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (carboxyl group not adjacent to heteroatom)

---

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers with **bulky substituents near the carboxyl group** or **multiple aromatic rings** result in **low yield** due to steric hindrance that impedes metal coordination.*

  - **Explanation**: Bulky groups can obstruct the approach of the carboxylate to the metal center, reducing binding affinity and catalytic efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-(3,4-Dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid* (bulky aromatic substituent)
      - *2-[(4-Hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid* (amide bond with aromatic ring)

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers with **thiol groups (–SH)** on **aliphatic chains** result in **high yield**. Thiol groups on **aromatic rings** lead to **low yield** due to potential catalyst poisoning.*

  - **Explanation**: Aliphatic thiol groups can provide additional coordination sites without deactivating the metal catalyst. Aromatic thiols may bind too strongly to metal ions, inhibiting catalytic activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *3-Sulfanylpropanoic acid* (thiol on aliphatic chain)
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Sulfanylbenzoic acid* (thiol on aromatic ring)

    - **Low Yield**:
      - *7-Hydroxyheptanoic acid* (single hydroxyl group on a long aliphatic chain)

---

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids** with the **carboxyl group adjacent to a heteroatom** (e.g., nitrogen or oxygen) result in a **high yield**. If the carboxyl group is not adjacent to the heteroatom, the yield is **low**.*

  - **Explanation**: The proximity of the carboxyl group to a heteroatom enhances electron delocalization and coordination potential with metal ions, strengthening the catalyst's performance.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid; carboxyl adjacent to nitrogen)
      - *1H-Pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid* (carboxyl adjacent to multiple nitrogen atoms)
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (carboxyl group not adjacent to heteroatom)
      - *Pyridine-4-carboxylic acid* (Isonicotinic acid; carboxyl opposite nitrogen)

---

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers with **ether linkages (–O–)** near the **carboxyl group** result in a **low yield** due to increased molecular flexibility that hinders effective metal coordination.*

  - **Explanation**: Ether linkages can increase flexibility and disrupt the optimal orientation needed for strong metal coordination, weakening the metal-ligand interaction and reducing catalytic efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *2-[2-(2-Methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
      - *3-[2-(2-Aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers containing **strong electron-withdrawing groups** (e.g., perfluoroalkyl groups) on an **aliphatic chain** result in a **low yield**. These groups reduce the carboxylate's ability to coordinate with metal ions.*

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups decrease the electron density of the carboxylate anion, weakening its interaction with metal ions and diminishing catalytic efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid* (perfluorinated aliphatic acid)
      - *4-[(2,2,2-Trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid* (trifluoroacetyl group)

---

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers with **adjacent carbonyl groups** (aldehyde or ketone) to the **carboxyl group** result in a **low yield** due to potential interference with metal coordination.*

  - **Explanation**: Carbonyl groups near the carboxylate can engage in intramolecular interactions or compete for coordination with the metal ion, limiting the availability of the carboxylate for effective binding.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Formylbenzoic acid* (aldehyde adjacent to carboxyl group)
      - *4-Oxoheptanedioic acid* (ketone near carboxyl groups)

---

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers with **amide bonds near the carboxyl group** result in a **low yield** due to competition between amide and carboxylate groups for metal coordination.*

  - **Explanation**: Amide groups can form complexes with metal ions, potentially competing with the carboxylate group and reducing overall coordination efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *2-[(4-Hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*
      - *(2S)-6-Acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **bulky substituents** near the **carboxyl group** or **multiple aromatic rings** result in a **low yield** due to steric hindrance impeding metal coordination.*

  - **Explanation**: Bulky groups can obstruct the approach of the carboxylate to the metal center, reducing binding affinity and catalytic efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-(3,4-Dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid*
      - *2-[[(2S)-2-Amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid* (contains bulky side chain)

---

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers with **thiol groups (–SH)** on **short aliphatic chains** result in a **high yield**, whereas thiol groups on **aromatic rings** lead to a **low yield** due to potential catalyst poisoning.*

  - **Explanation**: Aliphatic thiol groups can provide additional coordination sites without deactivating the metal catalyst. Aromatic thiols may bind too strongly or irreversibly to metal ions, inhibiting catalytic activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *3-Sulfanylpropanoic acid* (thiol on aliphatic chain)
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Sulfanylbenzoic acid* (thiol on aromatic ring)

---

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with a **hydroxyl group at the meta position** relative to the carboxyl group result in a **high yield**. Hydroxyl groups at other positions may lead to a **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: A hydroxyl group at the meta position can enhance coordination through hydrogen bonding or resonance effects without causing steric hindrance.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *5-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid* (hydroxyl meta to carboxyl group when considering the phenyl ring)
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *3-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (hydroxyl para to carboxyl group but on a shorter chain causing steric issues)

---

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers with **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** (chain lengths greater than eight carbons) result in a **low yield** due to decreased solubility and increased hydrophobicity.*

  - **Explanation**: Long aliphatic chains may reduce the modifier's solubility in the reaction medium, hindering effective interaction with the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *Decanoic acid* (though not listed in the dataset, extended from observed patterns)

---

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers that are **amino acids with sulfur-containing side chains**, such as methionine derivatives, result in a **low yield** due to potential interference with the catalyst.*

  - **Explanation**: Sulfur-containing side chains can bind strongly to metal ions, potentially deactivating the catalyst or altering its activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *2-[[(2S)-2-Amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid*

---

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers with **multiple coordinating functional groups** (e.g., carboxylate, amino, hydroxyl) in a configuration that allows for chelation result in a **high yield**. Dispersed functional groups without chelating ability lead to a **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Chelation enhances the strength and stability of the metal-ligand complex, improving catalytic efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-Pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (multiple hydroxyls near the carboxyl group)
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *3-[2-(2-Aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid* (functional groups too dispersed for effective chelation)

These rules illustrate the relationships between specific combinations of substructures in the molecular modifiers and their impact on the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By considering underlying physicochemical properties such as coordination ability, electronic effects, steric factors, and solubility, the rules provide a predictive framework for determining whether a given modifier will result in a high or low yield.

The rules balance simplicity and complexity while covering a broad range of the dataset:

- **Rules 1 to 5** focus on the effects of functional groups adjacent to coordination sites, highlighting how amino acids, electron-donating and withdrawing groups, and heterocycles influence yield.
- **Rules 6 to 10** address structural features that hinder coordination, such as ether linkages, steric hindrance from bulky substituents, and electron-withdrawing groups.
- **Rules 11 to 15** consider the position and nature of specific functional groups like thiols, hydroxyls, and amino groups, emphasizing the importance of chelation and functional group configuration.

By applying these rules, chemists can rationalize the observed yields in the dataset and make informed decisions when selecting or designing modifiers to optimize the reaction outcome.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**:

  Rule 1 is clear and allows for the straightforward determination of high yield when a modifier is a dicarboxylic amino acid with an α-amino group. The property insight is adequate, explaining how multiple coordination sites enhance catalytic efficiency. The rule shows moderate complexity by combining specific structural features (dicarboxylic acid and α-amino group). Coverage is good, supported by at least three data points: entries 0 and 2 (high yield) and entry 13 (low yield when the amino acid is monocarboxylic). Overall, Rule 1 meets all the scoring criteria effectively.

- **Comment 2**:

  Rule 2 is clear in specifying that aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-donating or withdrawing groups at the para position result in a high yield, while weak electron-donating groups lead to a low yield. The property insight about modulation of electron density enhancing coordination ability is appropriate. The rule considers combinations of substructures (aromatic ring, carboxyl group, substituent type, and position), showing adequate complexity. Coverage is strong, with data points supporting high yield (entries 1, 4, and 20) and low yield (entry 22). Rule 2 effectively satisfies the scoring criteria.

- **Comment 3**:

  Rule 3 clearly describes how aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of five to eight carbons and no additional polar functional groups result in high yield, whereas longer chains with polar groups lead to low yield. The property insight regarding steric hindrance and solubility affecting coordination is adequate. The rule exhibits moderate complexity by considering chain length and functional group presence. Coverage is good, with data points supporting high yield (entries 3 and 5) and low yield (entries 31 and 34). Rule 3 meets the criteria well.

- **Comment 4**:

  Rule 4 is clear in stating that polyhydroxy carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups result in high yield, while single hydroxyl groups on long aliphatic chains result in low yield. The property insight about additional coordination sites provided by multiple hydroxyl groups is adequate. Complexity is moderate, as it considers both the number and arrangement of hydroxyl groups. Coverage includes data points supporting high yield (entries 6 and 9) and low yield (entry 29). Rule 4 effectively meets the scoring criteria.

- **Comment 5**:

  Rule 5 clearly indicates that heterocyclic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group adjacent to a heteroatom result in high yield, whereas those without this arrangement result in low yield. The property insight regarding enhanced electron delocalization and coordination potential is appropriate. The rule considers combinations of substructures, showing satisfactory complexity. Coverage is adequate, with high-yield data points (entries 15 and 21) and a low-yield data point (entry 12). Rule 5 adheres to the criteria.

- **Comment 6**:

  Rule 6 is clear in stating that modifiers with ether linkages near the carboxyl group result in low yield due to increased molecular flexibility hindering metal coordination. The property insight is reasonable. Complexity is moderate, focusing on specific structural features affecting coordination. Coverage includes at least two data points with low yield (entries 11 and 32). Rule 6 meets all criteria effectively.

- **Comment 7**:

  Rule 7 clearly specifies that modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups on aliphatic chains result in low yield due to reduced coordination ability of the carboxylate. The property insight is adequate. Complexity is moderate, considering the nature of substituents on aliphatic chains. Coverage includes data points with low yield (entries 14 and 28). Rule 7 satisfies the scoring criteria.

- **Comment 8**:

  Rule 8 clearly states that modifiers with adjacent carbonyl groups near the carboxyl group result in low yield due to potential interference with metal coordination. The property insight is acceptable. Complexity is satisfactory, focusing on specific functional group arrangements. Coverage includes data points with low yield (entries 19 and 27). Rule 8 meets the criteria.

- **Comment 9**:

  Rule 9 is clear, indicating that modifiers with amide bonds near the carboxyl group result in low yield due to competition for metal coordination. The property insight is reasonable. Complexity is moderate, considering the presence and position of amide groups. Coverage includes data points with low yield (entries 26 and 33). Rule 9 adheres to the criteria.

- **Comment 10**:

  Rule 10 suggests that modifiers with bulky substituents near the carboxyl group or multiple aromatic rings result in low yield due to steric hindrance. However, there is an inconsistency, as the example given (entry 25: *4-(3,4-Dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid*) is associated with low yield in the rule but has a high yield in the dataset. This inconsistency reduces clarity and questions the accuracy of the property insight. While the rule has acceptable complexity, the conflicting data weakens coverage. Rule 10 needs revision to resolve this inconsistency and improve clarity.

- **Comment 11**:

  Rule 11 states that modifiers with thiol groups on short aliphatic chains result in high yield, while thiol groups on aromatic rings lead to low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning. The property insight is reasonable. Clarity is good, and complexity is moderate, considering both the functional group and its position. Coverage is adequate, with data points supporting high yield (entry 17) and low yield (entry 10). Rule 11 meets the scoring criteria effectively.

- **Comment 12**:

  Rule 12 indicates that aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups at the meta position result in high yield, while hydroxyl groups at other positions lead to low yield. However, the examples and data do not consistently support this rule. Entry 7 (*5-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*) is marked as high yield but does not have the hydroxyl group at the meta position relative to the carboxyl group in an aromatic system. Conversely, entry 30 (*3-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*), structurally similar, is marked as low yield. This inconsistency reduces clarity and suggests inadequate property insight. Coverage is uncertain due to conflicting data. Rule 12 requires refinement for clarity and consistency.

- **Comment 13**:

  Rule 13 states that long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (chain lengths greater than eight carbons) result in low yield due to decreased solubility. However, the dataset does not include modifiers with chain lengths greater than eight carbons (e.g., decanoic acid is not present). Clarity is acceptable, and the property insight is reasonable. Complexity is low, focusing solely on chain length. Coverage is insufficient, lacking data points to support the rule. Rule 13 fails to meet the coverage criterion effectively.

- **Comment 14**:

  Rule 14 suggests that amino acids with sulfur-containing side chains result in low yield due to potential interference with the catalyst. The property insight is acceptable. Clarity is adequate. However, coverage is minimal, supported by only one data point (entry 23: low yield). Since at least two data points are required for adequate coverage, Rule 14 lacks sufficient support.

- **Comment 15**:

  Rule 15 states that modifiers with multiple coordinating functional groups in a configuration allowing for chelation result in high yield, while dispersed functional groups without chelating ability lead to low yield. The property insight is appropriate but somewhat general, potentially overlapping with other rules. Clarity is moderate. Complexity is high, considering combinations and configurations of functional groups. Coverage is ambiguous, as the supporting data points (e.g., entry 9 for high yield, entry 32 for low yield) may already be accounted for in other rules. Rule 15 requires refinement to enhance clarity and define unique coverage distinct from other rules.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *4-Aminobenzoic acid*
      - *5-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *3-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (hydroxy group not optimally positioned)
      - *4-Methylbenzoic acid* (methyl group is less electron-donating)

---

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with a **para nitro group** result in a **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: The nitro group, being a strong electron-withdrawing group, can enhance the acidity of the carboxylate, potentially improving its coordination ability with the metal catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *4-Nitrobenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids** with the carboxyl group directly attached to the ring result in a **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Heterocyclic rings with nitrogen or oxygen can participate in coordination with metal ions, and when the carboxyl group is directly attached, it enhances chelation, stabilizing the metal complex.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
      - *1H-Pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (pyridyl group may introduce steric hindrance)

---

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with a **para formyl (aldehyde) group** result in a **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: The aldehyde group can interfere with metal coordination by engaging in competing interactions or causing steric hindrance, reducing the effectiveness of the modifier.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Formylbenzoic acid*
      - *5-Formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with a **terminal amino group** and a chain length of five carbons result in a **high yield**. Longer chains or absence of the amino group lead to a **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: The terminal amino group provides an additional coordination site, and a five-carbon chain offers optimal flexibility without significant steric hindrance.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *5-Aminopentanoic acid*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *7-Aminoheptanoic acid* (longer chain may hinder coordination)
      - *Octanoic acid* (no amino group but still shows high yield; suggests chain length alone is not prohibitive)

---

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **additional polar functional groups** (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) on **long chains (more than six carbons)** result in a **low yield**. Simple aliphatic acids without such groups result in a **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Additional polar groups on long chains can interfere with coordination due to steric hindrance or competition. Simple long-chain acids can coordinate effectively without interference.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *Octanoic acid* (C8 chain without additional groups)
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *7-Hydroxyheptanoic acid*
      - *7-Aminoheptanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers with **ether linkages near the carboxyl group** result in a **low yield** due to increased molecular flexibility hindering effective coordination.*

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *2-[2-(2-Methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
      - *3-[2-(2-Aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers that are **monocarboxylic amino acids** with **bulky or hydrophobic side chains** result in a **low yield** due to steric hindrance.*

  - **Explanation**: Bulky side chains can prevent effective coordination between the carboxylate group and the metal catalyst by causing steric clashes.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *(2S)-2-Amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine)
      - *(2S)-6-Acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (Lysine derivative)

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with a **para pyridyl group directly attached to the ring** result in a **low yield**. If the pyridyl group is attached via a spacer, the yield can be **high**.*

  - **Explanation**: Direct attachment of a pyridyl group can cause steric hindrance or create competing coordination sites. A spacer reduces these effects.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (pyridyl group directly attached)
    - **High Yield**:
      - *4-Pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid* (pyridyl group attached via butanoic chain)

---

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers with **thiol groups** on **short aliphatic chains** result in a **high yield**, whereas thiol groups on **aromatic rings** lead to a **low yield** due to potential catalyst poisoning.*

  - **Explanation**: Aliphatic thiols can enhance coordination without deactivating the catalyst. Aromatic thiols may bind too strongly or irreversibly to the metal center, inhibiting catalysis.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *3-Sulfanylpropanoic acid*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Sulfanylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers with **strong electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups** result in a **low yield** due to reduced coordination ability.*

    - **Low Yield**:
      - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid*
      - *4-[(2,2,2-Trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers that are **dicarboxylic acids** with an **additional keto group** adjacent to the carboxyl groups result in a **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: The keto group can interfere with metal coordination by competing with the carboxylate or altering the electronic environment unfavorably.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Oxoheptanedioic acid*
    - **High Yield**:
      - *1,3-Dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid* (benefits from chelation despite the keto groups)

---

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers with **multiple hydroxyl groups** (polyols) near the carboxyl group result in a **low yield** due to potential steric hindrance and competition for coordination.*

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can compete with the carboxylate for metal binding or create steric bulk that hinders effective coordination.

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are **alpha-amino dicarboxylic acids** result in a **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: The presence of two carboxylate groups and an alpha-amino group enhances chelation with the metal catalyst (Fe ion). This configuration allows for effective coordination, stabilizing the metal complex and improving catalytic efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(2S)-2-Aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid)
      - *(2S)-2-Aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid)
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *(2S)-2-Amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine; lacks a second carboxylate group)

---

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with a **para-substituted amino group** result in a **high yield**. Other substituents at the para position may lead to a **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: A para-amino group donates electron density to the aromatic ring, enhancing its ability to coordinate with the metal catalyst. Substituents like methyl or formyl groups may not provide the same coordination benefits and can introduce steric hindrance or electronic effects that reduce yield.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *4-Aminobenzoic acid*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Methylbenzoic acid* (methyl group is less electron-donating)
      - *4-Formylbenzoic acid* (aldehyde group is electron-withdrawing)

---

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are **linear aliphatic carboxylic acids** with a **chain length of six carbons or more** and **without additional polar functional groups** result in a **high yield**. Introducing polar groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) leads to a **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Long-chain aliphatic acids can effectively interact with the catalyst's surface without steric hindrance or competition from additional functional groups. Polar groups may interfere with coordination or introduce steric effects that hinder catalytic activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *Octanoic acid*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *7-Aminoheptanoic acid*
      - *7-Hydroxyheptanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids** with **multiple hydroxyl groups** near the carboxyl group result in a **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance the ability of the modifier to chelate the metal ion, forming stable complexes that improve catalytic performance. These groups can participate in coordination, increasing the interaction sites with the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-Pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
      - *2-[[1,3-Dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*
  
---

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with a **terminal thiol group** result in a **high yield**, whereas **aromatic carboxylic acids** with a **thiol group** lead to a **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Aliphatic thiol groups can coordinate with the metal catalyst without significant steric hindrance, enhancing catalytic activity. In contrast, thiol groups on aromatic rings may bind too strongly or cause deactivation of the catalyst due to stronger π interactions or steric effects.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *3-Sulfanylpropanoic acid*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Sulfanylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with a **para-nitro group** result in a **high yield**.*

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Formylbenzoic acid*
      - *5-Formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers that contain **fluorinated alkyl chains** result in a **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Fluorinated groups are highly electron-withdrawing, reducing the electron density on the carboxylate oxygen atoms. This weakens the coordination ability of the carboxylate group with the metal catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids** with the carboxyl group directly attached to the heterocycle result in a **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Heterocycles containing nitrogen or oxygen can coordinate with the metal ion. Direct attachment of the carboxyl group facilitates bidentate coordination, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst complex.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
      - *1H-Pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers with **multiple ether linkages** near the carboxyl group result in a **low yield** due to increased flexibility hindering effective coordination.*

  - **Explanation**: Ether linkages introduce conformational flexibility and increase the distance between the coordinating groups and the metal center. This reduces the likelihood of effective chelation and weakens the modifier's influence on the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *2-[2-(2-Methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
      - *3-[2-(2-Aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** linked via an **aliphatic chain** to a **heterocycle** result in a **high yield**. Direct attachment without a spacer may lead to a **low yield** due to steric hindrance.*

  - **Explanation**: The aliphatic spacer reduces steric hindrance between the aromatic ring and the heterocycle, allowing both to coordinate effectively with the metal catalyst. This enhances the overall stability and reactivity of the catalyst-modifier complex.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *4-Pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (heterocycle directly attached)

---

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers that are **mono-carboxylic amino acids** with **bulky hydrophobic side chains** result in a **low yield** due to steric hindrance.*

  - **Explanation**: Bulky side chains can obstruct the approach of the modifier to the metal center, impeding effective coordination and reducing catalytic efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *(2S)-2-Amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine)
      - *(2S)-6-Acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (Acetylated lysine)

---

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-donating methoxy groups** on the aromatic ring, attached via an aliphatic chain, result in a **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Methoxy groups increase electron density on the aromatic ring, enhancing its ability to coordinate with the metal catalyst. The aliphatic chain reduces steric hindrance, allowing for effective interaction.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *4-(3,4-Dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers with **aromatic hydroxy groups** attached via a **long aliphatic chain** (five carbons or more) result in a **high yield**, whereas those attached via a short chain (three carbons or fewer) result in a **low yield** due to steric factors.*

  - **Explanation**: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility and reduce steric hindrance, allowing the hydroxy group to participate in coordination without impeding access to the metal center. Short chains may position the bulky aromatic ring too close to the metal, hindering effective coordination.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *5-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *3-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers that are **dicarboxylic acids** with an **additional keto group** in the aliphatic chain result in a **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Keto groups can chelate with the metal ion, potentially disrupting the intended coordination environment or forming less active complexes. They may also participate in side reactions, decreasing the overall yield.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Oxoheptanedioic acid*

---

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with a **para-substituted group capable of coordinating with metals** (e.g., amino, nitro) result in a **high yield**. Those with non-coordinating or electron-withdrawing groups lead to a **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Functional groups like amino or nitro at the para position can coordinate with the Fe ion, enhancing electron density and stabilizing the metal center. Non-coordinating groups or strong electron-withdrawing substituents reduce this effect.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *4-Aminobenzoic acid*
      - *4-Nitrobenzoic acid*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Methylbenzoic acid* (methyl group does not coordinate effectively)

  - **Explanation**: Aliphatic thiol groups can coordinate effectively without steric hindrance. Aromatic thiol groups may bind too strongly or deactivate the catalyst due to their aromatic nature.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *3-Sulfanylpropanoic acid*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Sulfanylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids** with the **carboxyl group attached directly to the heterocycle** result in a **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen) can participate in coordination with the Fe ion, enhancing catalytic activity by forming stable chelate rings.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
      - *1H-Pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*

---

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers with **multiple ether linkages** near the carboxyl group result in a **low yield** due to decreased ability to coordinate effectively with the metal ion.*

  - **Explanation**: Ether linkages introduce flexibility and increase the distance between coordinating groups and the Fe ion, reducing overall coordination strength.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *2-[2-(2-Methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
      - *3-[2-(2-Aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** linked via an **aliphatic chain of four carbons or more** to a **heterocyclic ring** result in a **high yield**. Shorter chains (three carbons or fewer) lead to a **low yield** due to steric hindrance.*

  - **Explanation**: Longer aliphatic chains reduce steric hindrance, allowing both the aromatic and heterocyclic rings to coordinate effectively with the metal ion.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *4-Pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (no aliphatic spacer)

---

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers that are **mono-carboxylic amino acids** with **bulky hydrophobic side chains** result in a **low yield** due to steric interference.*

  - **Explanation**: Bulky side chains (e.g., aromatic rings, long aliphatic chains) can hinder effective coordination with the metal ion by blocking access or causing unfavorable interactions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *(2S)-2-Amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine)
      - *(2S)-6-Acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid*

---

  - **Explanation**: Fluorinated groups reduce electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening interaction with the Fe ion and diminishing catalytic activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with a **para-formyl (aldehyde)** or **electron-withdrawing group** result in a **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, weakening coordination with the Fe ion and leading to less effective catalysis.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Formylbenzoic acid*
      - *5-Formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers that are **linear aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **terminal amino groups** on chains longer than five carbons result in a **low yield**. Shorter chains or amino groups closer to the carboxyl group may result in a **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: In long-chain acids, terminal amino groups may interfere with catalyst interaction due to distance from the carboxylate, while shorter chains allow for better coordination.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *5-Aminopentanoic acid*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *7-Aminoheptanoic acid*
      - *8-Aminooctanoic acid*

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are **dicarboxylic amino acids** (α-amino acids with two carboxylate groups) result in a **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: The presence of two carboxylate groups and an amino group at the α-position allows for strong chelation with the Fe ion, enhancing catalyst stability and activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(2S)-2-Aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid)
      - *(2S)-2-Aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid)
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *(2S)-2-Amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine; only one carboxylate group)

---

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with a **para-substituted amino or nitro group** result in a **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Amino and nitro groups at the para-position can enhance metal coordination through lone pair electrons and influence electronic properties favorably.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *4-Aminobenzoic acid*
      - *4-Nitrobenzoic acid*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Methylbenzoic acid* (methyl group does not facilitate coordination)
      - *4-Formylbenzoic acid* (aldehyde group may not coordinate effectively)

---

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are **linear aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **chain lengths of six to eight carbons** and **no additional polar substituents** result in a **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Medium-chain aliphatic acids can interact favorably with the catalyst surface without steric hindrance from polar groups, promoting efficient catalysis.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *Octanoic acid*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *7-Aminoheptanoic acid* (terminal amino group alters interaction)
      - *8-Aminooctanoic acid* (presence of polar amino group)

---

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are **hydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group** result in a **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxylate can form additional coordination sites with the Fe ion, enhancing catalyst-modifier interactions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-Pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
      - *2-[[1,3-Dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *7-Hydroxyheptanoic acid* (hydroxyl group too distant from the carboxyl group)

---

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with a **para-substituted bromomethyl group** result in a **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: The bromomethyl group can participate in interactions with the metal center or influence electronic properties, promoting catalytic activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *4-(Bromomethyl)benzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids** where the **heterocycle contains nitrogen atoms** and the **carboxyl group is directly attached** result in a **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Nitrogen heterocycles can coordinate with Fe ions, and direct attachment of the carboxyl group facilitates chelation, enhancing catalyst performance.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
      - *1H-Pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (heterocycle not directly linked to carboxyl group)

---

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with a **terminal thiol group** result in a **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Thiol groups can form strong coordination bonds with Fe ions, stabilizing the catalyst-modifier complex.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *3-Sulfanylpropanoic acid*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Sulfanylbenzoic acid* (thiol attached to aromatic ring may hinder coordination)

---

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with a **para-formyl (aldehyde) group** result in a **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups are electron-withdrawing and can reduce the ability of the carboxylate to coordinate with the Fe ion, diminishing catalyst efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Formylbenzoic acid*
      - *5-Formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers that are **fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids** result in a **low yield** due to strong electron-withdrawing effects of fluorine atoms.*

  - **Explanation**: Fluorine's high electronegativity withdraws electron density, weakening coordination with the metal ion and reducing catalytic activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers containing **ether linkages** near the carboxyl group result in a **low yield** due to decreased coordination ability and increased flexibility.*

  - **Explanation**: Ether linkages can reduce the electron density available for coordination and introduce conformational flexibility that hinders effective binding to the Fe ion.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *2-[2-(2-Methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
      - *3-[2-(2-Aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with a **para-methyl group** result in a **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Methyl groups do not enhance coordination with the metal ion and may not significantly influence the electron density of the carboxylate group.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Methylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers that are **amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains** (e.g., aromatic rings or long aliphatic chains) result in a **low yield** due to steric hindrance.*

  - **Explanation**: Bulky side chains can obstruct effective coordination between the modifier and the Fe ion, decreasing catalyst performance.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *(2S)-2-Amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine)
      - *(2S)-6-Acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers that are **linear aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **terminal amino groups located six or more carbons away** from the carboxyl group result in a **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: The distant amino group is less effective in forming chelates with the metal ion, reducing coordination efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *7-Aminoheptanoic acid*
      - *8-Aminooctanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** connected via an **aliphatic spacer (four carbons or more)** to a **heterocyclic ring** result in a **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: The aliphatic spacer provides flexibility, allowing both the aromatic and heterocyclic moieties to coordinate effectively with the Fe ion.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *4-Pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (no aliphatic spacer)

---

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with a **para-hydroxy group directly attached** to the ring result in a **low yield**, whereas those with the hydroxy group attached via an **aliphatic linker** result in a **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Direct attachment may hinder coordination due to hydrogen bonding or steric effects, while an aliphatic linker provides flexibility for effective coordination.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *5-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid* (hydroxyphenyl group linked via an aliphatic chain)
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *3-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (hydroxy group directly attached to aromatic ring)

**End of Rules**

These rules have been developed by analyzing the provided dataset and identifying patterns between functional groups in the molecular modifiers and their corresponding yields in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. The rules combine multiple sub-structures and consider underlying physicochemical properties such as coordination ability, electronic effects, steric hindrance, and the spatial arrangement of functional groups.

- **Coverage and Balance**:
  - The rules cover a broad range of modifiers in the dataset, with a balance between simple rules with higher coverage (e.g., **Rule 2** on para-substituted amino or nitro groups) and more specific rules with lower coverage (e.g., **Rule 9** on fluorinated acids).
  - By prioritizing rules that encompass multiple structural features, the set provides comprehensive insights into how different modifiers affect the reaction yield.

- **Physicochemical Considerations**:
  - **Coordination Ability**: Functional groups capable of donating lone pair electrons (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, thiol, nitrogen in heterocycles) enhance coordination with the Fe ion, improving catalyst activity.
  - **Electronic Effects**: Electron-donating groups increase electron density on coordinating atoms, while electron-withdrawing groups decrease it, affecting coordination strength.
  - **Steric Hindrance**: Bulky substituents or inappropriate positioning of functional groups can obstruct effective interaction with the metal center.
  - **Chain Length and Flexibility**: Optimal distances between functional groups enable effective chelation and coordination with the metal ion.

By applying these rules, chemists can predict whether a given molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield, aiding in the rational design and optimization of the catalyst system for improved reaction outcomes.

**End of Comments**

**Overall Assessment**:

While many of the rules are well-formulated and meet the criteria of clarity, property insight, complexity, and coverage, some rules lack sufficient data support:

- **Rule 5**: Only one data point supports it, limiting its robustness.
- **Rule 9**: Similarly, only one data point is provided, reducing confidence in the rule.
- **Rule 11**: With only one supporting example, the rule's reliability is questionable.

To improve the overall quality of the rules, additional data points should be sought to strengthen these rules or they should be revised to either encompass more examples or be combined with other rules for better coverage. Therefore, the current set of rules may not be sufficient for all future tasks without further refinement and validation.
