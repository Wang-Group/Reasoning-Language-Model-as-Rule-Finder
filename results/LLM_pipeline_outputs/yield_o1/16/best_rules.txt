**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with a substituent at the **para position** relative to the carboxyl group, where the substituent is either electron-donating (e.g., amino, hydroxy) or electron-withdrawing (e.g., nitro, halogens), result in **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Para-substituents enhance delocalization of electron density and improve coordination with the metal catalyst. Both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups at the para position can stabilize the carboxylate anion and facilitate effective interaction with the catalyst.
  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: 
      - *4-Aminobenzoic acid* (para-amino group enhances electron density).
      - *4-Nitrobenzoic acid* (para-nitro group withdraws electrons but stabilizes coordination).
      - *4-(Bromomethyl)benzoic acid* (para-bromomethyl group is electron-withdrawing).
    - **Low Yield**: 
      - *4-Methylbenzoic acid* (methyl group is weakly electron-donating and may not sufficiently enhance coordination).

---

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxylic acid groups (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) result in **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Additional carboxyl groups provide more coordination sites for metal ions, enhancing catalyst binding and stability. The proximity of multiple acidic groups facilitates stronger interactions with the catalyst.
  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: 
      - *(2S)-2-Aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid).
      - *(2S)-2-Aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid).
    - **Low Yield**: 
      - *(2S)-2-Amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine; lacks additional carboxylate group).

---

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms in the ring directly attached to the carboxyl group result in **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings can serve as additional coordination sites, enhancing the interaction with metal catalysts. The ring nitrogen increases electron density at the coordination site, facilitating stronger binding.
  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: 
      - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid).
      - *1H-Pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*.
    - **Low Yield**: 
      - *4-Pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Pyridine ring is not directly attached to the carboxyl group, reducing coordination effectiveness).

---

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer, bearing functional groups such as amino (–NH₂) or thiol (–SH) groups, result in **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Short-chain aliphatic acids with additional coordinating groups enhance interaction with the catalyst without significant steric hindrance. Amino and thiol groups provide extra sites for metal coordination.
  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: 
      - *5-Aminopentanoic acid*.
      - *3-Sulfanylpropanoic acid*.
    - **Low Yield**: 
      - *7-Aminoheptanoic acid* (longer chain introduces steric hindrance).
      - *4-Sulfanylbenzoic acid* (thiol group on aromatic ring may be less effective).

---

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths up to eight carbons and **no additional functional groups** result in **high yield**. However, the presence of polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) on longer chains (more than six carbons) leads to **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Unsubstituted aliphatic acids interact favorably due to minimal steric hindrance and good solubility. In contrast, polar groups on longer chains may interfere with catalyst interaction due to increased flexibility and steric effects.
  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: 
      - *Octanoic acid* (straight-chain C8 acid with no additional groups).
    - **Low Yield**: 
      - *7-Hydroxyheptanoic acid* (hydroxyl group on a long chain may hinder interaction).
      - *7-Aminoheptanoic acid* (amino group on a long chain introduces steric hindrance).

---

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers containing both hydroxyl (–OH) and carboxylic acid groups, particularly polyhydroxy acids (sugar acids), result in **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance solubility in the reaction medium and provide additional coordination sites for metal ions, improving catalyst binding.
  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: 
      - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-Pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid).
      - *2-[[1,3-Dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*.
    - **Low Yield**: 
      - *7-Hydroxyheptanoic acid* (single hydroxyl group on a long chain may not provide sufficient coordination benefit).

---

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers with aliphatic thiol groups (–SH) result in **high yield**, whereas thiol groups attached directly to an aromatic ring result in **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Aliphatic thiols can effectively coordinate with metal ions due to their accessibility and lack of steric hindrance. Aromatic thiols may have reduced availability for coordination due to resonance stabilization and potential steric factors.
  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: 
      - *3-Sulfanylpropanoic acid*.
    - **Low Yield**: 
      - *4-Sulfanylbenzoic acid*.

---

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers containing ether linkages (–O–) adjacent to the carboxylic acid group result in **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Ether linkages introduce flexibility and steric bulk, hindering effective coordination with the catalyst. They may also decrease the overall electron density available for metal binding.
  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**: 
      - *2-[2-(2-Methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*.
      - *3-[2-(2-Aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*.

---

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers containing carbonyl groups (aldehyde or ketone) adjacent to the carboxylic acid or amide linkages near the carboxyl group result in **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Carbonyl and amide groups near the carboxylic acid can chelate metal ions or engage in side reactions, reducing the availability of the catalyst for the desired reaction.
  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**: 
      - *4-Formylbenzoic acid*.
      - *5-Formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*.
      - *4-Oxoheptanedioic acid*.
      - *2-[(4-Hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*.

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains or strong electron-withdrawing groups in aliphatic chains result in **low yield** due to their hydrophobicity and strong electron-withdrawing effects.*

  - **Explanation**: Perfluoroalkyl groups decrease solubility in the reaction medium and reduce the electron density available for coordination, hindering effective interaction with the catalyst.
  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**: 
      - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid*.
      - *4-[(2,2,2-Trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid*.

---

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are N-substituted amino acids or small peptides containing additional amide bonds near the carboxylic acid result in **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Amide bonds can form strong complexes with metal ions, potentially sequestering the catalyst or altering its activity through competitive binding.
  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**: 
      - *(2S)-6-Acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid*.
      - *2-[[(2S)-2-Amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid*.

---

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers that integrate both aromatic and aliphatic moieties, where the aromatic ring carries electron-donating groups and is connected via a flexible linker to the carboxylic acid, result in **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: The flexible linker allows for optimal spatial arrangement, and electron-donating groups on the aromatic ring enhance electron density for better coordination with the catalyst.
  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: 
      - *5-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*.
      - *4-Pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid*.
    - **Low Yield**: 
      - *3-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (shorter linker may not provide optimal positioning for coordination).
