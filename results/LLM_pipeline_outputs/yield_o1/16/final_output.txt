    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are carboxylic acids directly attached to heteroaromatic rings containing nitrogen (e.g., pyridine carboxylic acids, pyrazole carboxylic acids) tend to give high yield.*

  - **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings can coordinate with the iron catalyst, enhancing its stability and activity.
  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid.
    - **Low Yield**: 4-Pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (pyridine ring not directly attached to the carboxyl group).

---

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are amino acids with acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) result in high yield; those with basic or bulky hydrophobic side chains result in low yield.*

  - **Explanation**: Acidic amino acids have additional carboxylate groups that enhance coordination with the metal catalyst, while basic or bulky side chains may hinder interaction due to steric effects or competing binding.
  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (glutamic acid).
    - **Low Yield**: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine), (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (lysine derivative).

---

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are simple saturated aliphatic carboxylic acids with straight chains of up to eight carbons and no additional functional groups result in high yield.*

  - **Explanation**: Straight-chain aliphatic acids can favorably interact with the catalyst without causing steric hindrance, facilitating efficient catalysis.
  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: Octanoic acid, 5-Aminopentanoic acid (short-chain amine).
    - **Low Yield**: 7-Hydroxyheptanoic acid (hydroxyl group may interfere), 8-Aminooctanoic acid (long-chain amine introduces steric hindrance).

---

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers containing electron-donating groups (e.g., amino, methoxy) on aromatic rings in ortho or para positions relative to the carboxylic acid tend to result in high yield.*

  - **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups enhance electron density on the aromatic ring and carboxylate, improving coordination with the metal catalyst.
  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: 4-Aminobenzoic acid, 5-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-(3,4-Dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.
    - **Low Yield**: 3-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (hydroxy group not optimally positioned for interaction).

---

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halogens) on aromatic rings also tend to result in high yield.*

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing its ability to coordinate with the metal catalyst.
  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: 4-Nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(Bromomethyl)benzoic acid.
    - **Low Yield**: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid (perfluorinated chain may reduce solubility and interaction).

---

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers containing aldehyde (–CHO) or ketone (–CO–) groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid on aromatic or aliphatic chains lead to low yield.*

  - **Explanation**: Aldehyde and ketone groups may form complexes with the catalyst or engage in side reactions, reducing its availability for the desired transformation.
  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**: 4-Formylbenzoic acid, 5-Formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid, 4-Oxoheptanedioic acid.
    - **High Yield Exception**: 1,3-Dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid (ketone groups are part of a stable aromatic system).

---

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield.*

  - **Explanation**: Strongly electron-withdrawing perfluorinated chains can destabilize interactions with the catalyst and decrease solubility in the reaction medium.
  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid.

---

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers that contain both a carboxylic acid group and an aliphatic thiol (–SH) group in a short chain lead to high yield; if the thiol is attached to an aromatic ring, the yield is low.*

  - **Explanation**: Aliphatic thiols can coordinate effectively with the metal catalyst, enhancing activity, whereas aromatic thiols may not favor the same interactions due to resonance stabilization or steric factors.
  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: 3-Sulfanylpropanoic acid.
    - **Low Yield**: 4-Sulfanylbenzoic acid.

---

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers that are sugar acids or polyhydroxy carboxylic acids result in high yield.*

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and provide additional coordination sites to stabilize the catalyst.
  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-Pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid).

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers that are amino acids with short aliphatic amino side chains result in high yield; those with longer chains bearing amino groups result in low yield.*

  - **Explanation**: Short-chain amines can interact favorably without causing significant steric hindrance, whereas longer chains may block access to the catalyst's active sites.
  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: 5-Aminopentanoic acid.
    - **Low Yield**: 7-Aminoheptanoic acid, 8-Aminooctanoic acid.

---

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers featuring amide linkages adjacent to carboxylic acids result in low yield.*

  - **Explanation**: Amide groups can strongly bind to the catalyst, potentially deactivating it or hindering substrate access.
  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**: 2-[(4-Hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid, 2-[[(2S)-2-Amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid.

---

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers with multiple ether linkages adjacent to carboxylic acids show low yield.*

  - **Explanation**: Ether linkages can introduce flexibility and steric bulk, disrupting optimal interactions with the catalyst.
  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**: 2-[2-(2-Methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-Aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid.

---

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers that are simple aromatic carboxylic acids without additional substituents or with weakly electron-donating groups at the para position tend to result in low yield.*

  - **Explanation**: Lack of strong electronic or coordinating substituents may lead to weaker interactions with the catalyst.
  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**: 4-Methylbenzoic acid, 3-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (hydroxy group not positioned for optimal interaction).

---

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers containing bulky or sterically hindering groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid tend to give low yield.*

  - **Explanation**: Bulky groups can prevent proper access to the catalyst's active site or interfere with substrate binding.
  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**: 4-Pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (extended conjugation introduces steric hindrance), 4-[(2,2,2-Trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

---

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers that are cyclic anhydrides or lactones capable of ring-opening to present multiple coordination sites tend to result in high yield.*

  - **Explanation**: Ring-opening can generate additional functional groups that stabilize the catalyst through chelation.
  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: 1,3-Dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid (lactone can open under reaction conditions).

**End of Rules**

    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are amino acids with acidic side chains containing additional carboxylic acid groups result in **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: The presence of extra carboxyl groups enhances the ability to coordinate with metal centers, improving catalyst stability and activity.
  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid).
    - **Low Yield**: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine; lacks additional carboxylate group).

---

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., amino, hydroxy) at the para position relative to the carboxyl group result in **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups increase electron density on the aromatic ring and carboxylate, enhancing coordination with metal catalysts.
  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: 4-aminobenzoic acid, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.
    - **Low Yield**: 4-methylbenzoic acid (methyl is weakly donating), 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (hydroxy group not optimally positioned).

---

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halogens) at the para position relative to the carboxyl group result in **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, improving metal coordination due to greater electron acceptance.
  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid.
    - **Low Yield**: 4-methylbenzoic acid (lacks strong electron-withdrawing group).

---

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms in the ring directly attached to the carboxyl group result in **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms can serve as additional coordination sites, stabilizing the metal catalyst complex.
  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (nicotinic acid), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid.
    - **Low Yield**: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (pyridine ring not directly attached to carboxyl group).

---

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers with aliphatic thiol groups (–SH) in short chains result in **high yield**, whereas those with thiol groups attached to aromatic rings result in **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Aliphatic thiols effectively coordinate with metals without steric hindrance; aromatic thiols may be less effective due to resonance and steric factors.
  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.
    - **Low Yield**: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.

---

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with no additional functional groups and chain lengths up to eight carbons result in **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Such modifiers offer minimal steric hindrance and can interact favorably with the catalyst.
  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: Octanoic acid.
    - **Low Yield**: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid (additional hydroxyl group may interfere).

---

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers containing aldehyde (–CHO) or ketone (–C=O) groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid lead to **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Carbonyl groups can chelate metal ions or participate in side reactions, reducing catalyst availability.
  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.
    - **High Yield Exception**: 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid (carbonyl groups within a stable ring system).

---

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers that are sugar acids or polyhydroxy carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups result in **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance solubility and provide additional coordination sites for metal ions.
  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid).

---

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers with long aliphatic chains bearing amino groups (–NH₂) longer than five carbons result in **low yield**; shorter chains result in **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Longer chains introduce steric hindrance and flexibility, interfering with catalyst interaction.
  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: 5-aminopentanoic acid.
    - **Low Yield**: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid.

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers containing perfluorinated alkyl chains result in **low yield** due to their strong electron-withdrawing nature and hydrophobicity.*

  - **Explanation**: Perfluoroalkyl groups decrease solubility and may disrupt favorable interactions with the catalyst.
  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid.

---

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (–O–) adjacent to the carboxylic acid group result in **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Ether linkages increase flexibility and steric bulk, potentially hindering effective catalyst coordination.
  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

---

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers that are N-substituted amino acids or peptides containing amide linkages near the carboxylic acid result in **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Amide groups may form strong complexes with the catalyst, reducing its activity by competitive binding.
  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**: 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid, (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid.

---

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers containing bulky substituents adjacent to the carboxylic acid group tend to give **low yield** due to steric hindrance.*

  - **Explanation**: Bulky groups can obstruct the active site of the catalyst, preventing efficient interaction.
  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.

---

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with substituents at non-optimal positions (not para to the carboxyl group) result in **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Substituent position affects the electronic distribution and coordination ability of the carboxylate.
  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid.

---

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers containing both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups on the aromatic ring may result in **low yield** due to competing electronic effects.*

  - **Explanation**: Conflicting substituents can destabilize interactions with the catalyst or reduce coordination efficiency.
  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**: 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (both hydroxy and formyl groups).

**End of Rules**

---

These rules establish a direct relationship between specific substructures and functional groups in the molecular modifiers and their impact on the reaction yield. By combining multiple functional groups and considering underlying physical and chemical properties—such as coordination ability, steric hindrance, electronic effects, and solubility—the rules aim to predict whether a given modifier will result in a high or low yield. This approach balances broad coverage of the dataset with the specificity needed for accurate predictions, enhancing the control and optimization of the reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with a substituent at the **para position** relative to the carboxyl group, where the substituent is either electron-donating (e.g., amino, hydroxy) or electron-withdrawing (e.g., nitro, halogens), result in **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Para-substituents enhance delocalization of electron density and improve coordination with the metal catalyst. Both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups at the para position can stabilize the carboxylate anion and facilitate effective interaction with the catalyst.
  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: 
      - *4-Aminobenzoic acid* (para-amino group enhances electron density).
      - *4-Nitrobenzoic acid* (para-nitro group withdraws electrons but stabilizes coordination).
      - *4-(Bromomethyl)benzoic acid* (para-bromomethyl group is electron-withdrawing).
    - **Low Yield**: 
      - *4-Methylbenzoic acid* (methyl group is weakly electron-donating and may not sufficiently enhance coordination).

---

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxylic acid groups (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) result in **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Additional carboxyl groups provide more coordination sites for metal ions, enhancing catalyst binding and stability. The proximity of multiple acidic groups facilitates stronger interactions with the catalyst.
  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: 
      - *(2S)-2-Aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid).
      - *(2S)-2-Aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid).
    - **Low Yield**: 
      - *(2S)-2-Amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine; lacks additional carboxylate group).

---

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms in the ring directly attached to the carboxyl group result in **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings can serve as additional coordination sites, enhancing the interaction with metal catalysts. The ring nitrogen increases electron density at the coordination site, facilitating stronger binding.
  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: 
      - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid).
      - *1H-Pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*.
    - **Low Yield**: 
      - *4-Pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Pyridine ring is not directly attached to the carboxyl group, reducing coordination effectiveness).

---

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer, bearing functional groups such as amino (–NH₂) or thiol (–SH) groups, result in **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Short-chain aliphatic acids with additional coordinating groups enhance interaction with the catalyst without significant steric hindrance. Amino and thiol groups provide extra sites for metal coordination.
  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: 
      - *5-Aminopentanoic acid*.
      - *3-Sulfanylpropanoic acid*.
    - **Low Yield**: 
      - *7-Aminoheptanoic acid* (longer chain introduces steric hindrance).
      - *4-Sulfanylbenzoic acid* (thiol group on aromatic ring may be less effective).

---

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths up to eight carbons and **no additional functional groups** result in **high yield**. However, the presence of polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) on longer chains (more than six carbons) leads to **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Unsubstituted aliphatic acids interact favorably due to minimal steric hindrance and good solubility. In contrast, polar groups on longer chains may interfere with catalyst interaction due to increased flexibility and steric effects.
  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: 
      - *Octanoic acid* (straight-chain C8 acid with no additional groups).
    - **Low Yield**: 
      - *7-Hydroxyheptanoic acid* (hydroxyl group on a long chain may hinder interaction).
      - *7-Aminoheptanoic acid* (amino group on a long chain introduces steric hindrance).

---

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers containing both hydroxyl (–OH) and carboxylic acid groups, particularly polyhydroxy acids (sugar acids), result in **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance solubility in the reaction medium and provide additional coordination sites for metal ions, improving catalyst binding.
  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: 
      - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-Pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid).
      - *2-[[1,3-Dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*.
    - **Low Yield**: 
      - *7-Hydroxyheptanoic acid* (single hydroxyl group on a long chain may not provide sufficient coordination benefit).

---

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers with aliphatic thiol groups (–SH) result in **high yield**, whereas thiol groups attached directly to an aromatic ring result in **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Aliphatic thiols can effectively coordinate with metal ions due to their accessibility and lack of steric hindrance. Aromatic thiols may have reduced availability for coordination due to resonance stabilization and potential steric factors.
  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: 
      - *3-Sulfanylpropanoic acid*.
    - **Low Yield**: 
      - *4-Sulfanylbenzoic acid*.

---

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers containing ether linkages (–O–) adjacent to the carboxylic acid group result in **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Ether linkages introduce flexibility and steric bulk, hindering effective coordination with the catalyst. They may also decrease the overall electron density available for metal binding.
  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**: 
      - *2-[2-(2-Methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*.
      - *3-[2-(2-Aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*.

---

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers containing carbonyl groups (aldehyde or ketone) adjacent to the carboxylic acid or amide linkages near the carboxyl group result in **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Carbonyl and amide groups near the carboxylic acid can chelate metal ions or engage in side reactions, reducing the availability of the catalyst for the desired reaction.
  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**: 
      - *4-Formylbenzoic acid*.
      - *5-Formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*.
      - *4-Oxoheptanedioic acid*.
      - *2-[(4-Hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*.

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains or strong electron-withdrawing groups in aliphatic chains result in **low yield** due to their hydrophobicity and strong electron-withdrawing effects.*

  - **Explanation**: Perfluoroalkyl groups decrease solubility in the reaction medium and reduce the electron density available for coordination, hindering effective interaction with the catalyst.
  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**: 
      - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid*.
      - *4-[(2,2,2-Trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid*.

---

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are N-substituted amino acids or small peptides containing additional amide bonds near the carboxylic acid result in **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Amide bonds can form strong complexes with metal ions, potentially sequestering the catalyst or altering its activity through competitive binding.
  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**: 
      - *(2S)-6-Acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid*.
      - *2-[[(2S)-2-Amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid*.

---

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers that integrate both aromatic and aliphatic moieties, where the aromatic ring carries electron-donating groups and is connected via a flexible linker to the carboxylic acid, result in **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: The flexible linker allows for optimal spatial arrangement, and electron-donating groups on the aromatic ring enhance electron density for better coordination with the catalyst.
  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: 
      - *5-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*.
      - *4-Pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid*.
    - **Low Yield**: 
      - *3-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (shorter linker may not provide optimal positioning for coordination).

These rules combine multiple substructures and functional groups to illustrate their collective impact on the reaction yield. By considering factors such as coordination ability, steric hindrance, electronic effects, and solubility, the rules provide a nuanced understanding of how molecular modifiers influence the catalytic activity in the reaction. This comprehensive approach aims to accurately predict whether a given modifier will result in a high or low yield, facilitating better control and optimization of the reaction process.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with a substituent at the **para position** relative to the carboxyl group, where the substituent is a strong **electron-donating group** (e.g., amino, hydroxy) or a strong **electron-withdrawing group** (e.g., nitro), result in **high yield**. Substitution with weakly electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl) leads to **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Strong electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups at the para position enhance the ability of the carboxylate to coordinate with the metal catalyst. These groups influence the electron density and resonance stabilization of the aromatic ring, promoting better interaction with the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**: 
      - *4-Aminobenzoic acid* (para-amino group is strongly electron-donating).
      - *4-Nitrobenzoic acid* (para-nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing).
    - **Low Yield**: 
      - *4-Methylbenzoic acid* (methyl group is a weak electron-donating group and does not sufficiently enhance coordination).

---

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are **amino acids** containing an additional **carboxylic acid group** in the side chain (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) result in **high yield**. Amino acids lacking the additional carboxyl group result in **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: The presence of a second carboxylic acid group provides additional coordination sites for metal ions, enhancing binding and stability of the catalyst. This facilitates effective metal-ligand interactions crucial for catalysis.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(2S)-2-Aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid).
      - *(2S)-2-Aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid).
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *(2S)-2-Amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine; lacks an extra carboxyl group).

---

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids** where the heteroatom (e.g., nitrogen) in the aromatic ring is directly attached to the **carboxyl group** result in **high yield**. If the heteroatom is not directly attached, the yield is **low**.*

  - **Explanation**: Direct attachment of the carboxyl group to a heteroatom-containing aromatic ring enhances electron delocalization and coordination ability with metal ions. The heteroatom can participate in metal binding, improving catalytic activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (nicotinic acid; carboxyl group attached at position 3 adjacent to nitrogen).
      - *1H-Pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid* (carboxyl group directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring).
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (pyridine ring not directly attached to the carboxyl group).

---

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are **straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** with chain lengths of **three to eight carbons** and **no additional functional groups** result in **high yield**. The presence of polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) on chains longer than five carbons leads to **low yield** due to steric hindrance and reduced coordination efficiency.*

  - **Explanation**: Unsubstituted aliphatic acids of moderate chain length interact favorably with the catalyst due to minimal steric hindrance and optimal hydrophobic-hydrophilic balance. Polar groups on longer chains may introduce flexibility and steric effects that hinder effective metal coordination.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *Octanoic acid* (C8 straight-chain fatty acid without additional groups).
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *7-Aminoheptanoic acid* (amino group on a long chain introduces steric hindrance).
      - *7-Hydroxyheptanoic acid* (hydroxyl group on a long chain may interfere with coordination).

---

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are **short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** (chain lengths up to five carbons) bearing additional coordinating groups such as **amino (–NH₂)** or **thiol (–SH)** groups result in **high yield**. Longer chains with such groups result in **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Short-chain acids with coordinating functional groups can effectively interact with the metal catalyst without significant steric hindrance. These groups provide additional metal-binding sites, enhancing catalytic activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *5-Aminopentanoic acid* (short chain with amino group).
      - *3-Sulfanylpropanoic acid* (short chain with thiol group).
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *7-Aminoheptanoic acid* (longer chain length reduces coordination efficiency).
      - *8-Aminooctanoic acid* (long chain with amino group introduces steric hindrance).

---

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers containing **multiple hydroxyl groups** along with a **carboxylic acid** group, particularly **polyhydroxy acids** (e.g., sugar acids), result in **high yield**. Modifiers with a **single hydroxyl group** on long aliphatic chains result in **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance solubility and provide several coordination sites for metal ions, facilitating stronger catalyst-modifier interactions. Single hydroxyl groups on long chains do not offer the same coordination benefits and may introduce steric hindrance.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-Pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (gluconic acid; multiple hydroxyl groups).
      - *2-[[1,3-Dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid* (multiple hydroxyl groups).
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *7-Hydroxyheptanoic acid* (single hydroxyl group on a long chain).

---

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers containing **ether linkages (–O–)** or **long flexible chains** with polar functional groups near the carboxylate result in **low yield** due to decreased coordination efficiency.*

  - **Explanation**: Ether linkages and flexible chains introduce mobility that can hinder the optimal positioning of the carboxylate and other coordinating groups for effective metal binding. This reduces the overall stability and activity of the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *2-[2-(2-Methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid* (contains ether linkages adjacent to the carboxyl group).
      - *3-[2-(2-Aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid* (ether linkages with amino group).

---

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers containing strong **electron-withdrawing groups** on an **aliphatic chain**, such as **perfluoroalkyl groups**, result in **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Strong electron-withdrawing groups reduce the electron density of the carboxylate anion, diminishing its ability to coordinate with the metal catalyst. Additionally, perfluorinated chains are highly hydrophobic, reducing solubility and interaction with the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid* (perfluorinated alkyl chain).
      - *4-[(2,2,2-Trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid* (trifluoromethyl group).

---

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers with **carbonyl groups** (aldehyde or ketone) or **amide bonds** adjacent to or near the **carboxyl group** result in **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Carbonyl groups and amide bonds near the carboxyl group can engage in competing interactions with metal ions or participate in side reactions, reducing the availability of the carboxylate for effective catalyst coordination.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Formylbenzoic acid* (aldehyde group adjacent to carboxyl).
      - *4-Oxoheptanedioic acid* (ketone group in proximity to carboxyl groups).
      - *2-[(4-Hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid* (amide bond near carboxyl group).

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers that are **N-acetylated amino acids** or **small peptides** containing additional **amide bonds** near the carboxyl group result in **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: The presence of amide bonds can sequester metal ions through strong coordination, reducing the availability of the catalyst for the desired reaction. This competitive binding diminishes catalytic efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *(2S)-6-Acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-acetylated lysine).
      - *2-[[(2S)-2-Amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid* (peptide bond near carboxyl group).

**End of Rules**

---

These rules are designed to capture the relationship between the molecular features of modifiers and their effect on the yield of the reaction. By considering combinations of substructures—such as functional groups and chain length—and underlying physicochemical properties like electron density, steric hindrance, and coordination ability, the rules provide a comprehensive framework to predict whether a given modifier will result in a high or low yield.

The rules prioritize broader coverage of the dataset while balancing simplicity and complexity:

- **Rules 1 to 3** focus on aromatic and heteroaromatic carboxylic acids, emphasizing the position and nature of substituents.
- **Rules 4 and 5** address aliphatic carboxylic acids, considering chain length and the presence of coordinating functional groups.
- **Rule 6** highlights the impact of multiple hydroxyl groups in enhancing yield.
- **Rules 7 to 10** identify structural features that lead to low yield, such as ether linkages, strong electron-withdrawing groups, adjacent carbonyl or amide groups, and N-acetylation.

Each rule clearly predicts the expected yield based on structural characteristics, providing guidance for selecting or designing modifiers to optimize the reaction outcome.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are **dicarboxylic amino acids** with an **α-amino group** result in a **high yield**. Examples include aspartic acid and glutamic acid.*

  - **Explanation**: The presence of two carboxylate groups and an amino group allows for multiple coordination sites with the metal catalyst. This enhances the stability and reactivity of the metal-ligand complex, improving catalytic efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(2S)-2-Aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid)
      - *(2S)-2-Aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid)
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *(2S)-2-Amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine; monocarboxylic amino acid)

---

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with a **strong electron-donating (e.g., amino, hydroxy) or electron-withdrawing (e.g., nitro, halogen) group at the para position** result in a **high yield**. Weak electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl) lead to a **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Electron-donating or withdrawing groups at the para position modulate the electron density of the carboxylate group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal ions. This strengthens metal-ligand interactions and boosts catalytic activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *4-Aminobenzoic acid* (strong electron-donating amino group)
      - *4-Nitrobenzoic acid* (strong electron-withdrawing nitro group)
      - *4-(Bromomethyl)benzoic acid* (electron-withdrawing bromomethyl group)
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Methylbenzoic acid* (weak electron-donating methyl group)

---

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **chain lengths of five to eight carbons** and **no additional polar functional groups** result in a **high yield**. Introducing polar groups on longer chains leads to a **low yield** due to steric hindrance and reduced solubility.*

  - **Explanation**: Medium-chain aliphatic acids without bulky or polar substituents interact effectively with the catalyst. Additional polar functional groups or longer chains can cause steric hindrance and affect solubility, reducing coordination efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *Octanoic acid* (C8 aliphatic acid with no substituents)
      - *5-Aminopentanoic acid* (C5 chain with an amino group enhancing coordination)
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *7-Aminoheptanoic acid* (C7 chain with an amino group causing steric hindrance)
      - *8-Aminooctanoic acid* (longer chain leading to decreased yield)

---

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids** with multiple **hydroxyl groups** in addition to a **carboxyl group** result in a **high yield**. Single hydroxyl groups on long aliphatic chains result in a **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites and enhance water solubility, promoting better interaction with the metal catalyst. Single hydroxyl groups may not significantly improve coordination and can introduce steric hindrance on long chains.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-Pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
      - *2-[[1,3-Dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *7-Hydroxyheptanoic acid* (single hydroxyl group on a long aliphatic chain)

---

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids** with the **carboxyl group adjacent to a heteroatom** (e.g., nitrogen or oxygen) result in a **high yield**. If the carboxyl group is not adjacent to the heteroatom, the yield is **low**.*

  - **Explanation**: The proximity of the carboxyl group to a heteroatom enhances electron delocalization and coordination potential with metal ions, strengthening the catalyst's performance.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid; carboxyl adjacent to nitrogen)
      - *1H-Pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid* (carboxyl adjacent to multiple nitrogen atoms)
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (carboxyl group not adjacent to heteroatom)
      - *Pyridine-4-carboxylic acid* (Isonicotinic acid; carboxyl opposite nitrogen)

---

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers with **ether linkages (–O–)** near the **carboxyl group** result in a **low yield** due to increased molecular flexibility that hinders effective metal coordination.*

  - **Explanation**: Ether linkages can increase flexibility and disrupt the optimal orientation needed for strong metal coordination, weakening the metal-ligand interaction and reducing catalytic efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *2-[2-(2-Methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
      - *3-[2-(2-Aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers containing **strong electron-withdrawing groups** (e.g., perfluoroalkyl groups) on an **aliphatic chain** result in a **low yield**. These groups reduce the carboxylate's ability to coordinate with metal ions.*

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups decrease the electron density of the carboxylate anion, weakening its interaction with metal ions and diminishing catalytic efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid* (perfluorinated aliphatic acid)
      - *4-[(2,2,2-Trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid* (trifluoroacetyl group)

---

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers with **adjacent carbonyl groups** (aldehyde or ketone) to the **carboxyl group** result in a **low yield** due to potential interference with metal coordination.*

  - **Explanation**: Carbonyl groups near the carboxylate can engage in intramolecular interactions or compete for coordination with the metal ion, limiting the availability of the carboxylate for effective binding.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Formylbenzoic acid* (aldehyde adjacent to carboxyl group)
      - *4-Oxoheptanedioic acid* (ketone near carboxyl groups)

---

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers with **amide bonds near the carboxyl group** result in a **low yield** due to competition between amide and carboxylate groups for metal coordination.*

  - **Explanation**: Amide groups can form complexes with metal ions, potentially competing with the carboxylate group and reducing overall coordination efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *2-[(4-Hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*
      - *(2S)-6-Acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **bulky substituents** near the **carboxyl group** or **multiple aromatic rings** result in a **low yield** due to steric hindrance impeding metal coordination.*

  - **Explanation**: Bulky groups can obstruct the approach of the carboxylate to the metal center, reducing binding affinity and catalytic efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-(3,4-Dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid*
      - *2-[[(2S)-2-Amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid* (contains bulky side chain)

---

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers with **thiol groups (–SH)** on **short aliphatic chains** result in a **high yield**, whereas thiol groups on **aromatic rings** lead to a **low yield** due to potential catalyst poisoning.*

  - **Explanation**: Aliphatic thiol groups can provide additional coordination sites without deactivating the metal catalyst. Aromatic thiols may bind too strongly or irreversibly to metal ions, inhibiting catalytic activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *3-Sulfanylpropanoic acid* (thiol on aliphatic chain)
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Sulfanylbenzoic acid* (thiol on aromatic ring)

---

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with a **hydroxyl group at the meta position** relative to the carboxyl group result in a **high yield**. Hydroxyl groups at other positions may lead to a **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: A hydroxyl group at the meta position can enhance coordination through hydrogen bonding or resonance effects without causing steric hindrance.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *5-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid* (hydroxyl meta to carboxyl group when considering the phenyl ring)
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *3-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (hydroxyl para to carboxyl group but on a shorter chain causing steric issues)

---

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers with **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** (chain lengths greater than eight carbons) result in a **low yield** due to decreased solubility and increased hydrophobicity.*

  - **Explanation**: Long aliphatic chains may reduce the modifier's solubility in the reaction medium, hindering effective interaction with the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *Decanoic acid* (though not listed in the dataset, extended from observed patterns)

---

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers that are **amino acids with sulfur-containing side chains**, such as methionine derivatives, result in a **low yield** due to potential interference with the catalyst.*

  - **Explanation**: Sulfur-containing side chains can bind strongly to metal ions, potentially deactivating the catalyst or altering its activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *2-[[(2S)-2-Amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid*

---

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers with **multiple coordinating functional groups** (e.g., carboxylate, amino, hydroxyl) in a configuration that allows for chelation result in a **high yield**. Dispersed functional groups without chelating ability lead to a **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Chelation enhances the strength and stability of the metal-ligand complex, improving catalytic efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-Pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (multiple hydroxyls near the carboxyl group)
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *3-[2-(2-Aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid* (functional groups too dispersed for effective chelation)

**End of Rules**

---

These rules illustrate the relationships between specific combinations of substructures in the molecular modifiers and their impact on the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By considering underlying physicochemical properties such as coordination ability, electronic effects, steric factors, and solubility, the rules provide a predictive framework for determining whether a given modifier will result in a high or low yield.

The rules balance simplicity and complexity while covering a broad range of the dataset:

- **Rules 1 to 5** focus on the effects of functional groups adjacent to coordination sites, highlighting how amino acids, electron-donating and withdrawing groups, and heterocycles influence yield.
- **Rules 6 to 10** address structural features that hinder coordination, such as ether linkages, steric hindrance from bulky substituents, and electron-withdrawing groups.
- **Rules 11 to 15** consider the position and nature of specific functional groups like thiols, hydroxyls, and amino groups, emphasizing the importance of chelation and functional group configuration.

By applying these rules, chemists can rationalize the observed yields in the dataset and make informed decisions when selecting or designing modifiers to optimize the reaction outcome.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic dicarboxylic acids** with an **alpha-amino group** result in a **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: The presence of two carboxylate groups and an alpha-amino group enhances chelation with the metal catalyst, improving coordination and catalytic efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(2S)-2-Aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid)
      - *(2S)-2-Aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid)
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *(2S)-2-Amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine; lacks a second carboxylate group)

---

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with a **para-substituted amino or nitro group** result in a **high yield**. Other substituents at the para position may lead to a **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Para amino or nitro groups influence the electron density of the aromatic ring, enhancing coordination with the metal ion. Amino groups are electron-donating, while nitro groups are electron-withdrawing, both facilitating effective interaction.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *4-Aminobenzoic acid*
      - *4-Nitrobenzoic acid*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Methylbenzoic acid* (methyl group may cause steric hindrance)
      - *4-Formylbenzoic acid* (aldehyde group can interfere with coordination)

---

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids** with the carboxyl group directly attached to the ring result in a **high yield**. If the heterocycle is attached via a spacer, the yield may be **low** due to steric factors.*

  - **Explanation**: Heterocyclic rings containing nitrogen or oxygen can coordinate with metal ions. Direct attachment of the carboxyl group facilitates chelation, stabilizing the metal complex.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
      - *1H-Pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (pyridine ring attached via a benzene ring)

---

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with a **terminal thiol group** on a short chain (three carbons) result in a **high yield**, whereas thiol groups on aromatic rings lead to a **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Short aliphatic thiols enhance coordination without significant steric hindrance or catalyst poisoning. Aromatic thiols might bind too strongly or deactivate the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *3-Sulfanylpropanoic acid*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Sulfanylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** (six or more carbons) without additional functional groups result in a **high yield**. Adding polar groups (e.g., amino, hydroxy) to long chains leads to a **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Simple long-chain acids can effectively coordinate without steric or electronic interference. Additional polar groups may introduce steric hindrance or compete for coordination sites.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *Octanoic acid*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *7-Aminoheptanoic acid*
      - *7-Hydroxyheptanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers with **multiple ether linkages** near the carboxyl group result in a **low yield** due to increased flexibility hindering effective coordination.*

  - **Explanation**: Ether linkages introduce conformational flexibility, reducing the ability of the carboxylate group to effectively coordinate with the metal catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *2-[2-(2-Methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
      - *3-[2-(2-Aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with a **para-substituted formyl (aldehyde) group** result in a **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups can interfere with metal coordination or participate in side reactions, diminishing the effectiveness of the modifier.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Formylbenzoic acid*
      - *5-Formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers that are **fluorinated carboxylic acids** or have **strong electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups** result in a **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Fluorinated groups decrease the electron density on the carboxylate, weakening coordination with the metal catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid*
      - *4-[(2,2,2-Trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers that are **mono-carboxylic amino acids** with **bulky or hydrophobic side chains** result in a **low yield** due to steric hindrance.*

  - **Explanation**: Bulky side chains can hinder effective coordination between the carboxylate group and the metal catalyst by causing steric clashes.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *(2S)-2-Amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine)
      - *(2S)-6-Acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers that are **dicarboxylic acids** with an **additional keto group** within an aliphatic chain result in a **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Keto groups can interfere with metal coordination or react undesirably with the catalyst.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Oxoheptanedioic acid*
    - **High Yield**:
      - *1,3-Dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid* (Ring structure aids chelation)

---

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** linked to **heterocycles** via an aliphatic spacer result in a **high yield**. Direct attachment without a spacer may lead to a **low yield** due to steric hindrance.*

  - **Explanation**: The spacer reduces steric hindrance and allows both the aromatic ring and the heterocycle to contribute to coordination.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *4-Pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid*
      - *4-(3,4-Dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (heterocycle directly attached)

---

- **Rule 12 (Revised)**: *Modifiers with **multiple hydroxyl groups** near the carboxyl group that are capable of forming stable chelate rings with the metal ion result in a **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups allow for chelation with the metal catalyst, stabilizing the complex and enhancing catalytic activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-Pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
      - *2-[[1,3-Dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*

---

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with an **amide linkage adjacent to the carboxyl group** result in a **low yield** due to potential competition for metal coordination.*

  - **Explanation**: Amide groups can coordinate with metal ions, potentially competing with the carboxylate group and reducing overall coordination efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *2-[(4-Hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*
      - *2-[[(2S)-2-Amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid*

---

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers that are **short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** (five carbons or fewer) with an **additional polar functional group** (e.g., amino, thiol) result in a **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Short chains with polar groups enhance coordination without significant steric hindrance, improving catalytic activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *5-Aminopentanoic acid*
      - *3-Sulfanylpropanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers with **electron-donating methoxy groups** on an aromatic ring, linked via an aliphatic chain, result in a **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Methoxy groups enhance electron density, and the aliphatic chain reduces steric hindrance, facilitating effective coordination.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *4-(3,4-Dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 16 (New Rule)**: *Modifiers with an **aromatic hydroxy group** attached via a **long aliphatic chain** (five carbons or more) result in a **high yield**, whereas those attached via a short chain (three carbons or fewer) result in a **low yield** due to steric factors.*

  - **Explanation**: Longer aliphatic chains reduce steric hindrance and allow better interaction with catalytic sites, while short chains can cause steric clashes or insufficient separation.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *5-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *3-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been generated by thoroughly analyzing the dataset and considering the underlying physicochemical properties of the molecular modifiers. They aim to provide a predictive framework for determining whether a given modifier will result in a high or low yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

- **Corrections and Additions**:
  - **Rule 12** has been revised to align with the observed data, recognizing that multiple hydroxyl groups capable of chelation contribute to a high yield.
  - **Rule 16** has been added to account for the effect of chain length on modifiers with aromatic hydroxy groups, enhancing the rules' predictive capacity.

- **Coverage and Balance**: The rules cover a broad range of modifiers in the dataset, balancing between simple rules with higher coverage (e.g., Rules 1, 2, 5) and more complex rules with lower coverage (e.g., Rules 10, 13).

- **Physicochemical Considerations**: The rules consider electronic effects (electron-donating or withdrawing groups), steric factors (chain length, functional group positioning), and coordination ability (presence of amino, thiol, hydroxyl groups), consistent with principles of metal coordination chemistry.

By applying these rules, chemists can rationalize observed yields and make informed decisions when selecting or designing molecular modifiers to optimize the reaction outcome.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are **alpha-amino dicarboxylic acids** result in a **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: The presence of two carboxylate groups and an alpha-amino group enhances chelation with the Fe ion, forming stable complexes that improve catalytic activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(2S)-2-Aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid)
      - *(2S)-2-Aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid)
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *(2S)-2-Amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine; lacks a second carboxylate group)

---

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with a **para-substituted group capable of coordinating with metals** (e.g., amino, nitro) result in a **high yield**. Those with non-coordinating or electron-withdrawing groups lead to a **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Functional groups like amino or nitro at the para position can coordinate with the Fe ion, enhancing electron density and stabilizing the metal center. Non-coordinating groups or strong electron-withdrawing substituents reduce this effect.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *4-Aminobenzoic acid*
      - *4-Nitrobenzoic acid*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Methylbenzoic acid* (methyl group does not coordinate effectively)
      - *4-Formylbenzoic acid* (aldehyde is electron-withdrawing)

---

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are **linear aliphatic carboxylic acids** with a **chain length of six to eight carbons** and **no additional polar functional groups** result in a **high yield**. Introducing polar groups (e.g., amino, hydroxy) at terminal positions leads to a **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Medium-chain aliphatic acids can interact favorably with the catalyst surface without steric hindrance. Polar groups may create unfavorable interactions or interfere with metal coordination.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *Octanoic acid*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *7-Aminoheptanoic acid*
      - *7-Hydroxyheptanoic acid*
      - *8-Aminooctanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **multiple hydroxyl groups** near the carboxyl group result in a **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance chelation with the Fe ion, increasing the stability of the catalyst-modifier complex and improving reaction efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-Pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
      - *2-[[1,3-Dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*

---

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with a **terminal thiol group** result in a **high yield**, while those with thiol groups on an aromatic ring lead to a **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Aliphatic thiol groups can coordinate effectively without steric hindrance. Aromatic thiol groups may bind too strongly or deactivate the catalyst due to their aromatic nature.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *3-Sulfanylpropanoic acid*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Sulfanylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids** with the **carboxyl group attached directly to the heterocycle** result in a **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen) can participate in coordination with the Fe ion, enhancing catalytic activity by forming stable chelate rings.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
      - *1H-Pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*

---

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers with **multiple ether linkages** near the carboxyl group result in a **low yield** due to decreased ability to coordinate effectively with the metal ion.*

  - **Explanation**: Ether linkages introduce flexibility and increase the distance between coordinating groups and the Fe ion, reducing overall coordination strength.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *2-[2-(2-Methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
      - *3-[2-(2-Aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** linked via an **aliphatic chain of four carbons or more** to a **heterocyclic ring** result in a **high yield**. Shorter chains (three carbons or fewer) lead to a **low yield** due to steric hindrance.*

  - **Explanation**: Longer aliphatic chains reduce steric hindrance, allowing both the aromatic and heterocyclic rings to coordinate effectively with the metal ion.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *4-Pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (no aliphatic spacer)

---

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers that are **mono-carboxylic amino acids** with **bulky hydrophobic side chains** result in a **low yield** due to steric interference.*

  - **Explanation**: Bulky side chains (e.g., aromatic rings, long aliphatic chains) can hinder effective coordination with the metal ion by blocking access or causing unfavorable interactions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *(2S)-2-Amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine)
      - *(2S)-6-Acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers that contain **fluorinated alkyl chains** result in a **low yield** due to strong electron-withdrawing effects.*

  - **Explanation**: Fluorinated groups reduce electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening interaction with the Fe ion and diminishing catalytic activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with a **para-formyl (aldehyde)** or **electron-withdrawing group** result in a **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, weakening coordination with the Fe ion and leading to less effective catalysis.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Formylbenzoic acid*
      - *5-Formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers that are **linear aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **terminal amino groups** on chains longer than five carbons result in a **low yield**. Shorter chains or amino groups closer to the carboxyl group may result in a **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: In long-chain acids, terminal amino groups may interfere with catalyst interaction due to distance from the carboxylate, while shorter chains allow for better coordination.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *5-Aminopentanoic acid*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *7-Aminoheptanoic acid*
      - *8-Aminooctanoic acid*

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been developed by analyzing the provided dataset and identifying patterns between the molecular structures of the modifiers and their corresponding yields in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. The rules focus on combinations of functional groups and their influence on metal coordination, electronic effects, and steric factors.

- **Coverage and Balance**: The rules provide a balance between broad coverage (e.g., Rules 1, 2, 3) and specificity (e.g., Rules 10, 11). They cover a wide range of modifiers in the dataset while highlighting important structural features that significantly impact the reaction yield.

- **Physicochemical Considerations**: Key aspects considered include:
  - **Coordination Ability**: Presence of functional groups (e.g., amino, nitro, thiol, hydroxyl) capable of coordinating with the Fe ion.
  - **Electronic Effects**: Influence of electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups on the modifier's ability to interact with the catalyst.
  - **Steric Factors**: Impact of molecular size, chain length, and functional group positioning on the accessibility of the metal center.
  - **Flexibility and Conformational Effects**: How structural features like ether linkages affect the modifier's conformation and coordination potential.

By applying these rules, chemists can predict whether a given molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield. This predictive framework aids in the rational design and selection of modifiers to optimize the reaction outcome, facilitating the development of more efficient catalytic systems.---------------------------------------------------------------

    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are **dicarboxylic amino acids** (α-amino acids with two carboxylate groups) result in a **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: The presence of two carboxylate groups and an amino group at the α-position allows for strong chelation with the Fe ion, enhancing catalyst stability and activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(2S)-2-Aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid)
      - *(2S)-2-Aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid)
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *(2S)-2-Amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine; only one carboxylate group)

---

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with a **para-substituted amino or nitro group** result in a **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Amino and nitro groups at the para-position can enhance metal coordination through lone pair electrons and influence electronic properties favorably.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *4-Aminobenzoic acid*
      - *4-Nitrobenzoic acid*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Methylbenzoic acid* (methyl group does not facilitate coordination)
      - *4-Formylbenzoic acid* (aldehyde group may not coordinate effectively)

---

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are **linear aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **chain lengths of six to eight carbons** and **no additional polar substituents** result in a **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Medium-chain aliphatic acids can interact favorably with the catalyst surface without steric hindrance from polar groups, promoting efficient catalysis.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *Octanoic acid*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *7-Aminoheptanoic acid* (terminal amino group alters interaction)
      - *8-Aminooctanoic acid* (presence of polar amino group)

---

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are **hydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group** result in a **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxylate can form additional coordination sites with the Fe ion, enhancing catalyst-modifier interactions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-Pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
      - *2-[[1,3-Dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *7-Hydroxyheptanoic acid* (hydroxyl group too distant from the carboxyl group)

---

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with a **para-substituted bromomethyl group** result in a **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: The bromomethyl group can participate in interactions with the metal center or influence electronic properties, promoting catalytic activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *4-(Bromomethyl)benzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids** where the **heterocycle contains nitrogen atoms** and the **carboxyl group is directly attached** result in a **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Nitrogen heterocycles can coordinate with Fe ions, and direct attachment of the carboxyl group facilitates chelation, enhancing catalyst performance.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
      - *1H-Pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (heterocycle not directly linked to carboxyl group)

---

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with a **terminal thiol group** result in a **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Thiol groups can form strong coordination bonds with Fe ions, stabilizing the catalyst-modifier complex.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *3-Sulfanylpropanoic acid*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Sulfanylbenzoic acid* (thiol attached to aromatic ring may hinder coordination)

---

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with a **para-formyl (aldehyde) group** result in a **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups are electron-withdrawing and can reduce the ability of the carboxylate to coordinate with the Fe ion, diminishing catalyst efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Formylbenzoic acid*
      - *5-Formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers that are **fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids** result in a **low yield** due to strong electron-withdrawing effects of fluorine atoms.*

  - **Explanation**: Fluorine's high electronegativity withdraws electron density, weakening coordination with the metal ion and reducing catalytic activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers containing **ether linkages** near the carboxyl group result in a **low yield** due to decreased coordination ability and increased flexibility.*

  - **Explanation**: Ether linkages can reduce the electron density available for coordination and introduce conformational flexibility that hinders effective binding to the Fe ion.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *2-[2-(2-Methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
      - *3-[2-(2-Aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with a **para-methyl group** result in a **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Methyl groups do not enhance coordination with the metal ion and may not significantly influence the electron density of the carboxylate group.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Methylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers that are **amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains** (e.g., aromatic rings or long aliphatic chains) result in a **low yield** due to steric hindrance.*

  - **Explanation**: Bulky side chains can obstruct effective coordination between the modifier and the Fe ion, decreasing catalyst performance.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *(2S)-2-Amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine)
      - *(2S)-6-Acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers that are **linear aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **terminal amino groups located six or more carbons away** from the carboxyl group result in a **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: The distant amino group is less effective in forming chelates with the metal ion, reducing coordination efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *7-Aminoheptanoic acid*
      - *8-Aminooctanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** connected via an **aliphatic spacer (four carbons or more)** to a **heterocyclic ring** result in a **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: The aliphatic spacer provides flexibility, allowing both the aromatic and heterocyclic moieties to coordinate effectively with the Fe ion.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *4-Pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (no aliphatic spacer)

---

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with a **para-hydroxy group directly attached** to the ring result in a **low yield**, whereas those with the hydroxy group attached via an **aliphatic linker** result in a **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Direct attachment may hinder coordination due to hydrogen bonding or steric effects, while an aliphatic linker provides flexibility for effective coordination.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *5-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid* (hydroxyphenyl group linked via an aliphatic chain)
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *3-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (hydroxy group directly attached to aromatic ring)

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been developed by analyzing the provided dataset and identifying patterns between functional groups in the molecular modifiers and their corresponding yields in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. The rules combine multiple sub-structures and consider underlying physicochemical properties such as coordination ability, electronic effects, steric hindrance, and the spatial arrangement of functional groups.

- **Coverage and Balance**:
  - The rules cover a broad range of modifiers in the dataset, with a balance between simple rules with higher coverage (e.g., **Rule 2** on para-substituted amino or nitro groups) and more specific rules with lower coverage (e.g., **Rule 9** on fluorinated acids).
  - By prioritizing rules that encompass multiple structural features, the set provides comprehensive insights into how different modifiers affect the reaction yield.

- **Physicochemical Considerations**:
  - **Coordination Ability**: Functional groups capable of donating lone pair electrons (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, thiol, nitrogen in heterocycles) enhance coordination with the Fe ion, improving catalyst activity.
  - **Electronic Effects**: Electron-donating groups increase electron density on coordinating atoms, while electron-withdrawing groups decrease it, affecting coordination strength.
  - **Steric Hindrance**: Bulky substituents or inappropriate positioning of functional groups can obstruct effective interaction with the metal center.
  - **Chain Length and Flexibility**: Optimal distances between functional groups enable effective chelation and coordination with the metal ion.

By applying these rules, chemists can predict whether a given molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield, aiding in the rational design and optimization of the catalyst system for improved reaction outcomes.
