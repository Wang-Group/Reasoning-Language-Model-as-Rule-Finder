**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic dicarboxylic amino acids** predict a **high yield**. The presence of two carboxyl groups and an amino group on adjacent carbons allows for effective chelation with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid), **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid).
   - *Low Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine), which has only one carboxyl group, predicts a **low yield** due to less effective metal coordination.

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **short-chain aliphatic amino acids with terminal amino groups within five carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**. The close proximity facilitates chelation to metal centers.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**. The increased chain length reduces chelation efficiency due to flexibility and decreased alignment of functional groups.

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids** predict a **high yield**. Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous coordination sites for metal binding, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid).
   - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, where the hydroxyl group is distant from the carboxyl group, predicts a **low yield** due to less effective coordination.

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted amino or nitro groups** predict a **high yield**. These substituents can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**, where the methyl group does not facilitate coordination, predicts a **low yield**.

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms capable of coordination** predict a **high yield**. Nitrogen atoms in the ring provide additional sites for metal binding.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid).
   - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**, where the pyridine ring is further from the carboxyl group, predicts a **low yield** due to reduced metal interaction.

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers with **fluorinated alkyl chains** predict a **low yield**. The strong electronegativity of fluorine withdraws electron density from coordinating groups, diminishing their ability to bind metals effectively.

   - *Low Yield Examples*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**, **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**.
   - *High Yield Examples*: Non-fluorinated analogs like **pentanoic acid** may predict a **high yield** if they meet other criteria.

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups and chain lengths up to eight carbons** predict a **high yield**. The carboxyl group can effectively coordinate with metal centers, and moderate hydrophobicity enhances interactions.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **octanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Very long-chain acids or those with interfering substituents may predict a **low yield** due to decreased solubility and reduced metal interaction.

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **polyether chains attached to carboxylic acids** predict a **low yield**. The steric bulk and electron-donating nature of ethers can hinder effective metal coordination.

   - *Low Yield Examples*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.
   - *High Yield Examples*: Acids without bulky ether chains, allowing better access to the metal center, may predict a **high yield**.

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde or formyl groups** predict a **low yield**. These groups can engage in intramolecular interactions or resonance structures that reduce the availability of coordinating atoms.

   - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
   - *High Yield Examples*: Aromatic acids without such electron-withdrawing groups, or with substituents that facilitate coordination, predict a **high yield**.

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **thiol groups within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**. Thiol groups are strong ligands that form stable complexes with metal centers.

    - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**, where the thiol is less accessible due to aromatic resonance, predicts a **low yield**.

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted bromomethyl groups** predict a **high yield**. The bromomethyl group can participate in metal coordination or activate the aromatic ring for binding.

    - *High Yield Example*: **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Examples*: Aromatic acids without coordinating substituents or with deactivating groups predict a **low yield**.

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **long aliphatic chains containing hydroxyl or amino groups distant from the carboxyl group (beyond the fifth carbon)** predict a **low yield**. Increased chain length diminishes chelation efficiency due to flexibility.

    - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**.
    - *High Yield Examples*: Shorter-chain analogs with functional groups closer to the carboxyl group predict a **high yield**.

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **bulky substituents near coordinating sites or side chains lacking coordinating functionality** predict a **low yield**. Steric hindrance impedes metal access, reducing catalyst effectiveness.

    - *Low Yield Examples*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (N-acetyl-lysine), where acetamido groups hinder coordination.
    - *High Yield Examples*: Amino acids with side chains that facilitate metal binding, like **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan), predict a **high yield**.

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy-substituted aromatic rings** predict a **high yield**. Methoxy groups can donate electron density, enhancing metal coordination.

    - *High Yield Example*: **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Examples*: Aromatic acids lacking electron-donating groups or with steric hindrance predict a **low yield**.

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers with **coordinating groups properly positioned for chelation**, such as adjacent amino and carboxyl groups or multiple hydroxyl groups, predict a **high yield**. Effective spatial arrangement enhances metal binding.

    - *High Yield Examples*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan), **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Examples*: Compounds where coordinating groups are too distant or obstructed predict a **low yield**.
