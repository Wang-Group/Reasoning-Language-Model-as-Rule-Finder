- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear and supported by data (entries 19 and 22), providing insight into the negative impact of para-substituted formyl or methyl groups on yield. However, it partially overlaps with Rule 11 regarding formyl groups, which may reduce overall clarity. Consolidating overlapping rules could improve clarity and effectiveness.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear and supported by multiple data points (entries 5, 29, 31, and 34), effectively distinguishing between modifiers with and without terminal functional groups. It offers good property insight and balances complexity with coverage, satisfying all the criteria.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear and supported by data (entries 16 and 21), highlighting the positive effect of heteroaromatic rings directly attached to carboxylic acid groups on yield. It meets the criteria for clarity, property insight, complexity, and coverage.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear and well-supported (entries 13 and 15), providing insight into how the size and electron richness of aromatic side chains in amino acids affect yield. It effectively balances complexity with sufficient coverage, satisfying all criteria.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear, with good property insight into the positional effects of thiol groups on yield. It is supported by data (entries 10 and 17), satisfying the criteria for clarity, property insight, complexity, and coverage.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 lacks sufficient coverage, being supported by only one data point (entry 9). While it provides property insight into the positive effect of aliphatic polyhydroxy acids on yield, the low coverage affects its robustness and effectiveness.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is supported by only one data point (entry 14), limiting its coverage. Although it offers property insight into the negative impact of electron-withdrawing perfluoroalkyl chains on yield, more data points are needed to strengthen the rule and meet the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is complex but clear, considering combinations of substituents and their electronic properties on aromatic carboxylic acids. Supported by data (entries 25, 26, and 28), it provides good property insight and has adequate coverage, satisfying the criteria.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 partially overlaps with Rule 3, both addressing modifiers with formyl groups leading to low yield. This redundancy may reduce clarity. It is supported by data (entries 18 and 19), but consolidating overlapping rules would improve clarity and adherence to the criteria.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is somewhat vague regarding "extensive ether linkages," but examples help clarify its scope. It is supported by data (entries 11 and 32), providing property insight into how flexible ether-containing chains negatively affect yield. Clarity could be improved by specifying the extent of ether linkages.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**
- **Comment 1**: **Rule 1** is clear and allows us to determine whether a modifier will result in high yield based on the presence of an amino group and two carboxylic acid groups on an aliphatic chain. It combines multiple functional groups, offering good complexity. The rule is supported by at least two data points ((2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid and (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid), satisfying the coverage criterion. The rule also reflects the chemical reasoning of how such groups might interact with the catalyst, providing adequate property insight.

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 2** is clear in specifying that modifiers are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (amino or methoxy) at the para position, resulting in high yield. It effectively combines sub-structures (aromatic ring, carboxylic acid, para electron-donating substituents), meeting the complexity criterion. The rule is supported by multiple data points (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), satisfying coverage. It also provides chemical insight into the effect of electron-donating groups on reactivity.

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 3** clearly states that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (formyl or methyl) at the para position result in low yield, which is easy to apply. It considers combinations of structural features, satisfying complexity. The rule is supported by data points (4-formylbenzoic acid, 4-methylbenzoic acid), satisfying coverage. The rule provides chemical insight into how electron-withdrawing groups affect the yield.

- **Comment 4**: **Rule 4** is clear and allows us to distinguish modifiers based on the presence or absence of terminal functional groups on straight-chain aliphatic monocarboxylic acids. It effectively considers combinations of sub-structures, addressing complexity. The rule is well-supported with multiple data points for both high yield (octanoic acid) and low yield (7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid), satisfying coverage. There's adequate chemical insight into how terminal functional groups affect yield.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** attempts to define when modifiers containing heteroaromatic rings result in high yield based on the position of nitrogen and direct attachment of the carboxylic acid. While the rule is detailed, its clarity is diminished due to complexity and inconsistencies with data points. For instance, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid results in high yield despite not meeting the rule's criteria, suggesting a need for refinement. The rule lacks sufficient coverage and clarity.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** provides a clear distinction between amino acids with electron-rich heterocyclic aromatic side chains and those with simpler aromatic side chains regarding yield. It offers chemical insight and adequate complexity. However, the rule is supported by only one high-yield data point (Tryptophan) and one low-yield data point (Phenylalanine), which may not satisfy the coverage criterion fully. Additional data points would strengthen the rule's validity.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** clearly distinguishes between modifiers with thiol groups on aliphatic chains resulting in high yield and those on aromatic rings resulting in low yield. It provides chemical insight and has acceptable complexity. However, the rule is based on only one high-yield data point (3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) and one low-yield data point (4-sulfanylbenzoic acid), which may not fully satisfy the coverage criterion. Additional data points would enhance the rule's reliability.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** effectively differentiates between aliphatic polyhydroxy acids and monohydroxy acids in terms of yield. It offers reasonable chemical insight and acceptable complexity by considering the number of hydroxyl groups. However, with only one data point for high yield (Gluconic acid) and one for low yield (7-hydroxyheptanoic acid), the rule falls short on the coverage criterion. More data points are needed to strengthen this rule.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** is clear but may be overly specific, focusing on perfluoroalkyl chains attached to carboxylic acids resulting in low yield. While it provides property insight regarding electron-withdrawing effects, the rule lacks complexity and is supported by only one data point, failing to meet the coverage criterion. Additional examples are needed to validate this rule.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** is clear but perhaps too narrow, focusing on amino acids with long aliphatic side chains modified with acetamido groups resulting in low yield. The rule shows complexity but lacks coverage, being supported by only one data point. It needs more data to confirm its validity.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** is clear and precisely defines modifiers resulting in low yield based on the presence of aldehyde groups adjacent to carboxylic acids on aromatic rings. It meets the complexity and coverage criteria, being supported by at least two data points. The rule also provides reasonable chemical insight into how such groups might lower yield.

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** adequately describes modifiers that result in low yield due to the presence of extensive ether linkages leading to a carboxylic acid. It offers acceptable complexity and is supported by at least two data points, satisfying the coverage criterion. It provides some property insight into how flexible ether chains may negatively affect yield.

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13** identifies modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating methoxy groups, resulting in high yield. While the rule is clear and provides property insight into the role of electron-donating groups, it lacks coverage, being supported by only one data point. It may overlap with **Rule 2**, which also considers electron-donating groups, suggesting redundancy.

- **Comment 14**: **Rule 14** lacks clarity and may be counterintuitive, as nitro groups are electron-withdrawing yet are stated to result in high yield. The rule is only supported by one data point for each case, not fulfilling the coverage criterion. The property insight is limited, and the rule may need further investigation and clarification.

- **Comment 15**: **Rule 15** is clear but perhaps overly specific, focusing on modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with internal ketone groups resulting in low yield. It lacks coverage, being supported by only one data point. Additional data points are needed to confirm this rule's validity.

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are unbranched aliphatic monocarboxylic acids with chain lengths up to eight carbons result in high yield, provided they do not have terminal amino or hydroxy groups on chains longer than six carbons.**
  - *Rationale*: Unbranched aliphatic acids can efficiently interact with the catalyst's active sites without steric hindrance. Terminal amino or hydroxy groups on longer chains may interfere with the catalyst or the reaction mechanism.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **Octanoic acid**
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids or amino acids with polar side chains result in high yield, whereas those with hydrophobic or bulky aromatic side chains result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Polar side chains can enhance interactions with the catalyst, promoting high yield. Hydrophobic or bulky side chains may cause steric hindrance or reduce catalyst compatibility.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating para-substituents (e.g., amino or hydroxy groups) result in high yield, while those with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., aldehyde, trifluoromethyl, or methyl groups) at the para position result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups can enhance the π-electron density of the aromatic ring, improving interactions with the catalyst. Electron-withdrawing groups can decrease reactivity or interfere with the catalyst.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers where the carboxylic acid group is directly attached to a nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring result in high yield; those where the heteroaromatic ring is connected through an additional aromatic ring result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Direct attachment allows for effective coordination with metal centers in the catalyst. Additional aromatic rings can introduce steric hindrance and reduce effective interaction.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups on short chains result in high yield, whereas those with thiol groups attached directly to an aromatic ring result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**
  - *Rationale*: Thiol groups on short aliphatic chains can act as ligands enhancing catalyst activity. Thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings can strongly bind to metal centers, deactivating the catalyst.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (3-mercaptopropionic acid)
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain result in high yield, while those with a single hydroxyl group on longer chains result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups can increase solubility and interaction with the catalyst. A single hydroxyl group on a long chain may not offer these benefits and can introduce unfavorable steric effects.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with perfluoroalkyl groups attached to the carboxylic acid result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Perfluoroalkyl groups are highly electron-withdrawing and hydrophobic, which can hinder interactions with the catalyst and reduce solubility in the reaction medium.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing polyether chains ending with a carboxylic acid group result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Polyether chains can increase flexibility and steric bulk, reducing the ability of the modifier to interact effectively with the catalyst.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy or hydroxy-substituted phenyl groups connected via an aliphatic chain result in high yield, whereas those with these substituents directly attached to the benzene ring result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: The aliphatic chain can provide flexibility and optimal positioning of functional groups for better catalyst interaction. Direct substitution on the aromatic ring may hinder effective binding due to steric factors.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups attached to aromatic or aliphatic chains result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde and ketone groups can react with amino or hydroxyl groups in the system or coordinate with metal centers, disrupting catalyst activity.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with electron-withdrawing trifluoroacetyl groups result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Strong electron-withdrawing groups can decrease the electron density of the modifier, hindering interactions with the catalyst and possibly deactivating it.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic amino acids with bulky acetamido or modified side chains result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Bulky side chains can create steric hindrance, reducing the modifier's ability to interact effectively with the catalyst.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing terminal amino groups on long aliphatic chains (seven carbons or more) result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Terminal amino groups on long chains may interfere with the catalyst, possibly through coordination that leads to catalyst deactivation.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with electron-rich heteroaromatic side chains result in high yield, whereas those with simple hydrophobic aromatic side chains result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Electron-rich heteroaromatic rings can enhance interactions with the catalyst, while simple hydrophobic rings may not provide the necessary interaction for high yield.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing groups that strongly coordinate to metals (e.g., thiol groups attached directly to an aromatic ring) may result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**
  - *Rationale*: Strongly coordinating groups can bind irreversibly to metal centers in the catalyst, reducing its availability and activity.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

The rationale discusses increased flexibility and steric bulk affecting catalyst interaction. The rule considers complex substructures and is supported by multiple data points, ensuring good coverage.

- **Comment 9**: *Rule 9* distinguishes between modifiers with methoxy or hydroxy-substituted phenyl groups connected via an aliphatic chain (high yield) and those directly attached to the benzene ring (low yield). The rationale provides insight into the benefits of chain flexibility for catalyst interaction. The rule is complex and supported by several data points, demonstrating good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 10**: *Rule 10* clearly states that modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups attached to aromatic or aliphatic chains result in low yield. The rationale addresses potential interference with the catalyst. The rule is simple yet considers critical functional groups, and multiple data points support it, ensuring good coverage.

- **Comment 11**: *Rule 11* specifies that modifiers with electron-withdrawing trifluoroacetyl groups result in low yield. The rationale is sound, but the rule is supported by only one data point, limiting coverage. While clarity and property insight are satisfactory, additional supporting data would strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 12**: *Rule 12* indicates that long-chain aliphatic amino acids with bulky acetamido or modified side chains result in low yield. The rationale highlights steric hindrance. The rule's complexity is appropriate, but it is supported by only one data point, limiting coverage. Broader data support would enhance its reliability.

- **Comment 13**: *Rule 13* is clear in stating that terminal amino groups on long aliphatic chains (seven carbons or more) result in low yield. The rationale addresses catalyst interference through coordination. The rule considers substructure combinations and is supported by multiple data points, ensuring good coverage.

- **Comment 14**: *Rule 14* effectively differentiates modifiers based on their side chains—electron-rich heteroaromatic side chains lead to high yield, while simple hydrophobic aromatic side chains result in low yield. The rationale provides adequate insight into catalyst interactions. The rule considers substructural complexity and is well-supported by data points, demonstrating good coverage.

- **Comment 15**: *Rule 15* identifies that modifiers containing groups which strongly coordinate to metals (e.g., thiol groups on aromatic rings) may cause catalyst poisoning, leading to low yield. The rationale is sound, but the rule is supported by only one data point, limiting coverage. Additional examples would increase its robustness.

    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with polar substituents (e.g., amino, nitro groups) at the para position result in high yield, whereas those with non-polar substituents (e.g., methyl groups) or electron-withdrawing aldehyde groups at the para position result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Polar substituents can enhance the electronic interaction with the catalyst, improving reactivity. Non-polar or electron-withdrawing groups may decrease reactivity or hinder catalyst interaction.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers where the carboxylic acid group is directly attached to a nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring result in high yield; those where the heteroaromatic ring is connected through an additional aromatic ring result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Direct attachment allows effective coordination with metal centers in the catalyst. Additional aromatic rings can introduce steric hindrance and reduce effective interaction.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups on short chains (three carbons) result in high yield, whereas those with thiol groups attached directly to an aromatic ring result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**
  - *Rationale*: Thiol groups on short aliphatic chains can act as ligands enhancing catalyst activity. Thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings can strongly bind to metal centers, deactivating the catalyst.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain result in high yield, while those with a single hydroxyl group on longer chains result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and interaction with the catalyst. A single hydroxyl group on a long chain may not offer these benefits and can introduce unfavorable steric effects.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing polyether chains ending with a carboxylic acid group result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Polyether chains can increase flexibility and steric bulk, reducing the ability of the modifier to interact effectively with the catalyst.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with perfluoroalkyl groups attached to the carboxylic acid result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Perfluoroalkyl groups are highly electron-withdrawing and hydrophobic, which can hinder interactions with the catalyst and reduce solubility in the reaction medium.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups attached to aromatic rings result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde and ketone groups can react with active sites or coordinate with metal centers in the catalyst, disrupting its activity.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with electron-rich heteroaromatic side chains result in high yield, whereas those with simple hydrophobic aromatic side chains result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Electron-rich heteroaromatic rings can enhance interactions with the catalyst, while simple hydrophobic rings may not provide the necessary interaction for high yield.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing functional groups that strongly coordinate to metals (e.g., trifluoroacetyl groups) result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation.**
  - *Rationale*: Strongly coordinating groups can bind to metal centers in the catalyst, reducing its availability and activity.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy or hydroxy-substituted phenyl groups connected via a short aliphatic chain result in high yield, while those with these substituents directly attached to the benzene ring result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: The aliphatic chain can provide flexibility and optimal positioning of functional groups for better catalyst interaction. Direct substitution on the aromatic ring may hinder effective binding due to steric factors.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are linear aliphatic monocarboxylic acids with chain lengths up to eight carbons result in high yield. Terminal amino groups on chains with five carbons or fewer result in high yield; however, if the chain is six carbons or longer, terminal amino or hydroxy groups lead to low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Short-chain aliphatic acids can effectively coordinate with the catalyst's active sites without significant steric hindrance. Terminal amino groups on shorter chains enhance solubility and interaction with the catalyst. In longer chains, terminal amino or hydroxy groups introduce steric bulk and can interfere with catalyst binding or the reaction mechanism, leading to lower yields.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **Octanoic acid**
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) result in high yield. Modifiers that are α-amino acids with hydrophobic or bulky aromatic side chains (e.g., phenylalanine) result in low yield, whereas those with heteroaromatic side chains (e.g., tryptophan) result in high yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Polar side chains in α-amino dicarboxylic acids enhance hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst, promoting high yield. Hydrophobic or bulky aromatic side chains can cause steric hindrance and reduce effective interaction with the catalyst. Heteroaromatic side chains can provide favorable electronic interactions and facilitate coordination.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents (e.g., amino, hydroxy) at the para position result in high yield, while those with electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., formyl, trifluoroacetyl) at the para position result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups increase electron density on the aromatic ring, enhancing interactions with the catalyst and facilitating the reaction. Electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density, potentially interfering with catalyst binding and reducing reactivity.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers where the carboxylic acid group is directly attached to a nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring result in high yield; those where the heteroaromatic ring is connected through an additional aromatic ring result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Direct attachment allows effective coordination between the nitrogen in the heteroaromatic ring and the catalyst. Additional aromatic rings introduce steric hindrance and reduce the efficiency of catalyst interaction.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups on short chains (three carbons) result in high yield, whereas those with thiol groups attached directly to an aromatic ring result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**
  - *Rationale*: Short-chain thiol groups can act as flexible ligands, enhancing catalyst activity by forming favorable interactions. Thiol groups on aromatic rings can strongly bind to metal centers, deactivating the catalyst through irreversible coordination.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups along an aliphatic chain result in high yield, while those with a single hydroxyl group on longer chains result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and the ability to form hydrogen bonds with the catalyst, enhancing reactivity. Single hydroxyl groups on long chains may not sufficiently interact with the catalyst and can introduce steric hindrance.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing flexible polyether chains ending with a carboxylic acid group result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Polyether chains introduce flexibility and steric bulk, which can hinder effective interaction with the catalyst's active sites and reduce overall reactivity.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with perfluoroalkyl groups attached to the carboxylic acid result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Perfluoroalkyl groups are highly hydrophobic and strongly electron-withdrawing, which can decrease solubility in the reaction medium and reduce the modifier's ability to interact with the catalyst.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups attached to aromatic rings result in low yield due to potential side reactions or catalyst deactivation.**
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde and ketone groups can coordinate with metal centers in the catalyst or undergo side reactions, disrupting catalyst activity and decreasing yield.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy-substituted phenyl groups connected via a short aliphatic chain result in high yield, while those with these substituents directly attached to the aromatic ring result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: The aliphatic chain provides flexibility, allowing optimal positioning of functional groups for effective catalyst interaction. Direct substitution on the aromatic ring may hinder binding due to steric effects.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal amino groups on chains of six carbons or more result in low yield due to increased steric hindrance and decreased catalyst interaction.**
  - *Rationale*: Long-chain amino acids may not effectively interact with the catalyst and can introduce steric bulk that hinders the approach of reactants to the active sites.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are dicarboxylic acids with ketone groups result in low yield, possibly due to chelation with the catalyst and reduction of its activity.**
  - *Rationale*: Ketone groups in dicarboxylic acids can coordinate with metal centers more strongly, potentially deactivating the catalyst by forming stable chelate complexes.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with acylated amino groups result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Acylation of the amino group reduces the ability of the modifier to coordinate with the catalyst through the amino group, decreasing effective interaction and yield.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with bulky, hydrophobic side chains attached to the carboxylic acid result in low yield due to steric hindrance and decreased solubility.**
  - *Rationale*: Bulky hydrophobic groups can inhibit effective access to the catalyst's active sites and reduce solubility in the reaction solvent, both of which negatively impact yield.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with halogen substituents on aromatic rings, such as bromomethyl groups, result in high yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Halogen substituents can enhance interactions with the catalyst through halogen bonding or induction effects, potentially increasing reactivity.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: **Rule 1** meets all the criteria. It is clear and allows us to determine yield based on the structural description of short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without bulky side groups. The property insight is sound, explaining steric factors affecting catalyst interaction. The rule balances complexity and coverage well, supported by multiple data points (e.g., octanoic acid and 5-aminopentanoic acid show high yield, while 7-aminoheptanoic acid and 8-aminooctanoic acid show low yield).

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 2** lacks clarity and contains inconsistencies. The rule states that electron-donating groups at the para position on aromatic carboxylic acids lead to high yield, while electron-withdrawing groups result in low yield. However, the high yield example includes **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, which has a nitro group, an electron-withdrawing group. This contradicts the rule's rationale. Additionally, **4-methylbenzoic acid**, which has an electron-donating methyl group, results in low yield (as per the dataset). This inconsistency indicates the rule needs revision to accurately reflect the observed outcomes.

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 3** is clear and well-supported by data, allowing us to predict yield based on the presence of polar side chains in α-amino acids. The property insight about the effect of side chain polarity on catalyst interaction is appropriate.

1. **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer and containing an amino group result in high yield; those with longer chains may result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Short aliphatic chains with amino groups can effectively interact with the catalyst without significant steric hindrance, enhancing coordination and reactivity.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

2. **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids where the carboxyl group is directly attached to an aromatic ring, and the ring has substituents capable of coordination (e.g., amino, hydroxy, nitro) at the ortho or para position result in high yield.**

   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid**

   - *Rationale*: Additional carboxyl groups enhance coordination with the catalyst's metal centers, increasing reactivity. Nonpolar aromatic side chains may not effectively interact with the catalyst.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing heteroatoms capable of metal coordination (e.g., amino, carboxyl, hydroxyl, indole rings) result in high yield; those with hydrophobic or non-coordinating side chains result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Side chains with heteroatoms can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalyst activity. Hydrophobic side chains lack these interactions, reducing effectiveness.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid, Entry 2)
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid, Entry 0)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan, Entry 15)
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine, Entry 13)
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 33)

2. **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromo) or coordinating groups (e.g., amino) result in high yield; those with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl) or non-coordinating groups result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing and coordinating groups enhance the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxylate, improving interaction with the catalyst. Electron-donating groups reduce these effects.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Entry 20)
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Entry 1)
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Entry 4)
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 22)
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19)

3. **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with coordinating functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, thiol) within four carbon atoms of the carboxyl group result in high yield; those where the functional group is further away result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Close proximity of coordinating groups to the carboxyl enhances effective chelation with the metal center. Distant groups reduce coordination efficiency.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (Entry 3)
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 17)
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Entry 31)
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Entry 34)

4. **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of coordination (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole rings) result in high yield; those substituted with bulky groups or additional aromatic rings result in low yield due to steric hindrance.**
   - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatics can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalyst activity. Bulky substituents hinder this interaction.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid, Entry 21)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 16)
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 8)
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 12)

5. **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with thiol groups in short aliphatic chains (up to four carbons) result in high yield; those with thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**
   - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols coordinate effectively without strongly deactivating the catalyst. Aromatic thiols may bind too tightly, inhibiting catalysis.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 17)
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Entry 10)

6. **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group result in high yield; those with hydroxyl groups further from the carboxyl or with protective groups result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Adjacent hydroxyl groups increase coordination sites and solubility, enhancing catalyst interaction. Distant hydroxyls or protected hydroxyls are less effective.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid, Entry 9)
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Entry 29)
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 33)

7. **Rule 7**: **Modifiers featuring ether linkages in aliphatic chains result in low yield due to increased flexibility and reduced ability to coordinate effectively with the catalyst.**
   - *Rationale*: Ether linkages introduce flexibility, preventing proper alignment and reducing coordination efficiency.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 11)
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32)

8. **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing bulky aromatic systems or multiple fused rings (e.g., biphenyls, indole) result in high yield if the functional groups allow coordination and steric hindrance is minimal; excessive bulk without coordinating benefits results in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Bulky systems can participate effectively if they enhance coordination. Without coordinating functionality, steric hindrance dominates, reducing yield.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan, Entry 15)
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 12)
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine, Entry 13)

9. **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the aromatic ring or coordination site result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation or side reactions.**
   - *Rationale*: Aldehydes and ketones can bind irreversibly to the metal center or participate in unwanted reactions, inhibiting catalysis.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19)
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 18)
     - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Entry 27)

10. **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl chains or strongly electron-withdrawing groups that significantly reduce electron density at coordinating sites result in low yield.**
    - *Rationale*: Strong electron-withdrawing groups diminish the ability of coordinating atoms to donate electron density to the metal center, weakening coordination.
    - *Low Yield Examples*:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Entry 14)
      - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** (Entry 28)

11. **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups result in high yield up to a chain length of eight carbons; longer chains or those lacking coordinating groups result in low yield due to decreased solubility and coordination.**
    - *Rationale*: Medium-chain aliphatic acids maintain solubility and can interact with the catalyst. Longer chains become too hydrophobic, reducing effectiveness.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - **Octanoic acid** (Entry 5)
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - **No longer-chain acids present in the dataset for direct comparison**

12. **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic rings connected via short aliphatic chains (three carbons or fewer) result in low yield due to suboptimal positioning for coordination; increasing the chain length to four or five carbons results in high yield by optimizing spatial arrangement.**
    - *Rationale*: Optimal chain length allows coordinating groups to interact effectively with the catalyst without steric hindrance.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Entry 7)
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30)

- **Comment 1**:

  *Rule 1 demonstrates excellent clarity, allowing for clear predictions of yield based on the defined structural features of amino acid modifiers. The physico-chemical insight is substantial, explaining how proximal coordinating groups enhance metal interaction and how hydrophobic or extended side chains hinder binding. The rule effectively combines substructures such as amino acids, coordinating groups, and side-chain length, satisfying the complexity criterion. Coverage is strong, supported by multiple high and low yield examples, and the balance between complexity and applicability is appropriately managed.*

- **Comment 2**:

  *Rule 2 is clear and provides straightforward predictions by focusing on aromatic carboxylic acids with specific para-substituents. The physico-chemical rationale is sound, linking the electronic effects of substituents to coordination efficiency. The rule considers combinations of aromatic structures and substituents, meeting the complexity requirement. Coverage is adequate, with several examples supporting both high and low yield outcomes, and the balance between specificity and broad applicability is well-maintained.*

- **Comment 3**:

  *Rule 3 offers clear guidance on the influence of hydroxyl or thiol group positioning in aliphatic carboxylic acids on yield. The physico-chemical insight is adequate, emphasizing the importance of proximity for effective metal binding. The rule addresses complexity by considering both the type and position of functional groups. Coverage is acceptable, with multiple high yield examples and at least one low yield example, ensuring the rule is supported by data. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.*

- **Comment 4**:

  *Rule 4 provides clarity in predicting high yield modifiers containing coordinating nitrogen heterocycles and highlights the detrimental effect of steric hindrance from additional aromatic rings. The physico-chemical reasoning is solid, focusing on coordination ability and steric factors. The rule involves combinations of substructures, satisfying the complexity criterion. Coverage is strong, with multiple supporting examples for both high and low yield, and the rule maintains a good balance between complexity and practical application.*

- **Comment 5**:

  *Rule 5 is clear and states that aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages result in low yield. While the physico-chemical insight could be deeper, it reasonably addresses how increased chain flexibility may reduce effective coordination. The rule has acceptable complexity by focusing on specific chain features. Coverage is sufficient with two low yield examples, and the simplicity of the rule is balanced by its applicability.*

- **Comment 6**:

  *Rule 6 clearly identifies modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to key functional groups as leading to low yield, providing a plausible rationale related to catalyst deactivation. The rule meets the complexity criterion by considering the combination of carbonyl groups with other structural features. Coverage is robust, supported by multiple examples, and the balance between specificity and general applicability is well-managed.*

- **Comment 7**:

  *Rule 7, albeit complex, offers clarity by specifying that modifiers with aliphatic linkers connecting aromatic carboxylic acids to additional aromatic rings with coordinating substituents result in high yield. The physico-chemical insight is adequate, suggesting that linkers enhance flexibility and coordination. The rule addresses complexity through the combination of aromatic structures, linkers, and substituents. Coverage is acceptable, with examples supporting both high and low yield cases, achieving a reasonable balance.*

- **Comment 8**:

  *Rule 8 is clear in stating that perfluorinated carboxylic acids result in low yield, supported by a valid physico-chemical rationale related to electron-withdrawing effects and hydrophobicity. However, the coverage is limited, with only one supporting data point (Entry 14). This insufficient coverage weakens the rule's reliability, suggesting that more data is needed to strengthen this rule's applicability.*

- **Comment 9**:

  *Rule 9 provides a clear and straightforward prediction that simple aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of eight carbons or less result in high yield. While the physico-chemical reasoning is plausible, focusing on solubility and steric hindrance, the rule's coverage is minimal, backed by only one example (Entry 5). This limited data support reduces the rule's generalizability and effectiveness despite its clarity.*

- **Comment 10**:

  *Rule 10 effectively distinguishes between modifiers containing sulfur in coordinating functional groups (thiol) versus non-coordinating groups (thioether), providing clear predictions of yield outcomes. The physico-chemical insight is solid, explaining how thiol groups enhance coordination while thioethers may interfere with catalysis. The rule meets the complexity criterion by considering the type of sulfur-containing groups and their coordination ability. Coverage is adequate, with examples for both high and low yield, resulting in a balanced and reliable rule.*
