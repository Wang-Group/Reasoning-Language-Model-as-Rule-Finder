Thought，持续 1m 4s

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers with both amino and carboxylic acid groups (e.g., α-amino acids like (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid or (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid) generally result in **high yield**. This combination is commonly found in high-yield entries, likely due to the presence of electron-donating amino groups that enhance reactivity.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that contain halogen atoms attached to an aromatic ring, specifically bromine or chlorine in the para or meta position (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid), lead to a **high yield**. Halogen atoms can stabilize intermediates through inductive effects, aiding in a successful reaction outcome.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that contain both hydroxyl and phenyl groups in their structure (e.g., 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid) typically correlate with a **low yield**. The hydroxyl group in close proximity to the aromatic ring may increase electron density, possibly disrupting the reaction mechanism.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with bulky substituents, especially with multiple hydroxyl groups and branching (e.g., 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid), tend to result in **high yield**. These substituents likely aid in stabilizing the Fe ion in the catalytic environment, enhancing the functionalization process.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that include sulfur-containing groups, such as sulfanyl or thioether groups (e.g., 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid), generally produce a **low yield**. Sulfur groups may interfere with the metal catalyst or reduce reactivity by donating electrons in an undesirable way.

- **Rule 6**: Linear aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium chain lengths (C5-C8), such as octanoic acid, are associated with **high yield**. The length of the chain may provide an optimal balance of hydrophobicity and chain flexibility, allowing better interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with fluorinated groups, especially when they are close to the carboxylic acid group (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), generally result in **low yield**. Fluorine’s strong electron-withdrawing properties might destabilize key intermediates or hinder productive interaction with the Fe catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with heterocyclic rings containing nitrogen atoms (e.g., 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid) typically show **high yield**. The nitrogen-containing ring may coordinate with the Fe ion, potentially stabilizing it during the reaction process.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with formyl or aldehyde groups attached to an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) usually correlate with a **low yield**. Aldehyde groups may introduce instability or react with radical species, hindering the main reaction pathway.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that include both pyridine rings and carboxylic acid functionalities (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid and pyridine-3-carboxylic acid) often produce a **high yield**. The pyridine ring can act as a coordinating site for Fe ions, enhancing catalytic performance.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with methoxy groups attached to an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid and 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid) tend to result in **low yield**. The electron-donating effects of methoxy groups may disrupt catalyst interaction, reducing overall effectiveness.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers containing multiple carboxylic acid groups (e.g., 4-oxoheptanedioic acid) tend to produce a **low yield**. Multiple acidic groups might destabilize the Fe ion or lead to competing side reactions.

- **Rule 13**: Amino acids with bulky side chains containing nitrogen or sulfur (e.g., (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid and (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid) generally lead to **high yield**. Bulky, nitrogen-rich side chains may enhance Fe ion stability in the MOL framework.

**End of Rules**

These rules, based on structural features and their electronic effects, provide a predictive framework for understanding how molecular modifiers impact the yield of this functionalization reaction.

Thought，持续 44 秒

**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and well-supported by multiple data points (e.g., entries 0, 2, 3, and 15), showing that modifiers with both amino and carboxylic acid groups generally result in high yield. The rule effectively highlights the electron-donating properties of amino groups, which enhance the reaction's reactivity. This rule is **well-balanced** in terms of complexity and coverage, and the chemical insight aligns with the observed trends. **Score: 9/10**

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 indicates that halogen substituents on aromatic rings (specifically bromine or chlorine) generally lead to high yield. Although the rule is chemically plausible due to the stabilizing inductive effects of halogens, it only covers one data point explicitly (entry 1). The limited support raises questions about its general applicability, and additional data points could strengthen this rule. **Score: 6/10**

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 specifies that modifiers with both hydroxyl and phenyl groups yield lower results, likely due to electron density effects that disrupt the reaction mechanism. This rule is insightful and provides good clarity but faces minor inconsistencies, as some modifiers with these groups do not follow this trend. Despite these discrepancies, the rule remains useful. **Score: 7/10**

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 suggests that bulky modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups and branching tend to result in high yield. This rule is both complex and well-supported by entries (e.g., 6), with a plausible explanation for Fe ion stabilization, which aids in functionalization. The rule’s coverage is robust and strikes a good balance between complexity and utility. **Score: 9/10**

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 mentions that sulfur-containing groups like sulfanyl or thioether groups generally result in low yield, possibly due to undesirable electron-donating effects. This rule is well-supported by entries with low yields (e.g., entry 10) and offers strong chemical insight into sulfur’s potential interference in the catalytic process. **Score: 8/10**

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 proposes that medium-chain linear aliphatic carboxylic acids (C5-C8) yield high results due to optimal hydrophobicity and flexibility. While chemically reasonable, the rule is limited by a narrow dataset and would benefit from more supporting examples to reinforce its conclusions. **Score: 7/10**

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 explains that fluorinated groups, especially near carboxylic acid groups, correlate with low yield due to fluorine's electron-withdrawing effects. This rule is insightful, although its coverage is narrow with limited supporting examples (e.g., entry 14). Broader support across the dataset could improve its reliability. **Score: 6/10**

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8, which associates nitrogen-containing heterocyclic rings with high yield, is backed by solid chemical reasoning and several data points (e.g., entries 8 and 16). The rule successfully conveys the stability nitrogen atoms can provide to Fe ions, and it’s a good example of clear, balanced guidance. **Score: 8/10**

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 points out that aldehyde groups attached to aromatic rings generally lead to low yield, potentially due to reactivity with radicals. This rule aligns well with observed patterns in entries (e.g., 18, 19) and provides strong chemical justification. Its simplicity and clarity are strengths, though its data support is modest. **Score: 7/10**

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 describes that modifiers with both pyridine rings and carboxylic acid functionalities yield high results. This rule’s chemical rationale is solid, and it’s supported by data points like entries 8 and 21. Although one outlier exists, the rule maintains strong coverage and practical application. **Score: 8/10**

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 indicates that methoxy groups on aromatic rings generally lead to low yield, likely due to disruptive electron-donating effects. This rule is reasonable but has limited data support, as certain entries do not fully align (e.g., entry 22). **Score: 6/10**

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 suggests that modifiers with multiple carboxylic acid groups result in low yield, possibly destabilizing the Fe ion or causing competing reactions. This rule is logical but lacks extensive support, with only a few supporting entries. **Score: 6/10**

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 states that amino acids with bulky side chains containing nitrogen or sulfur tend to produce high yield, supported by entries (e.g., entry 15). The rule is well-balanced in complexity and provides valuable chemical insight, though additional support would strengthen it. **Score: 7/10**

**End of Comments**

**TRUE**
---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **High Yield** is generally observed with modifiers that are α-amino acids possessing aliphatic or small side chains and at least one additional carboxylic acid group (e.g., **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid**, **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid**, **5-aminopentanoic acid**). The combination of amino and multiple carboxylic acid groups enhances coordination with the metal center, improving catalytic activity.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with strong electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro or halogens (e.g., **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**) lead to a **high yield**. Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity and electron deficiency of the aromatic ring, facilitating stronger interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles with carboxylic acid groups directly attached to the ring (e.g., **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**, **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**) result in a **high yield**. The nitrogen atom in the heterocycle can coordinate with Fe ions, enhancing catalyst efficiency.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with electron-donating groups such as hydroxyl, methoxy, or methyl groups (e.g., **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**, **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**) tend to produce a **low yield**. Electron-donating substituents reduce the acidity of the carboxylic acid, potentially hindering effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with long aliphatic chains containing amino or hydroxyl groups (e.g., **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**, **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**) generally result in a **low yield**. Extended chain lengths may cause steric hindrance or decrease solubility, negatively affecting catalyst accessibility and reactivity.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing sulfur-functional groups such as sulfanyl or thioether groups (e.g., **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**, **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**) lead to a **low yield**. Sulfur atoms may bind strongly to the Fe catalyst, leading to catalyst poisoning or deactivation.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers featuring pyridine rings connected to carboxylic acid groups via flexible aliphatic linkers (e.g., **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**) result in a **high yield**. The linker allows the pyridine nitrogen to effectively coordinate with the Fe ion while maintaining optimal spatial orientation for catalytic activity.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain (e.g., **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**) tend to yield a **high yield**. The presence of several hydroxyl groups enhances solubility and may facilitate multiple points of interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing electron-rich aromatic heterocycles linked to amino acids (e.g., **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid**) result in a **high yield**. Electron-rich heterocycles can stabilize radical intermediates and improve electron transfer processes during the reaction.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoroacetyl groups (e.g., **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**, **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**) tend to result in a **low yield**. The strong electronegativity of fluorine reduces electron density, hindering effective coordination with the catalyst.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde or keto groups adjacent to the carboxyl group (e.g., **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**, **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**) tend to result in a **low yield**. Aldehyde and keto groups may undergo side reactions or interact unfavorably with the catalyst, reducing efficiency.

- **Rule 12**: Linear aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium chain lengths (6–8 carbons) and minimal branching or substitution (e.g., **octanoic acid**) are associated with a **high yield**. These modifiers may enhance hydrophobic interactions within the reaction medium, improving catalyst accessibility and substrate alignment.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers containing bulky aromatic side chains in amino acids (e.g., **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid**) tend to result in a **low yield**. Steric hindrance from large aromatic groups may impede coordination between the modifier and the catalyst's active sites.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with hydroxyl groups positioned ortho or para to the carboxylic acid on aromatic rings (e.g., **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**, **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**) lead to a **low yield**. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding or strong resonance effects can reduce the availability of coordination sites for the catalyst.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers bearing methoxy groups on aromatic rings coupled with additional functional groups such as ketones or extended conjugation (e.g., **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**) can result in a **high yield**. The methoxy groups can donate electron density, and the presence of ketones may facilitate favorable interactions with the catalyst.

**End of Rules**

These rules provide a framework for predicting the reaction yield based on the structural features of molecular modifiers. By considering combinations of functional groups and their influence on physical-chemical properties, such as electron density, coordination ability, steric factors, and solubility, these guidelines help in selecting or designing modifiers to achieve optimal yields in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

- **Rule 1**: **High Yield** is observed with modifiers that are α-amino acids containing two carboxylic acid groups (amino-dicarboxylic acids), such as **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** and **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid**. The presence of an amino group and two carboxylic acid groups enhances coordination with the metal catalyst, improving reactivity.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with electron-withdrawing groups like nitro or bromomethyl (e.g., **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**) result in a **High Yield**. Electron-withdrawing groups increase acidity and facilitate stronger interaction with the catalyst's active sites.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles with carboxylic acid groups directly attached to the ring (e.g., **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**, **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**) produce a **High Yield**. The nitrogen atoms can coordinate with Fe ions, enhancing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with electron-donating groups such as methyl, methoxy, or hydroxyl (e.g., **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**, **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**) result in a **Low Yield**. Electron-donating substituents reduce acidity, weakening interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing long aliphatic chains with terminal amino or hydroxyl groups (e.g., **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**) lead to a **Low Yield**. The terminal functional groups may not effectively coordinate with the catalyst, and long chains can cause steric hindrance or reduce solubility.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers featuring sulfur-containing functional groups, such as thiols or thioethers (e.g., **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**, **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**), result in a **Low Yield**. Sulfur atoms may bind strongly to the Fe catalyst, leading to deactivation or poisoning.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing aldehyde or keto groups adjacent to carboxylic acid groups (e.g., **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**, **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**) produce a **Low Yield**. These carbonyl groups may interfere with the catalyst or participate in side reactions that reduce efficiency.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups (e.g., **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**, **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**) result in a **Low Yield**. The strong electronegativity of fluorine atoms reduces electron density, hindering effective coordination with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are amino acids with hydrophobic aromatic side chains like phenylalanine (e.g., **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid**) result in a **Low Yield** due to steric hindrance and decreased solubility. However, amino acids with heterocyclic aromatic side chains like tryptophan (e.g., **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid**) result in a **High Yield**, potentially due to additional coordination sites and better electron delocalization.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium chain lengths (6–8 carbons) and minimal branching (e.g., **octanoic acid**) produce a **High Yield**. These modifiers may enhance hydrophobic interactions within the reaction medium, improving catalyst accessibility and substrate alignment.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains (polyhydroxylated acids) (e.g., **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**) yield a **High Yield**. Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance solubility and provide additional interaction points with the catalyst.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups located ortho or para to the carboxyl group may result in a **Low Yield** if the hydroxyl group engages in intramolecular hydrogen bonding (e.g., **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**, **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**). This can reduce the availability of coordination sites for the catalyst.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with flexible aliphatic linkers between an aromatic ring and a carboxylic acid group (e.g., **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**, **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**) can result in a **High Yield**. The flexible linker allows optimal spatial orientation for interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers containing ethylene glycol chains or ether linkages (e.g., **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**) result in a **Low Yield**. The ether oxygen atoms may not coordinate effectively with the catalyst and can increase the modifier's solubility, reducing its concentration at the catalytic site.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with cyclic anhydride or lactone structures fused to aromatic rings (e.g., **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**) produce a **High Yield**. The rigid structures and electron-withdrawing effects may facilitate effective binding and activation of the catalyst.

**End of Rules**

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: **Rule 1** excels across all criteria. It is clear—you can easily determine that modifiers fitting the description will result in a high yield. The rule provides solid property insight by explaining how the combination of an amino group and two carboxylic acid groups enhances coordination with the metal catalyst. It considers a combination of functional groups, satisfying the complexity criterion. The rule is supported by at least two data points—entries 0 and 2—and maintains a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 2** is generally strong. It is clear and provides adequate property insight by linking strong electron-withdrawing groups to increased acidity and stronger catalyst interactions. It covers at least two data points—entries 1 and 20. However, there's an exception with entry 19 (4-formylbenzoic acid), which fits the structural description but results in a low yield. This suggests that the rule may need refinement to account for such exceptions.

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 3** is clear and offers reasonable property insight about electron-donating groups decreasing acidity and weakening catalyst interactions. It covers multiple data points with low yields, such as entries 22 and 30. However, it doesn't account for entry 7 (5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid), which, despite having an electron-donating group, results in a high yield. This indicates that the rule may require adjustments to address these contradictions.

- **Comment 4**: **Rule 4** performs well on all criteria. It is clear and provides strong property insight by explaining how nitrogen heterocycles enhance catalytic efficiency through additional binding sites. It considers specific combinations of functional groups, satisfying the complexity requirement. The rule is supported by at least three data points—entries 8, 16, and 21—and achieves a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** meets the criteria effectively. It is clear and offers acceptable property insight by stating that sulfur atoms may deactivate the catalyst. It considers functional groups like thiols or thioethers, addressing the complexity criterion. The rule is supported by two data points—entries 10 and 23—and maintains a balanced approach.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** is clear but lacks consistency. While it correctly predicts a low yield for entry 13 ((2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid), it fails to account for entry 15 ((2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid), which is an α-amino acid with a hydrophobic aromatic side chain that results in a high yield. This inconsistency suggests that the rule may need refinement to improve its accuracy.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** is clear and provides acceptable property insight by explaining how long-chain aliphatic acids with terminal amino or hydroxyl groups reduce effective coordination. It considers combinations of structural features, fulfilling the complexity criterion. The rule is supported by multiple data points—entries 29, 31, and 34—and maintains a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** lacks sufficient coverage, as it is primarily supported by a single data point—entry 5 (octanoic acid). While it is clear and offers plausible property insight about medium-chain aliphatic acids enhancing hydrophobic interactions, the rule would benefit from additional supporting data to strengthen its validity.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** is clear and provides adequate property insight by noting that ether oxygen atoms may not coordinate effectively with the catalyst. It considers the presence of ether linkages, addressing the complexity criterion. The rule is supported by two data points—entries 11 and 32—and achieves a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** meets all the criteria effectively. It is clear and offers solid property insight by explaining how strong electronegativity of fluorine atoms hinders effective interaction with the catalyst. It considers specific functional groups, fulfilling the complexity requirement. The rule is supported by two data points—entries 14 and 28—and maintains a balanced approach.

It considers the combination of carbonyl groups adjacent to carboxylic acids, satisfying the complexity criterion. The rule is supported by two data points—entries 19 and 27—and achieves a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** lacks sufficient coverage, being supported by only one data point—entry 9. While it is clear and provides reasonable property insight about multiple hydroxyl groups enhancing coordination, additional data points are needed to strengthen the rule and confirm its applicability.

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13** is clear but has limited coverage, with only one supporting data point—entry 17. It offers plausible property insight by suggesting that fused aromatic rings may enhance binding due to their rigid structures. However, more data points are necessary to validate the rule and ensure its robustness.

- **Comment 14**: **Rule 14** performs well across the criteria. It is clear and provides good property insight by explaining how flexible linkers allow optimal spatial orientation with the catalyst. It considers combinations of structural features, addressing the complexity criterion. The rule is supported by two data points—entries 7 and 24—and maintains a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 15**: **Rule 15** lacks clarity and sufficient coverage. It describes modifiers with both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups resulting in variable yields but only provides one example—entry 25. The rule is somewhat vague and may benefit from refinement to improve clarity and provide more predictive power.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **ω-amino acids with short aliphatic chains (chain length ≤ 5 carbons)**, like **5-aminopentanoic acid**, produce a **High Yield**. The proximity of the amino group to the carboxylic acid allows for effective bidentate coordination with the metal catalyst, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with amino groups at the para position**, such as **4-aminobenzoic acid**, result in a **High Yield**. The amino group can coordinate with the Fe ions, providing additional binding sites and stabilizing the catalyst-substrate complex.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing **nitrogen heterocycles with carboxylic acid groups directly attached to the ring**, like **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** and **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**, produce a **High Yield**. The lone pair electrons on the nitrogen can coordinate with the metal catalyst, enhancing catalytic efficiency through additional coordination pathways.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids**, such as **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid), result in a **High Yield**. Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and provide numerous hydrogen-bonding interactions, facilitating better alignment and interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with **flexible aliphatic linkers connecting an aromatic ring to a carboxylic acid group**, such as **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** and **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**, result in a **High Yield**. The flexible linker allows the aromatic ring to interact with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst while the carboxylic acid coordinates with metal sites, enhancing overall binding affinity.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups**, like **octanoic acid**, produce a **High Yield**. Their hydrophobic chains can enhance interactions within the reaction medium, improving substrate orientation and accessibility to the catalytic sites.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **sulfur atoms** in functional groups like **thiols** or **thioethers**, such as **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** and **methionine derivatives**, result in a **Low Yield**. Sulfur can strongly bind to the Fe catalyst, leading to deactivation or poisoning of the catalytic site due to the formation of stable Fe–S bonds.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with electron-donating groups (EDGs)** like **methyl**, **methoxy**, or **hydroxyl** groups at the para position (e.g., **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**) result in a **Low Yield**. EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid and reduce its ability to coordinate with the metal catalyst effectively.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers containing **ether linkages or polyether chains**, such as **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, result in a **Low Yield**. Ether oxygens do not coordinate as effectively with metal centers as nitrogen or oxygen in carboxylic acids, and the increased solubility can dilute the concentration of the modifier at the catalytic site.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers featuring **perfluorinated alkyl chains** or **trifluoromethyl groups**, like **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** and **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**, result in a **Low Yield**. The strong electronegativity of fluorine atoms withdraws electron density, hindering effective coordination with the catalyst due to decreased basicity of potential donor atoms.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers containing **aldehyde or keto groups adjacent to carboxylic acid groups**, such as **4-formylbenzoic acid** and **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**, produce a **Low Yield**. These carbonyl groups can interfere with the catalyst by forming Schiff bases or undergoing side reactions, reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with bulky hydrophobic aromatic side chains**, like **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine), result in a **Low Yield**. Steric hindrance from bulky side chains can impede effective interaction with the catalyst's active sites, and hydrophobicity may reduce solubility in the reaction medium.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with **multiple functional groups that provide a balance of electron-donating and electron-withdrawing effects**, such as **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**, can result in a **High Yield**. The presence of both EDGs (methoxy groups) and a ketone functional group may enhance interactions with the catalyst through a combination of electronic tuning and additional coordination sites.

- **Rationale for Rule 12**: Highly electronegative fluorine atoms withdraw electron density from coordinating atoms, diminishing their ability to interact with the catalyst.

- **Rationale for Rule 13**: Aldehyde and keto groups near carboxylic acids can engage in side reactions or deactivate the catalyst, leading to lower yields.

- **Rationale for Rule 14**: Bulky hydrophobic side chains introduce steric hindrance and reduce the solubility of the modifier, negatively impacting catalyst-modifier interactions.

- **Rationale for Rule 15**: A balance of electronic effects and multiple functional groups can enhance the modifier's ability to interact with the catalyst in multiple ways, improving the overall yield.

These rules provide practical guidelines for selecting or designing molecular modifiers to optimize the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By understanding the relationship between modifier structure and reaction yield, researchers can make informed decisions in their experimental designs.

**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: *Rule 5* lacks sufficient coverage. It is supported by only one data point—**5-aminopentanoic acid** with a high yield. While the rule is clear and offers good property insight by specifying ω-amino acids with a chain length of five carbons, the lack of additional supporting data points reduces its reliability. Including more examples of ω-amino acids with varying chain lengths could strengthen this rule and test its applicability.

- **Comment 2**: *Rule 6* has low coverage, with limited data points directly supporting it. The rule cites **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** leading to a low yield, which aligns with the dataset (Entry 10: yield is low). However, additional modifiers containing sulfur atoms, such as thiols or thioethers, are scarce in the dataset. Expanding the dataset to include more sulfur-containing modifiers would enhance the rule's robustness and confirm whether sulfur indeed consistently leads to catalyst deactivation.

- **Comment 3**: *Rule 8* suffers from low coverage due to the limited number of data points. Only **octanoic acid** (Entry 5) supports the rule by yielding a high reaction output. Although the rule provides good property insight by suggesting that hydrophobic chains improve substrate orientation, more examples of long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups are needed to validate this rule comprehensively.

- **Comment 4**: *Rule 12* also lacks sufficient coverage, being supported solely by **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Entry 4), which results in a high yield. The rule is clear and suggests that primary amino groups attached to aromatic rings enhance coordination with the metal catalyst. To strengthen this rule, incorporating more modifiers with primary amino groups on aromatic rings into the dataset is necessary to see if the observed effect is consistent.

- **Comment 5**: *Rule 14* is somewhat complex and has limited coverage, with only two data points: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine) yielding a low result, and **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan) yielding a high result. The rule acknowledges exceptions, which may reduce clarity. While it provides valuable property insight by considering steric hindrance and additional interactions like π-π stacking, the rule's predictive power is limited without more supporting data.

- **Comment 6**: *Rule 15* is supported by only one data point—**4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**—which results in a high yield. The rule considers the combined effect of electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups on an aromatic ring, offering good property insight. However, the low coverage suggests that the rule may be too specific or that more data is needed to confirm its general applicability.

- **Comment 7**: Overall, while most rules demonstrate clarity and provide meaningful physical-chemical insights, several rules (*Rules 5, 6, 8, 12, 14, and 15*) lack sufficient coverage. These rules could benefit from additional data points to enhance their reliability and predictive power. Balancing rule complexity with broader coverage would improve the overall set of rules, making them more robust for future applications.

**End of Rules**

**Rationales for the Rules**

- **Rule 1**: The dual carboxylic acid groups and amino group in α-amino dicarboxylic acids facilitate strong chelation with metal ions like Fe³⁺. This chelation stabilizes the metal center and increases the local concentration of the catalyst-substrate complex, enhancing reactivity.

- **Rule 2**: Electron-withdrawing groups at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids enhance the acidity of the carboxyl group by stabilizing the negative charge upon deprotonation. Increased acidity promotes stronger coordination with the metal catalyst, improving catalytic activity.

- **Rule 3**: Strong electron-donating groups like amino groups can act as additional coordination sites with the metal catalyst. The lone pair on the nitrogen atom facilitates binding to the metal center, enhancing catalytic performance through chelation.

- **Rule 4**: Weak electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid by destabilizing the negative charge upon deprotonation. This reduced acidity weakens coordination with the metal catalyst, resulting in lower yields due to less effective catalyst-modifier interactions.

- **Rule 5**: Nitrogen heterocycles can coordinate with metal centers through the lone pair electrons on nitrogen, providing additional binding sites that enhance catalyst stability and efficiency. This increased coordination improves the electron density around the metal center, facilitating the catalytic cycle.

- **Rule 6**: ω-Amino acids with shorter chain lengths can bind to metal catalysts in a bidentate manner via the amino and carboxyl groups, forming stable five-membered chelate rings that enhance catalytic performance through increased stability and effective orbital overlap.

- **Rule 7**: Longer-chain ω-amino acids are less effective because the increased chain length leads to flexible structures that cannot form stable chelate rings. This flexibility reduces the rigidity necessary for effective coordination, diminishing the modifier's ability to enhance the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Sulfur-containing functional groups can form strong, often irreversible bonds with metal centers, leading to catalyst poisoning and deactivation. The formation of stable metal-sulfur bonds withdraws the metal from the catalytic cycle, reducing the reaction yield.

- **Rule 9**: Aldehyde and ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acids can participate in side reactions or interact unfavorably with the catalyst. They may form hemiacetals or hemiketals, or coordinate in a way that blocks the active site, interfering with the catalyst's ability to facilitate the desired transformation.

- **Rule 10**: Long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids increase the hydrophobic character of the modifier, which may promote better association with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or substrate. This can enhance substrate orientation and proximity to the active site, improving reactivity.

- **Rule 11**: Hydroxyl groups at remote positions in aliphatic carboxylic acids do not contribute effectively to coordination with the metal center. Instead, they may increase the solubility of the modifier in the reaction medium, diluting the concentration near the catalyst and reducing interactions.

- **Rule 12**: Ether linkages increase the polarity and solubility of the modifier but do not contribute significantly to metal coordination due to the lone pair electrons on oxygen being less available for bonding. This can lead to a dilution effect and reduced interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 13**: Perfluorinated groups withdraw electron density from potential coordinating atoms, decreasing their ability to donate electrons to the metal catalyst. This weakens coordination, diminishes catalytic activity, and the fluorinated chains may also repel organic substrates due to their lipophobic nature.

- **Rule 14**: Multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid increase the number of potential hydrogen bonds and coordination sites with the metal center. This can enhance the stability of the catalyst-modifier complex and improve solubility in polar solvents, facilitating better interactions.

These interactions can enhance the proximity and orientation of the substrate to the active site, increasing the reaction yield.

**Summary**

The generated rules illustrate how combinations of functional groups and substructures in molecular modifiers influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

**End of Rules**

**Rationales for the Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **α-Amino dicarboxylic acids** have the ability to form strong bidentate chelation with metal ions through their amino and carboxylate groups. This chelation stabilizes the metal center and increases the local concentration of the catalyst-modifier complex, enhancing reactivity and yield.

- **Rule 2**: **Electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)** at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids increase the acidity of the carboxyl group by stabilizing the negative charge upon deprotonation. Enhanced acidity promotes stronger coordination with the metal catalyst due to increased electrophilicity, improving catalytic activity.

- **Rule 3**: **Strong electron-donating groups (EDGs)** like amino groups provide additional coordination sites via lone pair electrons on nitrogen. This facilitates direct binding to the metal center, enhancing catalytic performance through effective chelation and increasing electron density around the metal.

- **Rule 4**: **Weak EDGs** decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid by destabilizing the carboxylate anion. This reduction in acidity weakens the interaction with the metal catalyst, resulting in lower yields due to less effective catalyst-modifier binding.

- **Rule 5**: **Nitrogen heterocycles** offer lone pair electrons for coordination, providing additional binding sites that enhance catalyst stability and efficiency. This increased coordination improves electron transfer processes essential for catalytic cycles, leading to higher yields.

- **Rule 6**: **Short-chain ω-amino acids** can form stable five-membered chelate rings with metal catalysts via their amino and carboxylate groups. This effective bidentate coordination enhances catalyst binding and reactivity due to favorable ring size and orbital overlap.

- **Rule 7**: **Long-chain ω-amino acids** have increased flexibility, preventing the formation of stable chelate rings necessary for effective coordination. The reduced rigidity diminishes the modifier's ability to enhance the catalyst, leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 8**: **Sulfur-functional groups** can irreversibly bind to metal centers, causing catalyst poisoning. The formation of strong metal-sulfur bonds withdraws the metal from the catalytic cycle, reducing the availability of active catalyst and decreasing reaction yield.

- **Rule 9**: **Aldehyde and ketone groups** adjacent to carboxylic acids can interact unfavorably with the catalyst or participate in side reactions. They may coordinate in a way that blocks the active site or engage in condensation reactions, interfering with the desired catalytic activity.

- **Rule 10**: **Long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** enhance hydrophobic interactions within the reaction medium, promoting better association between the substrate and catalyst. This can improve substrate orientation toward the active site, increasing reactivity and yield.

- **Rule 11**: **Multiple hydroxyl groups** adjacent to the carboxyl group provide numerous opportunities for hydrogen bonding and coordination with the metal center. This enhances the stability of the catalyst-modifier complex and improves solubility in polar solvents, facilitating effective interactions.

- **Rule 12**: **Ether linkages** do not contribute significantly to metal coordination due to the lone pair electrons on oxygen being less available for bonding. Increased solubility from polyether chains may also lead to dilution of the modifier near the catalyst, reducing effectiveness.

- **Rule 13**: **Perfluorinated groups** withdraw electron density from coordinating atoms, weakening their ability to donate electrons to the metal catalyst. This hinders effective coordination and diminishes catalytic activity. Additionally, fluorinated chains are lipophobic, potentially repelling organic substrates.

- **Rule 14**: **Aromatic amino acids with extended conjugation**, like tryptophan, have side chains capable of π-stacking or hydrogen bonding with the catalyst or substrate. These interactions enhance proximity and orientation to the active site, increasing reaction yield through improved electron transfer.

- **Rule 15**: **Sterically hindered or deactivating functional groups** on modifiers can impede effective coordination by blocking access to the metal center or engaging in competing interactions. This reduces the modifier's ability to enhance catalytic performance, leading to lower yields.

**Summary**

The rules highlight how specific combinations of functional groups and substructures in molecular modifiers influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.
