- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and appropriately specific, with adequate physical-chemical insight regarding the role of acidic and aromatic heterocyclic side chains in amino acids. It covers multiple data points (aspartic acid, glutamic acid, and tryptophan) that support the high yield outcome, demonstrating good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear and provides adequate physical-chemical insight into how strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids influence the reaction to produce high yield. The rule is supported by multiple data points (4-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid) and effectively balances complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is generally clear and based on reasonable physical-chemical insight regarding the role of heterocyclic aromatic rings in enhancing yield. However, there is a conflicting data point (**4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**) that exhibits low yield despite containing a heterocyclic aromatic ring, suggesting the rule may require refinement. The coverage is sufficient but could benefit from addressing exceptions to improve balance and accuracy.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear and effectively distinguishes between sulfhydryl groups on aliphatic chains and those attached directly to aromatic rings, reflecting meaningful physical-chemical insight. The rule is supported by two data points (**3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** with high yield and **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** with low yield), demonstrating appropriate coverage and balance.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 provides a clear guideline distinguishing between unfunctionalized aliphatic carboxylic acids and those with polar substituents on the chain, supported by multiple data points (**octanoic acid** with high yield versus **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, and **8-aminooctanoic acid** with low yield). The rule demonstrates solid physical-chemical insight and maintains an effective balance of complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 clearly states that modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl groups result in low yield, which is supported by two data points (**2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** and **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**). The rule offers reasonable physical-chemical insight and maintains appropriate complexity and coverage for the dataset.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear and grounded in physical-chemical rationale, as aldehyde and keto groups on aliphatic chains can affect reactivity, leading to low yield. The rule is supported by two data points (**4-oxoheptanedioic acid** and **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**) and maintains an appropriate level of complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear but lacks sufficient coverage, as it is supported by only one data point (**gluconic acid**). While the physical-chemical insight is plausible, the rule would benefit from additional supporting data to confirm its validity and enhance its balance and coverage.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear but lacks sufficient coverage, being based primarily on a single data point (**phenylalanine**). While the rule differentiates between types of aromatic amino acids, it would be strengthened by additional data points to confirm its general applicability and improve balance.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is specific but lacks sufficient coverage, being supported primarily by a single data point (**4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**). While the physical-chemical rationale regarding methoxy substituents and linkers is reasonable, additional data points are necessary to confirm the rule's validity and enhance balance.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear and provides physical-chemical insight into how polar functional groups on long aliphatic chains may lead to low yield. The rule is supported by multiple data points (**7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**). However, the case of **5-aminopentanoic acid**, which has a shorter chain and results in high yield, suggests that chain length may be a factor, and the rule could be refined to specify the influence of chain length on yield to improve balance and accuracy.

Examples are **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**, and **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with unbranched chains and no polar substituents** (e.g., hydroxyl or amino groups), such as **octanoic acid**, lead to **high yield**. In contrast, similar aliphatic acids with polar substituents on the chain, especially at terminal positions, result in **low yield**. Examples of low-yield modifiers are **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, and **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl groups attached to the carboxylic acid**, such as **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**, result in **low yield** due to the electron-withdrawing nature of fluorine atoms affecting catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups on an aliphatic chain**, like **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid), lead to **high yield** by enhancing solubility and catalyst interactions.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (-CHO) or ketone (>C=O) functional groups** tend to result in **low yield**. Examples include **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** and **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**, where these groups may deactivate the catalyst or interfere with the reaction pathway.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with thiol (-SH) groups on aliphatic chains** lead to **high yield**, as seen with **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**, due to potential coordination with metal centers. Conversely, **modifiers with thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings**, like **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**, result in **low yield**, possibly due to steric hindrance or deactivation of the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with uncharged polar side chains or basic side chains**, such as derivatives of serine, threonine, or lysine (e.g., **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**), tend to result in **low yield**. The presence of additional amino groups may lead to catalyst poisoning or side reactions.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are aromatic amino acids with bulky side chains**, like **tryptophan** ((2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid), lead to **high yield**, possibly due to π-π interactions facilitating catalyst activity. In contrast, **modifiers with less bulky aromatic side chains**, such as **phenylalanine** ((2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid), result in **low yield**.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that include amide linkages involving aromatic rings and aliphatic chains** tend to result in **low yield**. Examples are **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** and **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**, where the amide bond may hinder effective catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with aromatic rings bearing hydroxyl (-OH) groups at the para position** can have variable effects. **Modifiers like 4-aminobenzoic acid**, with a para-amino group, lead to **high yield**, possibly due to favorable electronic effects. However, **derivatives of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid**, such as **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**, tend to result in **low yield**, indicating that para-hydroxyl groups may negatively impact the reaction.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are omega-amino carboxylic acids with a chain length of five carbons**, such as **5-aminopentanoic acid**, result in **high yield**, potentially due to optimal chain length for catalyst interaction. **Longer chain omega-amino acids**, like **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**, result in **low yield**, possibly because longer chains reduce the compound's ability to effectively interact with the catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with ether linkages extending from the carboxylic acid**, especially those containing polyether chains like triethylene glycol units, result in **low yield**. An example is **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, where the ether chains may sterically hinder catalyst access or alter solubility.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing an aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents connected via flexible aliphatic linkers**, where the linker is sufficiently long, can lead to **high yield**. For instance, **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (with a five-carbon linker) results in **high yield**, whereas **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (with a three-carbon linker) results in **low yield**, suggesting that longer linkers favor better catalyst interaction.

It provides some insight into how amide bonds may hinder effective catalyst interaction. The rule considers structural combinations and is supported by at least two data points, fulfilling the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 addresses the effects of aromatic rings bearing hydroxyl groups at the para position, noting that para-amino groups lead to high yield (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid), whereas para-hydroxyl groups may result in low yield (e.g., derivatives of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid). While the rule provides property insight, it may lack clarity due to the variable effects and could benefit from being split into separate, more specific rules to improve clarity and application.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 effectively demonstrates that omega-amino carboxylic acids with a chain length of five carbons result in high yield, such as 5-aminopentanoic acid, while longer chains lead to low yield. It offers good property insight into the optimal chain length for catalyst interaction, considers structural complexity, and is well-supported by multiple data points, meeting the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 clearly states that modifiers with ether linkages extending from the carboxylic acid, especially those containing polyether chains, result in low yield, as shown by 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid. The rule provides insight into how ether chains may hinder catalyst access or alter solubility. It considers combinations of substructures and meets the coverage requirement with at least two supporting data points.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 illustrates that modifiers containing aromatic rings with electron-donating substituents connected via flexible aliphatic linkers, where the linker is sufficiently long, can lead to high yield, as seen with 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid. Conversely, shorter linkers result in low yield, exemplified by 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid. The rule is clear, offers property insight into linker length effects on catalyst interaction, considers combinations of substructures, and is supported by data, satisfying the coverage criterion.

In contrast, similar modifiers with para-methyl (-CH₃) groups, like **4-methylbenzoic acid**, result in **low yield** due to the electron-donating nature of the methyl group, which may reduce catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms in the ring**, such as pyridine or pyrazole carboxylic acids directly attached to the carboxyl group, are associated with **high yield**. Examples include **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid), **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**, and **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**. However, modifiers where the nitrogen-containing heterocycle is a substituent on an aromatic ring, like **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**, result in **low yield**.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with thiol (-SH) groups attached to aliphatic chains** lead to **high yield**. An example is **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**. Conversely, modifiers with thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings, such as **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**, result in **low yield**, possibly due to steric hindrance or electronic effects affecting catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky hydrophobic aromatic side chains**, particularly **tryptophan**, lead to **high yield**.

  Rule 1 is clear and straightforward to apply, as it focuses on amino acids with acidic side chains containing an additional carboxylic acid group beyond the alpha-carboxyl group. The rule provides physical-chemical insight by suggesting that the presence of two carboxyl groups may enhance coordination with the metal center, potentially increasing the yield. It considers combinations of sub-structures—the amino acid backbone and the extra carboxyl group—adding complexity. The rule is supported by at least two data points: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid and (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, both resulting in high yield, demonstrating good coverage.

- **Comment 2**:
  
  Rule 2 is clear in its application, requiring the identification of electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) or electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids.

It considers combinations of sub-structures and electronic effects, adding complexity. The rule has good coverage, supported by multiple data points: high yields for 4-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, low yields for 4-methylbenzoic acid and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, and an exception with high yield for 4-aminobenzoic acid.

- **Comment 3**:

The rule considers the presence of specific functional groups and their impact on coordination, adding complexity. It is supported by data showing low yields for (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid and 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid, indicating good coverage.

- **Comment 9**:
  
  Rule 9 is clear in identifying modifiers with highly electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups, such as perfluoroalkyl chains. It provides physical-chemical insight by proposing that strong electron-withdrawing effects may reduce the ability of the carboxylate to coordinate with the metal center. However, the rule is based on a single data point (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), resulting in low coverage. This limits the strength of the rule despite its clarity and insight.

- **Comment 10**:

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with an additional carboxylic acid group (amino dicarboxylic acids)** result in **high yield**. Examples include **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid). The presence of two carboxyl groups provides multiple coordination sites, enhancing binding to the metal center of the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a primary amino group located on a short aliphatic chain of five carbons or fewer (short-chain omega-amino acids)** result in **high yield**. An example is **5-aminopentanoic acid**. The proximity of the amino and carboxyl groups facilitates effective bidentate coordination with minimal steric hindrance. Conversely, **similar amino acids with longer aliphatic chains (more than five carbons)** result in **low yield** due to increased flexibility and steric hindrance reducing effective coordination. Examples include **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating coordinating groups such as amino (-NH₂) or hydroxy (-OH) groups at the para position** result in **high yield**. Examples include **4-aminobenzoic acid** and **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**. These groups enhance interaction with the metal center through coordination. In contrast, **modifiers where the substituent at the para position is a non-coordinating group (e.g., methyl group)** result in **low yield**. An example is **4-methylbenzoic acid**. Electron-donating but non-coordinating groups decrease the acidity and coordinating ability of the carboxyl group, weakening metal coordination.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (-NO₂) at the para position** result in **high yield**. An example is **4-nitrobenzoic acid**. Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with the metal center.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen heteroatoms adjacent to the carboxyl group** result in **high yield**. Examples include **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** and **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**. The nitrogen atoms increase electron density and provide additional coordination sites, enhancing binding to the catalyst.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing both a carboxylic acid group and a thiol (-SH) group on a short aliphatic chain (three carbons or fewer)** result in **high yield**. An example is **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**. The thiol group offers additional coordination capability, enhancing binding to the metal center.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups** result in **high yield**. An example is **octanoic acid**. The hydrophobic hydrocarbon chain may facilitate favorable interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst, enhancing binding.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing ether linkages, especially polyether chains extending from the carboxylic acid** result in **low yield**. Examples include **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**. Ether oxygens may disrupt optimal coordination with the catalyst by introducing flexibility and steric hindrance, reducing efficacy.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with amide bonds linking functional groups or amino acids (containing amide linkages)** result in **low yield**. Examples include **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** and **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**. Amide linkages reduce electron density on coordinating atoms, hindering effective binding to the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing highly electron-withdrawing groups attached to the carboxylic acid, such as perfluoroalkyl or trifluoroacetyl groups** result in **low yield**. Examples include **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** and **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect reduces electron density on the carboxylate, diminishing coordination ability.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with additional carbonyl groups (ketone or aldehyde) adjacent to the carboxylic acid group** result in **low yield**. Examples include **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** and **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**. The adjacent carbonyl groups may compete for metal coordination or alter electronic distribution unfavorably, hindering effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups along with a carboxylic acid group on an aliphatic chain** result in **high yield**. An example is **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid). Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst’s active sites.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with heteroaromatic substituents at the para position** result in **low yield**. An example is **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**. The steric hindrance and electronic effects of the bulky heteroaromatic group may impede effective coordination with the metal center.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with phenolic groups attached to a propanoic acid chain (where the hydroxyphenyl group is not directly attached to the carboxyl group)** result in **low yield**. An example is **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**. The increased distance between the phenolic hydroxyl group and the carboxyl group may reduce the overall coordination efficiency.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains (aromatic rings)** result in **low yield**. An example is **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine). The bulky side chain may cause steric hindrance, preventing optimal interaction with the catalyst.
