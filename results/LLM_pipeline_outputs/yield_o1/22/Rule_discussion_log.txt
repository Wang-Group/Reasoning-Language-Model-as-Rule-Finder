**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows for easy determination of whether a modifier will result in a high or low yield based on chain length (2 to 5 carbons) and the presence of an amino group. The property insight is strong, explaining that the amino group enhances coordination with the metal center while the short chain reduces steric hindrance, promoting effective interaction with the catalyst. The rule considers combinations of substructures (short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino group), satisfying the complexity criterion. It is supported by multiple data points with both high yield (e.g., 5-aminopentanoic acid) and low yield examples (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid), ensuring good coverage.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear in specifying that aromatic carboxylic acids with a para amino group lead to high yield, while those with electron-withdrawing groups at the same position result in low yield. The property insight is solid, relating electron-donating and withdrawing effects to catalytic activity by affecting electron density and coordination with the metal center. The rule considers combinations of substructures (aromatic ring, carboxylic acid, and specific substituents at the para position), fulfilling the complexity requirement. The examples provided support the rule, indicating good coverage with both high yield (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid) and low yield modifiers (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid).

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 clearly distinguishes between modifiers where the pyridine ring is directly attached to the carboxylic acid (resulting in high yield) and those connected via another aromatic ring (resulting in low yield). The property insight is logical, explaining that direct attachment allows the nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring to coordinate effectively with the metal center, while additional rings introduce steric hindrance. The rule involves combinations of substructures, addressing complexity. Coverage is adequate with high yield examples (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid) and low yield examples (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid).

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 specifies that long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (more than 6 carbons) without polar substituents result in high yield, whereas those with polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) lead to low yield.

The property insight explains that non-polar long chains enhance hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst, while polar groups can cause steric hindrance and decrease solubility. The rule considers both chain length and presence of substituents, satisfying the complexity criterion. It is backed by examples with high yield (e.g., octanoic acid) and low yield (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid), demonstrating good coverage.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 states that amino acids with carboxylic acid side chains, such as aspartic and glutamic acid, give high yield. Those with hydrophobic aromatic side chains result in low yield, except for tryptophan, which gives high yield. While the rule is generally clear, the exception introduces some complexity. The property insight is adequate, suggesting that carboxylic side chains enhance coordination, bulky hydrophobic side chains cause steric hindrance, but the indole ring in tryptophan may favorably interact with the catalyst. The rule considers combinations of substructures, meeting the complexity criterion. Coverage is good with examples of high yield (e.g., (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid) and low yield (e.g., (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid), including the exception (e.g., tryptophan).

Coverage is adequate with high yield examples (e.g., 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid), supporting the rule.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 specifies that modifiers with thiol groups on short aliphatic chains yield high results, while those with thiol groups on aromatic rings yield low results. The rule is clear. The property insight is reasonable, noting that aliphatic thiols enhance coordination without significant steric hindrance, whereas aromatic thiols may bind too strongly or poison the catalyst. The rule considers both the functional group and the type of chain, meeting the complexity criterion. Coverage includes examples for both high yield (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) and low yield (e.g., 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid), though more data points would be beneficial.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 states that modifiers with flexible ether chains resembling polyethylene glycol (PEG) result in low yield. The rule is clear and easily applicable.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 specifies that modifiers with methoxy groups on aromatic rings attached to aliphatic chains result in high yield, especially when combined with electron-donating substituents. The rule is moderately complex but remains clear. The property insight is acceptable, highlighting how electron-donating groups increase electron density, enhancing coordination with the catalyst. Complexity involves combinations of structural features. Coverage is limited to a high yield example (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid); additional data points would strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 indicates that modifiers that are keto acids with a ketone group adjacent to the carboxylic acid result in low yield. The rule is clear and direct. The property insight suggests that the ketone group may participate in side reactions or bind too strongly to the catalyst. Complexity is minimal, focusing on a specific structural feature. Coverage includes a low yield example (e.g., 4-oxoheptanedioic acid) and a high yield exception (e.g., 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid), which is explained. Additional examples could enhance coverage.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 states that N-acetylated amino acids result in low yield. The rule is clear. The property insight is logical, noting that N-acetylation blocks free amino groups essential for coordination. Complexity is minimal. Coverage includes a low yield example (e.g., (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid), but more data points would be beneficial.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 specifies that modifiers with hydrophobic aromatic side chains on aliphatic backbones result in low yield unless they contain electron-donating groups. The rule is clear but complex due to the conditional exception. The property insight is sound, explaining that hydrophobic aromatic groups cause steric hindrance, but electron-donating substituents mitigate this effect. Complexity is high, considering combinations of substructures and effects of substituents. Coverage is good, with both low yield examples (e.g., 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid) and a high yield exception (e.g., 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid).

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: *Short-chain aliphatic amino acids (2 to 5 carbon backbone) containing both amino and carboxyl groups result in high yield.*  
  **Explanation:** The presence of amino and carboxylate groups allows for effective coordination with the metal center of the catalyst. Short-chain lengths minimize steric hindrance, facilitating interaction with the catalyst's active sites.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **High Yield:** (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid), 5-aminopentanoic acid (5-aminovaleric acid)  
    - **Low Yield:** (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (N-acetyllysine), 7-aminoheptanoic acid

- **Rule 2**: *Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, methoxy) at the para position lead to high yield; those with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., formyl, trifluoromethyl) result in low yield.*  
  **Explanation:** Electron-donating groups increase electron density on the aromatic ring, enhancing coordination with the metal catalyst. Electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density, weakening interaction with the catalyst.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **High Yield:** 4-aminobenzoic acid, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid  
    - **Low Yield:** 4-formylbenzoic acid, 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers containing nitrogenous heterocycles (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole) directly attached to the carboxylic acid group result in high yield; if the nitrogenous ring is indirectly attached, the yield is low.*  
  **Explanation:** Nitrogen atoms in heterocyclic rings can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity. Direct attachment ensures effective orbital overlap and coordination. Indirect attachment via another ring introduces steric hindrance and reduces coordination efficiency.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **High Yield:** Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (nicotinic acid), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid  
    - **Low Yield:** 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 4**: *Long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (6 or more carbons) without polar functional groups result in high yield; introducing polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) onto the chain decreases the yield.*  
  **Explanation:** Non-polar long chains enhance hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst, promoting better alignment and access to active sites. Polar groups can introduce steric hindrance or form undesired interactions, impeding effective catalysis.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **High Yield:** Octanoic acid  
    - **Low Yield:** 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group result in high yield due to enhanced chelation; lack of such groups leads to lower yield.*  
  **Explanation:** Multiple hydroxyl groups increase the ligand's ability to chelate the metal center, forming stable complexes that enhance catalytic activity.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **High Yield:** (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid)  
    - **Low Yield:** Modifiers without adjacent hydroxyl groups, such as simple aliphatic acids

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers with thiol groups on short aliphatic chains yield high results; thiol groups on aromatic rings lead to low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.*  
  **Explanation:** Aliphatic thiols can coordinate with the metal center without causing significant steric hindrance. Aromatic thiols may bind too strongly or irreversibly to the catalyst, deactivating it.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **High Yield:** 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid  
    - **Low Yield:** 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers containing bulky, electron-rich aromatic systems directly attached to the carboxylic acid enhance yield when they have electron-donating substituents; absence of such substituents results in low yield.*  
  **Explanation:** Electron-rich aromatics with donating groups increase electron density for coordination and may interact via π-stacking with the catalyst. Bulky groups without electron-donating substituents may cause steric hindrance without beneficial electronic effects.  
  **Examples:**

However, it doesn't fully account for all data points; for example, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid shows low yield despite fitting the high-yield criteria, suggesting the rule may need refinement to include chain length or other structural factors.
- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 provides a clear distinction between nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxylic acid (high yield) and those that are substituted or indirectly attached (low yield). The property insight is adequate, focusing on coordination efficiency. However, the rule doesn't account for exceptions like 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid, which results in high yield despite the heterocycle being indirectly attached, indicating the rule may require further refinement.
- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear and effectively explains how long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without polar groups lead to high yield, while introducing polar groups reduces yield. The property insight is solid, relating to hydrophobic interactions and steric effects. It considers combinations of substructures and is well-supported by data, achieving good coverage and balance.
- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear in its description of modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group leading to high yield. The property insight regarding enhanced chelation is sound. However, the rule has limited coverage with only one supporting data point and may be too specific, suggesting the need for more supporting examples to validate its effectiveness.
- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 clearly differentiates between thiol groups on aliphatic chains (high yield) and on aromatic rings (low yield). The property insight is adequate, addressing catalyst poisoning by aromatic thiols. It considers functional group location and is well-supported by data, showing good coverage and balance.
- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear, indicating that flexible ether chains in modifiers result in low yield due to steric hindrance and decreased effective concentration. The property insight is appropriate, and while the rule is specific, it is supported by data points, achieving acceptable coverage and balancing complexity with specificity.
- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear and provides property insight into how perfluorinated alkyl chains reduce yield. However, it is supported by only one data point, limiting its coverage. The rule may be too specific and would benefit from additional examples to strengthen its validity.
- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear, stating that modifiers with aldehyde groups lead to low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation. The property insight is adequate. It is supported by multiple data points, providing good coverage and balancing specificity with practical significance.
- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 clearly explains that N-acetylated amino acids and modifiers with peptide bonds result in low yield. The property insight regarding steric hindrance and blocked coordination sites is solid. The rule considers combinations of substructures and is well-supported by data, achieving good coverage and balance.
- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 addresses modifiers with electron-rich aromatic systems and extended aliphatic chains, but its complexity may reduce clarity. The property insight is reasonable, but exceptions in the data (e.g., 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid showing low yield) suggest the rule may need simplification or additional factors to improve clarity and coverage.
- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is clear but highly specific, with limited coverage supported by a single data point. The property insight is acceptable, but the rule would benefit from more examples to enhance its applicability and balance.
- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 provides clarity on the impact of strong electron-withdrawing groups on yield. The property insight is adequate, but the rule is narrow in scope with only one supporting data point, suggesting limited coverage and the need for additional examples.
- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 is clear in its focus on modifiers containing indole systems leading to high yield. The property insight regarding enhanced π-interactions is reasonable. However, the rule relies on a single data point, limiting its coverage and practical applicability.
- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 is clear and offers adequate property insight into how cyclic imide structures enhance yield through effective chelation. Like several others, it is supported by only one data point, indicating limited coverage and the potential need for more supporting data to confirm its significance.

**Revised Rules**

After analyzing the provided dataset and the current rules, we've identified some inconsistencies and opportunities for improvement, particularly in **Rule 2**. We have refined the rules to better align with the underlying chemical principles and to enhance their predictive power.

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: *Short-chain aliphatic amino acids (2 to 5 carbons) with free amino and carboxyl groups and without bulky aromatic side chains result in high yield; introducing aromatic side chains or N-acetylation lowers the yield.*

  **Explanation:** Simple aliphatic amino acids coordinate effectively with the metal center, enhancing catalyst activity. Aromatic side chains introduce steric hindrance or disrupt coordination due to π-π interactions. N-acetylation blocks the amino group, reducing coordination ability.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid), 5-aminopentanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine), (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (N-acetyllysine)

- **Rule 2**: *Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., amino, hydroxy) at the para position **and** extended aliphatic chains (4 or more carbons) connected to the aromatic ring result in high yield; simple aromatic carboxylic acids without extended chains result in low yield.*

  **Explanation:** The combination of electron-donating groups and an extended aliphatic chain enhances electron density and provides flexibility, improving coordination with the catalyst. Simple aromatics lack the necessary spatial arrangement for effective interaction.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-methylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxylic acid group result in high yield; if the heterocycle is indirectly attached or has bulky substituents, the yield is low.*

  **Explanation:** Nitrogen heterocycles like pyridine and pyrazole efficiently coordinate with metal centers when directly connected, enhancing catalyst activity. Indirect attachment or bulky groups hinder coordination due to steric effects.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (nicotinic acid), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (heterocycle indirectly attached)

- **Rule 4**: *Long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (6 or more carbons) without additional polar functional groups result in high yield; introducing polar groups (e.g., hydroxy, amino) onto the chain decreases the yield due to disrupted hydrophobic interactions.*

  **Explanation:** Nonpolar long chains enhance hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst, promoting better alignment with active sites. Polar groups introduce unfavorable interactions or steric hindrance, impeding catalysis.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** Octanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group on an aliphatic chain result in high yield; lack of such hydroxyl groups or their presence on aromatic rings leads to lower yield.*

  **Explanation:** Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance chelation with the metal center through multidentate binding, forming stable complexes that boost catalytic activity.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid)
    - **Low Yield:** Molecules without adjacent hydroxyl groups or with hydroxyls on aromatic rings (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid)

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers containing thiol groups on short aliphatic chains lead to high yield; thiol groups on aromatic rings result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning from strong or irreversible binding.*

  **Explanation:** Aliphatic thiols can coordinate with the metal center without significant steric hindrance, enhancing activity. Aromatic thiols may bind too strongly or irreversibly, deactivating the catalyst.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers with flexible ether chains (e.g., polyethylene glycol-like structures) and terminal carboxyl groups result in low yield due to steric hindrance and reduced effective concentration at the catalyst surface.*

  **Explanation:** Flexible ether chains increase molecular volume and conformational flexibility, reducing the likelihood of effective interaction with the catalyst's active sites.

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., perfluoroalkyl chains, trifluoroacetyl) result in low yield due to decreased electron density and poor coordination ability with the metal center.*

  **Explanation:** Electron-withdrawing groups reduce electron availability for coordination, weakening interactions with the catalyst.

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid, 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers containing aldehyde groups, especially on aromatic rings, result in low yield due to potential side reactions and catalyst deactivation.*

  **Explanation:** Aldehyde groups are reactive and may form Schiff bases or coordinate strongly with metals, blocking catalyst active sites and reducing activity.

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers that are N-acetylated amino acids or contain peptide bonds result in low yield due to steric hindrance and blocked coordination sites from the capped amino groups and increased molecular size.*

  **Explanation:** N-acetylation and peptide bonds prevent effective coordination with the metal center, hindering catalytic activity.

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic systems directly attached to extended aliphatic chains enhance yield; shorter chains or lack of electron-donating substituents result in low yield.*

  **Explanation:** Electron-rich aromatics with donating groups (e.g., methoxy, hydroxy) increase electron density for coordination and improve hydrophobic interactions. Extended chains provide flexibility and optimal positioning near the active site.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (shorter chain)

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers containing halomethyl groups on aromatic rings result in high yield due to increased reactivity and potential for additional interactions with the catalyst through halogen bonding or enhanced electrophilicity.*

  **Explanation:** Halomethyl groups can participate in unique interactions or affect electron distribution, enhancing catalyst-modifier binding.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers containing indole or other extended conjugated systems directly attached to the amino acid backbone result in high yield due to enhanced π-interactions and potential for multidentate coordination with the catalyst.*

  **Explanation:** Extended conjugated systems can engage in π-π stacking or coordinate through delocalized electrons, enhancing binding with the catalyst.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan)
    - **Low Yield:** (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine) due to less effective conjugation and sterics

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers with cyclic imide structures adjacent to carboxylic acid groups result in high yield due to their ability to chelate metal centers effectively through multiple coordination sites.*

  **Explanation:** Cyclic imides provide multiple points of interaction (carbonyl oxygens and nitrogen) for strong and stable complex formation with the metal catalyst.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers that are simple aromatic carboxylic acids without electron-donating substituents or with electron-withdrawing groups result in low yield due to poor coordination ability and decreased electron density.*

  **Explanation:** Lack of electron-donating groups reduces the affinity of the modifier for the metal center, leading to weaker interactions.

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-formylbenzoic acid

**End of Rules**

**Summary of Changes:**

- **Rule 1**: Expanded to include the effect of aromatic side chains on amino acids, explaining the discrepancy with phenylalanine.
- **Rule 2**: Refined to clarify that both electron-donating groups and extended aliphatic chains are necessary for high yield, addressing the exceptions with simple aromatic acids like 4-aminobenzoic acid.
- **Rule 8**: Combined the effects of perfluorinated chains and other strong electron-withdrawing groups to broaden the rule's applicability.
- **Rule 12**: Added explanation for the unique behavior of halomethyl groups on aromatic rings, despite limited examples.
- **Rule 13**: Clarified the importance of extended conjugation and multidentate coordination with indole-containing modifiers.
- **Rule 15**: Added to address low-yield modifiers lacking electron-donating groups, reinforcing patterns observed in the dataset.

**Conclusion:**

These revised rules offer a comprehensive understanding of how various functional groups and structural features of molecular modifiers influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp3)–H bond functionalization reaction. By considering combinations of substructures and underlying physicochemical properties, these rules provide clear predictions for the activity of new modifiers and cover a broad range of the dataset while balancing simplicity and complexity.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 states that amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains lower the yield. However, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan) is listed as a high-yield modifier (entry 15). This contradiction suggests that the rule needs refinement to account for exceptions like tryptophan, possibly due to the unique properties of the indole group enhancing coordination.

- **Comment 2**: According to Rule 2, simple aromatic carboxylic acids without extended aliphatic chains result in low yield. Yet, 4-aminobenzoic acid (entry 4) is reported to have a high yield in the dataset. This inconsistency indicates that the rule may require revision to consider that strong electron-donating groups like amino groups can enhance yield even without extended aliphatic chains.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is supported by a single data point—(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid). Due to limited coverage, the reliability of this rule is uncertain. Additional data points with modifiers containing multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups are necessary to validate this rule.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is based on only one example—4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid (entry 1). With insufficient data to support this rule, its general applicability is questionable. More examples are needed to confirm the effect of halomethyl groups on yield.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 centers on modifiers containing indole or extended conjugated systems, but relies solely on tryptophan (entry 15) as evidence. The limited data reduces confidence in the rule. Expanding the dataset to include more modifiers with similar structures would help reinforce this rule.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 is derived from a single data point—1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid (entry 17). The lack of multiple supporting examples limits the rule's coverage and predictive power. Additional modifiers with cyclic imide structures should be examined to substantiate this rule.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 overlaps with parts of Rule 2, as both address simple aromatic carboxylic acids lacking electron-donating substituents. This redundancy could be reduced by combining the two rules for clarity. Consolidating the rules may also help address contradictions noted with 4-aminobenzoic acid in Rule 2.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear in its structural description, allowing unambiguous classification of modifiers based on the presence of free amino and carboxyl groups on short aliphatic chains without bulky or aromatic side chains. It provides good physical-chemical insight by explaining how these groups facilitate high yield and how bulky or aromatic side chains lower yield due to steric hindrance or electronic effects. The rule considers combinations of substructures (functional groups and chain length), adding appropriate complexity. It is well-supported by multiple data points (e.g., aspartic acid and 5-aminopentanoic acid yielding high; phenylalanine yielding low), demonstrating good coverage.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 offers a clear structural guideline by combining electron-donating groups at the para position with extended aliphatic chains, aiding in classification. It provides physical-chemical insight by linking the electron-donating ability and chain extension to improved yield. The rule incorporates combinations of substructures, enhancing complexity. However, there is a discrepancy in the dataset: 4-aminobenzoic acid is listed as low yield in the rule but shows high yield in the dataset. This inconsistency affects clarity and coverage, indicating that the rule may not fully capture all influencing factors.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 distinctly differentiates between modifiers with nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to carboxylic groups (high yield) and those indirectly attached or with bulky substituents (low yield), providing clarity. It offers insight by suggesting that direct attachment aids in effective coordination with the metal center. The rule considers specific substructures, adding complexity. However, the example of 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid shows high yield despite the heterocycle being indirectly attached, which contradicts the rule. This inconsistency affects the rule's clarity and coverage.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear and straightforward, specifying that long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without polar groups result in high yield, while introducing polar groups lowers the yield. It provides good physical-chemical insight by associating non-polar chains with better interaction or solubility properties favorable for the reaction. The rule combines chain length and functional group presence, adding complexity. It is well-supported by multiple data points (e.g., octanoic acid yielding high; 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid yielding low), ensuring good coverage.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 clearly identifies modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group on aliphatic chains as resulting in high yield. It provides physical-chemical insight by suggesting these groups enhance coordination or reactivity with the catalyst. The rule considers specific structural combinations, adding appropriate complexity. It is supported by data (e.g., gluconic acid yielding high), but coverage is somewhat limited due to fewer examples, though it aligns with observed trends.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 offers clarity by distinguishing between thiol groups on aliphatic chains (high yield) and on aromatic rings (low yield), explaining that the latter may lead to catalyst poisoning. It provides solid physical-chemical insight and considers combinations of substructures, adding complexity.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear in its identification of modifiers with flexible ether chains and terminal carboxyl groups resulting in low yield due to steric hindrance and dilution at the catalyst surface. It provides adequate physical-chemical insight and considers specific structural combinations, contributing to complexity. The rule is supported by data (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid yielding low), ensuring reasonable coverage.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 clearly states that strong electron-withdrawing groups lead to low yield, providing insight into how decreased electron density hampers coordination with the metal center. The rule focuses on specific substructures, offering appropriate complexity. It is supported by data points such as perfluorinated acids yielding low, demonstrating good coverage.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear in identifying aldehyde-containing modifiers, especially on aromatic rings, as resulting in low yield due to potential side reactions and catalyst deactivation. It provides solid physical-chemical insight and focuses on specific functional groups, adding complexity. The rule has good coverage, supported by data (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid yielding low).

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 clearly indicates that N-acetylated amino acids or modifiers with peptide bonds result in low yield due to steric hindrance and blocked coordination sites. It provides relevant physical-chemical insight and considers combinations of substructures (acetylation and peptide bonds), adding complexity. The rule is supported by data (e.g., N-acetylated amino acids yielding low), ensuring good coverage.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 offers clarity by linking high yield to electron-rich aromatic systems directly attached to extended aliphatic chains and low yield to shorter chains or lack of electron-donating substituents. It provides physical-chemical insight into how these features enhance interactions with the catalyst. The rule considers substructure combinations, adding complexity. It has good coverage, supported by data (e.g., 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid yielding high and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid yielding low).

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is clear in identifying modifiers with halomethyl groups on aromatic rings as resulting in high yield due to increased reactivity. It provides physical-chemical insight, but the rule focuses on a very specific substructure, which may limit complexity. Coverage is limited as it is supported by a single data point (4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid), indicating a need for more data to strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 clearly states that modifiers with indole or extended conjugated systems attached to amino acid backbones result in high yield due to enhanced π-interactions. It provides good physical-chemical insight and includes complex structures. However, coverage is limited to a single example (tryptophan yielding high), suggesting that more data points are needed to confirm the rule's validity.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 is clear in specifying that modifiers with cyclic imide structures near carboxylic acid groups result in high yield due to effective chelation. It offers physical-chemical insight and includes complex substructures.

    - **Low Yield:** 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers containing thiol groups on short aliphatic chains lead to **high yield** due to the thiol's ability to coordinate with metal centers. Thiol groups on aromatic rings result in **low yield** due to potential catalyst poisoning from strong or irreversible binding.*

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are α-amino acids with free amino and carboxyl groups result in **high yield**. The presence of electron-rich side chains, especially those containing heteroatoms like additional amino or carboxyl groups, enhances yield due to better coordination with the metal center. Amino acids with hydrophobic or bulky aromatic side chains without additional coordinating sites result in **low yield** because of reduced interaction with the catalyst.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (glutamic acid), (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan)
    - **Low Yield:** (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine)

- **Rule 2**: *Aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-donating groups such as amino or hydroxy at the para position result in **high yield** due to increased electron density and improved coordination with the catalyst. Aromatic acids lacking these groups or containing electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., formyl, methyl) lead to **low yield** because they do not facilitate effective interaction with the metal center.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 4-aminobenzoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 4-formylbenzoic acid, 4-methylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group result in **high yield** due to the nitrogen's ability to coordinate with the metal center. If the nitrogen heterocycle is separated from the carboxyl group by additional rings or linkers, the yield is **low** because of steric hindrance or reduced electronic interaction.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (nicotinic acid), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 4**: *Long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups result in **high yield** due to favorable hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst surface. Introducing polar groups such as hydroxy or amino groups decreases the yield to **low** because they disrupt these interactions and may introduce steric hindrance or competing coordination sites.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** octanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers possessing multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups (polyols) near the carboxyl group on an aliphatic chain result in **high yield** due to enhanced hydrogen bonding and multiple coordination points with the catalyst. Modifiers with isolated hydroxyl groups or hydroxyl groups on aromatic rings result in **low yield** because they provide fewer coordination opportunities and may introduce steric hindrance.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid)
    - **Low Yield:** 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers containing thiol groups on short aliphatic chains lead to **high yield** due to the thiol's strong affinity for metal centers, enhancing coordination with the catalyst. Thiol groups on aromatic rings result in **low yield** because they may cause catalyst poisoning or are less accessible for coordination due to steric factors.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups such as perfluoroalkyl chains or trifluoroacetyl moieties result in **low yield** due to decreased electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, leading to poor coordination with the metal center and reduced catalyst activity.*

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid, 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers featuring flexible ether chains (e.g., polyethylene glycol-like structures) linked to a terminal carboxyl group result in **low yield**. The increased flexibility and polarity reduce effective interactions with the catalyst’s active site and may lead to unfavorable solvation effects.*

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers containing aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid, especially on aromatic rings, result in **low yield** due to potential side reactions with the catalyst or substrate and possible catalyst deactivation.*

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic systems connected via an aliphatic chain of four or more carbons to a carboxylic acid result in **high yield**. The appropriate chain length and electron-rich aromatic ring facilitate strong interactions with the catalyst. Shorter chains or absence of electron-donating groups reduce the yield to **low** because they do not provide the same level of interaction.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers with bulky substituents or sterically hindered groups near the carboxyl functional group result in **low yield** because they restrict access to the catalyst's active site and impede effective coordination. This includes molecules where the carboxyl group is adjacent to large aromatic systems or additional substituents.*

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers with extended conjugated systems containing heteroatoms (such as oxygen or nitrogen) directly attached to the carboxyl group result in **high yield**. These structures can delocalize charge and provide multiple coordination sites, enhancing interactions with the catalyst.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers containing halomethyl groups on aromatic rings result in **high yield** due to increased reactivity and potential for halogen bonding or coordination with the catalyst, which can enhance catalytic activity.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers that are N-acetylated amino acids or contain peptide bonds result in **low yield** due to steric hindrance from the acetyl or peptide groups and blocked coordination sites, which prevent effective interaction with the catalyst.*

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

    - 8-aminooctanoic acid
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group result in **high yield** due to the nitrogen's ability to coordinate with the metal center. If the nitrogen heterocycle is connected through additional aromatic rings or linkers, the yield is **low** because of steric hindrance and reduced electronic interaction.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (*Nicotinic acid*)
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group (e.g., sugar acids) result in **high yield** due to enhanced hydrogen bonding and multiple coordination sites. Modifiers with hydroxyl groups on aromatic rings or isolated hydroxyl groups result in **low yield** because they provide fewer coordination opportunities and may introduce steric hindrance.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (*Gluconic acid*)
  
  - **Low Yield:** 
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing strong electron-withdrawing groups, such as perfluoroalkyl chains, result in **low yield** due to decreased electron density on coordinating atoms, leading to poor interaction with the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:** 
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with aliphatic thiol groups result in **high yield** due to the thiol's strong affinity for metal centers, enhancing coordination.

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  
  - **Low Yield:** 
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with flexible polyether chains (e.g., polyethylene glycol-like structures) linked to a terminal carboxyl group result in **low yield**. Their increased flexibility and polarity reduce effective interactions with the catalyst's active site due to unfavorable solvation and entropic effects.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:** 
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:** 
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing electron-rich aromatic rings connected via an aliphatic chain (four or more carbons) to a carboxyl group result in **high yield**. The chain length allows for optimal positioning of the aromatic ring for π-interactions with the catalyst, enhancing binding. Shorter chains or absence of electron-donating substituents lead to **low yield**.**

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**
- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear, allowing us to determine whether a modifier will result in high or low yield based on the presence of free amino and carboxyl groups and the nature of the side chain. The physical-chemical insight is adequate, as coordinating functional groups enhance interaction with the catalyst, leading to higher yields, while hydrophobic side chains or blocked amino groups hinder coordination. The rule considers combinations of substructures—specifically, the amino acid backbone with varying side chains—satisfying the complexity criterion. It is supported by multiple data points, including both high yield (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid, tryptophan) and low yield examples (e.g., phenylalanine, N-acetyllysine), demonstrating good coverage.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear in distinguishing between electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups on aromatic carboxylic acids at the para position, enabling precise yield predictions. The physical-chemical insight is solid; electron-donating groups increase electron density, facilitating coordination with the catalyst, while electron-withdrawing groups have the opposite effect. The rule combines multiple structural features (aromatic ring, carboxyl group, substituent type, and position), aligning with the complexity criterion. It is well-supported by data, with high yield examples like 4-aminobenzoic acid and low yield examples like 4-formylbenzoic acid, indicating satisfactory coverage.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 lacks some clarity due to inconsistencies; while it states that modifiers without additional polar groups result in high yield, 5-aminopentanoic acid (which has an amino group) is listed as a high yield example. This contradiction reduces the rule's clarity. The physical-chemical insight regarding chain length and the effect of polar groups on coordination is reasonable. The rule addresses combinations of features, such as chain length and functional groups, meeting the complexity criterion. However, the inconsistency and potential exceptions weaken the rule’s reliability, despite it being supported by several data points across both high and low yields.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear and allows for straightforward application by identifying modifiers with nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group as high yield modifiers, and those connected via additional rings as low yield. The physical-chemical insight is appropriate, attributing higher yields to better coordination with the metal center. The rule considers complex structural features, satisfying the complexity criterion. It has good coverage, with multiple data points supporting both high yield (e.g., nicotinic acid) and low yield (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid) modifiers.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear in its distinction between modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group and those with isolated hydroxyl groups. The physical-chemical insight is acceptable, explaining that multiple coordination sites enhance binding. However, the rule falls short on coverage, as it is supported by only one high yield data point (gluconic acid), which undermines its reliability according to the coverage criterion requiring at least two supporting data points.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear, specifying that modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups like perfluoroalkyl chains result in low yield. The physical-chemical rationale is sound, as decreased electron density hinders interaction with the metal center. The rule is simple, focusing on a single functional group, which may limit its complexity. Coverage is minimal with only one supporting data point, reducing the rule's reliability.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 distinctly differentiates between aliphatic and aromatic thiol-containing modifiers regarding yield outcomes, making it clear and actionable. The physical-chemical insight is valid, considering the thiol group's affinity for metal centers in aliphatic contexts. The rule addresses combinations of structural features (thiol group context), meeting the complexity criterion. However, coverage is limited, supported by only one high yield and one low yield data point, which affects its overall reliability.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear and specific about modifiers with flexible polyether chains linked to a carboxyl group resulting in low yield. The physical-chemical insight is adequate, explaining the impact of flexibility and solvation on catalyst interaction. The rule combines several structural aspects, fulfilling the complexity criterion. It meets the coverage requirement with two supporting data points, although more data would strengthen its reliability.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear and provides sufficient detail to determine the yield outcome for modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxyl group. The physical-chemical reasoning is acceptable, highlighting potential side reactions and catalyst deactivation. The rule is complex, considering both functional groups and their positions relative to the carboxyl group. It meets the coverage criterion with two low yield examples, although additional data would enhance confidence in the rule.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 clearly identifies modifiers with N-acetylated amino acids or peptide bonds adjacent to the carboxyl group as resulting in low yield. The physical-chemical insight is appropriate, noting steric hindrance and blocked coordination sites. It satisfies the complexity criterion by addressing specific structural modifications. Coverage is sufficient with at least two supporting data points, bolstering the rule's validity.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 provides clear criteria by combining chain length, the presence of electron-rich aromatic rings, and their connection to the carboxyl group. It offers solid physical-chemical insight into how chain length affects π-interactions with the catalyst. The rule is complex and considers multiple structural features. It is well-supported by several data points across both high and low yields, fulfilling the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is clear in its focus on extended conjugated systems with coordinating oxygen atoms. The physical-chemical rationale is plausible, but the rule lacks sufficient coverage, with only one high yield example supporting it. This limitation affects the rule's reliability according to the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear and specific about modifiers with electron-donating halogenated methyl groups on aromatic rings resulting in high yield. The physical-chemical insight is acceptable, but the rule is only supported by one data point, which does not meet the coverage requirement, reducing its reliability.

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with free amino (-NH₂) and carboxyl (-COOH) groups, and side chains containing coordinating functional groups such as carboxylate or indole rings, result in a **high yield**. If the side chain is non-polar (e.g., phenyl group) or the amino group is modified (e.g., acetylated), the yield is **low** due to reduced coordination with the catalyst.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid)
    - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid)

    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyllysine)

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents at the para position (e.g., amino, bromomethyl groups) lead to a **high yield** by enhancing coordination with the metal center. Those with electron-withdrawing groups or non-coordinating substituents at the para position result in a **low yield** due to decreased electron density and hindered coordination.**

  **Examples:**

    - *4-aminobenzoic acid*
    - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid*
  
  - **Low Yield:** 
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid*
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium chain lengths (5–8 carbons) and without additional polar functional groups result in a **high yield**. Introducing polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) into longer aliphatic chains leads to a **low yield** due to increased steric hindrance and disrupted hydrophobic interactions.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - *Octanoic acid*
    - *5-aminopentanoic acid*
  
  - **Low Yield:** 
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*

    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group (e.g., pyridine carboxylic acids, pyrazole carboxylic acids) result in a **high yield** due to the nitrogen's ability to coordinate with the metal center. If the nitrogen heterocycle is connected through additional aromatic rings or linkers, the yield is **low** because of steric hindrance and reduced electronic interaction.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
    - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
  
  - **Low Yield:** 
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group (e.g., sugar acids) result in a **high yield** due to enhanced hydrogen bonding and multiple coordination sites. Modifiers with single hydroxyl groups or hydroxyl groups distant from the carboxyl group result in a **low yield** as they provide fewer coordination opportunities and may introduce steric hindrance.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
  
  - **Low Yield:** 
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing thiol (-SH) groups attached to short aliphatic chains result in a **high yield** due to the thiol's strong affinity for metal centers, enhancing coordination. Aromatic thiols lead to a **low yield** because the thiol group is less accessible for coordination and may cause catalyst deactivation.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*
  
  - **Low Yield:** 
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic systems connected via an aliphatic chain (four or more carbons) to a carboxyl group result in a **high yield**. The chain length allows for optimal positioning of the aromatic ring for π-interactions with the catalyst, enhancing binding. Shorter chains or absence of electron-donating substituents lead to a **low yield**.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid*
    - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid*
  
  - **Low Yield:** 
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with flexible polyether chains or multiple ether linkages (e.g., polyethylene glycol-like structures) linked to a terminal carboxyl group result in a **low yield**. Their increased flexibility and polarity reduce effective interactions with the catalyst's active site due to unfavorable solvation and entropic effects.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:** 
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing strong electron-withdrawing groups, such as perfluoroalkyl or trifluoroacetyl groups, result in a **low yield** due to decreased electron density on coordinating atoms, leading to poor interaction with the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:** 
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*
    - *4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers possessing aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid, especially on aromatic rings, result in a **low yield**. These groups can participate in side reactions or coordinate in a manner that deactivates the catalyst.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:** 
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*
    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*

---

    - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers where the coordinating groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, thiol) are sterically hindered or blocked by bulky substituents result in a **low yield** due to reduced accessibility to the metal center. Modifications that protect or mask these groups diminish coordination ability.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:** 
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyllysine)
    - *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are dicarboxylic acids with both carboxyl groups accessible and lacking additional coordinating functional groups result in a **low yield**. The absence of auxiliary coordinating sites reduces effective binding to the catalyst.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:** 
    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* (if considering the carboxyl and thiol groups as less effective due to aromaticity)

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing side chains that may chelate with the metal center through multiple coordination sites (e.g., adjacent amino and carboxyl groups) result in a **high yield** due to stable complex formation with the catalyst.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid)
    - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid)

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with side chains that can engage in π-stacking interactions or π-donor coordination with the metal center, such as indole or certain aromatic systems, result in a **high yield**. These interactions enhance the stability of the catalyst-modifier complex.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (Tryptophan)
    - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*

    - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine)

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers where potential coordinating amino groups are blocked or modified (e.g., acetylation) result in a **low yield**. Blocking reduces the number of available coordination sites, hindering effective interaction with the metal center.**

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: **Rule 1** is clear and allows us to determine the yield based on the presence of both a carboxylate and a free amino group on the α-carbon, along with side chains containing additional coordinating groups like carboxyl (-COOH). It provides strong physical-chemical insight into how multiple coordinating sites enhance interaction with the metal center. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures and is supported by multiple data points, achieving a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 2** clearly explains the effect of electron-donating groups at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids on the yield. It offers solid property insights by emphasizing increased electron density and additional coordination sites. The rule considers both functional groups and their positions, is supported by several examples, and strikes a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 3** lacks clarity due to contradictory examples. While it states that aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 3 to 8 carbons and a terminal amino (-NH₂) or thiol (-SH) group result in a high yield, the inclusion of **octanoic acid**, which lacks these groups, as a high-yield example is confusing. This inconsistency reduces clarity. The rule needs refinement to accurately reflect the impact of chain length and terminal functional groups on the yield.

- **Comment 4**: **Rule 4** is clear and considers modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group. It provides good physical-chemical insight into coordination with metal centers and considers structural combinations. The rule is well-supported by data points and achieves a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** effectively identifies modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl (-OH) groups near the carboxyl group as resulting in a high yield. It provides strong property insights into how several coordinating hydroxyl groups enhance metal interaction. The rule considers combinations of functional groups, is well-supported by data, and maintains a good balance.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** is clear and provides good insights into how strong electron-withdrawing groups like fluoroalkyl chains decrease electron density at coordination sites, resulting in a low yield. It is adequately supported by data points and maintains an acceptable balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** is clear in associating flexible ether linkages connected to the carboxyl group with a low yield due to increased conformational flexibility and steric hindrance. It offers relevant property insights and is supported by examples, achieving a good balance.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** clearly states that modifiers with aldehyde (-CHO) or ketone (>C=O) groups adjacent to the carboxyl group or on the aromatic ring result in a low yield. It provides property insights into potential side reactions and decreased coordination ability due to electron-withdrawing effects. The rule is supported by data points and maintains balance.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** effectively distinguishes between amino acids with aromatic side chains capable of additional coordination through heteroatoms (e.g., indole nitrogen in tryptophan) and those without. It is clear, provides good property insight, considers combinations of sub-structures, and is well-supported, achieving a good balance.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** is clear in indicating that blocking or modifying potential coordinating amino groups leads to a low yield. It offers property insight into how blocking reduces available coordination sites, hindering metal interaction. The rule is supported by data points and maintains an acceptable balance.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** distinguishes between thiol (-SH) groups on aliphatic chains (high yield) versus aromatic rings (low yield). It is clear, provides strong property insights into coordination efficiency, considers sub-structure combinations, and is supported by data, achieving a good balance.

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** is clear in associating modifiers with conjugated keto systems adjacent to aromatic rings directly connected to the carboxyl group with a high yield. It provides property insights into resonance stabilization enhancing metal coordination, is supported by data points, and maintains balance.

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13** clearly links aliphatic carboxylic acids with aromatic groups connected via an aliphatic chain of 4 to 5 carbons and possessing electron-donating groups on the aromatic ring to a high yield. It offers property insights, considers combinations of structural features, is well-supported by data, and achieves a good balance.

- **Comment 14**: **Rule 14** is clear about how steric bulk near coordination sites or bulky substituents hinder metal interaction, resulting in a low yield. It provides property insights, considers combinations of structural features, and is supported by the dataset, maintaining balance.

- **Comment 15**: **Rule 15** lacks some clarity due to inconsistent examples. It states that simple aromatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups result in a low yield but includes **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**, which is an aliphatic dicarboxylic acid with a ketone group, not an aromatic compound. This inconsistency reduces clarity and suggests the rule could be refined to improve accuracy and alignment between the description and examples.

  **Rule 1** is clear in identifying modifiers that are amino acids with free amino (-NH₂) and carboxyl (-COOH) groups, especially those with additional carboxyl groups in the side chain, as resulting in a **high yield**. The rule provides strong physicochemical insight by explaining that multiple coordination sites enhance interaction with the metal center, improving catalyst activity. It considers combinations of substructures (free amino and multiple carboxyl groups) rather than a single functional group, adding appropriate complexity. The rule is well-supported by multiple data points, such as *Aspartic acid*, *Glutamic acid*, and *5-Aminovaleric acid* for high yield, and *N-Acetyllysine* and *Aminooctanoic acid* for low yield.

- **Comment 2**:

  **Rule 2** clearly states that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents at the para position lead to a **high yield**, while those with electron-withdrawing groups or lacking such substituents result in a **low yield**. The rule offers solid physicochemical insight by linking electron-donating groups to increased electron density, enhancing coordination with the metal center. It incorporates complexity by considering both the aromatic ring and the nature of substituents. The rule is supported by examples like *4-aminobenzoic acid* and *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid* for high yield, and *4-formylbenzoic acid* and *4-methylbenzoic acid* for low yield.

- **Comment 3**:
