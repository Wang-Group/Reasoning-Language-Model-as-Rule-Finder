**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with free amino (-NH₂) and carboxyl (-COOH) groups directly attached to short aliphatic chains (up to five carbons) without bulky side chains or blocking groups result in a **high yield**. The presence of both free amino and carboxyl groups enhances coordination with the metal center, improving catalyst activity.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid)
    - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid)
    - *5-aminopentanoic acid* (5-Aminovaleric acid)

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine)
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyllysine)

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents such as amino (-NH₂) or hydroxyl (-OH) groups at the para position relative to the carboxyl group result in a **high yield**. This enhances electron density and provides additional coordination sites. Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., formyl (-CHO)) or non-coordinating substituents at the same position result in a **low yield** due to decreased coordination ability.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid*
    - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles (e.g., pyridine or pyrazole rings) directly attached to the carboxyl group result in a **high yield**. The nitrogen atom's lone pair enhances coordination with the metal center. If the nitrogen heterocycle is connected via an additional aromatic ring, increasing steric hindrance, the yield is **low** due to reduced coordination efficiency.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
    - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with thiol (-SH) groups attached to short aliphatic chains near the carboxyl group result in a **high yield**. The thiol group provides strong coordination with the metal center. Thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings lead to a **low yield** due to steric hindrance and decreased accessibility for coordination.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with moderate chain lengths (up to eight carbons) and without additional functional groups result in a **high yield**. The simplicity of the structure allows efficient interaction with the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *Octanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups near the carboxyl group, such as sugar acids or polyhydroxy acids, result in a **high yield**. The additional hydroxyl groups offer multiple coordination sites, enhancing interaction with the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
    - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., formyl (-CHO), fluoroalkyl groups) near the carboxyl group result in a **low yield**. These groups reduce electron density at coordination sites, hindering effective interaction with the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with bulky side chains, blocked amino groups (e.g., acylated amino groups), or multiple rings between functional groups and the carboxyl group result in a **low yield**. Steric hindrance reduces accessibility to the metal center, impeding effective coordination.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyllysine)
    - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine)
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with flexible polyether chains lacking strong coordinating groups result in a **low yield**. The increased conformational flexibility and absence of effective coordination sites reduce interaction with the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with conjugated ring systems containing multiple coordinating heteroatoms (e.g., oxygen, nitrogen) result in a **high yield**. The combination of conjugation and multiple coordination sites facilitates strong binding to the metal center, enhancing catalyst performance.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*
    - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (Tryptophan)

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl (-OH) or amino (-NH₂) groups distant from the carboxyl group (more than three carbons away) result in a **low yield** due to reduced coordination ability near the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with polycyclic or highly conjugated systems without effective coordinating groups result in a **low yield**. The lack of coordinating heteroatoms and increased steric bulk hinder interaction with the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid*
    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been developed by analyzing the provided dataset and considering the underlying physicochemical properties that influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. The rules focus on combinations of substructures and functional groups within the molecular modifiers, such as coordination sites, electron-donating or -withdrawing groups, steric effects, chain lengths, and the presence of heteroatoms.

Each rule predicts whether a modifier will result in a high or low yield based on its structural features. By combining multiple functional groups and considering their combined effects, these rules provide guidelines for predicting the performance of different modifiers in the reaction.

The set of 12 rules maintains a suitable balance between simple rules with higher coverage and more complex rules with lower coverage, effectively covering a broad range of the dataset. This approach facilitates better selection and design of modifiers to optimize and control the yield of the target reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------
