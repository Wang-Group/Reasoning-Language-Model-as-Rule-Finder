**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: *Aliphatic carboxylic acids with a chain length of five carbons or fewer that contain an amino group result in high yield.*  
  **Explanation:** Short-chain amino acids and their derivatives enhance catalyst interaction due to their increased solubility and ability to coordinate with metal centers.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **High Yield:** 5-aminopentanoic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid  
    - **Low Yield:** 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 2**: *Aromatic carboxylic acids with an amino group at the para position lead to high yield, whereas those with hydroxyl or thiol groups at the para position lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation:** Para-amino groups can donate electron density and facilitate better coordination with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Hydroxyl and thiol groups may lead to catalyst poisoning or unwanted side reactions.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **High Yield:** 4-aminobenzoic acid  
    - **Low Yield:** 4-hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives, 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., formyl, trifluoromethyl) at the para position result in low yield.*  
  **Explanation:** Electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density on the aromatic ring, weakening interactions with the catalyst and reducing its effectiveness.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **Low Yield:** 4-formylbenzoic acid, 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers with long aliphatic chains (more than six carbons) containing hydroxyl or amino groups result in low yield.*

    - **Low Yield:** (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers containing a pyridine ring directly attached to the carboxylic acid (especially at the 3-position) give high yield. If the pyridine ring is connected via another aromatic ring, the yield is low.*  
  **Explanation:** Pyridine nitrogen can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity. Direct attachment ensures effective interaction, whereas additional rings may hinder this interaction.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **High Yield:** Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid  
    - **Low Yield:** 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 7**: *Aliphatic carboxylic acids with hydrophilic substituents (e.g., hydroxyl, thiol) near the carboxyl group and short chain lengths result in high yield.*  
  **Explanation:** Hydrophilic groups increase solubility and can participate in hydrogen bonding or coordination, improving catalyst interaction.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **High Yield:** 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid, 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid  
    - **Low Yield:** Compounds with these groups far from the carboxyl group

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers with methoxyethoxy chains or polyethylene glycol-like structures result in low yield.*  
  **Explanation:** These chains can increase the flexibility and steric bulk, potentially leading to unfavorable interactions with the catalyst or active site blocking.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **Low Yield:** 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield.*  
  **Explanation:** Perfluorinated groups are highly hydrophobic and electron-withdrawing, which can reduce interaction with the catalyst and decrease solubility in reaction solvents.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **Low Yield:** 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers that are N-acetylated amino acids result in low yield.*  
  **Explanation:** N-acetylation blocks the free amino group, which may be essential for coordination with the catalyst, thus reducing reactivity.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **Low Yield:** (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers with aldehyde groups on the aromatic ring result in low yield.*  
  **Explanation:** Aldehyde groups are reactive and can undergo side reactions or deactivate the catalyst through strong coordination or oxidation.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **Low Yield:** 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers containing a thiol group on an aliphatic chain yield high results, whereas those with a thiol group on an aromatic ring yield low results.*

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers that are keto acids (containing both ketone and carboxylic acid functional groups) result in low yield.*  
  **Explanation:** The ketone group can participate in side reactions or coordinate strongly with the catalyst, inhibiting the desired reaction pathway.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **Low Yield:** 4-oxoheptanedioic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid (Exception: this compound yields high results due to the pyridine ring aiding in coordination)

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers with bulky aromatic substituents on the aliphatic chain result in high yield if they also contain electron-donating groups.*  
  **Explanation:** Bulky groups can enhance π-interactions and electron-donating substituents increase electron density, potentially improving catalyst performance.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **High Yield:** 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid  
    - **Low Yield:** Modifiers without electron-donating groups on bulky substituents

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Improve Rule 5 for Clarity by Refining the Exception**  
  **Suggestion:** Modify Rule 5 to enhance clarity regarding the exception of tryptophan. Instead of stating an exception, incorporate the underlying reason into the rule. For example:

  *Modifiers that are amino acids with carboxylic acid side chains (e.g., aspartic and glutamic acid) result in high yield due to their ability to coordinate with the catalyst. Amino acids with aromatic side chains generally result in low yield unless the aromatic side chain contains a heterocycle capable of metal coordination, such as the indole ring in tryptophan, which leads to high yield.*

- **Advice 2**: **Enhance Coverage of Rules with Limited Data Support**  
  **Suggestion:** Reevaluate rules supported by a single data point (Rules 9, 10, 13, 14, 15). Consider combining them with related rules to improve coverage and robustness. For instance:

  - Merge Rule 9 with Rule 3 since both involve electron-withdrawing groups leading to low yield.
  - Integrate Rule 13 with Rule 7, focusing on hydrophilic substituents near the carboxyl group that enhance yield.

- **Advice 3**: **Simplify Rules Containing Exceptions to Improve Clarity**  
  **Suggestion:** For rules that include exceptions (e.g., Rule 14), refine them to eliminate exceptions by specifying the conditions more precisely. For example:

  *Modifiers that are keto acids containing both ketone and carboxylic acid groups typically result in low yield due to potential side reactions or strong catalyst coordination that inhibits the desired pathway. However, if the keto acid also contains a coordinating heterocyclic ring (e.g., a pyridine ring as in 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid), the yield may remain high due to enhanced catalyst interaction.*

- **Advice 4**: **Increase Data Support for Underrepresented Rules**  
  **Suggestion:** Collect additional experimental data for rules with limited support (Rules 9, 10, 13, 14, 15) to validate their reliability. If acquiring more data is impractical, consider de-emphasizing or removing these rules to focus on those with stronger empirical backing.

- **Advice 5**: **Provide Specificity in Substituent Position Impact**  
  **Suggestion:** Clarify the effect of substituent positions in rules where it influences yield (e.g., Rules 2 and 12). Specify how different positions of functional groups affect the outcome. For instance, modify Rule 2 to state:

  *Aromatic carboxylic acids with an amino group at the para position lead to high yield, while those with hydroxyl or thiol groups at the para position lead to low yield. Note that substituents at ortho or meta positions may have varying effects and should be evaluated separately.*

- **Advice 6**: **Consolidate Overlapping Rules to Streamline the Rule Set**  
  **Suggestion:** Identify and combine rules with overlapping concepts to reduce redundancy and simplify application. For example:

  - Combine Rules 3 and 9 into a single rule addressing electron-withdrawing groups (both aromatic and aliphatic) leading to low yield due to decreased electron density and reduced catalyst interaction.

- **Advice 7**: **Incorporate Structural Representations in Examples**  
  **Suggestion:** Include SMILES strings or molecular diagrams for each example in the rules to aid in the visual interpretation and facilitate the application of rules to SMILES-based analyses.

- **Advice 8**: **Emphasize Functional Groups That Enhance Coordination**  
  **Suggestion:** Across relevant rules, highlight the significance of functional groups capable of metal coordination (e.g., amino, pyridine nitrogen, thiol groups on aliphatic chains). Reinforce how these groups contribute to high yield by improving catalyst interaction.

- **Advice 9**: **Standardize Terminology and Improve Language Consistency**  
  **Suggestion:** Review and edit the rules to ensure consistent use of chemical terminology and clear language. For example, consistently refer to "electron-donating groups" and "electron-withdrawing groups," and uniformly describe chain lengths (e.g., "carbon chain length of five or fewer").

- **Advice 10**: **Integrate Additional Property Insights into Existing Rules**  
  **Suggestion:** Incorporate property insights from the data and discussions into the rules to enhance their explanatory power. For example, acknowledge the role of steric hindrance, solubility, and electronic effects more explicitly within the rules. This can improve the user's understanding of the underlying principles guiding the rules.

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows for easy determination of whether a modifier will result in a high or low yield based on chain length (2 to 5 carbons) and the presence of an amino group. The property insight is strong, explaining that the amino group enhances coordination with the metal center while the short chain reduces steric hindrance, promoting effective interaction with the catalyst. The rule considers combinations of substructures (short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino group), satisfying the complexity criterion. It is supported by multiple data points with both high yield (e.g., 5-aminopentanoic acid) and low yield examples (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid), ensuring good coverage.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear in specifying that aromatic carboxylic acids with a para amino group lead to high yield, while those with electron-withdrawing groups at the same position result in low yield.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 specifies that modifiers with methoxy groups on aromatic rings attached to aliphatic chains result in high yield, especially when combined with electron-donating substituents. The rule is moderately complex but remains clear. The property insight is acceptable, highlighting how electron-donating groups increase electron density, enhancing coordination with the catalyst. Complexity involves combinations of structural features. Coverage is limited to a high yield example (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid); additional data points would strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 indicates that modifiers that are keto acids with a ketone group adjacent to the carboxylic acid result in low yield. The rule is clear and direct. The property insight suggests that the ketone group may participate in side reactions or bind too strongly to the catalyst. Complexity is minimal, focusing on a specific structural feature. Coverage includes a low yield example (e.g., 4-oxoheptanedioic acid) and a high yield exception (e.g., 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid), which is explained. Additional examples could enhance coverage.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 states that N-acetylated amino acids result in low yield. The rule is clear. The property insight is logical, noting that N-acetylation blocks free amino groups essential for coordination. Complexity is minimal.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 specifies that modifiers with hydrophobic aromatic side chains on aliphatic backbones result in low yield unless they contain electron-donating groups. The rule is clear but complex due to the conditional exception. The property insight is sound, explaining that hydrophobic aromatic groups cause steric hindrance, but electron-donating substituents mitigate this effect. Complexity is high, considering combinations of substructures and effects of substituents. Coverage is good, with both low yield examples (e.g., 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid) and a high yield exception (e.g., 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid).

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify the Rules with Quantifiable Descriptors**
  
  Rephrase the rules to focus on quantifiable molecular descriptors that can be directly extracted from SMILES strings. Utilize features such as the number of specific functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, carboxyl), chain length (exact carbon counts), and presence of aromatic or heterocyclic rings. This makes it easier to generate a numeric feature matrix for computational models.

- **Advice 2**: **Use Standard Cheminformatics Descriptors**

  Incorporate standardized descriptors like molecular weight, logP (octanol-water partition coefficient), topological polar surface area (TPSA), hydrogen bond donors (HBD), and hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA). These properties can be calculated from SMILES and provide valuable numerical data for model building.

- **Advice 3**: **Define Clear Structural Criteria Using SMARTS Patterns**

  Employ SMARTS (SMILES Arbitrary Target Specification) patterns to define structural features in the rules. This allows for precise identification of substructures within molecules, facilitating automated extraction of features from SMILES strings.

- **Advice 4**: **Convert Qualitative Descriptions into Numerical Thresholds**

  Replace vague terms like "short-chain" or "long-chain" with specific numerical thresholds. For example, define short-chain aliphatic acids as those with 2–5 carbons and long-chain acids as those with more than 6 carbons. This removes ambiguity and aids in computational processing.

- **Advice 5**: **Consolidate Similar Rules to Reduce Complexity**

  Merge overlapping rules to streamline the rule set. For instance, combine rules related to amino groups enhancing coordination (Rules 1, 2, and 5) into a single rule describing the positive impact of amino groups on yield, specifying exact positions and contexts.

- **Advice 6**: **Eliminate Exceptions or Address Them Separately**

  Exceptions complicate computational models. Either revise rules to account for exceptions through additional descriptors or handle them in a separate category. For example, address tryptophan separately if it doesn't fit the general trend due to its unique indole structure.

- **Advice 7**: **Create Binary Feature Flags for Easy Computation**

  Define binary (0 or 1) features for the presence or absence of specific functional groups or structural motifs. This simplification facilitates the creation of a feature matrix for machine learning models.

- **Advice 8**: **Develop a Decision Tree Based on Yes/No Questions**

  Formulate the rules as a series of yes/no questions regarding molecular features (e.g., "Does the molecule contain a primary amino group attached to a short aliphatic chain?"). This approach simplifies rule application and aids in programming logical conditions.

- **Advice 9**: **Ensure Mutual Exclusivity and Completeness**

  Revise the rules so that they are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. Each modifier should fit into one clear category without overlap, ensuring accurate classification during data analysis.

- **Advice 10**: **Include Both Positive and Negative Examples Explicitly**

  For each rule, provide examples of both high-yield and low-yield modifiers. This clarity helps in understanding the rule boundaries and improves the training of predictive models.

- **Advice 11**: **Incorporate Electronic and Steric Parameters Quantitatively**

  Quantify electronic effects (e.g., Hammett sigma values) and steric hindrance (e.g., Taft steric parameters) where applicable. By assigning numerical values to these factors, models can better correlate structural features with yields.

- **Advice 12**: **Use Software Tools for Descriptor Calculation**

  Utilize cheminformatics software (e.g., RDKit, ChemAxon) to automatically calculate molecular descriptors from SMILES. Integrate these tools into the workflow to streamline feature extraction and rule application.

- **Advice 13**: **Provide Clear Definitions and Justifications in Rules**

  Ensure each rule includes precise definitions and the chemical rationale behind it. This transparency aids in understanding and allows for better validation and refinement of the rules.

- **Advice 14**: **Update the Dataset with Descriptors Aligned to Revised Rules**

  Re-analyze the existing dataset to extract features based on the new, simplified rules. This alignment ensures consistency between the rules and the data used to validate them.

- **Advice 15**: **Iteratively Refine Rules Based on Data Analysis**

  Use statistical methods and machine learning to identify patterns in the data that may not be captured by the current rules. Iteratively refine the rules to improve their predictive power based on empirical evidence.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: *Short-chain aliphatic amino acids (2 to 5 carbon backbone) containing both amino and carboxyl groups result in high yield.*  
  **Explanation:** The presence of amino and carboxylate groups allows for effective coordination with the metal center of the catalyst. Short-chain lengths minimize steric hindrance, facilitating interaction with the catalyst's active sites.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **High Yield:** (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid), 5-aminopentanoic acid (5-aminovaleric acid)  
    - **Low Yield:** (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (N-acetyllysine), 7-aminoheptanoic acid

- **Rule 2**: *Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, methoxy) at the para position lead to high yield; those with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., formyl, trifluoromethyl) result in low yield.*  
  **Explanation:** Electron-donating groups increase electron density on the aromatic ring, enhancing coordination with the metal catalyst. Electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density, weakening interaction with the catalyst.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **High Yield:** 4-aminobenzoic acid, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid  
    - **Low Yield:** 4-formylbenzoic acid, 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers containing nitrogenous heterocycles (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole) directly attached to the carboxylic acid group result in high yield; if the nitrogenous ring is indirectly attached, the yield is low.*  
  **Explanation:** Nitrogen atoms in heterocyclic rings can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity. Direct attachment ensures effective orbital overlap and coordination. Indirect attachment via another ring introduces steric hindrance and reduces coordination efficiency.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **High Yield:** Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (nicotinic acid), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid  
    - **Low Yield:** 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 4**: *Long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (6 or more carbons) without polar functional groups result in high yield; introducing polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) onto the chain decreases the yield.*  
  **Explanation:** Non-polar long chains enhance hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst, promoting better alignment and access to active sites. Polar groups can introduce steric hindrance or form undesired interactions, impeding effective catalysis.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **High Yield:** Octanoic acid  
    - **Low Yield:** 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group result in high yield due to enhanced chelation; lack of such groups leads to lower yield.*  
  **Explanation:** Multiple hydroxyl groups increase the ligand's ability to chelate the metal center, forming stable complexes that enhance catalytic activity.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **High Yield:** (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid)  
    - **Low Yield:** Modifiers without adjacent hydroxyl groups, such as simple aliphatic acids

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers with thiol groups on short aliphatic chains yield high results; thiol groups on aromatic rings lead to low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.*  
  **Explanation:** Aliphatic thiols can coordinate with the metal center without causing significant steric hindrance. Aromatic thiols may bind too strongly or irreversibly to the catalyst, deactivating it.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **High Yield:** 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid  
    - **Low Yield:** 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers containing bulky, electron-rich aromatic systems directly attached to the carboxylic acid enhance yield when they have electron-donating substituents; absence of such substituents results in low yield.*  
  **Explanation:** Electron-rich aromatics with donating groups increase electron density for coordination and may interact via π-stacking with the catalyst. Bulky groups without electron-donating substituents may cause steric hindrance without beneficial electronic effects.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **High Yield:** (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan), 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid  
    - **Low Yield:** (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine)

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers with flexible ether chains resembling polyethylene glycol (PEG) and terminal carboxyl groups result in low yield.*  
  **Explanation:** Flexible ether chains increase conformational entropy and steric bulk, reducing effective interactions with the catalyst's active sites. They may also interfere with substrate access.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **Low Yield:** 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to their strong electron-withdrawing nature and extreme hydrophobicity.*  
  **Explanation:** Perfluorinated groups withdraw electron density, weakening coordination with the metal center. Their hydrophobicity can lead to phase separation or poor solubility, reducing effective catalyst interaction.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **Low Yield:** 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers containing aldehyde groups on aromatic rings result in low yield due to potential side reactions and catalyst deactivation.*  
  **Explanation:** Aldehyde groups are reactive and can form Schiff bases with amines or coordinate strongly with metals, potentially deactivating the catalyst by blocking active sites.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **Low Yield:** 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are N-acetylated amino acids or peptides result in low yield due to blocked coordination sites.*  
  **Explanation:** N-acetylation caps the amino group, preventing it from coordinating with the metal center. This reduces the number of binding interactions, decreasing catalyst-modifier affinity.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **Low Yield:** (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers with ketone groups adjacent to the carboxyl group result in low yield due to strong chelation that can inhibit catalytic activity.*  
  **Explanation:** The adjacent ketone and carboxyl groups can chelate the metal center tightly, potentially deactivating the catalyst by occupying active sites and preventing substrate access.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **Low Yield:** 4-oxoheptanedioic acid  
    - **High Yield Exception:** 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid (aromatic stabilization offsets chelation effects)

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., trifluoroacetyl, nitro) on aliphatic or aromatic chains result in low yield due to decreased electron density and poor coordination ability.*  
  **Explanation:** Electron-withdrawing groups reduce the electron density available for coordination with the metal catalyst, weakening the interaction and lowering catalytic efficiency.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **Low Yield:** 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers with hydrophobic aromatic side chains on aliphatic backbones result in low yield unless they contain electron-donating substituents or extended chains to reduce steric hindrance.*  
  **Explanation:** Hydrophobic aromatic groups can cause steric hindrance and reduce solubility. Electron-donating groups or longer aliphatic chains can mitigate these effects by enhancing coordination or reducing steric clash.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **Low Yield:** (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine), 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid  
    - **High Yield:** 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid (longer chain and hydroxyl group improve interaction)

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers containing halomethyl groups (e.g., bromomethyl) on aromatic rings result in high yield due to increased reactivity and potential for additional interactions with the catalyst.*  
  **Explanation:** Halomethyl groups can participate in electrophilic interactions or form weak bonds with the metal center, enhancing catalyst-modifier binding and activity.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **High Yield:** 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: *Short-chain aliphatic amino acids (2 to 5 carbon backbone) containing both amino and carboxyl groups result in high yield.*  
  **Explanation:** The presence of amino and carboxylate groups allows for effective coordination with the metal center of the catalyst. Short-chain lengths minimize steric hindrance, facilitating interaction with the catalyst's active sites.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **High Yield:** (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid), 5-aminopentanoic acid (5-aminovaleric acid)  
    - **Low Yield:** (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (N-acetyllysine), 7-aminoheptanoic acid

- **Rule 2**: *Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, methoxy) at the para position lead to high yield; those with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., formyl, trifluoromethyl) result in low yield.*  
  **Explanation:** Electron-donating groups increase electron density on the aromatic ring, enhancing coordination with the metal catalyst. Electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density, weakening interaction with the catalyst.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **High Yield:** 4-aminobenzoic acid, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid  
    - **Low Yield:** 4-formylbenzoic acid, 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers containing nitrogenous heterocycles (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole) directly attached to the carboxylic acid group result in high yield; if the nitrogenous ring is indirectly attached, the yield is low.*  
  **Explanation:** Nitrogen atoms in heterocyclic rings can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity. Direct attachment ensures effective orbital overlap and coordination. Indirect attachment via another ring introduces steric hindrance and reduces coordination efficiency.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **High Yield:** Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (nicotinic acid), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid  
    - **Low Yield:** 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 4**: *Long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (6 or more carbons) without polar functional groups result in high yield; introducing polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) onto the chain decreases the yield.*  
  **Explanation:** Non-polar long chains enhance hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst, promoting better alignment and access to active sites. Polar groups can introduce steric hindrance or form undesired interactions, impeding effective catalysis.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **High Yield:** Octanoic acid  
    - **Low Yield:** 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group result in high yield due to enhanced chelation; lack of such groups leads to lower yield.*  
  **Explanation:** Multiple hydroxyl groups increase the ligand's ability to chelate the metal center, forming stable complexes that enhance catalytic activity.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **High Yield:** (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid)  
    - **Low Yield:** Modifiers without adjacent hydroxyl groups, such as simple aliphatic acids

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers with thiol groups on short aliphatic chains yield high results; thiol groups on aromatic rings lead to low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.*  
  **Explanation:** Aliphatic thiols can coordinate with the metal center without causing significant steric hindrance. Aromatic thiols may bind too strongly or irreversibly to the catalyst, deactivating it.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **High Yield:** 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid  
    - **Low Yield:** 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers containing bulky, electron-rich aromatic systems directly attached to the carboxylic acid enhance yield when they have electron-donating substituents; absence of such substituents results in low yield.*  
  **Explanation:** Electron-rich aromatics with donating groups increase electron density for coordination and may interact via π-stacking with the catalyst. Bulky groups without electron-donating substituents may cause steric hindrance without beneficial electronic effects.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **High Yield:** (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan), 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid  
    - **Low Yield:** (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine)

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers with flexible ether chains resembling polyethylene glycol (PEG) and terminal carboxyl groups result in low yield.*  
  **Explanation:** Flexible ether chains increase conformational entropy and steric bulk, reducing effective interactions with the catalyst's active sites. They may also interfere with substrate access.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **Low Yield:** 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to their strong electron-withdrawing nature and extreme hydrophobicity.*  
  **Explanation:** Perfluorinated groups withdraw electron density, weakening coordination with the metal center. Their hydrophobicity can lead to phase separation or poor solubility, reducing effective catalyst interaction.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **Low Yield:** 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers containing aldehyde groups on aromatic rings result in low yield due to potential side reactions and catalyst deactivation.*  
  **Explanation:** Aldehyde groups are reactive and can form Schiff bases with amines or coordinate strongly with metals, potentially deactivating the catalyst by blocking active sites.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **Low Yield:** 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are N-acetylated amino acids or peptides result in low yield due to blocked coordination sites.*  
  **Explanation:** N-acetylation caps the amino group, preventing it from coordinating with the metal center. This reduces the number of binding interactions, decreasing catalyst-modifier affinity.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **Low Yield:** (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers with ketone groups adjacent to the carboxyl group result in low yield due to strong chelation that can inhibit catalytic activity.*  
  **Explanation:** The adjacent ketone and carboxyl groups can chelate the metal center tightly, potentially deactivating the catalyst by occupying active sites and preventing substrate access.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **Low Yield:** 4-oxoheptanedioic acid  
    - **High Yield Exception:** 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid (aromatic stabilization offsets chelation effects)

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., trifluoroacetyl, nitro) on aliphatic or aromatic chains result in low yield due to decreased electron density and poor coordination ability.*  
  **Explanation:** Electron-withdrawing groups reduce the electron density available for coordination with the metal catalyst, weakening the interaction and lowering catalytic efficiency.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **Low Yield:** 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers with hydrophobic aromatic side chains on aliphatic backbones result in low yield unless they contain electron-donating substituents or extended chains to reduce steric hindrance.*  
  **Explanation:** Hydrophobic aromatic groups can cause steric hindrance and reduce solubility. Electron-donating groups or longer aliphatic chains can mitigate these effects by enhancing coordination or reducing steric clash.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **Low Yield:** (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine), 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid  
    - **High Yield:** 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid (longer chain and hydroxyl group improve interaction)

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers containing halomethyl groups (e.g., bromomethyl) on aromatic rings result in high yield due to increased reactivity and potential for additional interactions with the catalyst.*  
  **Explanation:** Halomethyl groups can participate in electrophilic interactions or form weak bonds with the metal center, enhancing catalyst-modifier binding and activity.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **High Yield:** 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid

Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: **Correct the SMARTS pattern for the nitro group used in Rule 13.**  
  The current pattern `'nitro_group': '[NX3](=O)=O'` does not accurately match the nitro group in aromatic compounds. The nitro group is best represented by the charged form `[$([N+](=O)[O-])]`. Update the SMARTS pattern to `'[N+](=O)[O-]'` to correctly identify nitro groups in molecules like nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Refine the SMARTS patterns for electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups at the para position in Rule 2.**  
  The current patterns `'edg_para'` and `'ewg_para'` are overly specific and may not match the intended structures. Consider using more general patterns that accurately represent para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups. For example:  
  - Electron-donating groups at the para position: `'[cH]1ccc([cH])cc1C(=O)O'` with a substituent pattern for EDGs at the para position, such as amino (`'-[NH2]'`), hydroxyl (`'-OH'`), or methoxy (`'-OCH3'`).  
  - Electron-withdrawing groups at the para position: similar patterns with substituents like nitro (`'-NO2'`), formyl (`'-CHO'`), or trifluoromethyl (`'-CF3'`).

- **Suggestion 3**: **Improve the SMARTS pattern for nitrogenous heterocycles directly attached to the carboxylic acid group in Rule 3.**  
  The current pattern `'nitrogen_heterocycle_acid': '[n,c][n,c][C](=O)[OX2H1]'` may not accurately capture nitrogenous heterocycles like pyridine or pyrazole directly attached to a carboxyl group. Update the pattern to `'[n]1cccc1C(=O)O'` to match heteroaromatic rings containing nitrogen directly bonded to a carboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Adjust the SMARTS patterns for nitrogenous heterocycles indirectly attached in Rule 3.1.**  
  The pattern `'nitrogen_heterocycle': '[n,c][n,c]'` is too broad and may incorrectly match many structures. To specifically identify nitrogenous heterocycles indirectly attached to a carboxylic acid via a benzene ring, use a pattern like `'c1cc[nH]c1'` connected to a benzene carboxylic acid. Combine this with the benzene carboxylic acid pattern to ensure correct matching.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Ensure exclusion patterns are correctly implemented in Rule 4 to identify polar functional groups.**  
  The exclusion patterns `'hydroxyl_group'` and `'amino_group'` need accurate SMARTS definitions. The current patterns may not capture all polar groups. Update them to:  
  - Hydroxyl group: `'[OX2H]'`  
  - Amino group: `'[NX3;H2,H1;!$(NC=O)]'`  
  Ensure that these patterns are correctly used to exclude molecules with polar groups from matching Rule 4.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Modify the carbon counting method in Rules 1 and 4 to accurately reflect backbone length.**  
  Counting all carbons in the molecule (`num_carbons = sum(1 for atom in mol.GetAtoms() if atom.GetAtomicNum() == 6)`) may not accurately represent the backbone length. Implement a method to identify the longest carbon chain or specifically count carbons in the backbone excluding side chains or functional groups.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Refine the SMARTS patterns for hydrophobic aromatic side chains and extended chains in Rule 14.**  
  The current patterns may not accurately identify molecules described in the rule. Update the patterns to:  
  - Hydrophobic aromatic side chain: `'[CX4][CX4][c]'` matching an aliphatic chain connected to an aromatic ring.  
  - Electron-donating substituents: include patterns for `'-OH'`, `'-NH2'`, or `'-OCH3'` on the aromatic ring.  
  - Extended chain: define a pattern for longer aliphatic chains, such as `'CCCCCCC'`.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Verify the SMARTS pattern for halomethyl groups on aromatic rings in Rule 15.**  
  The pattern `'halomethyl_aromatic': 'c[CH2][Br,I,F,Cl]'` may not correctly match halomethyl-substituted aromatics. Adjust the pattern to `'c[CH2][Cl,Br,F,I]'`, ensuring the halomethyl group is directly attached to the aromatic ring.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Add more comprehensive SMARTS patterns to cover various functional groups mentioned in the rules.**  
  Some patterns may be too narrow and miss certain structures. Expand patterns to include tautomers, resonance forms, and different substitutions. For example, include charged forms, tautomeric forms, and different attachment points for functional groups.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Test the SMARTS patterns against known examples and counterexamples from the rules.**  
  Validate each SMARTS pattern by applying it to the examples provided in the rules to ensure correct matching. Adjust patterns based on whether they correctly identify high-yield and low-yield modifiers as per the examples.

- **Suggestion 11**: **Improve error handling and logging in the code.**  
  In the molecule processing loop, add logging for molecules that cannot be parsed or when exceptions occur. This will help identify issues with specific SMILES strings and SMARTS patterns.

- **Suggestion 12**: **Consider using RDKit's built-in functions for more accurate functional group detection.**  
  RDKit provides predefined functional group definitions and functions like `Chem.Fragments` which can be used to detect certain functional groups more reliably.

**Detailed Analysis**

1. **Train Support**

   - **Observation:** The current train support is **4.08%**, which is significantly lower than the reference mean support of **17.56%**.
   - **Implication:** Lower support indicates that the current rules apply to a smaller portion of the dataset. This suggests that the rules may be too specific, capturing fewer instances.

2. **Train Confidence**

   - **Observation:** The current train confidence is **61.36%**, slightly higher than the reference mean confidence of **58.74%**.
   - **Implication:** An increased confidence means that, when the rule conditions are met, there is a higher probability that the rule predictions are correct. This reflects an improvement in the precision of the rules.

3. **Train Lift**

   - **Observation:** The current train lift is **1.2282**, which exceeds the reference mean lift of **1.1304**.
   - **Implication:** A lift greater than 1 indicates that the rule is better at predicting the outcome than random chance. The increased lift suggests that the current rules are more effective at identifying associations between conditions and predictions.

4. **Train Leverage**

   - **Observation:** The current train leverage is **0.0086**, slightly lower than the reference mean leverage of **0.0124**.
   - **Implication:** Positive leverage indicates a genuine association between rule conditions and predictions. However, the reduced leverage may be a result of decreased support, meaning fewer instances contribute to the strength of this association.

---

**Interpretation of the Metrics**

- **Trade-off Between Support and Confidence/Lift**

  The current iteration shows a **trade-off** where improving confidence and lift has come at the expense of support:

  - **Higher Confidence and Lift:** Indicates better predictive accuracy when the rules apply.
  - **Lower Support:** Suggests that the rules are applicable to a narrower subset of data, potentially missing broader patterns.

- **Potential Overfitting**

  The decrease in support with increased confidence and lift may signify that the rules are becoming **overfitted** to the training data:

  - Overfitting occurs when rules capture noise or specific patterns that don't generalize well.
  - This can lead to reduced performance on unseen data.

---

**Assessment of Iterations and Local Minimum**

- **Local Minimum Indication**

  - The marginal improvements in confidence and lift, coupled with decreased support, may indicate that the optimization process has reached a **local minimum**.
  - Further iterations focusing on the current rule refinement strategy may yield diminishing returns or exacerbate overfitting.

- **Sufficiency of Iterations**

  - Given the patterns observed, it may be appropriate to **reassess** the current approach rather than continue with more iterations of the same kind.
  - Introducing new strategies might be necessary to achieve better overall performance.

---

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

1. **Increase Rule Generality**

   - **Broaden Conditions:**
     - Relax overly stringent conditions in the rules to encompass more instances, thereby increasing support.
     - For example, adjust specific functional group positions or chain lengths to include a wider range.

   - **Example Adjustment:**
     - *Rule 1:* Instead of "Short-chain aliphatic amino acids (2 to 5 carbon backbone)," consider "Aliphatic amino acids with up to 6 carbon backbones."

2. **Balance Complexity and Interpretability**

   - **Simplify Rules:**
     - Reduce the complexity of rules by focusing on key functional groups that have the most significant impact.
     - Avoid including too many specific conditions that limit the applicability of the rules.

   - **Merge Similar Rules:**
     - Combine rules that have overlapping conditions or predictions to improve support and simplify the rule set.

3. **Validate Against Test Data**

   - **Assess Generalization:**
     - Apply the rules to a separate test dataset to evaluate their performance outside the training data.
     - Monitor if confidence and lift remain high without significant drops in support.

   - **Prevent Overfitting:**
     - Use cross-validation techniques to ensure that the rules generalize well.

4. **Incorporate Additional Relevant Features**

   - **Feature Expansion:**
     - Introduce new descriptors or properties that might capture broader patterns.
     - Consider physicochemical properties like hydrophobicity indices, pKa values, or molecular weight.

5. **Refine Feature Selection**

   - **Eliminate Redundant Features:**
     - Remove features that contribute little to predictive power but add complexity.
     - Use statistical methods to identify and keep the most impactful features.

6. **Adjust Focus on Metrics**

   - **Balance Metrics:**
     - While confidence and lift are important, ensure that support and leverage are not neglected.
     - Aim for a balance where all metrics indicate good performance.

7. **Iterative Feedback and Expert Input**

   - **Consult Domain Experts:**
     - Collaborate with chemists or domain experts to verify if the rules make practical sense.
     - Adjust rules based on expert feedback to improve real-world applicability.

   - **Iterative Refinement:**
     - Use insights from expert feedback to guide further iterations, focusing on both statistical metrics and domain relevance.

8. **Implement Regularization Techniques**

   - **Control Model Complexity:**
     - Use techniques that penalize overly complex rules, encouraging simpler, more generalizable rules.

9. **Monitor Leverage and its Impact**

   - **Target Positive Leverage Increases:**
     - Strive to not only maintain but increase leverage, ensuring that rules provide meaningful associations beyond chance.

---

**Conclusion**

The current rules demonstrate improved predictive accuracy when they apply, as evidenced by higher confidence and lift. However, the significant reduction in support indicates that these rules are applicable to a smaller portion of the dataset, potentially limiting their usefulness.

To enhance the performance of the rules, it is recommended to:

- **Adjust the specificity** of the rules to cover a broader range of data without compromising too much on confidence and lift.
- **Incorporate new features** and simplify rule conditions to improve generalizability.
- **Balance all performance metrics**, ensuring that improvements in one area do not lead to unacceptable declines in others.
- **Include expert insights** to align the rules with domain knowledge, which can improve both the scientific validity and the practical applicability of the rules.

By implementing these recommendations, the rules can be made more robust, generalizable, and ultimately more effective in addressing the catalytic problem at hand.

**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

*1. Overall Effectiveness of the Current Rules:*

The current model achieved an accuracy of **0.714** on the validation set, which is slightly lower than the previous accuracies reported (ranging from **0.75** to **0.76**). This suggests that the current set of rules may not be as effective as the previous iterations in predicting the catalytic performance accurately.

*2. Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting:*

Given that the validation accuracy is consistently around **0.714** across the folds and the test accuracies in previous iterations were either **0.75** or **0.625**, it appears that the model is neither overfitting nor underfitting excessively. However, the reduction in accuracy compared to previous iterations may indicate a slight underfitting, where the current rules are not capturing all the relevant features necessary for optimal predictions.

*3. Analysis of Discrepancies Using SHAP Values:*

We observe that there are **nine molecules** where the predicted loading is low, but the experimental value is high. There are no instances where the predicted loading is high and the experimental value is low. This asymmetry suggests a systematic underestimation in certain cases.

For these misclassified molecules, we analyze the SHAP values to identify which rules contribute most negatively to the prediction of high loading:

- **Rule 4** consistently shows high negative SHAP values across the misclassified molecules.
- **Rule 12** also exhibits significant negative SHAP values in specific misclassified cases.

8. **C(CCS)C(=O)O**
   - **Predicted:** Low
   - **Experimental:** High
   - **SHAP Values:**
     - Rule 1: -0.0796
     - **Rule 4: -0.1355**
     - Rule 12: +0.0485

9. **C1=CN=CC=C1CCCC(=O)O**
   - **Predicted:** Low
   - **Experimental:** High
   - **SHAP Values:**
     - Rule 1: -0.0470
     - **Rule 4: -0.0845**
     - Rule 12: +0.0790

**Observations:**

- **Rule 4** has high negative SHAP values in **seven** out of the nine misclassified cases.
- **Rule 12** shows significant negative SHAP values in the first two misclassified molecules.
  
This indicates that **Rule 4** is primarily responsible for the underestimation in most cases, while **Rule 12** contributes to underestimation in specific molecules.

*4. Interpretation of Accuracy Metrics:*

The slight decrease in accuracy compared to previous iterations suggests that the current rules may need refinement. The consistent misclassification of certain molecules points toward opportunities to improve the rules to enhance predictive performance.

*5. Insights from SHAP Analysis:*

The SHAP analysis highlights that **Rule 4** and **Rule 12** are contributing negatively to the prediction of high loading in molecules that experimentally show high catalytic activity. This suggests that these rules may be too restrictive or not adequately capturing the nuances of the molecular structures that lead to high yield.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

*1. **Refine Rule 4**:*

**Current Rule 4:**
*Modifiers with long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (6 or more carbons) without polar functional groups result in high yield; introducing polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) onto the chain decreases the yield.*

**Issues Identified:**

- The rule assumes that introducing polar groups onto long aliphatic chains decreases yield, which may not universally hold true.
- Several misclassified molecules have polar groups on long chains but exhibit high experimental yields.

**Suggested Refinements:**

- **Modify the Rule to Account for Beneficial Polar Groups:**

  Revise Rule 4 to consider that certain polar functional groups may enhance interaction with the catalyst, especially if they facilitate better coordination or solubility.

  **Revised Rule 4:**
  *Long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (6 or more carbons) generally result in high yield. Polar functional groups, such as hydroxyl or amino groups, may not necessarily decrease yield and can enhance catalytic performance if they are positioned to facilitate favorable interactions with the catalyst.*

- **Include Examples of Exceptions:**

  **High Yield with Polar Groups:**

  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  These examples show that the presence of polar groups does not always decrease the yield and may, in some cases, be beneficial.

*2. **Adjust Rule 12**:*

**Current Rule 12:**
*Modifiers with ketone groups adjacent to the carboxyl group result in low yield due to strong chelation that can inhibit catalytic activity.*

**Issues Identified:**

- The rule may be too general, not accounting for the influence of the overall molecular context.
- In the misclassified molecules, ketone groups adjacent to carboxyl groups do not necessarily lead to low yield.

**Suggested Refinements:**

- **Introduce Exceptions Based on Molecular Structure:**

  Recognize that the impact of ketone groups adjacent to carboxyl groups may be mitigated by other structural features that promote high yield.

  **Revised Rule 12:**
  *Modifiers with ketone groups adjacent to the carboxyl group often result in low yield due to potential over-chelation of the catalyst. However, if the molecule contains additional functional groups or structural features that enhance catalytic interaction (e.g., electron-donating groups or aromatic rings), the negative effect may be reduced, and high yield can be achieved.*

- **Include Examples of High Yield Despite Ketone Groups:**

  **High Yield:**

  - **4-oxopentanoic acid**
  - **COC1=C(C=CC=C1)C(=O)CCC(=O)O**

  These molecules demonstrate that ketone groups adjacent to carboxyl groups do not universally result in low yield.

*3. **Enhance Generalization to Address Underfitting:*

- **Incorporate Additional Molecular Descriptors:**

  Consider expanding the rules to include more detailed descriptors that capture electronic effects, steric factors, and hydrogen bonding potential.

- **Utilize Machine Learning Models:**

  Complement the rule-based approach with machine learning models trained on molecular features to identify patterns not captured by the current rules.

*4. **Iteratively Refine Rules Using SHAP Insights:**

- **Systematically Update Rules:**

  Use the SHAP analysis to identify patterns where certain rules consistently contribute negatively to correct predictions. Adjust these rules to reduce misclassifications.

- **Monitor Performance Metrics:**

  After refining the rules, re-evaluate the model's performance to ensure that changes lead to improved accuracy.

**Conclusion**

By carefully analyzing the misclassified molecules and the associated SHAP values, we identified that **Rule 4** and **Rule 12** are contributing to underestimating the catalytic performance of certain modifiers. Refining these rules to be more inclusive of molecular structures that lead to high yield will likely improve the model's predictive accuracy. Additionally, by enhancing the generalization of the rules and incorporating insights from the SHAP analysis, we can address potential underfitting issues and better capture the complexity of the catalytic system.

**Summary of Discussions and Suggestions for Optimizing the Current Rules**

The analysis of the current rules governing the catalytic action in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction has highlighted several areas for improvement:

1. **Performance Metrics Indicate Specificity Over Generality**
   - **Low Train Support (4.08%)**: The rules apply to a small fraction of the dataset, suggesting they may be too narrowly defined.
   - **High Train Confidence (61.36%) and Lift (1.2282)**: When the rules do apply, they predict outcomes accurately, indicating precision but at the cost of generality.
   - **Potential Overfitting**: The high confidence and lift coupled with low support may indicate that the rules are overfitted to specific instances and may not generalize well to new data.

2. **Issues Identified via SHAP Analysis**
   - **Rule 4 and Rule 12 Contribute Negatively**: These rules are often responsible for misclassifications where the experimental yield is high but predicted as low.
   - **Rule 4**: The assumption that polar groups on long-chain aliphatic acids decrease yield is not universally valid.
   - **Rule 12**: The generalization that ketone groups adjacent to carboxyl groups result in low yield overlooks cases where additional structural features mitigate negative effects.

3. **SMARTS Patterns Need Refinement**
   - **Inaccurate or Overly Specific Patterns**: Existing SMARTS patterns may fail to match target molecules correctly or are too restrictive.
   - **Examples**:
     - **Nitro Groups**: Current pattern does not accurately detect nitro groups in aromatic compounds.
     - **Electron-Donating/Withdrawing Groups**: Patterns may not capture all relevant substituents at the para position.
     - **Nitrogenous Heterocycles**: Patterns may not correctly identify heterocycles directly attached to carboxylic acids.

4. **Recommendations for Rule Optimization**
   - **Refine SMARTS Patterns**:
     - **Correct Functional Group Representations**: Update patterns to accurately reflect functional groups (e.g., nitro group as `[N+](=O)[O-]`).
     - **Broaden Scope Where Appropriate**: Adjust overly specific patterns to include a wider range of relevant molecules.
     - **Test Patterns Against Known Examples**: Validate patterns using molecules with known outcomes to ensure accuracy.

   - **Adjust Problematic Rules**:
     - **Rule 4**:
       - **Revise to Include Beneficial Polar Groups**: Recognize that polar groups can enhance yield in some contexts.
       - **Include Exceptions and Conditions**: Specify when polar groups might not decrease yield based on chain length or position.
     - **Rule 12**:
       - **Incorporate Molecular Context**: Acknowledge that other structural features can mitigate the potential negative effects of adjacent ketone groups.
       - **Add Examples of High Yield Despite Ketone Groups**: Illustrate exceptions to the rule to refine its applicability.

   - **Increase Rule Generality**:
     - **Simplify Rule Conditions**: Focus on key functional groups and structural features without overly restrictive criteria.
     - **Merge Similar Rules**: Combine overlapping rules to improve support and reduce complexity.

   - **Enhance Feature Selection**:
     - **Introduce Additional Descriptors**: Incorporate physicochemical properties like hydrophobicity, pKa, and molecular weight.
     - **Eliminate Redundant Features**: Remove unnecessary complexity by focusing on impactful features.

   - **Iterative Validation and Refinement**:
     - **Use Cross-Validation Techniques**: Ensure rules generalize well to unseen data.
     - **Incorporate Domain Expertise**: Collaborate with chemists to verify the scientific validity of rules.
     - **Monitor Performance Metrics**: Balance support, confidence, lift, and leverage to prevent overfitting.

5. **Implement Regularization and Error Handling**
   - **Control Model Complexity**: Apply regularization techniques to penalize overly complex rules.
   - **Improve Error Logging**: Enhance error handling in code to identify issues with molecules or patterns.

6. **Leverage RDKit's Built-in Functions**
   - **Utilize Predefined Functional Groups**: Use RDKit's `Chem.Fragments` for reliable functional group detection.
   - **Enhance Pattern Matching**: Employ RDKit functions to improve the accuracy of SMARTS pattern matches.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

There is a clear potential for further optimization of the current rules without causing overfitting. By refining SMARTS patterns, adjusting rules to be more inclusive, and incorporating additional molecular descriptors, the rules can better capture the underlying chemical principles affecting yield. This approach aims to increase the train support while maintaining high confidence and lift, enhancing both the applicability and accuracy of the model.

    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: *Short-chain aliphatic amino acids (2 to 5 carbon backbone) containing both amino and carboxyl groups result in high yield.*  
  **Explanation:** The presence of amino and carboxylate groups allows for effective coordination with the metal center of the catalyst. Short-chain lengths minimize steric hindrance, facilitating interaction with the catalyst's active sites.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **High Yield:** (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid), 5-aminopentanoic acid (5-aminovaleric acid)  
    - **Low Yield:** (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (N-acetyllysine), 7-aminoheptanoic acid

- **Rule 2**: *Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, methoxy) at the para position lead to high yield; those with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., formyl, trifluoromethyl) result in low yield.*  
  **Explanation:** Electron-donating groups increase electron density on the aromatic ring, enhancing coordination with the metal catalyst. Electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density, weakening interaction with the catalyst.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **High Yield:** 4-aminobenzoic acid, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid  
    - **Low Yield:** 4-formylbenzoic acid, 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers containing nitrogenous heterocycles (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole) directly attached to the carboxylic acid group result in high yield; if the nitrogenous ring is indirectly attached, the yield is low.*  
  **Explanation:** Nitrogen atoms in heterocyclic rings can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity. Direct attachment ensures effective orbital overlap and coordination. Indirect attachment via another ring introduces steric hindrance and reduces coordination efficiency.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **High Yield:** Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (nicotinic acid), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid  
    - **Low Yield:** 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 4**: *Long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (6 or more carbons) without polar functional groups result in high yield; introducing polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) onto the chain decreases the yield.*  
  **Explanation:** Non-polar long chains enhance hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst, promoting better alignment and access to active sites. Polar groups can introduce steric hindrance or form undesired interactions, impeding effective catalysis.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **High Yield:** Octanoic acid  
    - **Low Yield:** 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group result in high yield due to enhanced chelation; lack of such groups leads to lower yield.*  
  **Explanation:** Multiple hydroxyl groups increase the ligand's ability to chelate the metal center, forming stable complexes that enhance catalytic activity.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **High Yield:** (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid)  
    - **Low Yield:** Modifiers without adjacent hydroxyl groups, such as simple aliphatic acids

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers with thiol groups on short aliphatic chains yield high results; thiol groups on aromatic rings lead to low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.*  
  **Explanation:** Aliphatic thiols can coordinate with the metal center without causing significant steric hindrance. Aromatic thiols may bind too strongly or irreversibly to the catalyst, deactivating it.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **High Yield:** 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid  
    - **Low Yield:** 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers containing bulky, electron-rich aromatic systems directly attached to the carboxylic acid enhance yield when they have electron-donating substituents; absence of such substituents results in low yield.*  
  **Explanation:** Electron-rich aromatics with donating groups increase electron density for coordination and may interact via π-stacking with the catalyst. Bulky groups without electron-donating substituents may cause steric hindrance without beneficial electronic effects.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **High Yield:** (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan), 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid  
    - **Low Yield:** (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine)

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers with flexible ether chains resembling polyethylene glycol (PEG) and terminal carboxyl groups result in low yield.*  
  **Explanation:** Flexible ether chains increase conformational entropy and steric bulk, reducing effective interactions with the catalyst's active sites. They may also interfere with substrate access.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **Low Yield:** 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to their strong electron-withdrawing nature and extreme hydrophobicity.*  
  **Explanation:** Perfluorinated groups withdraw electron density, weakening coordination with the metal center. Their hydrophobicity can lead to phase separation or poor solubility, reducing effective catalyst interaction.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **Low Yield:** 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers containing aldehyde groups on aromatic rings result in low yield due to potential side reactions and catalyst deactivation.*  
  **Explanation:** Aldehyde groups are reactive and can form Schiff bases with amines or coordinate strongly with metals, potentially deactivating the catalyst by blocking active sites.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **Low Yield:** 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are N-acetylated amino acids or peptides result in low yield due to blocked coordination sites.*  
  **Explanation:** N-acetylation caps the amino group, preventing it from coordinating with the metal center. This reduces the number of binding interactions, decreasing catalyst-modifier affinity.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **Low Yield:** (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers with ketone groups adjacent to the carboxyl group result in low yield due to strong chelation that can inhibit catalytic activity.*  
  **Explanation:** The adjacent ketone and carboxyl groups can chelate the metal center tightly, potentially deactivating the catalyst by occupying active sites and preventing substrate access.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **Low Yield:** 4-oxoheptanedioic acid  
    - **High Yield Exception:** 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid (aromatic stabilization offsets chelation effects)

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., trifluoroacetyl, nitro) on aliphatic or aromatic chains result in low yield due to decreased electron density and poor coordination ability.*  
  **Explanation:** Electron-withdrawing groups reduce the electron density available for coordination with the metal catalyst, weakening the interaction and lowering catalytic efficiency.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **Low Yield:** 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers with hydrophobic aromatic side chains on aliphatic backbones result in low yield unless they contain electron-donating substituents or extended chains to reduce steric hindrance.*  
  **Explanation:** Hydrophobic aromatic groups can cause steric hindrance and reduce solubility. Electron-donating groups or longer aliphatic chains can mitigate these effects by enhancing coordination or reducing steric clash.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **Low Yield:** (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine), 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid  
    - **High Yield:** 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid (longer chain and hydroxyl group improve interaction)

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers containing halomethyl groups (e.g., bromomethyl) on aromatic rings result in high yield due to increased reactivity and potential for additional interactions with the catalyst.*  
  **Explanation:** Halomethyl groups can participate in electrophilic interactions or form weak bonds with the metal center, enhancing catalyst-modifier binding and activity.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **High Yield:** 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers containing bulky, electron-rich aromatic systems directly attached to the carboxylic acid enhance yield when they have electron-donating substituents and extended aliphatic chains; absence of such substituents or shorter chains result in low yield.*  
  **Explanation:** Electron-rich aromatics with donating groups increase electron density for coordination and may interact via π-stacking with the catalyst. Extended chains reduce steric hindrance by distancing bulky groups from the active site.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **High Yield:** 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid  
    - **Low Yield:** 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers with flexible ether chains resembling polyethylene glycol (PEG) and terminal carboxyl groups result in low yield.*  
  **Explanation:** Flexible ether chains increase conformational entropy and steric bulk, reducing effective interactions with the catalyst's active sites. They may also interfere with substrate access.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **Low Yield:** 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to their strong electron-withdrawing nature and extreme hydrophobicity.*  
  **Explanation:** Perfluorinated groups withdraw electron density, weakening coordination with the metal center. Their hydrophobicity can lead to phase separation or poor solubility, reducing effective catalyst interaction.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **Low Yield:** 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers containing aldehyde groups on aromatic rings result in low yield due to potential side reactions and catalyst deactivation.*  
  **Explanation:** Aldehyde groups are reactive and can form Schiff bases with amines or coordinate strongly with metals, potentially deactivating the catalyst by blocking active sites.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **Low Yield:** 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are N-acetylated amino acids or peptides result in low yield due to blocked coordination sites.*  
  **Explanation:** N-acetylation caps the amino group, preventing it from coordinating with the metal center. This reduces the number of binding interactions, decreasing catalyst-modifier affinity.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **Low Yield:** (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers that are dipeptides or contain peptide bonds result in low yield due to increased steric hindrance and decreased coordination with the metal center.*  
  **Explanation:** The presence of peptide bonds increases molecular size and flexibility, reducing effective interaction with the catalyst. This steric bulk can hinder access to the active site of the catalyst, lowering yield.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **Low Yield:** 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., trifluoroacetyl, nitro) on aliphatic or aromatic chains result in low yield due to decreased electron density and poor coordination ability.*  
  **Explanation:** Electron-withdrawing groups reduce the electron density available for coordination with the metal catalyst, weakening the interaction and lowering catalytic efficiency.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **Low Yield:** 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers with hydrophobic aromatic side chains on aliphatic backbones result in low yield unless they contain electron-donating substituents or extended chains to reduce steric hindrance.*  
  **Explanation:** Hydrophobic aromatic groups can cause steric hindrance and reduce solubility. Electron-donating groups or longer aliphatic chains can mitigate these effects by enhancing coordination or reducing steric clash.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **Low Yield:** (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine), 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid  
    - **High Yield:** 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid (longer chain and hydroxyl group improve interaction)

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers containing halomethyl groups (e.g., bromomethyl) on aromatic rings result in high yield due to increased reactivity and potential for additional interactions with the catalyst.*  
  **Explanation:** Halomethyl groups can participate in electrophilic interactions or form weak bonds with the metal center, enhancing catalyst-modifier binding and activity. The presence of a halogen increases the electrophilicity of the methyl group, potentially facilitating coordination.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **High Yield:** 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**:

  **Rule 1** is clear and specifies that short-chain aliphatic amino acids (2 to 5 carbon backbone) with both amino and carboxyl groups result in high yield. The property insight about effective chelation and minimized steric hindrance is well-explained. The rule considers a combination of functional groups and chain length, adding appropriate complexity. It is supported by multiple data points (e.g., entries 0, 2, 3, which all have high yields), satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 2**:

  **Rule 2** clearly differentiates between electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups on aromatic carboxylic acids and their impact on yield. The property insight regarding electron density and coordination with the metal catalyst is sound. The rule adds complexity by considering both the type and position of substituents. It is well-supported by data points such as entries 4 and 7 (high yield with electron-donating groups) and entries 20 and 28 (low yield with electron-withdrawing groups), ensuring good coverage.

- **Comment 3**:

  **Rule 3** explicitly states the effect of nitrogenous heterocycles directly versus indirectly attached to the carboxylic acid group on yield. The property insight about the coordination ability of nitrogen atoms in heterocycles enhances understanding. The rule introduces complexity through structural attachment variations. Supported by data points like entry 21 (high yield with direct attachment) and entry 12 (low yield with indirect attachment), the coverage is satisfactory.

- **Comment 4**:

  **Rule 4** is clear in describing how long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups result in high yield, while introducing polar groups decreases yield. The explanation about hydrophobic interactions and steric effects is insightful. The rule's complexity arises from combining chain length and functional group presence. Data points such as entry 5 (high yield with octanoic acid) and entries 29 and 31 (low yield with polar groups) provide solid coverage.

- **Comment 5**:

  **Rule 5** specifies that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group result in high yield due to enhanced chelation. The property insight is strong. The rule adds complexity by focusing on a specific structural arrangement. However, coverage is limited, with entry 9 (high yield with gluconic acid) as the main supporting data point and a lack of low-yield examples without adjacent hydroxyl groups.

- **Comment 6**:

  **Rule 6** effectively differentiates between thiol groups on aliphatic chains versus aromatic rings. The property insight about catalyst poisoning is valuable. Complexity is added through the placement of the thiol group. Data points such as entry 18 (high yield with aliphatic thiol) and entry 10 (low yield with aromatic thiol) support the rule well.

- **Comment 7**:

  **Rule 7** discusses the influence of bulky, electron-rich aromatic systems with electron-donating substituents and extended aliphatic chains on yield. While the rule provides deep property insight, its clarity could be improved due to its complexity. It is supported by entries like 7 (high yield) and 30 (low yield), but additional data points would strengthen the coverage.

- **Comment 8**:

  **Rule 8** clearly states that modifiers with flexible ether chains resembling PEG and terminal carboxyl groups lead to low yield. The property insight about conformational entropy and steric bulk is appropriate. Complexity is added by focusing on chain flexibility and functional groups. Coverage is moderate, with entries 11 and 32 (both low yield) supporting the rule.

- **Comment 9**:

  **Rule 9** indicates that modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to electron-withdrawing effects and extreme hydrophobicity. The rule is clear with solid property insight. Complexity comes from specific functional groups. Coverage is limited to entry 14 (low yield), suggesting more data points are needed for stronger support.

- **Comment 10**:

  **Rule 10** specifies that modifiers containing aldehyde groups on aromatic rings result in low yield. The property insight about potential side reactions and catalyst deactivation is relevant. The rule introduces complexity by focusing on reactive functional groups. Coverage is adequate with entries 19 and 20 (both low yield) supporting the rule.

- **Comment 11**:

  **Rule 11** explains that N-acetylated amino acids or peptides lead to low yield due to blocked coordination sites. The property insight is clear, and the rule adds complexity by considering functional group modifications. Coverage is limited, with entry 33 (low yield) illustrating the rule, indicating a need for more supporting data.

- **Comment 12**:

  **Rule 12** states that dipeptides or modifiers containing peptide bonds result in low yield. The property insight regarding steric hindrance and coordination is sound. Complexity arises from considering larger molecular structures. Coverage is limited to entry 23 (low yield), suggesting additional examples would enhance the rule's support.

- **Comment 13**:

  **Rule 13** addresses modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups resulting in low yield. The rule is clear with appropriate property insight. Complexity is present through the consideration of electronic effects. Coverage is somewhat limited, primarily supported by entry 28 (low yield).

- **Comment 14**:

  **Rule 14** discusses the effect of hydrophobic aromatic side chains on yield and how electron-donating substituents or extended chains can mitigate negative effects. While the property insight is valuable, the rule's clarity could be improved due to its conditional nature. Coverage includes entries 13 and 30 (low yield) versus entry 7 (high yield), providing moderate support.

- **Comment 15**:

  **Rule 15** states that modifiers containing halomethyl groups on aromatic rings result in high yield. The property insight about increased reactivity is sound. Complexity is added through specific functional groups. However, coverage is limited to entry 1 (high yield), indicating a need for more data points to fully validate the rule.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: *Short-chain aliphatic amino acids (2 to 5 carbon backbone) containing both amino and carboxyl groups result in high yield.*  
  **Explanation:** The presence of both amino and carboxyl groups enables effective chelation with the metal center of the catalyst. Short-chain lengths minimize steric hindrance, facilitating interaction with the catalyst's active sites.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **High Yield:** (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid), 5-aminopentanoic acid (5-aminovaleric acid)  
    - **Low Yield:** (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (N-acetyllysine), 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 2**: *Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) at the para position lead to high yield; those with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., formyl, trifluoromethyl) result in low yield.*  
  **Explanation:** Electron-donating groups increase electron density on the aromatic ring, enhancing coordination with the metal catalyst. Electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density, weakening interaction with the catalyst.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **High Yield:** 4-aminobenzoic acid, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid  
    - **Low Yield:** 4-formylbenzoic acid, 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers containing nitrogenous heterocycles (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole) directly attached to the carboxylic acid group result in high yield; if the nitrogenous ring is indirectly attached, the yield is low.*  
  **Explanation:** Nitrogen atoms in heterocyclic rings can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity through additional binding sites. Direct attachment ensures effective orbital overlap and coordination. Indirect attachment via another ring introduces steric hindrance and reduces coordination efficiency.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **High Yield:** Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (nicotinic acid), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid  
    - **Low Yield:** 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 4**: *Long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (6 or more carbons) without additional polar functional groups result in high yield; introducing polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) onto the chain decreases the yield.*  
  **Explanation:** Non-polar long chains enhance hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst, promoting better alignment and access to active sites. Polar groups can introduce steric hindrance or form undesired interactions, impeding effective catalysis.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **High Yield:** Octanoic acid  
    - **Low Yield:** 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group result in high yield due to enhanced chelation; lack of such groups leads to lower yield.*  
  **Explanation:** Multiple hydroxyl groups increase the ligand's ability to chelate the metal center, forming stable complexes that enhance catalytic activity.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **High Yield:** (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid)  
    - **Low Yield:** Carboxylic acids without adjacent hydroxyl groups

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers with thiol groups on short aliphatic chains yield high results; thiol groups on aromatic rings lead to low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.*  
  **Explanation:** Aliphatic thiols can coordinate with the metal center without causing significant steric hindrance. Aromatic thiols may bind too strongly or irreversibly to the catalyst, deactivating it.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **High Yield:** 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid  
    - **Low Yield:** 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers containing bulky, electron-rich aromatic systems directly attached to the carboxylic acid enhance yield when they have electron-donating substituents and extended aliphatic chains; absence of such substituents or shorter chains result in low yield.*  
  **Explanation:** Electron-rich aromatics with donating groups increase electron density for coordination and may interact via π-stacking with the catalyst. Extended chains reduce steric hindrance by distancing bulky groups from the active site.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **High Yield:** 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid  
    - **Low Yield:** 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers with flexible ether chains resembling polyethylene glycol (PEG) and terminal carboxyl groups result in low yield.*  
  **Explanation:** Flexible ether chains increase conformational entropy and steric bulk, reducing effective interactions with the catalyst's active sites. They may also interfere with substrate access.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **Low Yield:** 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to their strong electron-withdrawing nature and extreme hydrophobicity.*  
  **Explanation:** Perfluorinated groups withdraw electron density, weakening coordination with the metal center. Their hydrophobicity can lead to phase separation or poor solubility, reducing effective catalyst interaction.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **Low Yield:** 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers containing aldehyde groups on aromatic rings result in low yield due to potential side reactions and catalyst deactivation.*  
  **Explanation:** Aldehyde groups are reactive and can form Schiff bases with amines or coordinate strongly with metals, potentially deactivating the catalyst by blocking active sites.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **Low Yield:** 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are N-acetylated amino acids or peptides result in low yield due to blocked coordination sites.*  
  **Explanation:** N-acetylation caps the amino group, preventing it from coordinating with the metal center. This reduces the number of binding interactions, decreasing catalyst-modifier affinity.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **Low Yield:** (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers that are dipeptides or contain peptide bonds result in low yield due to increased steric hindrance and decreased coordination with the metal center.*  
  **Explanation:** The presence of peptide bonds increases molecular size and flexibility, reducing effective interaction with the catalyst. This steric bulk can hinder access to the active site of the catalyst, lowering yield.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **Low Yield:** 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., trifluoroacetyl, nitro) on aliphatic or aromatic chains result in low yield due to decreased electron density and poor coordination ability.*  
  **Explanation:** Electron-withdrawing groups reduce the electron density available for coordination with the metal catalyst, weakening the interaction and lowering catalytic efficiency.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **Low Yield:** 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers with hydrophobic aromatic side chains on aliphatic backbones result in low yield unless they contain electron-donating substituents or extended chains to reduce steric hindrance.*  
  **Explanation:** Hydrophobic aromatic groups can cause steric hindrance and reduce solubility. Electron-donating groups or longer aliphatic chains can mitigate these effects by enhancing coordination or reducing steric clash.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **Low Yield:** (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine), 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid  
    - **High Yield:** 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid (longer chain and hydroxyl group improve interaction)

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers containing halomethyl groups (e.g., bromomethyl) on aromatic rings result in high yield due to increased reactivity and potential for additional interactions with the catalyst.*  
  **Explanation:** Halomethyl groups can participate in electrophilic interactions or form weak bonds with the metal center, enhancing catalyst-modifier binding and activity. The presence of a halogen increases the electrophilicity of the methyl group, potentially facilitating coordination.  
  **Examples:**  
    - **High Yield:** 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- **Suggestion 1**: **Correct the use of curly braces in SMARTS patterns involving ranges.**  
  In the code, SMARTS patterns that include quantifiers with curly braces (e.g., `{2,5}`) are not formatted correctly due to improper use of Python string formatting. Curly braces in strings used with the `format` method need to be escaped by doubling them. For example, in Rule 1, the backbone pattern should be corrected as follows:
  ```python
  backbone = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[C;D3][C;D2]{{{},{}}}'.format(rule['count_range'][0]-1, rule['count_range'][1]-1))
  ```
  This ensures that the curly braces are correctly interpreted in the SMARTS pattern.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Ensure all SMARTS patterns are valid and accurately represent the natural language rules.**  
  Review each SMARTS pattern for syntax errors and correctness. For instance, in Rule 2, the SMARTS pattern for electron-donating groups at the para position may not be specific enough or might miss some cases. Consider refining the patterns, and test them individually using tools like RDKit or SMARTS viewers.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Add explicit hydrogen counts where necessary in SMARTS patterns.**  
  In some patterns, the absence of explicit hydrogen counts may lead to incorrect matches. For example, specifying `[NX3H2]` for primary amines ensures that only nitrogen atoms with two hydrogens are matched. Ensure consistency in hydrogen counts across all patterns to prevent mismatches.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Include aromaticity in SMARTS patterns where appropriate.**  
  For rules involving aromatic systems (e.g., Rules 2, 3, 7, 10, 13, 15), ensure that the SMARTS patterns include aromatic atom specifications (lowercase symbols) and aromatic bond indicators (`:`). This will improve the accuracy of matches with aromatic compounds.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Test SMARTS patterns individually against example molecules to verify their effectiveness.**  
  Before integrating the patterns into the code, test them against known positive and negative examples to confirm that they match or exclude the correct structures.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Implement more comprehensive substructure searches by considering recursive SMARTS or multiple patterns.**  
  Some rules may require more complex patterns to capture all relevant features. Consider using recursive SMARTS or combining multiple patterns with logical operators to improve the specificity and sensitivity of the matches.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Review and update the exclusion patterns to prevent unintended exclusions.**  
  In some cases, exclusion patterns might be too broad or too narrow. Ensure that they only exclude structures that are genuinely contrary to the rule, and do not inadvertently exclude valid matches.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Add debugging statements to log which patterns are matched or not matched for each molecule.**  
  This will help identify where the matching process may be failing and facilitate troubleshooting. For example, print the rule number, molecule index, and whether each pattern matches.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Handle cases where molecules cannot be parsed by providing informative feedback.**  
  Instead of silently adding a row of zeros, inform the user which molecules could not be parsed and why. This will help in checking the input data for errors.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Consider using molecule fragments or descriptors if SMARTS patterns are insufficient.**  
  For some complex rules, it might be more effective to use computed molecular descriptors or fragment-based methods to capture the desired features.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: Simplify and standardize the rules by focusing on structural features that can be directly extracted from SMILES notation. Define features such as the presence of specific functional groups, ring systems, or chain lengths that can be quantified numerically.

- **Advice 2**: Use quantifiable descriptors for modifiers, such as the exact number of carbon atoms in the backbone, counts of specific functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino, carboxyl, thiol), and the presence of heteroatoms. This facilitates the creation of a numerical feature matrix.

- **Advice 3**: Consolidate overlapping or similar rules to reduce complexity. For example, combine rules about electron-donating groups on aromatic rings into a single rule with specified positions and substituents.

- **Advice 4**: Define rules based on computable electronic properties. Assign numerical values to electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups using established parameters like Hammett sigma constants, which can be associated with substituents directly from SMILES.

- **Advice 5**: Avoid subjective terms like "bulky," "flexible," or "steric hindrance" unless they can be quantified. Instead, use measurable parameters such as molecular weight, topological polar surface area, or specific steric descriptors.

- **Advice 6**: Incorporate cheminformatics tools (e.g., RDKit, Open Babel) to extract molecular descriptors and features from the SMILES strings automatically. Utilize these tools to identify functional groups, count ring systems, and calculate molecular properties.

- **Advice 7**: Specify clear numerical thresholds in the rules. For instance, instead of "short-chain aliphatic amino acids (2 to 5 carbon backbone)," specify "aliphatic amino acids with a carbon backbone length of 2 to 5 carbons."

- **Advice 8**: For rules involving chain length, functional group position, or substitution patterns, define these parameters explicitly to allow for algorithmic parsing. Use absolute positions or relative positioning from functional groups identifiable in SMILES.

- **Advice 9**: Reframe rules involving electronic effects into ones based on the presence of specific substituents or functional groups. For example, define electron-donating groups as specific substituents like "-OH," "-NH₂," "-OCH₃," which can be detected in SMILES.

- **Advice 10**: Create a comprehensive feature list that includes binary (presence/absence), count-based (number of specific groups), and continuous (calculated properties like LogP, pKa) features. This feature set should cover all aspects mentioned in the rules and be derivable from SMILES.

- **Advice 11**: Eliminate rules that cannot be directly mapped to computational features. Focus on rules that can be converted into algorithms for automatic feature extraction, ensuring consistency and reproducibility.

- **Advice 12**: Use machine learning-friendly features by transforming complex chemical information into numerical values. For example, encode aromaticity, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and molecular flexibility using quantifiable descriptors.

- **Advice 13**: Provide examples for each rule with their corresponding SMILES annotations, highlighting the features that satisfy the rule. This will aid in verifying that the features can be extracted from SMILES.

- **Advice 14**: Prioritize rules based on their impact on yield as observed in the dataset. Consider weighting the features according to their significance in predicting high or low yield, which can be determined through statistical analysis.

- **Advice 15**: Ensure that each rule is mutually exclusive or clearly defines how it interacts with other rules. This prevents ambiguity when a modifier could fall under multiple rules, simplifying the feature extraction process.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are short-chain aliphatic amino acids (2 to 5 carbons) with free amino and carboxyl groups result in high yield; extending the chain beyond 5 carbons or N-acetylation lowers the yield.*

  **Explanation:** Short-chain amino acids can effectively coordinate with the metal center through their amino and carboxyl groups, enhancing catalyst activity. Longer chains introduce steric hindrance, and N-acetylation blocks the amino group, reducing coordination.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid), 5-aminopentanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (N-acetyllysine), 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 2**: *Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., amino, hydroxy) at the para position lead to high yield; those with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., formyl, nitro) at any position result in low yield.*

  **Explanation:** Electron-donating groups increase electron density on the aromatic ring, enhancing coordination with the metal catalyst. Electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density, weakening interaction and possibly deactivating the catalyst through strong binding.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 4-aminobenzoic acid, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxylic acid group result in high yield; if the heterocycle is substituted or indirectly attached, the yield is low.*

  **Explanation:** Nitrogen heterocycles like pyridine and pyrazole can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity. Substituents or indirect attachment introduce steric hindrance and reduce coordination efficiency.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (nicotinic acid), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (heterocycle indirectly attached)

- **Rule 4**: *Long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (6 or more carbons) without additional polar functional groups result in high yield; introducing polar groups (e.g., hydroxy, amino) onto the chain decreases the yield.*

  **Explanation:** Nonpolar long chains enhance hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst, promoting better alignment with active sites. Polar groups introduce steric hindrance or form competing interactions, impeding effective catalysis.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** Octanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group result in high yield; lack of such hydroxyl groups leads to lower yield.*

  **Explanation:** Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance chelation with the metal center, forming stable complexes that boost catalytic activity.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid)
    - **Low Yield:** Carboxylic acids without adjacent hydroxyl groups (e.g., octanoic acid lacks adjacent hydroxyls but is still high yield due to Rule 4)

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers containing thiol groups on short aliphatic chains lead to high yield; thiol groups on aromatic rings result in low yield due to possible catalyst poisoning.*

  **Explanation:** Aliphatic thiols can coordinate with the metal center without significant steric hindrance. Aromatic thiols may bind irreversibly to the catalyst, deactivating it.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers with flexible ether chains (e.g., polyethylene glycol-like structures) and terminal carboxyl groups result in low yield due to steric hindrance and decreased effective concentration at the catalyst surface.*

  **Explanation:** Flexible ether chains increase molecular volume and conformational entropy, reducing the likelihood of effective interaction with the catalyst's active sites.

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects and extreme hydrophobicity, which hinder interaction with the catalyst.*

  **Explanation:** Perfluorinated groups withdraw electron density, weakening coordination with the metal center. Their hydrophobicity can cause phase separation or poor solubility.

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers containing aldehyde groups, especially on aromatic rings, result in low yield due to potential side reactions and catalyst deactivation.*

  **Explanation:** Aldehyde groups are reactive and may form Schiff bases or coordinate strongly with metals, blocking catalyst active sites.

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers that are N-acetylated amino acids or contain peptide bonds result in low yield due to steric hindrance and blocked coordination sites.*

  **Explanation:** N-acetylation caps the amino group, and peptide bonds increase molecular size, both reducing coordination with the metal center.

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic systems directly attached to the carboxylic acid and extended aliphatic chains enhance yield; shorter chains or lack of electron-donating substituents result in low yield.*

  **Explanation:** Electron-rich aromatics with donating groups (e.g., methoxy, hydroxy) increase electron density for coordination and improve solubility. Extended chains reduce steric hindrance near the active site.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers containing halomethyl groups on aromatic rings result in high yield due to increased reactivity and potential for additional interactions with the catalyst.*

  **Explanation:** Halomethyl groups can participate in electrophilic interactions or coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalyst-modifier binding.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., trifluoroacetyl, nitro) on aliphatic chains result in low yield due to decreased electron density and poor coordination ability.*

  **Explanation:** Electron-withdrawing groups reduce electron availability for coordination with the metal catalyst, weakening interactions.

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers containing indole or other extended conjugated systems directly attached to the amino acid backbone result in high yield due to enhanced π-interactions with the catalyst.*

  **Explanation:** Extended conjugated systems can engage in π-π stacking or coordinate through delocalized electrons, enhancing binding with the catalyst.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan)

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers with carboxylic acid groups adjacent to cyclic imide structures result in high yield due to the ability to chelate metal centers effectively.*

  **Explanation:** Cyclic imides can coordinate with metals through carbonyl and nitrogen atoms, forming stable complexes that enhance catalytic activity.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Consolidate Overlapping Rules for Clarity and Efficiency.** Merge rules that cover similar structural features to reduce redundancy. For example, combine Rules 2 and 11, which both address electron-donating groups on aromatic rings enhancing yield, and clarify the impact of chain length and substituent position.

- **Advice 2**: **Refine Rules with Limited Data Support.** Reevaluate rules that are based on a single or few data points (e.g., Rules 8, 12, 13, 14, 15). Either gather additional data to strengthen these rules or integrate them into broader rules to improve reliability.

- **Advice 3**: **Address Exceptions and Expand Rule Coverage.** Modify rules to account for exceptions observed in the dataset. For instance, adjust Rule 3 to explain why 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid results in high yield despite the heterocycle being indirectly attached. Ensure that the rules accommodate such anomalies.

- **Advice 4**: **Increase Supporting Examples for Each Rule.** Provide more high-yield and low-yield examples for each rule to enhance understanding and applicability. This will also help validate the rules across a broader range of modifiers.

- **Advice 5**: **Simplify Complex Rules for Practical Application.** Streamline overly intricate rules (e.g., Rules 7 and 11) to focus on the most influential structural features affecting yield. This will make the rules more user-friendly and easier to apply to new modifiers.

- **Advice 6**: **Ensure Consistency in Rule Numbering and Terminology.** Review the rules for consistent numbering and clear, uniform terminology. This will prevent confusion and facilitate better communication among team members.

- **Advice 7**: **Integrate SMILES Notation into the Rules.** Convert structural descriptions into SMILES-based substructures to enable direct application of the rules to SMILES strings. Define key functional groups and patterns in SMILES notation within each rule.

- **Advice 8**: **Incorporate Quantitative Thresholds Where Applicable.** Where possible, specify quantitative parameters such as exact chain lengths or positions of functional groups. This will enhance the precision of the rules and aid in computational predictions.

- **Advice 9**: **Highlight the Role of Steric and Electronic Effects Explicitly.** Emphasize how steric hindrance and electronic properties influence yield within each rule's explanation. This will provide clearer guidance on the underlying principles affecting the reaction outcomes.

- **Advice 10**: **Validate and Update Rules with Additional Data.** Continuously test the rules against new data and modify them as necessary. This iterative approach will improve the rules' accuracy and reliability over time.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are short-chain aliphatic amino acids (2 to 5 carbons) with free amino and carboxyl groups result in high yield; extending the chain beyond 5 carbons or N-acetylation lowers the yield.*

  **Explanation:** Short-chain amino acids can effectively coordinate with the metal center through their amino and carboxyl groups, enhancing catalyst activity. Longer chains introduce steric hindrance, and N-acetylation blocks the amino group, reducing coordination.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid), 5-aminopentanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (N-acetyllysine), 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 2**: *Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., amino, hydroxy) at the para position lead to high yield; those with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., formyl, nitro) at any position result in low yield.*

  **Explanation:** Electron-donating groups increase electron density on the aromatic ring, enhancing coordination with the metal catalyst. Electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density, weakening interaction and possibly deactivating the catalyst through strong binding.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 4-aminobenzoic acid, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxylic acid group result in high yield; if the heterocycle is substituted or indirectly attached, the yield is low.*

  **Explanation:** Nitrogen heterocycles like pyridine and pyrazole can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity. Substituents or indirect attachment introduce steric hindrance and reduce coordination efficiency.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (nicotinic acid), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (heterocycle indirectly attached)

- **Rule 4**: *Long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (6 or more carbons) without additional polar functional groups result in high yield; introducing polar groups (e.g., hydroxy, amino) onto the chain decreases the yield.*

  **Explanation:** Nonpolar long chains enhance hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst, promoting better alignment with active sites. Polar groups introduce steric hindrance or form competing interactions, impeding effective catalysis.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** Octanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group result in high yield; lack of such hydroxyl groups leads to lower yield.*

  **Explanation:** Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance chelation with the metal center, forming stable complexes that boost catalytic activity.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid)
    - **Low Yield:** Carboxylic acids without adjacent hydroxyl groups (e.g., octanoic acid lacks adjacent hydroxyls but is still high yield due to Rule 4)

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers containing thiol groups on short aliphatic chains lead to high yield; thiol groups on aromatic rings result in low yield due to possible catalyst poisoning.*

  **Explanation:** Aliphatic thiols can coordinate with the metal center without significant steric hindrance. Aromatic thiols may bind irreversibly to the catalyst, deactivating it.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers with flexible ether chains (e.g., polyethylene glycol-like structures) and terminal carboxyl groups result in low yield due to steric hindrance and decreased effective concentration at the catalyst surface.*

  **Explanation:** Flexible ether chains increase molecular volume and conformational entropy, reducing the likelihood of effective interaction with the catalyst's active sites.

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects and extreme hydrophobicity, which hinder interaction with the catalyst.*

  **Explanation:** Perfluorinated groups withdraw electron density, weakening coordination with the metal center. Their hydrophobicity can cause phase separation or poor solubility.

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers containing aldehyde groups, especially on aromatic rings, result in low yield due to potential side reactions and catalyst deactivation.*

  **Explanation:** Aldehyde groups are reactive and may form Schiff bases or coordinate strongly with metals, blocking catalyst active sites.

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers that are N-acetylated amino acids or contain peptide bonds result in low yield due to steric hindrance and blocked coordination sites.*

  **Explanation:** N-acetylation caps the amino group, and peptide bonds increase molecular size, both reducing coordination with the metal center.

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic systems directly attached to the carboxylic acid and extended aliphatic chains enhance yield; shorter chains or lack of electron-donating substituents result in low yield.*

  **Explanation:** Electron-rich aromatics with donating groups (e.g., methoxy, hydroxy) increase electron density for coordination and improve solubility. Extended chains reduce steric hindrance near the active site.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers containing halomethyl groups on aromatic rings result in high yield due to increased reactivity and potential for additional interactions with the catalyst.*

  **Explanation:** Halomethyl groups can participate in electrophilic interactions or coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalyst-modifier binding.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., trifluoroacetyl, nitro) on aliphatic chains result in low yield due to decreased electron density and poor coordination ability.*

  **Explanation:** Electron-withdrawing groups reduce electron availability for coordination with the metal catalyst, weakening interactions.

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers containing indole or other extended conjugated systems directly attached to the amino acid backbone result in high yield due to enhanced π-interactions with the catalyst.*

  **Explanation:** Extended conjugated systems can engage in π-π stacking or coordinate through delocalized electrons, enhancing binding with the catalyst.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan)

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers with carboxylic acid groups adjacent to cyclic imide structures result in high yield due to the ability to chelate metal centers effectively.*

  **Explanation:** Cyclic imides can coordinate with metals through carbonyl and nitrogen atoms, forming stable complexes that enhance catalytic activity.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: In Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern for `short_chain_amino_acid` only matches amino acids with exactly 5 carbons between the amino and carboxyl groups. To accurately reflect the rule, modify the SMARTS to allow variable chain lengths of 2 to 5 carbons. Use repetition quantifiers or recursive patterns to match chains with 2 to 5 carbon atoms. For example, replace the fixed chain length with a pattern like `[C;X4H2]{1,4}` to represent 1 to 4 repeating methylene groups, resulting in total chain lengths of 2 to 5 carbons including the initial carbon.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: For Rule 2, the SMARTS patterns for electron-donating groups at the para position (`amino_para`, `hydroxy_para`) and for electron-withdrawing groups (`ewg_any`, `formyl_any`) are too specific and may not capture all relevant cases. Generalize these patterns to detect various electron-donating groups (e.g., methoxy, alkyl) and electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., cyano, sulfonyl) at any position on the aromatic ring. Use wildcard patterns and substituent lists to include all potential substituents affecting the yield.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: In Rule 3, the patterns for `nitrogen_heterocycle_carboxylic_acid` and `substituted_heterocycle` may not cover all nitrogen heterocycles or properly distinguish direct vs. indirect attachment. Update the SMARTS to more broadly identify nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly attached to the carboxylic acid group, and ensure that substitutions or additional atoms between the heterocycle and carboxylic acid are accurately detected.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: The SMARTS for Rule 4's `long_chain_carboxylic_acid` only matches a specific chain length and may miss longer chains or different branching patterns. Modify the pattern to match any aliphatic carboxylic acid with chains of 6 or more carbons, regardless of branching. Similarly, expand the `polar_groups` pattern to detect all relevant polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxy, amino, thiol) attached to any carbon in the chain.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: For Rule 5, the `multiple_adjacent_hydroxyls` SMARTS is too narrowly defined and may miss modifiers that meet the rule criteria but have different hydroxyl group arrangements. Adjust the pattern to detect any molecule with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group, possibly using recursive SMARTS or variable repetition to account for different numbers and positions of hydroxyls.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: In Rule 6, refine the `aliphatic_thiol` and `aromatic_thiol` SMARTS patterns to more accurately detect thiol groups on short aliphatic chains and aromatic rings, respectively. Ensure that the aliphatic thiol pattern captures various chain lengths up to a certain limit, and that the aromatic thiol pattern identifies thiols directly attached to any position on the aromatic ring.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: The SMARTS pattern for Rule 7 (`ether_chain`) may not fully capture all flexible ether chains leading to terminal carboxyl groups. Generalize the pattern to include variable-length ether chains with possible branching, and ensure that the terminal carboxyl group is correctly associated with these chains.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: For Rule 8, the `perfluorinated_chain` pattern only matches trifluoromethyl groups and may not detect longer perfluorinated alkyl chains. Modify the SMARTS to match any alkyl chain where all hydrogens are replaced with fluorines, such as by using a pattern like `[CX4]([F])([F])([F])[CX4]([F])([F])([F])...` with appropriate repetition to represent perfluorinated chains of varying lengths.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: In Rule 9, the `aldehyde_group` SMARTS `[CX3H](=O)` may match aldehyde groups not on aromatic rings. Since the rule emphasizes aldehyde groups on aromatic rings, adjust the pattern to specifically detect aldehyde groups attached to aromatic systems, such as using `[c][CX3H](=O)`.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: For Rule 10, the `n_acetylated_amino_acid` pattern may not accurately identify N-acetylated amino acids or molecules containing peptide bonds. Expand the pattern to detect N-acetyl groups attached to amino acids and include variations found in peptide bonds. Consider using patterns like `[NX3][CX3](=O)[NX3;H][CX3](=O)[OX1H]` to represent peptide bonds and N-acetyl groups.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: The `electron_rich_aromatic` pattern for Rule 11 is too specific, only detecting hydroxy groups directly attached to the aromatic ring. Broaden the pattern to include other electron-donating groups (e.g., amino, methoxy) and ensure it captures extended aliphatic chains attached to the aromatic system. Use variable patterns to match different lengths of aliphatic chains.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: For Rule 12, the `halomethyl_aromatic` pattern only includes a chloromethyl group. Modify the pattern to detect any halomethyl group (including bromine, iodine, fluorine) attached to an aromatic ring. Replace `Cl` with a halogen wildcard `[F,Cl,Br,I]` in the pattern.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: In Rule 13, the patterns for `trifluoroacetyl_group` and `nitro_group_aliphatic` may not encompass all strong electron-withdrawing groups on aliphatic chains. Expand the patterns to include other EWGs like cyano (`C#N`), sulfonyl (`S(=O)(=O)[#6]`), and ensure they are matched when attached to aliphatic chains.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: The `indole_attachment` pattern for Rule 14 might be too restrictive, potentially missing other extended conjugated systems. Modify the pattern to detect indole and other conjugated heterocycles directly attached to the amino acid backbone, possibly using more generic patterns for extended π-systems connected to amino acids.

- ** Suggestion 15 **: For Rule 15, the `cyclic_imide` SMARTS may not identify all carboxylic acids adjacent to cyclic imide structures. Broaden the pattern to include various cyclic imide systems and ensure the adjacency to the carboxylic acid is correctly represented in the SMARTS.

**Comments on the Performance of the Current Rules Based on the Current Metrics**

**Introduction**

In the context of our collaborative research on the catalytic problem, it's crucial to assess the performance of the current set of rules to ensure they effectively predict high-yield outcomes. This analysis focuses on the key metrics of **support**, **confidence**, **lift**, and **leverage**, with particular emphasis on **confidence** and **lift**.

---

**Comparison with Reference Metrics**

1. **Train Support**

   - **Previous Metrics**: 
     - Mean Support: *(0.1667, 0.1845)*
     - Average: ≈ **0.1756**

   - **Current Metrics**:
     - Train Support: **0.0648**

   - **Observation**:
     - **Decrease in Support**: The train support has significantly decreased by approximately **63%** compared to the average of previous metrics. This indicates that the current rules apply to a smaller portion of the dataset.

2. **Train Confidence**

   - **Previous Metrics**:
     - Mean Confidence: *(0.6352, 0.5396)*
     - Average: ≈ **0.5874**

   - **Current Metrics**:
     - Train Confidence: **0.6317**

   - **Observation**:
     - **Slight Increase**: The train confidence has increased slightly by approximately **7.5%** compared to the previous average, indicating that when the current rules apply, they predict high yield correctly about **63%** of the time.

3. **Train Lift**

   - **Previous Metrics**:
     - Mean Lift: *(1.2048, 1.0559)*
     - Average: ≈ **1.1304**

   - **Current Metrics**:
     - Train Lift: **1.2489**

   - **Observation**:
     - **Improved Lift**: The train lift has increased by approximately **10.5%** compared to the previous average. A lift greater than 1 suggests that the rule is better at predicting high yield than random chance.

4. **Train Leverage**

   - **Previous Metrics**:
     - Mean Leverage: *(0.0289, -0.0041)*
     - Average: ≈ **0.0124**

   - **Current Metrics**:
     - Train Leverage: **0.0060**

   - **Observation**:
     - **Decrease in Leverage**: The train leverage has decreased by approximately **51.6%** compared to the previous average. Positive leverage indicates a stronger association, but the decrease suggests a reduced impact.

---

**Interpretation of Metrics**

1. **Support Decrease**:
   - **Implication**: The rules cover fewer instances in the dataset, potentially missing out on other significant patterns.
   - **Reasoning**: The specificity of the current rules may be too high, making them applicable to a narrow subset of data.

2. **Confidence Maintenance**:
   - **Implication**: The reliability of the rules remains consistent. When the rules are applicable, they are likely to predict correctly.
   - **Reasoning**: The rules are accurate but not widely applicable.

3. **Lift Increase**:
   - **Implication**: The rules are better at predicting high yield than before, relative to random chance.
   - **Reasoning**: The rules capture strong associations between the conditions and high yield.

4. **Leverage Decrease**:
   - **Implication**: The rules contribute less additional predictive power over random chance compared to previous iterations.
   - **Reasoning**: The decrease in leverage, despite the increased lift, suggests that while the rules are better predictors when they apply, their overall contribution to prediction is less due to lower support.

---

**Determination of Local Minimum**

Based on the current metrics, especially the significantly reduced support and only marginal improvements in confidence and lift, it appears that we've reached a **local minimum** in improving our rule set. The trade-off between **specificity** (high confidence and lift) and **coverage** (support) indicates that without changes to our approach, further iterations may yield diminishing returns.

---

**Suggestions for Improvement After Detailed Analysis**

To enhance the performance of the rules, we need to address the low support while maintaining or improving confidence and lift.

1. **Review and Refine Existing Rules**

   - **Simplify Overly Specific Rules**:
     - **Analysis**: Some rules may be too narrowly defined, capturing only specific cases.
     - **Action**: Identify rules with very specific conditions and consider generalizing them to cover more instances without significantly reducing confidence.
     - **Example**: 
       - **Rule 13** focuses on modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups on aliphatic chains resulting in low yield.
       - **Improvement**: Broaden the rule to include all strong electron-withdrawing groups, whether on aliphatic or aromatic chains, to increase support.

2. **Consolidate Similar Rules**

   - **Analysis**: Overlapping rules could be merged to improve support.
   - **Action**: Combine rules that have similar explanations or effects into a single, more general rule.
   - **Example**:
     - **Rules 9 and 13** both deal with electron-withdrawing groups leading to low yield.
     - **Improvement**: Merge into a unified rule about electron-withdrawing substituents decreasing yield.

3. **Re-evaluate the Importance of Features**

   - **Analysis**: Some features may not be as influential as initially thought.
   - **Action**: Use statistical methods to assess the significance of different modifier features on yield.
   - **Example**:
     - **Rule 12** mentions halomethyl groups increasing yield due to reactivity.
     - **Improvement**: Verify if halomethyl groups consistently lead to high yield or if this is an outlier.

4. **Introduce New Features or Parameters**

   - **Analysis**: Additional properties like steric factors, solvent interactions, or catalyst modifications might influence outcomes.
   - **Action**: Collect and incorporate more data on these parameters to enhance rule accuracy.
   - **Example**:
     - Consider the role of **pKa** values, solubility, or coordination geometries in modifier effectiveness.

5. **Increase Dataset Size**

   - **Analysis**: A limited dataset can constrain the support metric.
   - **Action**: Expand the dataset with more experimental results to provide a broader basis for rule application.
   - **Example**:
     - Conduct additional experiments with modifiers that are structurally diverse but fall under existing rules.

6. **Utilize Machine Learning Techniques**

   - **Analysis**: Algorithms may detect patterns not immediately obvious.
   - **Action**: Apply decision trees, random forests, or association rule mining to the dataset.
   - **Example**:
     - Use **Apriori algorithm** for association rule learning to find itemsets with high support and confidence.

7. **Cross-Validate the Rules**

   - **Analysis**: Ensure the rules generalize well to unseen data.
   - **Action**: Use k-fold cross-validation to test the rules' performance across different subsets of the data.
   - **Example**:
     - Divide the dataset into 5 folds and iterate the training and validation process.

8. **Address Potential Overfitting**

   - **Analysis**: High confidence and lift with low support may indicate overfitting to the training data.
   - **Action**: Introduce regularization techniques or simplify rules to prevent overfitting.
   - **Example**:
     - Limit the number of conditions in each rule to prevent overly complex rules that don't generalize well.

9. **Incorporate Negative Examples Effectively**

   - **Analysis**: Rules that predict low yield are as important as those predicting high yield.
   - **Action**: Balance the rules to account for both high and low yield cases to improve overall predictive performance.
   - **Example**:
     - Ensure rules like **Rule 7** (flexible ether chains result in low yield) are validated and adjusted if necessary.

10. **Continuous Collaboration and Expert Review**

    - **Analysis**: Expert insights can identify subtle nuances in chemical behavior.
    - **Action**: Engage with chemists and other domain experts to refine rules based on chemical knowledge.
    - **Example**:
      - Discuss the plausibility of rules like **Rule 6**, which involves thiol groups and potential catalyst poisoning.

---

**Conclusion**

The current set of rules demonstrates high confidence and lift but suffers from low support, indicating that while the rules are accurate, they apply to a limited portion of the dataset. This suggests that we've reached a local minimum, where further refinements without strategic changes yield minimal benefits.

To improve the current rules, we should focus on:

- **Increasing Support**: Generalize rules to cover more data instances.
- **Maintaining High Confidence and Lift**: Ensure that the rules remain reliable predictors.
- **Enhancing Rule Set Effectiveness**: Simplify, consolidate, and validate rules to make them more robust.

By implementing these improvements, we can develop a more effective rule set that balances coverage and predictive power, ultimately advancing our research on the catalytic problem and achieving better predictive accuracy for high-yield outcomes.

---

**Next Steps**

- **Team Discussion**: Schedule a meeting to review the proposed improvements and assign action items.
- **Data Expansion**: Plan additional experiments to increase the dataset size and diversity.
- **Algorithm Application**: Allocate resources to apply machine learning techniques to the data.
- **Expert Consultation**: Engage with domain experts for rule validation and refinement.

---

**Overall Goal**

Enhance the predictive performance of the rules to facilitate more efficient catalyst design and selection, ultimately contributing to advancements in our catalytic research program.

**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

**1. Effectiveness of Current Rules**

The current rules have resulted in a 5-fold validation accuracy of **0.6857**, which is lower than the previous reference accuracies of **0.76**. This decrease in accuracy suggests that the effectiveness of the current rules has diminished compared to prior iterations. The model's ability to correctly predict the catalyst modifier loading has decreased, indicating that the current rules may not be capturing the essential features influencing the outcome as effectively as before.

**2. Overfitting and Underfitting Assessment**

- **Overfitting**: The decrease in validation accuracy, coupled with the introduction of new rules and changes in existing ones, may indicate that the model is not overfitting to the training data. Overfitting typically results in high training accuracy but low validation accuracy. In this case, both accuracies are relatively low, suggesting overfitting is less likely.

- **Underfitting**: The consistently low validation accuracy points towards underfitting. The model may be too simple or the rules too generic to capture the underlying patterns in the data. This underfitting could be due to the removal or modification of rules that were previously contributing positively to the model's predictive performance.

**3. Discrepancy Analysis Using SHAP Values**

Analyzing the SHAP values helps identify which rules are contributing to erroneous predictions.

- **Overestimated Loading (Predicted High, Experimental Low)**:
  - **Molecules**:
    - *C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N*
    - *C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O*
    - *C(CCCC(=O)O)CCCN*
    - *C(CCCN)CCC(=O)O*
    - *COCCOCCOCC(=O)O*
    - *C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)NCC(=O)O)O*
    - *CC1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=O)O*
    - *C(COCCOCCN)C(=O)O*
    - *C(CCCO)CCC(=O)O*
    - *C1=CC(=CC=C1CCC(=O)O)O*

  - **Common Rules with High Positive SHAP Values**:
    - **Rule 1**: Significant positive SHAP values across these molecules indicate that **Rule 1** is contributing to the overestimation.

- **Underestimated Loading (Predicted Low, Experimental High)**:
  - **Molecules**:
    - *CC(CC(=O)O)CNC(=O)C(F)(F)F*
    - *C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O*
    - *C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O*
    - *C(=O)(C(C(C(C(F)(F)F)(F)F)(F)F)(F)F)O*
    - *C(CCCN)CCC(=O)O*

  - **Common Rules with High Negative SHAP Values**:
    - **Rule 8**: For *C(=O)(C(C(C(C(F)(F)F)(F)F)(F)F)(F)F)O*, Rule 8 has a significant negative SHAP value, suggesting it is causing underestimation.
    - **Rule 1**: Negative SHAP values in cases like *CC(CC(=O)O)CNC(=O)C(F)(F)F* and *C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O* indicate **Rule 1** may also be contributing to the underestimation.

**4. Interpretation of Accuracy Changes**

The decrease in validation accuracy from **0.7143** in the previous iteration to **0.6857** currently suggests that the changes made to the rules have not improved the model's performance. It may indicate that the current set of rules is less aligned with the true underlying patterns in the data, or that important predictive features are not adequately captured.

**5. Insights from SHAP Analysis**

The SHAP analysis highlights the impact of specific rules on individual predictions:

- **Rule 1**: Has high positive SHAP values for many molecules, contributing significantly to high loading predictions—even when experimental values are low. This suggests that **Rule 1** may be too general or is being applied inappropriately to certain compounds.

- **Rule 8**: Exhibits high negative SHAP values for some molecules with high experimental loadings but low predictions. This indicates that **Rule 8** may be overly penalizing certain modifiers, leading to underestimation.

- **Rule 3 and Rule 5**: Their contributions vary, but any consistent patterns in mispredictions linked to these rules could indicate areas for refinement.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended to improve the current set of rules:

**1. Refine Rule 1**

- **Issue**: Rule 1 is contributing to overestimations in loading predictions for several molecules where the experimental loading is low.
- **Suggestion**:
  - **Increase Specificity**: Modify Rule 1 to be more specific about the chain length and the functional groups' positions.
  - **Add Exceptions**: Include exceptions for compounds that meet the criteria but have additional features that lower the yield, such as steric hindrance from bulky groups adjacent to the amino or carboxyl groups.
  - **Consider Interactions**: Factor in potential interactions with other functional groups that may affect coordination with the catalyst.

**2. Adjust Rule 8**

- **Issue**: Rule 8 is causing underestimations for molecules that experimentally show high loadings.
- **Suggestion**:
  - **Reevaluate the Scope**: Narrow down the cases where Rule 8 applies. Not all fluorinated compounds may negatively impact the yield.
  - **Incorporate Context**: Consider the position and number of fluorine atoms. Perhaps only heavily perfluorinated chains hinder catalyst interaction, whereas partial fluorination might not.
  - **Update Rule Explanation**: Adjust the explanation to reflect the nuanced impact of electron-withdrawing groups in different molecular contexts.

**3. Reassess Rule Contributions**

- **Utilize SHAP Values**: For rules like Rule 3 and Rule 5, analyze their SHAP values in mispredicted cases to determine if they require adjustments.

**4. Address Underfitting**

- **Expand Rule Coverage**: Introduce new rules or modify existing ones to capture features not currently accounted for, which may be influencing the loading.
- **Enhance Rule Complexity**: Allow for interactions between rules or compound features to capture more complex patterns.

**5. Improve Generalization**

- **Avoid Overly General Rules**: Rules that are too broad (e.g., applying to all modifiers with a certain functional group) may not capture the subtleties of modifier-catalyst interactions.
- **Incorporate Quantitative Thresholds**: Where possible, use quantitative criteria (e.g., exact carbon chain lengths, specific positions of functional groups) to make rules more precise.

**6. Iterative Refinement**

- **Test Incremental Changes**: Modify one rule at a time and evaluate the impact on model performance to isolate the effects.
- **Cross-Validation**: Continue using cross-validation to ensure changes improve generalization across different subsets of the data.

**7. Leverage Domain Knowledge**

- **Chemical Insights**: Consult with chemists to understand why certain modifiers behave contrary to the rules. This may reveal overlooked factors that can be integrated into the rules.
- **Update Rules Accordingly**: Incorporate new chemical knowledge into the rules to improve their predictive power.

**Conclusion**

The current set of rules appears to be less effective than previous iterations, as evidenced by decreased validation accuracy and discrepancies highlighted by SHAP analysis. Refining the rules, particularly those with high SHAP contributions to mispredictions, should improve the model's performance. By making rules more specific and considering additional molecular features, we can enhance the model's ability to accurately predict catalyst modifier loading.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

**Introduction**

The discussions above focus on evaluating and optimizing a set of rules aimed at predicting the yield of a radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. The reaction involves aliphatic alcohols using di-tert-butyl azodicarboxylate (DBAD) as the substrate, catalyzed by FeCl₃ in the presence of molecular modifiers. The rules are designed to capture the relationship between molecular modifiers' structures and the reaction yield. The analysis includes examining rule metrics, accuracy, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values, and providing suggestions for improvement.

**Performance Evaluation**

1. **Rule Metrics**

   - **Support**: There is a significant decrease in train support compared to previous metrics, indicating that the current rules apply to fewer instances in the dataset.
   - **Confidence**: Slightly increased compared to previous metrics, suggesting that when the rules do apply, they are somewhat more reliable.
   - **Lift**: Improved lift indicates that the rules are better at predicting high yield than random chance.
   - **Leverage**: The decrease in leverage suggests a reduced overall impact of the rules, despite higher confidence.

2. **Accuracy and SHAP Analysis**

   - **Validation Accuracy**: The current 5-fold validation accuracy is lower than previous iterations, indicating diminished predictive performance.
   - **SHAP Values**: The SHAP analysis highlights that certain rules are contributing to erroneous predictions. Specifically, Rule 1 is causing overestimations, and Rule 8 is causing underestimations in some cases.

**Directions to Optimize Current Rules**

To enhance the predictive performance of the rules and address the issues identified, the following directions are proposed:

1. **Refine and Generalize SMARTS Patterns**

   - **Adjust Rule Specificity**: Modify overly specific SMARTS patterns to capture a broader range of relevant structures without sacrificing accuracy.
   - **Increase Rule Coverage**: Ensure that the patterns account for structural variations and substitutions that are chemically significant.

2. **Incorporate Additional Chemical Features**

   - **Functional Groups**: Include a wider variety of electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups in the patterns.
   - **Steric Effects**: Consider the impact of molecular size and branching on steric hindrance and coordination with the catalyst.
   - **Electronic Effects**: Account for the influence of conjugation and resonance in aromatic systems on the modifiers' effectiveness.

3. **Revise Rules Based on SHAP Insights**

   - **Rule 1 (Short-Chain Amino Acids)**:
     - **Issue**: Overestimation of high yield in some cases.
     - **Action**: Refine the rule to specify chain lengths and functional group positions more precisely, and include exceptions where necessary.
   - **Rule 8 (Perfluorinated Chains)**:
     - **Issue**: Underestimation of high yield in certain fluorinated compounds.
     - **Action**: Reevaluate the rule to distinguish between different degrees and patterns of fluorination.

4. **Consolidate and Simplify Rules**

   - **Merge Similar Rules**: Combine overlapping rules to improve support and reduce redundancy.
   - **Simplify Complex Rules**: Streamline rules that are too intricate, which may be causing overfitting or misclassification.

**Specific Suggestions to Improve Current Rules**

1. **Rule 1: Short-Chain Aliphatic Amino Acids**

   - **Suggestion**: Modify the SMARTS pattern to allow chain lengths of 2 to 5 carbons. Use quantifiers like `[C;X4H2]{1,3}` to represent variable-length chains.

2. **Rule 2: Electron-Donating and Withdrawing Groups on Aromatic Rings**

   - **Suggestion**: Generalize patterns to detect a wider range of electron-donating groups (e.g., methoxy `[OCH3]`, alkyl groups) and electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro `[N+](=O)[O-]`, cyano `[C]#[N]`) at any position.

3. **Rule 3: Nitrogen Heterocycles**

   - **Suggestion**: Broaden the SMARTS to include various nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to carboxylic acids, ensuring accurate recognition of direct vs. indirect attachment.

4. **Rule 4: Long-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids**

   - **Suggestion**: Adjust the pattern to match aliphatic chains of 6 or more carbons, including branched chains. Expand detection of polar groups by including additional functional groups like `[OH]`, `[NH2]`, `[SH]`.

5. **Rule 5: Multiple Adjacent Hydroxyl Groups**

   - **Suggestion**: Use recursive SMARTS or variable repetition operators to capture molecules with varying numbers of adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group.

6. **Rule 6: Thiol Groups**

   - **Suggestion**: Refine patterns to accurately detect thiol groups on aliphatic chains of different lengths and ensure aromatic thiols are correctly identified.

7. **Rule 8: Perfluorinated Alkyl Chains**

   - **Suggestion**: Modify the SMARTS to match perfluorinated chains of varying lengths. Use patterns like `[CX4]([F])([F])([F])` repeated as necessary.

8. **Rule 9: Aldehyde Groups on Aromatics**

   - **Suggestion**: Adjust the pattern to `[c][CX3H](=O)` to specifically detect aldehyde groups attached to aromatic carbon atoms.

9. **Rule 10: N-Acetylated Amino Acids and Peptide Bonds**

   - **Suggestion**: Expand the pattern to include N-acetyl and peptide bond structures, capturing molecules with these features that may affect yield.

10. **Rule 11: Electron-Rich Aromatics with Aliphatic Chains**

    - **Suggestion**: Broaden the pattern to include various electron-donating groups and variable-length aliphatic chains attached to the aromatic ring.

11. **Rule 12: Halomethyl Groups on Aromatic Rings**

    - **Suggestion**: Replace specific halogen designations with a wildcard `[F,Cl,Br,I]` to detect any halomethyl group attached to an aromatic ring.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

There is a clear possibility for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. By refining the rules to be more accurate and representative of the underlying chemical principles, we can improve both support and confidence. This involves:

- **Enhancing Rule Applicability**: Adjusting the specificity and generality of rules to increase their applicability to more data instances while maintaining predictive accuracy.

- **Incorporating Comprehensive Chemical Knowledge**: Leveraging domain expertise to ensure that the rules accurately reflect the factors influencing the reaction yield.

- **Validating with Cross-Validation**: Continuously assessing the rules using techniques like k-fold cross-validation to prevent overfitting and ensure generalizability.

Final Metric Message:

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are short-chain aliphatic amino acids (2 to 5 carbons) with free amino and carboxyl groups result in high yield; extending the chain beyond 5 carbons or N-acetylation lowers the yield.*

  **Explanation:** Short-chain amino acids can effectively coordinate with the metal center through their amino and carboxyl groups, enhancing catalyst activity. Longer chains introduce steric hindrance, and N-acetylation blocks the amino group, reducing coordination.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid), 5-aminopentanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (N-acetyllysine), 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 2**: *Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., amino, hydroxy) at the para position lead to high yield; those with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., formyl, nitro) at any position result in low yield.*

  **Explanation:** Electron-donating groups increase electron density on the aromatic ring, enhancing coordination with the metal catalyst. Electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density, weakening interaction and possibly deactivating the catalyst through strong binding.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 4-aminobenzoic acid, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxylic acid group result in high yield; if the heterocycle is substituted or indirectly attached, the yield is low.*

  **Explanation:** Nitrogen heterocycles like pyridine and pyrazole can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity. Substituents or indirect attachment introduce steric hindrance and reduce coordination efficiency.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (nicotinic acid), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (heterocycle indirectly attached)

- **Rule 4**: *Long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (6 or more carbons) without additional polar functional groups result in high yield; introducing polar groups (e.g., hydroxy, amino) onto the chain decreases the yield.*

  **Explanation:** Nonpolar long chains enhance hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst, promoting better alignment with active sites. Polar groups introduce steric hindrance or form competing interactions, impeding effective catalysis.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** Octanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group result in high yield; lack of such hydroxyl groups leads to lower yield.*

  **Explanation:** Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance chelation with the metal center, forming stable complexes that boost catalytic activity.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid)
    - **Low Yield:** Carboxylic acids without adjacent hydroxyl groups (e.g., octanoic acid lacks adjacent hydroxyls but is still high yield due to Rule 4)

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers containing thiol groups on short aliphatic chains lead to high yield; thiol groups on aromatic rings result in low yield due to possible catalyst poisoning.*

  **Explanation:** Aliphatic thiols can coordinate with the metal center without significant steric hindrance. Aromatic thiols may bind irreversibly to the catalyst, deactivating it.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers with flexible ether chains (e.g., polyethylene glycol-like structures) and terminal carboxyl groups result in low yield due to steric hindrance and decreased effective concentration at the catalyst surface.*

  **Explanation:** Flexible ether chains increase molecular volume and conformational entropy, reducing the likelihood of effective interaction with the catalyst's active sites.

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects and extreme hydrophobicity, which hinder interaction with the catalyst.*

  **Explanation:** Perfluorinated groups withdraw electron density, weakening coordination with the metal center. Their hydrophobicity can cause phase separation or poor solubility.

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers containing aldehyde groups, especially on aromatic rings, result in low yield due to potential side reactions and catalyst deactivation.*

  **Explanation:** Aldehyde groups are reactive and may form Schiff bases or coordinate strongly with metals, blocking catalyst active sites.

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers that are N-acetylated amino acids or contain peptide bonds result in low yield due to steric hindrance and blocked coordination sites.*

  **Explanation:** N-acetylation caps the amino group, and peptide bonds increase molecular size, both reducing coordination with the metal center.

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic systems directly attached to the carboxylic acid and extended aliphatic chains enhance yield; shorter chains or lack of electron-donating substituents result in low yield.*

  **Explanation:** Electron-rich aromatics with donating groups (e.g., methoxy, hydroxy) increase electron density for coordination and improve solubility. Extended chains reduce steric hindrance near the active site.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers containing halomethyl groups on aromatic rings result in high yield due to increased reactivity and potential for additional interactions with the catalyst.*

  **Explanation:** Halomethyl groups can participate in electrophilic interactions or coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalyst-modifier binding.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., trifluoroacetyl, nitro) on aliphatic chains result in low yield due to decreased electron density and poor coordination ability.*

  **Explanation:** Electron-withdrawing groups reduce electron availability for coordination with the metal catalyst, weakening interactions.

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers containing indole or other extended conjugated systems directly attached to the amino acid backbone result in high yield due to enhanced π-interactions with the catalyst.*

  **Explanation:** Extended conjugated systems can engage in π-π stacking or coordinate through delocalized electrons, enhancing binding with the catalyst.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan)

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers with carboxylic acid groups adjacent to cyclic imide structures result in high yield due to the ability to chelate metal centers effectively.*

  **Explanation:** Cyclic imides can coordinate with metals through carbonyl and nitrogen atoms, forming stable complexes that enhance catalytic activity.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: Refine the SMARTS pattern in **Rule 1** to accurately capture short-chain aliphatic amino acids with chain lengths of 2 to 5 carbons. Use a variable-length carbon chain notation such as `[CH2]` repeated `{1,3}` times. Ensure that both the amino group (`[NH2]`) and the carboxyl group (`C(=O)[OH]`) are properly positioned to allow effective coordination with the metal center. For example, the SMARTS pattern can be modified to `N[C;H2][C;H2]{0,2}C(=O)O`.

- **Advice 2**: Generalize the SMARTS patterns in **Rule 2** to include a broader range of electron-donating groups on aromatic carboxylic acids. Modify the pattern to detect substituents like methoxy (`[OCH3]`), methyl (`[CH3]`), amino (`[NH2]`), and hydroxy (`[OH]`) groups attached to the aromatic ring at any position. Similarly, update the pattern to identify electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (`[N+](=O)[O-]`), cyano (`C#N`), and formyl (`[CH]=O`) at any position. This can be achieved by using a pattern like `c[C;!$(C=O)]c(c[c](c)c)[N,O,S]` for electron-donating groups and `c[C;!$(C=O)]c(c[c](c)c)[N+](=O)[O-]` for electron-withdrawing groups.

- **Advice 3**: Broaden the SMARTS patterns in **Rule 3** to include various nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxylic acid group. Ensure the patterns distinguish between direct and indirect attachment. Incorporate heterocycles such as pyridine (`[nH]1ccccc1`), pyrazole, imidazole, and others in the patterns. For direct attachment, use a pattern like `n[cH]c(C(=O)O)` to match heterocycles bound directly to the carboxyl group without intervening atoms.

- **Advice 4**: Adjust the SMARTS patterns in **Rule 4** to detect long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with chains of 6 or more carbons, including branched chains. Use a pattern like `[C;H2][C;H2]{4,}[C](=O)O` to match aliphatic chains of adjustable length. Exclude modifiers with polar functional groups by adding conditions that negate the presence of hydroxy (`[OH]`), amino (`[NH2]`), or other polar groups on the chain, such as `!@[C][OH]` or `!@[C][NH2]`.

- **Advice 5**: In **Rule 5**, use recursive SMARTS or variable repetition operators to capture modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group. Implement a pattern like `C(=O)O[C@H]([OH])[C@H]([OH])[C@H]([OH])` to match molecules with three adjacent hydroxyl-bearing carbons, and adjust the number of repetitions as needed.

- **Advice 6**: Refine the SMARTS patterns in **Rule 6** to accurately detect thiol groups on short aliphatic chains while excluding thiol groups on aromatic rings. Use a pattern like `C(=O)O[C][C][SH]` for aliphatic thiols and include a negative lookahead to exclude aromatic thiols, such as `!@[c][SH]`.

- **Advice 7**: For **Rule 8**, modify the SMARTS patterns to match perfluorinated alkyl chains of varying lengths. Use a repeating unit like `[CX4]([F])([F])([F])[CX4]([F])([F])([F])` to represent perfluorinated carbons. Adjust the repetition to cover chains of different lengths, ensuring that all hydrogens are replaced with fluorines.

- **Advice 8**: Adjust the SMARTS patterns in **Rule 9** to specifically detect aldehyde groups on aromatic rings. Use a pattern like `c[C](=O)[H]` to match an aldehyde group directly attached to an aromatic carbon. This will help identify modifiers that may lead to low yield due to catalyst deactivation.

- **Advice 9**: Expand the SMARTS patterns in **Rule 10** to include N-acetylated amino acids and peptide bonds. Use patterns like `N(C(=O)C)[C;H2][C;H2]C(=O)O` for N-acetylated amino acids and `C(=O)N[C;H2]C(=O)O` for peptide bonds. This will help capture modifiers with blocked coordination sites that reduce yield.

- **Advice 10**: In **Rule 11**, broaden the SMARTS patterns to include electron-rich aromatic systems with variable-length aliphatic chains attached to the carboxylic acid group. Use a pattern like `c1ccc(cc1)[C;H2]{2,5}C(=O)O` to allow for aliphatic chains of different lengths. Incorporate electron-donating groups such as methoxy (`[c][OCH3]`), hydroxy (`[c][OH]`), and amino (`[c][NH2]`) on the aromatic ring.

- **Advice 11**: For **Rule 12**, use a wildcard for halogens to detect any halomethyl group on aromatic rings. Modify the pattern to `c[CH2][F,Cl,Br,I]` to match modifiers like 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid. This generalization will help identify similar compounds that may enhance yield.

- **Advice 12**: Reevaluate the SMARTS patterns in **Rule 13** to precisely detect strong electron-withdrawing groups on aliphatic chains. Use patterns like `[C][C](=O)[C]([F,Cl,Br,I])([F,Cl,Br,I])[F,Cl,Br,I]` for trifluoromethyl groups or `[C][N+](=O)[O-]` for nitro groups, ensuring they are correctly associated with low yield.

- **Advice 13**: Incorporate additional chemical features into the rules by considering steric hindrance and electronic effects. Use molecular descriptors or parameters such as molecular weight, clogP (partition coefficient), and topological polar surface area (TPSA) to account for size, hydrophobicity, and electronic distribution, which can influence the interaction with the catalyst.

- **Advice 14**: Consolidate overlapping rules to improve support and reduce redundancy. For example, merge **Rules 2** and **11** into a single rule that covers aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups and variable-length aliphatic chains, simplifying the rule set and increasing coverage.

- **Advice 15**: Simplify complex SMARTS patterns to avoid overfitting by focusing on key structural features. For instance, instead of highly specific patterns, use broader substructures that capture the essential characteristics influencing yield. Validate the simplified rules with cross-validation techniques to ensure they maintain predictive power without overfitting.

Rule Generator Message:
**Revised Rules**

After analyzing the provided dataset and the current rules, we've identified some inconsistencies and opportunities for improvement, particularly in **Rule 2**. We have refined the rules to better align with the underlying chemical principles and to enhance their predictive power.

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: *Short-chain aliphatic amino acids (2 to 5 carbons) with free amino and carboxyl groups and without bulky aromatic side chains result in high yield; introducing aromatic side chains or N-acetylation lowers the yield.*

  **Explanation:** Simple aliphatic amino acids coordinate effectively with the metal center, enhancing catalyst activity. Aromatic side chains introduce steric hindrance or disrupt coordination due to π-π interactions. N-acetylation blocks the amino group, reducing coordination ability.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid), 5-aminopentanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine), (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (N-acetyllysine)

- **Rule 2**: *Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., amino, hydroxy) at the para position **and** extended aliphatic chains (4 or more carbons) connected to the aromatic ring result in high yield; simple aromatic carboxylic acids without extended chains result in low yield.*

  **Explanation:** The combination of electron-donating groups and an extended aliphatic chain enhances electron density and provides flexibility, improving coordination with the catalyst. Simple aromatics lack the necessary spatial arrangement for effective interaction.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-methylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxylic acid group result in high yield; if the heterocycle is indirectly attached or has bulky substituents, the yield is low.*

  **Explanation:** Nitrogen heterocycles like pyridine and pyrazole efficiently coordinate with metal centers when directly connected, enhancing catalyst activity. Indirect attachment or bulky groups hinder coordination due to steric effects.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (nicotinic acid), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (heterocycle indirectly attached)

- **Rule 4**: *Long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (6 or more carbons) without additional polar functional groups result in high yield; introducing polar groups (e.g., hydroxy, amino) onto the chain decreases the yield due to disrupted hydrophobic interactions.*

  **Explanation:** Nonpolar long chains enhance hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst, promoting better alignment with active sites. Polar groups introduce unfavorable interactions or steric hindrance, impeding catalysis.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** Octanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group on an aliphatic chain result in high yield; lack of such hydroxyl groups or their presence on aromatic rings leads to lower yield.*

  **Explanation:** Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance chelation with the metal center through multidentate binding, forming stable complexes that boost catalytic activity.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid)
    - **Low Yield:** Molecules without adjacent hydroxyl groups or with hydroxyls on aromatic rings (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid)

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers containing thiol groups on short aliphatic chains lead to high yield; thiol groups on aromatic rings result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning from strong or irreversible binding.*

  **Explanation:** Aliphatic thiols can coordinate with the metal center without significant steric hindrance, enhancing activity. Aromatic thiols may bind too strongly or irreversibly, deactivating the catalyst.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers with flexible ether chains (e.g., polyethylene glycol-like structures) and terminal carboxyl groups result in low yield due to steric hindrance and reduced effective concentration at the catalyst surface.*

  **Explanation:** Flexible ether chains increase molecular volume and conformational flexibility, reducing the likelihood of effective interaction with the catalyst's active sites.

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., perfluoroalkyl chains, trifluoroacetyl) result in low yield due to decreased electron density and poor coordination ability with the metal center.*

  **Explanation:** Electron-withdrawing groups reduce electron availability for coordination, weakening interactions with the catalyst.

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid, 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers containing aldehyde groups, especially on aromatic rings, result in low yield due to potential side reactions and catalyst deactivation.*

  **Explanation:** Aldehyde groups are reactive and may form Schiff bases or coordinate strongly with metals, blocking catalyst active sites and reducing activity.

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers that are N-acetylated amino acids or contain peptide bonds result in low yield due to steric hindrance and blocked coordination sites from the capped amino groups and increased molecular size.*

  **Explanation:** N-acetylation and peptide bonds prevent effective coordination with the metal center, hindering catalytic activity.

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic systems directly attached to extended aliphatic chains enhance yield; shorter chains or lack of electron-donating substituents result in low yield.*

  **Explanation:** Electron-rich aromatics with donating groups (e.g., methoxy, hydroxy) increase electron density for coordination and improve hydrophobic interactions. Extended chains provide flexibility and optimal positioning near the active site.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (shorter chain)

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers containing halomethyl groups on aromatic rings result in high yield due to increased reactivity and potential for additional interactions with the catalyst through halogen bonding or enhanced electrophilicity.*

  **Explanation:** Halomethyl groups can participate in unique interactions or affect electron distribution, enhancing catalyst-modifier binding.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers containing indole or other extended conjugated systems directly attached to the amino acid backbone result in high yield due to enhanced π-interactions and potential for multidentate coordination with the catalyst.*

  **Explanation:** Extended conjugated systems can engage in π-π stacking or coordinate through delocalized electrons, enhancing binding with the catalyst.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan)
    - **Low Yield:** (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine) due to less effective conjugation and sterics

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers with cyclic imide structures adjacent to carboxylic acid groups result in high yield due to their ability to chelate metal centers effectively through multiple coordination sites.*

  **Explanation:** Cyclic imides provide multiple points of interaction (carbonyl oxygens and nitrogen) for strong and stable complex formation with the metal catalyst.

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers that are simple aromatic carboxylic acids without electron-donating substituents or with electron-withdrawing groups result in low yield due to poor coordination ability and decreased electron density.*

  **Explanation:** Lack of electron-donating groups reduces the affinity of the modifier for the metal center, leading to weaker interactions.

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-formylbenzoic acid

**End of Rules**

**Summary of Changes:**

- **Rule 1**: Expanded to include the effect of aromatic side chains on amino acids, explaining the discrepancy with phenylalanine.
- **Rule 2**: Refined to clarify that both electron-donating groups and extended aliphatic chains are necessary for high yield, addressing the exceptions with simple aromatic acids like 4-aminobenzoic acid.
- **Rule 8**: Combined the effects of perfluorinated chains and other strong electron-withdrawing groups to broaden the rule's applicability.
- **Rule 12**: Added explanation for the unique behavior of halomethyl groups on aromatic rings, despite limited examples.
- **Rule 13**: Clarified the importance of extended conjugation and multidentate coordination with indole-containing modifiers.
- **Rule 15**: Added to address low-yield modifiers lacking electron-donating groups, reinforcing patterns observed in the dataset.

**Conclusion:**

These revised rules offer a comprehensive understanding of how various functional groups and structural features of molecular modifiers influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp3)–H bond functionalization reaction. By considering combinations of substructures and underlying physicochemical properties, these rules provide clear predictions for the activity of new modifiers and cover a broad range of the dataset while balancing simplicity and complexity.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 states that amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains lower the yield. However, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan) is listed as a high-yield modifier (entry 15). This contradiction suggests that the rule needs refinement to account for exceptions like tryptophan, possibly due to the unique properties of the indole group enhancing coordination.

- **Comment 2**: According to Rule 2, simple aromatic carboxylic acids without extended aliphatic chains result in low yield. Yet, 4-aminobenzoic acid (entry 4) is reported to have a high yield in the dataset. This inconsistency indicates that the rule may require revision to consider that strong electron-donating groups like amino groups can enhance yield even without extended aliphatic chains.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is supported by a single data point—(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid). Due to limited coverage, the reliability of this rule is uncertain. Additional data points with modifiers containing multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups are necessary to validate this rule.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is based on only one example—4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid (entry 1). With insufficient data to support this rule, its general applicability is questionable. More examples are needed to confirm the effect of halomethyl groups on yield.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 centers on modifiers containing indole or extended conjugated systems, but relies solely on tryptophan (entry 15) as evidence. The limited data reduces confidence in the rule. Expanding the dataset to include more modifiers with similar structures would help reinforce this rule.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 is derived from a single data point—1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid (entry 17). The lack of multiple supporting examples limits the rule's coverage and predictive power. Additional modifiers with cyclic imide structures should be examined to substantiate this rule.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 overlaps with parts of Rule 2, as both address simple aromatic carboxylic acids lacking electron-donating substituents. This redundancy could be reduced by combining the two rules for clarity. Consolidating the rules may also help address contradictions noted with 4-aminobenzoic acid in Rule 2.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Revise Rule 1 to account for exceptions like tryptophan.**

  - **Action:** Modify Rule 1 to include that certain amino acids with aromatic side chains, such as tryptophan, result in high yield due to unique properties like extended conjugation and potential for multidentate coordination.
  - **Explanation:** While Rule 1 currently states that aromatic side chains lower the yield, tryptophan (entry 15) has an indole ring that enhances π-interactions with the catalyst. Adjusting the rule will resolve this contradiction and improve predictive accuracy.
  - **Revised Rule 1:** *Short-chain aliphatic amino acids (2 to 5 carbons) with free amino and carboxyl groups result in high yield; introducing bulky aromatic side chains generally lowers the yield **unless** the aromatic side chain provides additional coordination benefits (e.g., indole ring in tryptophan).*

- **Advice 2**: **Adjust Rule 2 to reflect high yield in simple aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-donating groups, regardless of chain extension.**

  - **Action:** Amend Rule 2 to recognize that strong electron-donating groups like amino groups can enhance yield even without extended aliphatic chains.
  - **Explanation:** 4-Aminobenzoic acid (entry 4) shows high yield despite lacking an extended aliphatic chain. Including this exception will align the rule with observed data.
  - **Revised Rule 2:** *Aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-donating groups (e.g., amino) at the para position result in high yield; the presence of extended aliphatic chains can further enhance yield, but is not strictly necessary.*

- **Advice 3**: **Validate or consolidate rules based on single data points (Rules 5, 12, 13, 14).**

  - **Action:** Either gather more data to support these rules or consider merging them with related rules to improve reliability.
  - **Explanation:** Rules supported by only one example have limited predictive power. For instance:
    - **Rule 5:** Seek additional modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups to confirm its validity.
    - **Rule 12 and 13:** Incorporate their unique cases into broader rules or note them as specific exceptions.
  - **Suggestion:** Merge Rule 5 into Rule 1 or Rule 4 if applicable, or reclassify these modifiers under existing rules with added conditions.

- **Advice 4**: **Combine Rule 15 with Rule 2 to reduce redundancy and enhance clarity.**

  - **Action:** Integrate Rule 15 into Rule 2, as both address how the lack of electron-donating groups on aromatic carboxylic acids leads to low yield.
  - **Explanation:** Consolidating these rules will eliminate overlap and simplify the rule set, making it easier to apply.
  - **Revised Rule 2:** *Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., amino, hydroxy) result in high yield; those without electron-donating substituents or with electron-withdrawing groups result in low yield.*

- **Advice 5**: **Refine rules to account for chain length and substituent effects more precisely.**

  - **Action:** Develop rules that consider the combined influence of chain length, substituent type, and position on the yield.
  - **Explanation:** Some modifiers (e.g., 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid) do not fit neatly into existing rules. A more nuanced approach can improve rule accuracy.
  - **Suggestion:** Create sub-rules or additional conditions within existing rules to account for these factors.

- **Advice 6**: **Include exceptions and conditions explicitly within the rules.**

  - **Action:** Update rules to acknowledge known exceptions, providing reasons for deviations.
  - **Explanation:** This enhances rule robustness and assists users in understanding when exceptions may occur.
  - **Example:** In Rule 1, note that tryptophan is an exception due to its indole ring.

- **Advice 7**: **Expand the dataset to strengthen support for underrepresented rules and improve overall rule reliability.**

  - **Action:** Investigate additional modifiers that fit the criteria of less-supported rules to confirm their validity.
  - **Explanation:** A larger dataset will provide a better foundation for rule creation and adjustment, increasing confidence in predictions.

- **Advice 8**: **Reassess and refine rules with overlapping or similar scopes to avoid contradictions.**

  - **Action:** Review all rules for overlap and potential contradictions, merging or redefining them as necessary.
  - **Explanation:** This ensures consistency across the rule set and prevents confusion when applying the rules.
  - **Suggestion:** Ensure that modifiers like 4-aminobenzoic acid are consistently categorized within the revised rules.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear in its structural description, allowing unambiguous classification of modifiers based on the presence of free amino and carboxyl groups on short aliphatic chains without bulky or aromatic side chains. It provides good physical-chemical insight by explaining how these groups facilitate high yield and how bulky or aromatic side chains lower yield due to steric hindrance or electronic effects. The rule considers combinations of substructures (functional groups and chain length), adding appropriate complexity. It is well-supported by multiple data points (e.g., aspartic acid and 5-aminopentanoic acid yielding high; phenylalanine yielding low), demonstrating good coverage.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 offers a clear structural guideline by combining electron-donating groups at the para position with extended aliphatic chains, aiding in classification. It provides physical-chemical insight by linking the electron-donating ability and chain extension to improved yield. The rule incorporates combinations of substructures, enhancing complexity. However, there is a discrepancy in the dataset: 4-aminobenzoic acid is listed as low yield in the rule but shows high yield in the dataset. This inconsistency affects clarity and coverage, indicating that the rule may not fully capture all influencing factors.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 distinctly differentiates between modifiers with nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to carboxylic groups (high yield) and those indirectly attached or with bulky substituents (low yield), providing clarity. It offers insight by suggesting that direct attachment aids in effective coordination with the metal center. The rule considers specific substructures, adding complexity. However, the example of 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid shows high yield despite the heterocycle being indirectly attached, which contradicts the rule. This inconsistency affects the rule's clarity and coverage.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear and straightforward, specifying that long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without polar groups result in high yield, while introducing polar groups lowers the yield. It provides good physical-chemical insight by associating non-polar chains with better interaction or solubility properties favorable for the reaction. The rule combines chain length and functional group presence, adding complexity. It is well-supported by multiple data points (e.g., octanoic acid yielding high; 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid yielding low), ensuring good coverage.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 clearly identifies modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group on aliphatic chains as resulting in high yield. It provides physical-chemical insight by suggesting these groups enhance coordination or reactivity with the catalyst. The rule considers specific structural combinations, adding appropriate complexity. It is supported by data (e.g., gluconic acid yielding high), but coverage is somewhat limited due to fewer examples, though it aligns with observed trends.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 offers clarity by distinguishing between thiol groups on aliphatic chains (high yield) and on aromatic rings (low yield), explaining that the latter may lead to catalyst poisoning. It provides solid physical-chemical insight and considers combinations of substructures, adding complexity. The rule has good coverage, supported by data points like 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid yielding high and 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid yielding low.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear in its identification of modifiers with flexible ether chains and terminal carboxyl groups resulting in low yield due to steric hindrance and dilution at the catalyst surface. It provides adequate physical-chemical insight and considers specific structural combinations, contributing to complexity. The rule is supported by data (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid yielding low), ensuring reasonable coverage.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 clearly states that strong electron-withdrawing groups lead to low yield, providing insight into how decreased electron density hampers coordination with the metal center. The rule focuses on specific substructures, offering appropriate complexity. It is supported by data points such as perfluorinated acids yielding low, demonstrating good coverage.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear in identifying aldehyde-containing modifiers, especially on aromatic rings, as resulting in low yield due to potential side reactions and catalyst deactivation. It provides solid physical-chemical insight and focuses on specific functional groups, adding complexity. The rule has good coverage, supported by data (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid yielding low).

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 clearly indicates that N-acetylated amino acids or modifiers with peptide bonds result in low yield due to steric hindrance and blocked coordination sites. It provides relevant physical-chemical insight and considers combinations of substructures (acetylation and peptide bonds), adding complexity. The rule is supported by data (e.g., N-acetylated amino acids yielding low), ensuring good coverage.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 offers clarity by linking high yield to electron-rich aromatic systems directly attached to extended aliphatic chains and low yield to shorter chains or lack of electron-donating substituents. It provides physical-chemical insight into how these features enhance interactions with the catalyst. The rule considers substructure combinations, adding complexity. It has good coverage, supported by data (e.g., 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid yielding high and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid yielding low).

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is clear in identifying modifiers with halomethyl groups on aromatic rings as resulting in high yield due to increased reactivity. It provides physical-chemical insight, but the rule focuses on a very specific substructure, which may limit complexity. Coverage is limited as it is supported by a single data point (4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid), indicating a need for more data to strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 clearly states that modifiers with indole or extended conjugated systems attached to amino acid backbones result in high yield due to enhanced π-interactions.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Revise Rule 2 to address inconsistencies with electron-donating groups on simple aromatic carboxylic acids.** The current rule states that simple aromatic acids without extended aliphatic chains result in low yield, but 4-aminobenzoic acid (entry 4) shows high yield despite lacking an extended chain. Modify Rule 2 to account for strong electron-donating groups (e.g., amino groups) on the aromatic ring that can enhance yield even without extended aliphatic chains. Consider specifying that **simple aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-donating groups at the para position can result in high yield**, regardless of the chain extension.

- **Advice 2**: **Adjust Rule 3 to incorporate exceptions where indirect attachment of nitrogen heterocycles still leads to high yield.** The rule currently predicts low yield for modifiers where the heterocycle is indirectly attached, but 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid (entry 24) shows high yield despite the pyridine ring being connected via an aliphatic linker. Revise Rule 3 to include that **nitrogen heterocycles connected through short aliphatic chains (e.g., one to four carbons) to the carboxylic acid group can still result in high yield**, as the linker may not significantly hinder coordination with the metal center.

- **Advice 3**: **Combine or generalize Rules 12, 13, and 14 due to limited data support.** These rules are based on single data points, reducing their reliability. Consider merging them into a broader rule that captures the common underlying feature, such as **"Modifiers containing functional groups capable of enhanced π-interactions or multidentate coordination (e.g., halomethyl groups, indole systems, cyclic imides) can lead to high yield due to strengthened interactions with the catalyst."** This generalization increases coverage and applicability while acknowledging the limited data.

- **Advice 4**: **Expand Rule 5 by providing more examples and clarifying its scope.** The rule currently relies on a single example (gluconic acid) and lacks sufficient supporting data. To strengthen Rule 5, include additional modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups and observe their yields. Alternatively, broaden the rule to encompass modifiers with **multiple coordinating functional groups (e.g., hydroxyls, amines) adjacent to the carboxyl group on an aliphatic chain**, which may enhance chelation and result in high yield.

- **Advice 5**: **Reevaluate Rule 11 to address exceptions related to chain length and electronic effects.** The current rule suggests that shorter chains lead to low yield, but there may be other factors at play. Investigate whether steric hindrance, conformational flexibility, or specific positioning of electron-donating groups affect the yield. Update the rule to reflect that **both chain length and the spatial arrangement of electron-donating groups influence the yield**, providing a more accurate prediction.

- **Advice 6**: **Ensure all rules are consistent with the dataset by thoroughly cross-referencing and updating them as necessary.** Review each rule in the context of all available data points to identify and correct discrepancies. This may involve redefining rules that have exceptions, merging overlapping rules (e.g., combining Rules 2 and 15 regarding aromatic carboxylic acids), and refining the criteria to improve clarity and predictive power.

- **Advice 7**: **Collect additional data for modifiers that are underrepresented to strengthen rules with limited coverage.** For rules like 12, 13, and 14, gather more experimental results for modifiers containing halomethyl groups, indole systems, and cyclic imide structures. This will either validate the rules or provide new insights that can lead to rule refinement or elimination if patterns do not hold.

- **Advice 8**: **Incorporate consideration of steric and electronic factors in rules where exceptions occur.** For instance, in Rule 2 and Rule 3, exceptions may be due to factors like resonance effects, the presence of additional functional groups, or conformational flexibility. Adjust the rules to account for these factors by specifying conditions under which they override the general trend.

- **Advice 9**: **Clarify ambiguous terms in the rules to improve understanding.** For example, specify what constitutes a "bulky" side chain or "extended" aliphatic chain by defining the number of carbons or describing the structural features. This will help in unambiguously categorizing modifiers and predicting their yields accurately.

- **Advice 10**: **Provide more detailed explanations in the rules' rationales to convey the underlying chemical principles.** Enhance the physical-chemical insights by explaining how specific functional groups affect coordination chemistry, electronic distribution, and steric interactions with the catalyst. This will not only improve the rules but also aid in the design of new modifiers.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: *Amino acids with free amino and carboxyl groups generally result in **high yield**. Side chains that enhance coordination with the metal center, such as those containing electron-rich heterocycles (e.g., indole rings), further promote high yield. Modifications that block the amino group (e.g., **N**-acetylation) or side chains that do not enhance coordination may result in **low yield**.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (glutamic acid), (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan)
    - **Low Yield:** (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine)

- **Rule 2**: *Aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-donating groups (e.g., amino, hydroxy) at the para position result in **high yield** due to enhanced coordination with the catalyst. The absence of such groups or the presence of electron-withdrawing substituents leads to **low yield**.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 4-aminobenzoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-formylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxylic acid group result in **high yield**. If the heterocycle is indirectly attached or bears bulky substituents, the yield is **low** due to steric hindrance or reduced coordination efficiency.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (nicotinic acid), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 4**: *Long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (6 or more carbons) without additional polar functional groups result in **high yield** due to favorable hydrophobic interactions. Introducing polar groups (e.g., hydroxy, amino) onto the chain decreases the yield to **low** because of increased polarity and potential interference with catalyst coordination.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** Octanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group on an aliphatic chain result in **high yield** due to enhanced hydrogen bonding and coordination potential. Single hydroxyl groups or those on aromatic rings without adjacency do not have the same effect and may result in **low yield**.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid)
    - **Low Yield:** 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers containing thiol groups on short aliphatic chains lead to **high yield** due to the thiol's ability to coordinate with metal centers. Thiol groups on aromatic rings result in **low yield** due to potential catalyst poisoning from strong or irreversible binding.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers with flexible ether chains (e.g., polyethylene glycol-like structures) and terminal carboxyl groups result in **low yield**. This is due to increased steric hindrance and reduced effective concentration at the catalyst surface.*

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., perfluoroalkyl chains, trifluoroacetyl groups) result in **low yield** due to decreased electron density and poor coordination ability with the metal center.*

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid, 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers containing aldehyde or ketone groups, especially on aromatic rings adjacent to the carboxyl group, result in **low yield** due to potential side reactions and catalyst deactivation.*

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers that are **N**-acetylated amino acids or contain peptide bonds result in **low yield** due to steric hindrance and blocked coordination sites from the capped amino groups.*

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic systems directly attached to extended aliphatic chains enhance yield, resulting in **high yield**. This is due to increased hydrophobic interactions and potential π-cation interactions with the catalyst. Shorter chains or lack of electron-donating substituents result in **low yield**.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (shorter chain)

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers containing halomethyl groups on aromatic rings result in **high yield** due to increased reactivity and potential for additional interactions with the catalyst.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers with extended conjugated systems containing heteroatoms (e.g., oxygen, nitrogen) directly attached to the carboxyl group result in **high yield** due to multiple coordination sites and enhanced interactions with the catalyst.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers with bulky substituents or groups that increase steric hindrance near the functional groups result in **low yield** due to restricted access to the catalyst's active site.*

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 15**: *Simple aromatic carboxylic acids lacking electron-donating substituents or possessing electron-withdrawing groups result in **low yield** due to poor coordination ability and decreased electron density.*

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 4-methylbenzoic acid, 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: The code only implements Rules 1 to 10, but the natural language specifies Rules 1 to 15. It is necessary to include all the rules in the code to ensure full coverage of the rules outlined.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: In **Rule 1**, the code requires the molecule to match all three patterns: primary amine, carboxylic acid, and indole ring simultaneously, due to the way `patterns` are defined as lists of lists which are all required to match. However, according to the natural language rule, high yield is expected for amino acids with free amino and carboxyl groups in general, and the presence of side chains with electron-rich heterocycles (e.g., indole rings) further promotes high yield. Therefore, the indole ring should be an optional pattern that, if present, still satisfies the rule but should not be a requirement. The code should be adjusted to reflect this by allowing the presence of either the basic amino acid structure or one that includes electron-rich heterocycles.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: The exclude pattern for N-acetylation in **Rule 1** (`n_acetyl = '[NX3][C](=O)[#6]'`) may incorrectly exclude molecules that have peptide bonds or amide bonds in other parts of the molecule. This pattern needs to be more specific to N-acetylation at the amino group of amino acids. A more accurate SMARTS pattern might be `[NHX3][CX3](=O)[CH3]` to specifically target N-acetyl groups.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: In **Rule 2**, the patterns for para-amino and para-hydroxy groups (`para_amino` and `para_hydroxy`) may match amino or hydroxy groups at any position on the aromatic ring rather than specifically at the para position. To correct this, the SMARTS patterns should be adjusted to ensure that the substituents are indeed at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid group. For example, use `c1ccc([NX3;H2,H1])cc1C(=O)[O;H1,H0-]` for para-amino and `c1ccc(O)cc1C(=O)[O;H1,H0-]` for para-hydroxy.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: For **Rule 3**, the SMARTS pattern for nitrogen heterocycles attached directly to the carboxylic acid group (`nitrogen_heterocycle_carboxylic_acid = '[nH0][cH1][cH1][cH1][cH1][cH1][C](=O)[O;H1,H0-]'`) is very specific and might not capture all relevant nitrogen heterocycles. It would be better to generalize this pattern to include various nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly bonded to the carboxylic acid. For example, use `[n][c][c][c][C](=O)[O;H1,H0-]` to capture a broader range of heterocycles.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: In **Rule 4**, the pattern `long_chain_carboxylic_acid` matches only a specific chain length and structure (`'[CH3][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][C](=O)[O;H1,H0-]'`). To encompass long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with 6 or more carbons, the pattern should be modified to allow for variable chain lengths. One way to do this is to use recursive SMARTS, such as `'*'CCCCC[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'`, or specifically `[CH3][CH2]{4,}[C](=O)[O;H1,H0-]` to denote chains of at least 6 carbons.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: For **Rule 5**, the pattern for multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group (`multiple_adjacent_hydroxyls`) is very strict and might miss valid compounds. The pattern can be adjusted to allow various numbers and positions of hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group. Using a more flexible pattern like `[CX4H](O)[CX4H](O)[CX4H](O)[CX4H](O)[CX4H](O)[C](=O)[O;H1,H0-]` or incorporating recursive patterns to match varying numbers of adjacent hydroxyl groups would improve accuracy.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: In **Rule 7**, the pattern for flexible ether chains (`flexible_ether_chain`) is specific and might not match all modifiers described in the rule. A more general pattern like `*[OX2][CH2][CH2][OX2][CH2][CH2][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` would capture a broader range of flexible ether chains with terminal carboxyl groups.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: For **Rule 8**, the pattern for strong electron-withdrawing groups (`perfluoroalkyl_chain = '[CX4]([F])([F])[F]'`) matches trifluoromethyl groups but may not capture perfluoroalkyl chains longer than one carbon. Adjust the pattern to `[*][CX4]([F])([F])[F]`, possibly with repetition for longer chains, or use `[CX4][CX4](F)(F)F` to match perfluoroalkyl chains.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Ensure that logical operators (AND, OR) are applied correctly when combining SMARTS patterns. Some rules may require that patterns match in combination (AND), while others may require any one of multiple patterns (OR). Adjust the implementation to reflect this, possibly by restructuring how patterns and pattern groups are processed in the code.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: Include the missing **Rules 11 to 15** from the natural language rules in the code, ensuring that SMARTS patterns accurately represent the described chemical features.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: Test each SMARTS pattern individually against known molecules to validate that they correctly match the intended functional groups. This can be done using cheminformatics tools like RDKit to prevent mismatches and false negatives/positives.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Translate Qualitative Rules into Quantitative Descriptors**  
  Convert the qualitative aspects of the current rules into quantifiable molecular descriptors that can be directly computed from the SMILES strings. For example:
  - For electron-donating or withdrawing groups (Rules 2, 8, 15), assign Hammett sigma constants or use electron density calculations.
  - For steric hindrance (Rules 3, 7, 14), calculate molecular volume or steric parameters like Taft's steric constants.

- **Advice 2**: **Standardize Molecular Features Across Modifiers**  
  Identify common structural features among the modifiers and encode them into binary or numerical features. For instance:
  - Presence of functional groups (e.g., amino group, carboxyl group, hydroxyl group) can be represented as binary variables.
  - Count of specific atoms or bonds (e.g., number of nitrogen atoms, aromatic rings).

- **Advice 3**: **Utilize Descriptor Calculation Software**  
  Employ cheminformatics tools (e.g., RDKit, ChemAxon) to calculate molecular descriptors such as:
  - Topological descriptors (e.g., molecular weight, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors).
  - Electronic descriptors (e.g., partial charges, HOMO-LUMO gap).
  - Geometric descriptors (e.g., molecular surface area, volume).

- **Advice 4**: **Implement Physicochemical Properties**  
  Include properties like LogP (octanol-water partition coefficient), which can reflect hydrophobic interactions mentioned in Rules 4 and 11.

- **Advice 5**: **Develop a Feature Encoding Scheme for Functional Groups**  
  Create a systematic encoding for different functional groups based on their ability to coordinate with metal centers or participate in hydrogen bonding:
  - Assign scores to functional groups (e.g., thiol = 2, amino = 1, hydroxyl = 1).
  - Sum the scores for each molecule to get a numeric value representing coordination potential.

- **Advice 6**: **Quantify Steric Effects with 3D Descriptors**  
  For modifiers where steric hindrance affects yield (e.g., Rules 3, 7, 14), calculate 3D descriptors:
  - Use molecular modeling to compute Connolly surface area or van der Waals volume.
  - Assess flexibility by calculating the number of rotatable bonds.

- **Advice 7**: **Incorporate Substituent Position and Chain Length Numerically**  
  Encode the position of substituents on aromatic rings or chain length in aliphatic carboxylic acids:
  - Use numerical values to represent position (e.g., para = 1, meta = 2, ortho = 3).
  - Include chain length as the number of carbon atoms in the longest chain.

- **Advice 8**: **Encode Electronic Effects Quantitatively**  
  For rules involving electron-rich or electron-poor systems (Rules 2, 8, 15):
  - Calculate molecular orbital energies.
  - Use electronegativity or polarizability descriptors.

- **Advice 9**: **Create a Structured Feature Matrix Template**  
  Design a template for the feature matrix where each row corresponds to a modifier and columns represent calculated descriptors. Ensure consistency in the descriptors used across all modifiers.

- **Advice 10**: **Address Potential Multicollinearity**  
  Be cautious of high correlations between descriptors. Use dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA) if necessary to prevent multicollinearity from affecting model performance.

- **Advice 11**: **Update Rules with Quantitative Thresholds**  
  Revise the rules to include specific numerical thresholds:
  - For example, specify that a Hammett sigma constant less than a certain value leads to high yield.
  - Define chain length ranges that correlate with high or low yield.

- **Advice 12**: **Consider Machine Learning Feature Selection Methods**  
  Use statistical methods to determine which descriptors are most predictive of yield:
  - Implement feature importance analysis from decision trees or random forests.
  - Apply logistic regression coefficients to assess feature impact.

- **Advice 13**: **Validate and Iterate on the Feature Set**  
  Test the generated feature matrix with preliminary models to assess predictive power. Adjust the descriptors based on model performance and continue refining the rules accordingly.

- **Advice 14**: **Document the Descriptor Calculation Process**  
  Ensure that the methods used to calculate each descriptor are well-documented for reproducibility:
  - Provide details on software used, parameter settings, and computational methods.

- **Advice 15**: **Engage Domain Experts for Complex Features**  
  Consult with chemists or materials scientists to capture complex interactions that may not be easily quantifiable:
  - For example, metal coordination chemistry may require specialized descriptors.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are amino acids with free amino and carboxyl groups result in **high yield**. The presence of side chains containing electron-rich groups like indole rings enhances yield due to better coordination with the metal center. N-acetylated amino acids or those with bulky or electron-withdrawing side chains result in **low yield** because of steric hindrance and reduced coordination ability.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (glutamic acid), (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan)
    - **Low Yield:** (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine)

- **Rule 2**: *Aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-donating groups such as amino or hydroxy at the para position result in **high yield** due to enhanced electron density and better coordination with the catalyst. Aromatic acids lacking these groups or containing electron-withdrawing substituents lead to **low yield**.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 4-aminobenzoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-formylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group result in **high yield** due to the ability of nitrogen to coordinate with the metal center. If the heterocycle is indirectly attached or has bulky substituents, the yield is **low** because of steric hindrance or reduced coordination efficiency.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (nicotinic acid), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 4**: *Long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with six or more carbons and without additional polar functional groups result in **high yield** due to favorable hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst. Introduction of polar groups like hydroxy or amino groups decreases the yield to **low** because they increase polarity and may interfere with catalyst coordination.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** octanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers possessing multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group on an aliphatic chain result in **high yield** due to enhanced hydrogen bonding and coordination potential. Modifiers with single or non-adjacent hydroxyl groups, especially on long chains or aromatic rings, tend to result in **low yield**.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid)
    - **Low Yield:** 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers containing thiol groups on short aliphatic chains lead to **high yield** due to the thiol's ability to coordinate with metal centers. Thiol groups on aromatic rings result in **low yield** because they may strongly bind and potentially poison the catalyst.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups such as perfluoroalkyl chains or trifluoroacetyl groups result in **low yield** due to decreased electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, leading to poor coordination with the metal center.*

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid, 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers featuring flexible ether chains (e.g., polyethylene glycol-like structures) linked to a terminal carboxyl group result in **low yield**. This is attributed to increased steric hindrance and reduced effective concentration at the catalyst surface.*

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers containing aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid, especially on aromatic rings, result in **low yield** due to potential side reactions with the catalyst and possible deactivation.*

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic systems connected via an aliphatic chain of four or more carbons to a carboxylic acid result in **high yield**. Such structures enhance hydrophobic and π-cation interactions with the catalyst. Shorter chains or absence of electron-donating substituents reduce yield to **low**.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are N-acetylated amino acids or contain peptide bonds result in **low yield** due to steric hindrance and blocked coordination sites, which prevent effective interaction with the catalyst.*

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers with bulky substituents or sterically hindered groups near the carboxyl functional group result in **low yield** because they restrict access to the catalyst's active site and impede effective coordination.*

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers containing halomethyl groups on aromatic rings result in **high yield** due to increased reactivity and potential for additional interactions with the catalyst, which can enhance catalytic activity.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers with extended conjugated systems containing heteroatoms (e.g., oxygen, nitrogen) directly attached to the carboxyl group result in **high yield**. These structures provide multiple coordination sites and stronger interactions with the catalyst.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers with flexible aminoalkyl ether chains linked to a carboxylic acid result in **low yield** due to increased polarity and steric hindrance, which negatively affect catalyst interaction.*

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are amino acids with free amino and carboxyl groups result in **high yield**. The presence of side chains containing electron-rich groups like indole rings enhances yield due to better coordination with the metal center. N-acetylated amino acids or those with bulky or electron-withdrawing side chains result in **low yield** because of steric hindrance and reduced coordination ability.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (glutamic acid), (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan)
    - **Low Yield:** (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine)

- **Rule 2**: *Aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-donating groups such as amino or hydroxy at the para position result in **high yield** due to enhanced electron density and better coordination with the catalyst. Aromatic acids lacking these groups or containing electron-withdrawing substituents lead to **low yield**.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 4-aminobenzoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-formylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group result in **high yield** due to the ability of nitrogen to coordinate with the metal center. If the heterocycle is indirectly attached or has bulky substituents, the yield is **low** because of steric hindrance or reduced coordination efficiency.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (nicotinic acid), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 4**: *Long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with six or more carbons and without additional polar functional groups result in **high yield** due to favorable hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst. Introduction of polar groups like hydroxy or amino groups decreases the yield to **low** because they increase polarity and may interfere with catalyst coordination.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** octanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers possessing multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group on an aliphatic chain result in **high yield** due to enhanced hydrogen bonding and coordination potential. Modifiers with single or non-adjacent hydroxyl groups, especially on long chains or aromatic rings, tend to result in **low yield**.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid)
    - **Low Yield:** 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers containing thiol groups on short aliphatic chains lead to **high yield** due to the thiol's ability to coordinate with metal centers. Thiol groups on aromatic rings result in **low yield** because they may strongly bind and potentially poison the catalyst.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups such as perfluoroalkyl chains or trifluoroacetyl groups result in **low yield** due to decreased electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, leading to poor coordination with the metal center.*

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid, 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers featuring flexible ether chains (e.g., polyethylene glycol-like structures) linked to a terminal carboxyl group result in **low yield**. This is attributed to increased steric hindrance and reduced effective concentration at the catalyst surface.*

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers containing aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid, especially on aromatic rings, result in **low yield** due to potential side reactions with the catalyst and possible deactivation.*

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic systems connected via an aliphatic chain of four or more carbons to a carboxylic acid result in **high yield**. Such structures enhance hydrophobic and π-cation interactions with the catalyst. Shorter chains or absence of electron-donating substituents reduce yield to **low**.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are N-acetylated amino acids or contain peptide bonds result in **low yield** due to steric hindrance and blocked coordination sites, which prevent effective interaction with the catalyst.*

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers with bulky substituents or sterically hindered groups near the carboxyl functional group result in **low yield** because they restrict access to the catalyst's active site and impede effective coordination.*

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers containing halomethyl groups on aromatic rings result in **high yield** due to increased reactivity and potential for additional interactions with the catalyst, which can enhance catalytic activity.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers with extended conjugated systems containing heteroatoms (e.g., oxygen, nitrogen) directly attached to the carboxyl group result in **high yield**. These structures provide multiple coordination sites and stronger interactions with the catalyst.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers with flexible aminoalkyl ether chains linked to a carboxylic acid result in **low yield** due to increased polarity and steric hindrance, which negatively affect catalyst interaction.*

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Correct the Logical Structure in the Code**  
  Review and adjust the logical flow used for pattern matching in the code. Currently, the code requires that all pattern groups (`compiled_patterns`) must match for a rule to be considered a match. This approach may not align with the intended logic of the natural language rules, where some patterns are meant to be alternatives (logical "OR") rather than cumulative requirements (logical "AND"). Modify the code so that it accurately reflects the intended logical relationships, allowing for "OR" conditions within and across pattern groups as specified by each rule.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Revise SMARTS Patterns to Accurately Represent Chemical Structures**  
  Carefully review and correct the SMARTS patterns for each rule to ensure they precisely correspond to the chemical structures described in the natural language rules. For example, in **Rule 1**, the pattern should capture the amino acid backbone with free amino (`-NH₂`) and carboxyl (`-COOH`) groups, and optionally include electron-rich side chains like indole rings. Adjust patterns to avoid overly broad or overly restrictive matches, ensuring they neither miss relevant structures nor capture unintended ones.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Separate Alternative Patterns Using Logical "OR" Conditions**  
  For rules that list alternative patterns (e.g., structures that can either have feature A *or* feature B), ensure that these alternatives are correctly implemented using logical "OR" conditions. In the code, this means that if any one of the alternative patterns matches, the rule should be considered a match. Adjust the pattern groupings and the matching logic to reflect this.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Apply Exclude Patterns Correctly**  
  Verify that the `exclude_patterns` are correctly applied in the code. The current implementation may not effectively exclude molecules that match the exclusion criteria. Modify the code to ensure that if a molecule matches any of the `exclude_patterns` for a rule, it should be excluded from matching that rule, even if it matches the positive patterns.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Use More Specific and Accurate SMARTS Patterns**  
  Enhance the specificity of the SMARTS patterns to accurately capture the structural details required by each rule. For instance, in **Rule 5**, to detect multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near a carboxyl group, the SMARTS pattern should explicitly define the adjacency and proximity to the carboxyl group. Avoid using overly generic patterns that might lead to false positives.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Test Rules with Known Examples**  
  For each rule, test the SMARTS patterns against the provided example molecules (both high-yield and low-yield examples) to validate that the patterns correctly identify matches and non-matches. Adjust the patterns and logic based on these tests to ensure accurate representation.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Document the Logical Relationships in the Code**  
  Include clear comments or documentation in the code explaining the intended logical relationships for each rule, such as whether patterns within a group are meant to be combined with logical "AND" or "OR", and how different groups relate to each other. This will aid in understanding and maintaining the code.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Ensure Correct Alignment of Rules and Feature Matrix Columns**  
  Check the alignment between the rule numbering, the order of rules in the code, and the columns of the feature matrix. Misalignment can lead to incorrect interpretation of which rules are matched by each molecule. Ensure that the rules are numbered and ordered consistently throughout the code and the output.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Implement Logical Operators Explicitly in Code**  
  Explicitly implement logical operators in the code to reflect the natural language rules accurately. For example, use logical "AND" (`&`), "OR" (`|`), and "NOT" (`~`) operators in SMARTS patterns or in the code logic when combining patterns. This enhances clarity and correctness in pattern matching.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Include Error Handling and Validation**  
  Add error handling to manage cases where molecules cannot be parsed, or pattern matching fails unexpectedly. Graceful error handling will prevent the code from assigning incorrect feature values due to unhandled exceptions.

- **Suggestion 11**: **Develop Unit Tests for Pattern Matching**  
  Create unit tests for each rule that check whether the SMARTS patterns match the correct set of molecules and do not match incorrect ones. This will help validate that the patterns and logic accurately implement the rules and will facilitate maintenance and future updates.

- **Suggestion 12**: **Consider Using Chemical Libraries for Functional Group Detection**  
  Utilize chemical informatics libraries or built-in functions that can detect common functional groups and motifs, which may simplify SMARTS pattern definitions and improve accuracy. This can also reduce the complexity of patterns and make the code more robust.

- **Suggestion 13**: **Re-evaluate Exclusion Criteria in Patterns**  
  Review the exclusion criteria in the SMARTS patterns to ensure they are not unintentionally excluding molecules that should be matched. For example, excluding any aromatic atoms (`'a'`) might be too broad and prevent valid matches. Refine the exclusion patterns to target specific undesired features.

- **Suggestion 14**: **Optimize Pattern Groupings for Clarity**  
  Organize the SMARTS patterns within each rule to reflect their logical relationships clearly. Group patterns that are meant to be alternatives together, and separate those that must co-occur. This will make the code easier to read and debug.

- **Suggestion 15**: **Update Code to Accurately Reflect Rule Examples**  
  Ensure that the code and SMARTS patterns correspond with the examples provided in each rule. If certain examples are meant to match a rule, adjust the patterns so that they indeed match those examples when tested.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Performance**

Upon examining the current rule metrics in comparison to the reference metrics, we observe the following:

1. **Support**:

   - **Previous Train Support**: Approximately 16.67% to 18.45%.
   - **Current Train Support**: Ranges from 2.48% to 6.48%.

   The current rules have significantly lower support compared to the previous iterations. This indicates that the rules apply to a smaller subset of the training data.

2. **Confidence**:

   - **Previous Train Confidence**: Approximately 53.96% to 63.52%.
   - **Current Train Confidence**: Ranges from 61.36% to 63.17%.

   The current rules exhibit a slight improvement in confidence. Higher confidence means that when the rule conditions are met, there is a greater likelihood that the prediction is correct.

3. **Lift**:

   - **Previous Train Lift**: Approximately 1.0559 to 1.2048.
   - **Current Train Lift**: Ranges from 1.2282 to 1.2627.

   The lift has improved in the current rules. A higher lift indicates that the rule is more effective at predicting the outcome compared to random chance, and it suggests a stronger association between the rule conditions and the prediction.

4. **Leverage**:

   - **Previous Train Leverage**: Approximately -0.0041 to 0.0289.
   - **Current Train Leverage**: Ranges from 0.00234 to 0.00855.

   The leverage is positive but lower than the maximum in previous iterations. Positive leverage indicates that the rule has better predictive power than chance, but the low values suggest the improvement over chance is modest.

**Interpretation**

- **Improved Predictive Strength**: The increase in confidence and lift suggests that the current rules are better at predicting high yield when the rule conditions are met.

- **Reduced Applicability**: The decrease in support indicates that these rules cover a smaller portion of the dataset. While the rules are more accurate, they are applicable to fewer cases.

- **Trade-off Between Precision and Coverage**: There is a balance between having high confidence and lift (precision) and having high support (coverage). The current rules favor precision over coverage.

**Assessment of Local Minimum and Iterations**

- **Local Minimum**: The marginal improvements in confidence and lift, coupled with the decrease in support, suggest that the current optimization process may have reached a local minimum. Further iterations focusing solely on increasing confidence and lift might continue to reduce support, which is not desirable.

- **Sufficiency of Iterations**: Given that significant gains in confidence and lift are not observed in recent iterations, and support is decreasing, it may be time to reconsider the approach rather than continuing with more iterations that might yield diminishing returns.

**Recommendations for Improving the Current Rules**

1. **Increase Rule Support**:

   - **Generalize Rule Conditions**: Review the current rules to identify overly specific conditions that limit support. Relaxing some conditions may increase support while maintaining acceptable confidence and lift.
   - **Combine Overlapping Rules**: Merge rules that cover similar cases to create broader rules with higher support.

2. **Balance Precision and Coverage**:

   - **Set Thresholds**: Establish minimum acceptable levels for support, confidence, and lift. Aim for rules that meet these thresholds to ensure they are both accurate and broadly applicable.
   - **Optimize for F1 Score**: Consider using metrics like the F1 score that balance precision and recall (coverage) to guide rule development.

3. **Analyze Feature Importance**:

   - **Identify Key Predictors**: Use statistical methods or machine learning algorithms to determine which features most significantly impact yield.
   - **Focus on High-Impact Features**: Prioritize these features when developing new rules to improve overall performance.

4. **Review and Refine Existing Rules**:

   - **Simplify Complex Rules**: Complex rules may contribute to low support. Simplify rules where possible to make them more inclusive.
   - **Eliminate Redundant Rules**: Remove rules that do not contribute significantly to confidence or lift or that overlap with more effective rules.

5. **Incorporate Negative Examples**:

   - **Understand Low Yield Factors**: Analyze cases with low yield to identify common factors. This can help refine rules to better distinguish between high and low yield scenarios.
   - **Adjust Rules Accordingly**: Modify existing rules or create new ones that account for these negative factors.

6. **Cross-Validation**:

   - **Evaluate Rules on Test Data**: Assess the rules using a separate validation dataset to ensure they generalize well and are not overfitting the training data.
   - **Monitor Overfitting**: Be cautious of rules that perform well on training data but poorly on test data, indicating overfitting.

7. **Iterative Refinement with Feedback**:

   - **Incorporate Domain Expertise**: Consult with subject matter experts to validate the plausibility of the rules and gain insights that may not be apparent from the data alone.
   - **Iterate Based on Feedback**: Use expert feedback to refine rules further, enhancing both their theoretical soundness and practical applicability.

8. **Explore Additional Features**:

   - **Augment Data**: If possible, include additional relevant features that may improve rule performance.
   - **Feature Engineering**: Create new features through combinations or transformations of existing ones that might capture important relationships.

**Conclusion**

The current rules demonstrate improved predictive precision, as indicated by higher confidence and lift metrics. However, the decrease in support suggests that these rules are applicable to a smaller portion of the dataset, potentially limiting their usefulness in practice.

To enhance the performance of the rules:

- **Aim for a Balance**: Strive to develop rules that maintain high confidence and lift while increasing support.
- **Refine Rule Conditions**: Generalize overly specific conditions and focus on key features that contribute most to high yield.
- **Prevent Overfitting**: Validate the rules using separate datasets and be cautious of over-specialization.

By implementing these recommendations, the rules can be improved to provide both accurate and widely applicable predictions, enhancing the overall effectiveness of the research program.

ML Commenter Message:
**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

Based on the latest training results, the performance of the current rules has declined compared to previous iterations. The current classification model achieved an accuracy of **45.71%**, which is significantly lower than previous accuracies of **71.43%** and **68.57%**. This decrease suggests that the existing rules are not effectively capturing the patterns necessary to accurately predict the loading of modifiers on the catalyst.

**Assessing Overfitting/Underfitting**

The substantial drop in accuracy indicates that the model may be **underfitting** the data. The current rules might be too generalized or insufficiently detailed to capture the complexity of the relationships between molecular structures and catalyst loading. This underfitting results in poor performance on both the training and validation sets, suggesting that the rules do not adequately explain the variability in the data.

**Analyzing Discrepancies Using SHAP Values**

To identify which rules are contributing to misclassifications, we examine the SHAP values associated with each molecule.

1. **Underestimated Loadings (Predicted Low, Experimental High)**

   For molecules where the predicted loading is **low** but the experimental value is **high**, the rules with the most **negative SHAP values** for high loading are likely problematic.

   - **Molecule:** C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N
     - **Rule1 SHAP:** -0.0200
     - **Rule2 SHAP:** -0.0200
     - **Rule7 SHAP:** +0.0341
   - **Molecule:** C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O
     - **Rule1 SHAP:** -0.0200
     - **Rule2 SHAP:** -0.0200
     - **Rule7 SHAP:** +0.0341
   - **Molecule:** C1=CNC(=O)C=C1C(=O)O
     - **Rule1 SHAP:** -0.0200
     - **Rule2 SHAP:** -0.0200
     - **Rule7 SHAP:** +0.0341

   **Observation:** **Rule1** and **Rule2** consistently have negative SHAP values, suggesting they are contributing to the underestimation of high experimental loadings.

2. **Overestimated Loadings (Predicted High, Experimental Low)**

   For molecules where the predicted loading is **high** but the experimental value is **low**, the rules with the most **positive SHAP values** for high loading are likely problematic.

   - **Molecule:** CC(=O)NCCCC[C@@H](C(=O)O)N
     - **Rule1 SHAP:** -0.0178
     - **Rule2 SHAP:** 0.0000
     - **Rule7 SHAP:** +0.0378
   - **Molecule:** C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)S
     - **Rule1 SHAP:** 0.0000
     - **Rule2 SHAP:** -0.0178
     - **Rule7 SHAP:** +0.0378
   - **Molecule:** CSCC[C@@H](C(=O)NCC(=O)O)N
     - **Rule1 SHAP:** 0.0000
     - **Rule2 SHAP:** -0.0178
     - **Rule7 SHAP:** +0.0378

   **Observation:** **Rule7** has consistently positive SHAP values in these cases, indicating it may be causing overestimation in predicted loadings.

**Interpreting Accuracy Metrics**

The decrease in accuracy across iterations suggests that the current set of rules may not be improving the model's ability to generalize. The model's performance is not only lower on the training data but also does not seem to capture the underlying relationships effectively, reducing the likelihood of improvement without rule modifications.

**Deriving Insights from SHAP Analysis**

The SHAP analysis indicates that:

- **Rule1** and **Rule2** are contributing to the underestimation of high experimental loadings.
- **Rule7** is contributing to the overestimation of low experimental loadings.

This suggests that these rules may not be accurately reflecting the true influence of certain molecular features on catalyst loading.

---

**Recommendations for Improvement**

To enhance the accuracy and generalization of the model, the following suggestions are proposed:

1. **Refine Rule 1: Amino Acids with Free Amino and Carboxyl Groups**

   - **Issue Identified:** Negative SHAP values for molecules that should be high in loading indicate Rule1 may be too restrictive or not accounting for all relevant amino acids.
   - **Recommended Actions:**
     - **Expand Rule1 to Include Additional Amino Acids:** Consider including N-acetylated amino acids or those with bulky side chains if experimental data shows they result in high loading.
     - **Incorporate Side Chain Effects:** Analyze the impact of different side chains on coordination with the metal center and adjust the rule to reflect any correlations.

2. **Adjust Rule 2: Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Electron-Donating Groups**

   - **Issue Identified:** Negative SHAP values suggest Rule2 may not fully capture the effect of substituent position and type on electron density.
   - **Recommended Actions:**
     - **Evaluate Substituent Position:** Modify Rule2 to consider ortho and meta positions, as electron-donating effects can vary based on position.
     - **Include Additional Electron-Donating Groups:** Expand the rule to include other groups like methoxy or alkyl groups that may enhance electron density.

3. **Reassess Rule 7: Electron-Withdrawing Groups Result in Low Yield**

   - **Issue Identified:** Positive SHAP values for overestimated loadings indicate Rule7 may be overly generalizing the effect of electron-withdrawing groups.
   - **Recommended Actions:**
     - **Differentiate Between Electron-Withdrawing Groups:** Distinguish between strong and weak electron-withdrawing groups, and assess their individual impacts on catalyst loading.
     - **Consider Resonance Effects:** Account for resonance stabilization that may mitigate the electron-withdrawing nature of certain groups.

4. **Improve Generalization and Address Underfitting**

   - **Recommended Actions:**
     - **Incorporate Additional Features:** Introduce new molecular descriptors, such as steric parameters or quantum chemical properties, to capture more nuances.
     - **Use Regularization Techniques:** Implement methods like L1 or L2 regularization to prevent underfitting and improve model complexity.

5. **Iteratively Refine Rules Based on Misclassified Molecules**

   - **Focus on Misclassified Examples:** Examine molecules that are consistently misclassified to identify patterns or features not accounted for in the current rules.
   - **Update Rules Accordingly:** Modify existing rules or introduce new ones to incorporate these insights, ensuring they are based on solid chemical principles.

6. **Validate Rule Adjustments with Experimental Data**

   - **Recommended Actions:**
     - **Cross-Validate Changes:** Use cross-validation to test the impact of rule changes on model performance across different subsets of data.
     - **Seek External Verification:** Compare findings with literature or conduct additional experiments if feasible to confirm the validity of the modified rules.

7. **Simplify or Merge Overlapping Rules**

   - **Recommended Actions:**
     - **Identify Redundant Rules:** Assess whether some rules overlap or contradict each other, which may confuse the model.
     - **Consolidate Rules for Clarity:** Merge similar rules to reduce complexity and improve the model's ability to learn from the data.

8. **Consider the Influence of Multiple Functional Groups**

   - **Recommended Actions:**
     - **Account for Synergistic Effects:** Modify rules to consider combinations of functional groups and their collective impact on catalyst loading.
     - **Introduce Interaction Terms:** In the feature matrix, include interaction terms that capture the effects of multiple groups present in a molecule.

9. **Reevaluate Rule Weightings Based on SHAP Contributions**

   - **Recommended Actions:**
     - **Adjust Rule Importance:** Based on the magnitude of SHAP values, reweight the influence of each rule in the model.
     - **Implement Feature Selection:** Use techniques to identify and retain the most impactful rules while discarding or modifying less significant ones.

---

By implementing these recommendations, the rules can be better aligned with the underlying chemical phenomena influencing catalyst loading. This iterative refinement, guided by SHAP analysis and experimental data, should improve the model's accuracy and ability to generalize, ultimately enhancing the predictive power of the research program.

**Summary of Discussions and Current Challenges**

The analysis of the current rules for predicting the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction reveals several key points:

1. **Trade-off Between Precision and Coverage**:
   - **Improved Precision**: The latest rules show an increase in **confidence** and **lift**, indicating that when the rules apply, they are more likely to predict the yield correctly.
   - **Reduced Coverage**: There is a significant decrease in **support**, meaning the rules apply to a smaller subset of the data. This suggests that while the rules are precise, they are not comprehensive.

2. **Model Performance Decline**:
   - The **classification accuracy** has decreased from earlier values (e.g., from 71.43% to 45.71%), indicating that the rules are not effectively capturing the patterns necessary for accurate predictions across the dataset.
   - The model may be **underfitting**, failing to capture the complexity of the relationships between molecular structures and reaction yields.

3. **SHAP Analysis Insights**:
   - **Rule1** and **Rule2** are contributing to underestimations of high yields, as evidenced by negative SHAP values for molecules that experimentally have high yields.
   - **Rule7** is contributing to overestimations, with positive SHAP values for molecules that experimentally have low yields but are predicted to have high yields.

4. **Potential Overfitting Not Observed**:
   - The model's poor performance on both training and validation sets suggests underfitting rather than overfitting, implying that the rules are too simplistic or not adequately capturing the relevant features.

**Directions to Optimize Current Rules**

To improve the current rules and enhance the model's predictive performance, the following suggestions are proposed:

1. **Refine Specific Rules Based on SHAP Analysis**:

   - **Rule 1: Amino Acids with Free Amino and Carboxyl Groups**:
     - **Issue**: Negative SHAP values for molecules expected to have high yields indicate that Rule 1 may be too restrictive.
     - **Action**:
       - **Expand Inclusion Criteria**: Broaden the rule to include amino acids with modified side chains if they exhibit high yields experimentally.
       - **Consider Side Chain Effects**: Account for various side chains, including bulky or electron-rich groups, and their influence on coordination with the metal center.

   - **Rule 2: Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Electron-Donating Groups**:
     - **Issue**: The rule may not fully capture the effects of different substituents and their positions.
     - **Action**:
       - **Incorporate Substituent Position**: Modify the rule to consider ortho, meta, and para positions, as electron-donating effects can vary.
       - **Include Additional Groups**: Expand to other electron-donating groups like methoxy or alkyl groups that may enhance yield.

   - **Rule 7: Modifiers with Strong Electron-Withdrawing Groups Result in Low Yield**:
     - **Issue**: Overgeneralization may lead to incorrect predictions.
     - **Action**:
       - **Differentiate Between Electron-Withdrawing Groups**: Distinguish between groups based on their strength and specific effects on electron density.
       - **Consider Resonance and Inductive Effects**: Evaluate how these effects might mitigate or amplify electron-withdrawing properties.

2. **Improve Logical Structure and Pattern Matching in Code**:

   - **Implement Correct Logical Operators**:
     - Use logical "OR" conditions where appropriate to reflect alternative patterns within rules.
     - Ensure that "AND" conditions are only used when all specified patterns must be present.

   - **Apply Exclude Patterns Accurately**:
     - Modify the code so that if a molecule matches any of the exclude patterns, it is correctly excluded from matching the rule.

   - **Document Logical Relationships**:
     - Clearly specify in the code comments the intended logical relationships between patterns to aid in future maintenance and understanding.

3. **Enhance Specificity and Accuracy of SMARTS Patterns**:

   - **Revise SMARTS Patterns for Each Rule**:
     - Ensure that the patterns precisely correspond to the chemical structures described.
     - Avoid overly broad patterns that capture unintended molecules or overly narrow patterns that miss relevant ones.

   - **Use Chemical Informatics Libraries**:
     - Employ built-in functions or libraries capable of detecting functional groups, which can simplify pattern definitions and improve accuracy.

4. **Test and Validate Rules with Known Examples**:

   - **Confirm Expected Matches and Non-Matches**:
     - Use the provided examples to ensure that the SMARTS patterns correctly identify molecules that should match the rules.
     - Adjust patterns based on discrepancies observed during testing.

   - **Develop Unit Tests**:
     - Create tests for each rule to systematically validate the correctness of pattern matching.

5. **Increase Rule Support Without Sacrificing Precision**:

   - **Generalize Overly Specific Conditions**:
     - Relax certain conditions that may be unnecessarily restricting the applicability of the rules.
     - Merge overlapping rules to cover a broader range of molecules.

   - **Balance Complexity and Coverage**:
     - Aim for rules that strike a balance between being comprehensive and maintaining high confidence and lift.

6. **Incorporate Additional Molecular Features**:

   - **Explore New Descriptors**:
     - Introduce features such as steric hindrance, electronic effects, and molecular orbital contributions.
     - Consider quantitative descriptors like molecular weight, polar surface area, and partition coefficients.

   - **Feature Engineering**:
     - Create interaction terms or composite features that may capture complex relationships between molecular properties and yield.

7. **Iterative Refinement Based on Misclassifications**:

   - **Analyze Misclassified Molecules**:
     - Investigate patterns or features common among misclassified cases.
     - Adjust rules to account for these insights, ensuring they align with chemical reasoning.

   - **Consult Domain Experts**:
     - Engage with chemists to validate assumptions and gain insights into the catalytic mechanisms that may inform rule adjustments.

8. **Avoid Overfitting While Optimizing**:

   - **Use Cross-Validation**:
     - Validate rules across different subsets of data to ensure they generalize well.
     - Monitor performance metrics to detect signs of overfitting.

   - **Regularize Rule Complexity**:
     - Implement penalties for overly complex rules that do not significantly improve predictive performance.

9. **Align Code Implementation with Natural Language Rules**:

   - **Ensure Consistency**:
     - Verify that the logical relationships and conditions specified in the natural language rules are accurately reflected in the code.
     - Update the code to correct any misalignments, such as incorrect logical operators or pattern groupings.

10. **Optimize Rule Weightings Based on SHAP Values**:

    - **Adjust Rule Influence**:
      - Reevaluate the weight or importance assigned to each rule based on its contribution to prediction accuracy.
      - Consider reducing the influence of rules that contribute to misclassifications.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

There is considerable potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting:

- **Underfitting Concerns**: The model is currently underfitting, as indicated by low accuracy on both training and validation sets. This suggests that the model is too simplistic and can benefit from increased complexity.

- **Scope for Rule Refinement**: By refining rules based on systematic analysis and incorporating additional molecular features, the model can better capture the underlying relationships.

- **Balanced Approach**: Implementing the suggested improvements can increase both the coverage and precision of the rules, enhancing overall performance while mitigating the risk of overfitting.

**Conclusion**

By carefully refining the current rules, improving the logical structure in the code, and incorporating additional molecular insights, it is possible to enhance the predictive power of the model without overfitting. The focus should be on expanding the applicability of the rules while maintaining or improving their accuracy.

    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are amino acids with free amino and carboxyl groups result in **high yield**. The presence of side chains containing electron-rich groups like indole rings enhances yield due to better coordination with the metal center. N-acetylated amino acids or those with bulky or electron-withdrawing side chains result in **low yield** because of steric hindrance and reduced coordination ability.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (glutamic acid), (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan)
    - **Low Yield:** (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine)

- **Rule 2**: *Aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-donating groups such as amino or hydroxy at the para position result in **high yield** due to enhanced electron density and better coordination with the catalyst. Aromatic acids lacking these groups or containing electron-withdrawing substituents lead to **low yield**.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 4-aminobenzoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-formylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group result in **high yield** due to the ability of nitrogen to coordinate with the metal center. If the heterocycle is indirectly attached or has bulky substituents, the yield is **low** because of steric hindrance or reduced coordination efficiency.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (nicotinic acid), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 4**: *Long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with six or more carbons and without additional polar functional groups result in **high yield** due to favorable hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst. Introduction of polar groups like hydroxy or amino groups decreases the yield to **low** because they increase polarity and may interfere with catalyst coordination.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** octanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers possessing multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group on an aliphatic chain result in **high yield** due to enhanced hydrogen bonding and coordination potential. Modifiers with single or non-adjacent hydroxyl groups, especially on long chains or aromatic rings, tend to result in **low yield**.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid)
    - **Low Yield:** 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers containing thiol groups on short aliphatic chains lead to **high yield** due to the thiol's ability to coordinate with metal centers. Thiol groups on aromatic rings result in **low yield** because they may strongly bind and potentially poison the catalyst.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups such as perfluoroalkyl chains or trifluoroacetyl groups result in **low yield** due to decreased electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, leading to poor coordination with the metal center.*

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid, 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers featuring flexible ether chains (e.g., polyethylene glycol-like structures) linked to a terminal carboxyl group result in **low yield**. This is attributed to increased steric hindrance and reduced effective concentration at the catalyst surface.*

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers containing aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid, especially on aromatic rings, result in **low yield** due to potential side reactions with the catalyst and possible deactivation.*

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic systems connected via an aliphatic chain of four or more carbons to a carboxylic acid result in **high yield**. Such structures enhance hydrophobic and π-cation interactions with the catalyst. Shorter chains or absence of electron-donating substituents reduce yield to **low**.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are N-acetylated amino acids or contain peptide bonds result in **low yield** due to steric hindrance and blocked coordination sites, which prevent effective interaction with the catalyst.*

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers with bulky substituents or sterically hindered groups near the carboxyl functional group result in **low yield** because they restrict access to the catalyst's active site and impede effective coordination.*

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers containing halomethyl groups on aromatic rings result in **high yield** due to increased reactivity and potential for additional interactions with the catalyst, which can enhance catalytic activity.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers with extended conjugated systems containing heteroatoms (e.g., oxygen, nitrogen) directly attached to the carboxyl group result in **high yield**. These structures provide multiple coordination sites and stronger interactions with the catalyst.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers with flexible aminoalkyl ether chains linked to a carboxylic acid result in **low yield** due to increased polarity and steric hindrance, which negatively affect catalyst interaction.*

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **
- **Advice 1**: **Refine Rule 1 to Include a Broader Range of Amino Acids**

  - **Issue**: Rule 1 is too restrictive, excluding amino acids with modified side chains that may result in high yield.
  - **Action**: Expand Rule 1 to include amino acids with various side chains, including those with bulky or electron-rich groups, as long as the amino and carboxyl groups are free for coordination.
  - **Implementation**: Modify the SMARTS pattern for Rule 1 to capture all amino acids with free amino and carboxyl groups, unless the side chains directly interfere with coordination due to steric hindrance or strong electron-withdrawing effects.
  - **Example of Revised SMARTS Pattern**: `[NX3;H2][C@@H]([C])[C](=O)[O;H]` (captures amino acids with free amino and carboxyl groups, adjusting side chain specificity as needed).

- **Advice 2**: **Enhance Rule 2 by Considering Substituent Positions and Additional Electron-Donating Groups**

  - **Issue**: Rule 2 does not account for the effects of substituent position on the aromatic ring and is limited to specific groups.
  - **Action**: Modify Rule 2 to include electron-donating groups (e.g., -OH, -NH₂, -OCH₃, -CH₃) at any position on the aromatic ring and consider their cumulative effect on electron density.
  - **Implementation**: Adjust the SMARTS pattern to detect aromatic carboxylic acids with any electron-donating substituents, regardless of their position, enhancing coordination ability.
  - **Example of Revised SMARTS Pattern**: `[c][c]([OH,NH2,OCH3,CH3])[c][c][c][C](=O)[O;H]` (captures aromatic acids with electron-donating groups in any position).

- **Advice 3**: **Differentiate Electron-Withdrawing Groups in Rule 7 and Adjust Predictions**

  - **Issue**: Rule 7 may overgeneralize all electron-withdrawing groups, leading to incorrect low-yield predictions.
  - **Action**: Refine Rule 7 to focus on specific strong electron-withdrawing groups that significantly reduce coordination ability, such as perfluoroalkyl chains directly attached to the carboxyl group.
  - **Implementation**: Modify the SMARTS pattern to target molecules with strong electron-withdrawing groups adjacent to the carboxylate, differentiating them from less impactful groups.
  - **Example of Revised SMARTS Pattern**: `[CX4](F)(F)(F)[C](=O)[O;H]` (specifically captures trifluoromethyl groups adjacent to carboxylate).

- **Advice 4**: **Improve Logical Operators and Pattern Matching in Code**

  - **Issue**: Incorrect logical operators may cause unintended molecule matches or exclusions.
  - **Action**: Review and correct the logical structure in the code for each rule, ensuring the appropriate use of "AND" and "OR" operators to accurately reflect the intended conditions.
  - **Implementation**: For rules where multiple patterns can independently indicate high yield, use logical "OR" to combine them. Use "AND" only when all conditions must be met simultaneously.
  - **Example**: In code, replace `if (patternA and patternB):` with `if (patternA or patternB):` when either pattern A or B should trigger the rule.

- **Advice 5**: **Revise SMARTS Patterns to Enhance Specificity and Avoid Overly Broad or Narrow Definitions**

  - **Issue**: Some SMARTS patterns may be too broad or too narrow, leading to misclassification.
  - **Action**: Refine the SMARTS patterns to precisely match the intended molecular features, avoiding unnecessary wildcards or overly stringent specifications.
  - **Implementation**: Use precise atom and bond specifications in SMARTS patterns to accurately detect functional groups and avoid capturing unintended structures.
  - **Example**: Replace `[C][C](=O)[O]` (too broad) with `[CH2][C](=O)[O;H]` to specifically target primary carboxylic acids.

- **Advice 6**: **Test and Validate Rules with Known Examples**

  - **Issue**: Rules may not perform as expected due to discrepancies in pattern matching.
  - **Action**: Use the provided dataset to test each rule, confirming that molecules are correctly classified according to experimental yields.
  - **Implementation**: For each molecule in the dataset, verify if it matches the intended rule and adjust patterns as needed based on mismatches.
  - **Example**: Ensure that "4-aminobenzoic acid" is correctly identified by the updated Rule 2 and predicted to result in high yield.

- **Advice 7**: **Increase Rule Support Without Sacrificing Precision**

  - **Issue**: Current rules may be too specific, resulting in low coverage and underfitting.
  - **Action**: Generalize rules where appropriate to include more molecules while maintaining high precision, potentially by combining similar rules.
  - **Implementation**: Identify overlapping rules and merge them, or relax overly restrictive conditions that exclude relevant molecules.
  - **Example**: Combine Rules 1 and 3 if they both identify amino-containing molecules that coordinate well with the catalyst.

- **Advice 8**: **Incorporate Additional Molecular Features in the Rules**

  - **Issue**: Rules may not capture all factors influencing yield, such as steric effects or overall molecular polarity.
  - **Action**: Include descriptors like steric hindrance, hydrophobicity, and electronic effects in the rules to better predict outcomes.
  - **Implementation**: Adjust SMARTS patterns to account for steric bulk near functional groups or include additional conditions for hydrophobic interactions.
  - **Example**: Modify Rule 4 to specify that aliphatic chains should be unbranched to minimize steric hindrance.

- **Advice 9**: **Align Code Implementation with Natural Language Descriptions**

  - **Issue**: Discrepancies between the natural language rules and their code implementations can lead to errors.
  - **Action**: Review the code for each rule to ensure it accurately reflects the natural language description, making adjustments where inconsistencies are found.
  - **Implementation**: Update code comments to include the natural language rule, and verify that the code logic matches the intended criteria.
  - **Example**: If a rule states "modifiers with thiol groups on short aliphatic chains," ensure the code specifically looks for thiol groups attached to aliphatic chains of appropriate length.

- **Advice 10**: **Prioritize Refinement of Rules Based on SHAP Analysis**

  - **Issue**: Some rules have a greater impact on model predictions and should be refined first.
  - **Action**: Use SHAP values to identify rules contributing most to misclassifications and focus on optimizing these rules.
  - **Implementation**: Reevaluate and adjust rules like Rule 1 and Rule 2, which have significant negative SHAP values for high-yield molecules.
  - **Example**: Analyze why certain high-yield molecules are underestimated by Rule 1 and adjust the rule to better capture those cases.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are α-amino acids with free amino and carboxyl groups result in **high yield**. The presence of electron-rich side chains like indole rings enhances yield due to better coordination with the metal center. N-acetylated amino acids, those with bulky or electron-withdrawing side chains, or modified backbone structures result in **low yield** because of steric hindrance and reduced coordination ability.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (glutamic acid), (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan)
    - **Low Yield:** (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine), (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid

- **Rule 2**: *Aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-donating groups such as amino or hydroxy at the para position result in **high yield** due to enhanced electron density and better coordination with the catalyst. Aromatic acids lacking these groups or containing electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., formyl, methyl) lead to **low yield**.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 4-aminobenzoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 4-formylbenzoic acid, 4-methylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group result in **high yield** due to the ability of nitrogen to coordinate with the metal center. Indirect attachment via aromatic rings or bulky substituents near the carboxyl group reduces the yield to **low** because of steric hindrance or reduced coordination efficiency.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (nicotinic acid), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 4**: *Long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups result in **high yield** due to favorable hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst. Introduction of polar groups like hydroxy or amino groups decreases the yield to **low** because they increase polarity and may interfere with catalyst coordination.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** octanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers possessing multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups (polyols) near the carboxyl group on an aliphatic chain result in **high yield** due to enhanced hydrogen bonding and coordination potential. Modifiers with single or non-adjacent hydroxyl groups, especially on long chains or aromatic rings, result in **low yield**.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid)
    - **Low Yield:** 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers containing thiol groups on short aliphatic chains lead to **high yield** due to the thiol's ability to coordinate with metal centers. Thiol groups on aromatic rings result in **low yield** because they may strongly bind and potentially poison the catalyst.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups such as perfluoroalkyl chains or trifluoroacetyl groups result in **low yield** due to decreased electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, leading to poor coordination with the metal center.*

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid, 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers featuring flexible ether chains (e.g., polyethylene glycol-like structures) linked to a terminal carboxyl group result in **low yield**. This is attributed to increased steric hindrance and reduced effective concentration at the catalyst surface due to high polarity.*

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers containing aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid, especially on aromatic rings, result in **low yield** due to potential side reactions with the catalyst and possible deactivation.*

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic systems connected via an aliphatic chain of four or more carbons to a carboxylic acid result in **high yield**. Such structures enhance hydrophobic and π-cation interactions with the catalyst. Shorter chains or absence of electron-donating substituents reduce the yield to **low**.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers with bulky substituents or sterically hindered groups near the carboxyl functional group result in **low yield** because they restrict access to the catalyst's active site and impede effective coordination.*

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers with extended conjugated systems containing heteroatoms (e.g., oxygen, nitrogen) directly attached to the carboxyl group result in **high yield**. These structures provide multiple coordination sites and stronger interactions with the catalyst.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers containing halomethyl groups on aromatic rings result in **high yield** due to increased reactivity and potential for additional interactions with the catalyst, which can enhance catalytic activity.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers that are N-acetylated amino acids or contain peptide bonds result in **low yield** due to steric hindrance and blocked coordination sites, which prevent effective interaction with the catalyst.*

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are α-amino acids with free amino and carboxyl groups result in **high yield**. The presence of electron-rich side chains like indole rings enhances yield due to better coordination with the metal center. N-acetylated amino acids, those with bulky or electron-withdrawing side chains, or modified backbone structures result in **low yield** because of steric hindrance and reduced coordination ability.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (glutamic acid), (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan)
    - **Low Yield:** (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine), (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid

- **Rule 2**: *Aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-donating groups such as amino or hydroxy at the para position result in **high yield** due to enhanced electron density and better coordination with the catalyst. Aromatic acids lacking these groups or containing electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., formyl, methyl) lead to **low yield**.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 4-aminobenzoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 4-formylbenzoic acid, 4-methylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group result in **high yield** due to the ability of nitrogen to coordinate with the metal center. Indirect attachment via aromatic rings or bulky substituents near the carboxyl group reduces the yield to **low** because of steric hindrance or reduced coordination efficiency.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (nicotinic acid), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 4**: *Long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups result in **high yield** due to favorable hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst. Introduction of polar groups like hydroxy or amino groups decreases the yield to **low** because they increase polarity and may interfere with catalyst coordination.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** octanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers possessing multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups (polyols) near the carboxyl group on an aliphatic chain result in **high yield** due to enhanced hydrogen bonding and coordination potential. Modifiers with single or non-adjacent hydroxyl groups, especially on long chains or aromatic rings, result in **low yield**.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid)
    - **Low Yield:** 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers containing thiol groups on short aliphatic chains lead to **high yield** due to the thiol's ability to coordinate with metal centers. Thiol groups on aromatic rings result in **low yield** because they may strongly bind and potentially poison the catalyst.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups such as perfluoroalkyl chains or trifluoroacetyl groups result in **low yield** due to decreased electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, leading to poor coordination with the metal center.*

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid, 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers featuring flexible ether chains (e.g., polyethylene glycol-like structures) linked to a terminal carboxyl group result in **low yield**. This is attributed to increased steric hindrance and reduced effective concentration at the catalyst surface due to high polarity.*

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers containing aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid, especially on aromatic rings, result in **low yield** due to potential side reactions with the catalyst and possible deactivation.*

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic systems connected via an aliphatic chain of four or more carbons to a carboxylic acid result in **high yield**. Such structures enhance hydrophobic and π-cation interactions with the catalyst. Shorter chains or absence of electron-donating substituents reduce the yield to **low**.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers with bulky substituents or sterically hindered groups near the carboxyl functional group result in **low yield** because they restrict access to the catalyst's active site and impede effective coordination.*

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers with extended conjugated systems containing heteroatoms (e.g., oxygen, nitrogen) directly attached to the carboxyl group result in **high yield**. These structures provide multiple coordination sites and stronger interactions with the catalyst.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers containing halomethyl groups on aromatic rings result in **high yield** due to increased reactivity and potential for additional interactions with the catalyst, which can enhance catalytic activity.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers that are N-acetylated amino acids or contain peptide bonds result in **low yield** due to steric hindrance and blocked coordination sites, which prevent effective interaction with the catalyst.*

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: **Remove Chirality Constraints**: In Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern `'[C@@H](N)C(=O)O'` is overly specific due to the chirality notation `@@`. This can prevent matching molecules that are α-amino acids but may not have specified chirality in their SMILES representation. Modify the pattern to `'[CH](N)C(=O)O'` to match all α-amino acids regardless of chirality.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: **Treat Additional Patterns as Optional**: Currently, the code treats `additional_patterns` as mandatory, which conflicts with the natural language rules where these features enhance but are not required for high yield. Adjust the code so that `additional_patterns` contribute positively when present but do not cause the rule to fail if absent. This could involve adding a weighting system or modifying the logic to not set `match = False` when `additional_match` is `False`.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: **Correct Handling of Exclude Patterns**: Ensure that `exclude_patterns` are properly checked. If any exclude pattern matches, the rule should not apply. Verify that the code breaks out of loops correctly upon finding a match in exclude patterns to prevent false positives.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: **Refine Pattern Definitions**: Review and refine SMARTS patterns to accurately represent the functional groups described in the natural language rules. For example, in Rule 2, the pattern `'c1cc([OX2H,NH2])ccc1'` may not specifically capture substituents at the para position. Instead, use a more precise pattern like `'c1cc(O)ccc1C(=O)O'` for para-hydroxybenzoic acid or adjust the pattern to ensure the electron-donating group is at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: **Improve Pattern Specificity for Position Isomers**: For rules where the position of a substituent is critical (e.g., para positions in aromatic systems), use SMARTS patterns that specify the relative positions. This can be done using ring and atom indices to enforce the correct placement.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: **Handle Multiple Functional Groups**: For molecules with multiple functional groups that may interfere with pattern matching (e.g., molecules matching both high yield and low yield patterns), implement a priority system or scoring mechanism to determine the overall prediction based on the most influential rule.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: **Update Electron-Withdrawing/Donating Group Patterns**: In Rule 7 and others, the SMARTS patterns for electron-withdrawing groups may be too broad or miss key functionalities. Ensure that halogens, nitro groups, and carbonyl-containing groups are accurately represented. Similarly, define electron-donating groups with precise patterns.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: **Adjust Pattern Groups Logic**: In the code, the logic assumes all pattern groups in `patterns` must match. Modify the code to reflect whether all groups are required simultaneously or if matching any group suffices. This can be achieved by adding a parameter to each rule indicating whether the patterns are to be combined using AND or OR logic.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: **Include Aromaticity in Patterns**: For rules involving aromatic systems (e.g., Rule 2 and Rule 10), ensure that SMARTS patterns account for aromaticity correctly. Use lower-case 'c' for aromatic carbons and specify aromatic bonds where necessary.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: **Test and Validate Each Rule Separately**: Before applying all rules to the dataset, individually test and validate each rule with known compounds to ensure that the SMARTS patterns and code logic correctly identify matches and non-matches according to the rule definitions.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: **Enhance Error Handling**: Incorporate more robust error handling and logging within the code to capture and report issues during pattern matching. This will aid in debugging and ensuring that all molecules are processed correctly.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: **Use RDKit's Built-In Functional Group Definitions**: Utilize RDKit's predefined functional group SMARTS patterns where possible to ensure accuracy and consistency in pattern matching.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: **Simplify Complex Patterns**: For complex patterns that might be too restrictive or prone to errors, consider breaking them down into simpler subpatterns or using multiple patterns to capture the variations described in the natural language rule.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: **Review and Update Exclude Patterns**: Ensure that `exclude_patterns` are accurately representing the groups that should negate a rule's application. For example, in Rule 4, check that polar groups like hydroxy or amino groups are properly defined and that their presence correctly inhibits the rule.

- ** Suggestion 15 **: **Consider Stereochemistry Carefully**: Decide whether stereochemistry is essential for the rule. If not, remove stereochemistry from SMARTS patterns to avoid unintended mismatches, as stereochemical information in SMILES strings may vary or be omitted.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify the Rules with Explicit Structural Definitions**
  
  Replace qualitative descriptors in the rules with explicit structural definitions using SMARTS patterns or well-defined substructures. Instead of terms like "electron-rich side chains" or "bulky substituents," specify the exact functional groups or rings. For example, define "indole ring" explicitly and provide its SMARTS pattern for easy identification in SMILES strings.

- **Advice 2**: **Utilize SMARTS Patterns for Substructure Matching**

  Incorporate SMARTS (SMILES Arbitrary Target Specification) patterns into the rules to precisely define substructures. This allows for programmatic detection of features within molecules, facilitating the generation of a numeric feature matrix. For instance, specify aromatics with para-amino groups using a SMARTS pattern like "c1ccc(cc1)N".

- **Advice 3**: **Quantify Structural Features**

  Introduce quantifiable parameters into the rules. Instead of using vague terms like "long-chain," specify the exact number of carbon atoms (e.g., "aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of C6 to C8 result in high yield"). This makes it easier to create numerical features based on chain length.

- **Advice 4**: **Define Specific Functional Groups and Positions**

  Clearly define the functional groups and their positions relative to other groups. For example, specify "Modifiers containing a hydroxyl group on the beta carbon relative to the carboxyl group." Precise definitions enable automated feature extraction from SMILES strings.

- **Advice 5**: **Convert Qualitative Descriptors to Binary Features**

  Transform qualitative descriptors into binary features that indicate the presence or absence of specific structural elements. For example, create features like "has_primary_amine" (1 for presence, 0 for absence) or "contains_aromatic_ring_with_para_substituent".

- **Advice 6**: **Incorporate Molecular Descriptors and Properties**

  Use computationally derived molecular descriptors such as LogP, topological polar surface area (TPSA), molecular weight, and counts of specific atom types or bonds. Define thresholds in the rules (e.g., "Modifiers with TPSA > 75 Å² result in low yield") to facilitate numerical feature generation.

- **Advice 7**: **Standardize Rule Format for Consistency**

  Rephrase the rules using a consistent and standard format to ease parsing. Structure each rule as: "Modifiers containing [specific structural feature] result in [high/low] yield." This uniformity aids in programmatic extraction of features.

- **Advice 8**: **Create a Comprehensive List of Substructures**

  Develop an exhaustive list of all relevant substructures mentioned in the rules, along with their corresponding SMARTS patterns. This will serve as a reference for automated detection and feature matrix generation.

- **Advice 9**: **Leverage Cheminformatics Tools**

  Utilize tools like RDKit to automate the detection of specified substructures and calculate molecular descriptors. These tools can process SMILES strings to generate numerical features based on the refined rules.

- **Advice 10**: **Consolidate Overlapping Rules**

  Identify and merge rules that overlap or are similar to reduce complexity. For example, combine rules related to amino acids by specifying that "Modifiers that are α-amino acids with free amino and carboxyl groups, especially those with electron-rich side chains, result in high yield."

- **Advice 11**: **Include Negative Definitions Explicitly**

  For each rule indicating a high yield, explicitly state the contrasting conditions that lead to a low yield. This enhances clarity and aids in feature differentiation.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are α-amino acids with free amino and carboxyl groups result in **high yield**. The presence of electron-rich side chains, especially those containing heteroatoms like additional amino or carboxyl groups, enhances yield due to better coordination with the metal center. Amino acids with hydrophobic or bulky aromatic side chains without additional coordinating sites result in **low yield** because of reduced interaction with the catalyst.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (glutamic acid), (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan)
    - **Low Yield:** (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine)

- **Rule 2**: *Aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-donating groups such as amino or hydroxy at the para position result in **high yield** due to increased electron density and improved coordination with the catalyst. Aromatic acids lacking these groups or containing electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., formyl, methyl) lead to **low yield** because they do not facilitate effective interaction with the metal center.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 4-aminobenzoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 4-formylbenzoic acid, 4-methylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group result in **high yield** due to the nitrogen's ability to coordinate with the metal center. If the nitrogen heterocycle is separated from the carboxyl group by additional rings or linkers, the yield is **low** because of steric hindrance or reduced electronic interaction.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (nicotinic acid), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 4**: *Long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups result in **high yield** due to favorable hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst surface. Introducing polar groups such as hydroxy or amino groups decreases the yield to **low** because they disrupt these interactions and may introduce steric hindrance or competing coordination sites.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** octanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers possessing multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups (polyols) near the carboxyl group on an aliphatic chain result in **high yield** due to enhanced hydrogen bonding and multiple coordination points with the catalyst. Modifiers with isolated hydroxyl groups or hydroxyl groups on aromatic rings result in **low yield** because they provide fewer coordination opportunities and may introduce steric hindrance.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid)
    - **Low Yield:** 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers containing thiol groups on short aliphatic chains lead to **high yield** due to the thiol's strong affinity for metal centers, enhancing coordination with the catalyst. Thiol groups on aromatic rings result in **low yield** because they may cause catalyst poisoning or are less accessible for coordination due to steric factors.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups such as perfluoroalkyl chains or trifluoroacetyl moieties result in **low yield** due to decreased electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, leading to poor coordination with the metal center and reduced catalyst activity.*

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid, 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers featuring flexible ether chains (e.g., polyethylene glycol-like structures) linked to a terminal carboxyl group result in **low yield**. The increased flexibility and polarity reduce effective interactions with the catalyst’s active site and may lead to unfavorable solvation effects.*

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers containing aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid, especially on aromatic rings, result in **low yield** due to potential side reactions with the catalyst or substrate and possible catalyst deactivation.*

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic systems connected via an aliphatic chain of four or more carbons to a carboxylic acid result in **high yield**. The appropriate chain length and electron-rich aromatic ring facilitate strong interactions with the catalyst. Shorter chains or absence of electron-donating groups reduce the yield to **low** because they do not provide the same level of interaction.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:** 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers with bulky substituents or sterically hindered groups near the carboxyl functional group result in **low yield** because they restrict access to the catalyst's active site and impede effective coordination. This includes molecules where the carboxyl group is adjacent to large aromatic systems or additional substituents.*

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers with extended conjugated systems containing heteroatoms (such as oxygen or nitrogen) directly attached to the carboxyl group result in **high yield**. These structures can delocalize charge and provide multiple coordination sites, enhancing interactions with the catalyst.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers containing halomethyl groups on aromatic rings result in **high yield** due to increased reactivity and potential for halogen bonding or coordination with the catalyst, which can enhance catalytic activity.*

  **Examples:**
    - **High Yield:** 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers that are N-acetylated amino acids or contain peptide bonds result in **low yield** due to steric hindrance from the acetyl or peptide groups and blocked coordination sites, which prevent effective interaction with the catalyst.*

  **Examples:**
    - **Low Yield:** (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify the Rules with Quantifiable Descriptors**  
  Revise the current rules to focus on specific, quantifiable molecular descriptors that can be directly derived from SMILES strings or calculated computationally. This will facilitate the generation of a numeric feature matrix. For example, instead of using qualitative terms like "electron-rich side chains," specify measurable properties such as "number of nitrogen and oxygen atoms in the side chain."

- **Advice 2**: **Incorporate Computationally Accessible Molecular Descriptors**  
  Utilize molecular descriptors that can be easily calculated, such as:
  - **Counts of Specific Functional Groups**: Number of amino groups, hydroxyl groups, carboxyl groups, etc.
  - **Molecular Weight (MW)**
  - **Topological Polar Surface Area (TPSA)**
  - **Hydrogen Bond Donors (HBD) and Acceptors (HBA)**
  - **LogP (Octanol-Water Partition Coefficient)**
  - **Number of Rotatable Bonds**
  These descriptors can be incorporated into the rules to make them more quantifiable.

- **Advice 3**: **Use Structural Fingerprints and Substructure Patterns**  
  Employ cheminformatics tools to identify and encode substructures, functional groups, or molecular fragments present in the modifiers. Base the rules on the presence or absence of these features, which can be represented numerically.

- **Advice 4**: **Convert Qualitative Statements into Quantitative Thresholds**  
  Where possible, define exact numerical thresholds. For example:
  - Instead of "*long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids result in high yield*", specify "*aliphatic carboxylic acids with a carbon chain length of ≥8 result in high yield*."
  - Replace "*bulky substituents near the carboxyl group lead to low yield*" with "*molecules where the steric hindrance parameter (e.g., molar refractivity > X) near the carboxyl group exceeds a certain threshold result in low yield*."

- **Advice 5**: **Focus on Measurable Electronic Properties**  
  Incorporate parameters such as:
  - **Electron Donating/Withdrawing Power**: Use Hammett sigma constants to quantify the electronic effects of substituents.
  - **Charge Distribution**: Calculate partial charges on key atoms using computational methods.
  This will allow electronic effects to be quantified and included in the rules.

- **Advice 6**: **Create Binary Descriptors for Key Functional Groups**  
  Generate a list of functional groups or moieties that correlate with high or low yield. For each molecule, create binary descriptors (1 or 0) indicating the presence or absence of these groups. This simplifies the rules and makes feature extraction straightforward.

- **Advice 7**: **Reduce Complexity of Structural Features**  
  Avoid complex features that are hard to quantify, such as "*enhanced hydrogen bonding*" or "*flexible ether chains lead to low yield*". Instead, express these features in terms of counts or distances:
  - Specify the exact number of hydrogen bond donors/acceptors.
  - Use the number of ether groups or chain length as a descriptor.

- **Advice 8**: **Leverage Machine Learning for Feature Importance**  
  Use machine learning algorithms to analyze the dataset and identify the most significant molecular features influencing the yield. These insights can help refine existing rules or create new ones based on statistically significant descriptors.

- **Advice 9**: **Standardize Terminology and Definitions**  
  Ensure that all chemical terms and classifications used in the rules are clearly defined and standardized. This minimizes ambiguity and aids in the consistent application of rules during feature extraction.

- **Advice 10**: **Include Stereochemistry When Relevant**  
  If stereochemistry impacts yield, include it in the rules. Use absolute configuration (R/S notation) directly in the descriptors when necessary, and ensure that it can be extracted from the SMILES strings.

** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Translate Qualitative Rules into Quantitative Descriptors**  
  Convert the qualitative descriptions in the current rules into quantifiable molecular descriptors that can be directly extracted from SMILES strings. For example, instead of stating "Modifiers with strong electron-donating groups result in high yield," specify the exact functional groups (e.g., –NH₂, –OH) and count their occurrences. Use numerical values like electron density, molecular weight, and hydrophobicity indices to represent these features quantitatively.

- **Advice 2**: **Utilize SMARTS Patterns for Feature Extraction**  
  Rewrite the rules using SMARTS (Smiles Arbitrary Target Specification) patterns to precisely define structural motifs associated with high or low yield. This allows for automatic parsing of SMILES strings to detect the presence or absence of these motifs, facilitating the creation of a numeric feature matrix.

- **Advice 3**: **Consolidate and Simplify Overlapping Rules**  
  Identify and merge overlapping or redundant rules to streamline the rule set. For instance, combine rules that involve electron-donating groups attached to aromatic rings, regardless of the exact substituent, to create a more general rule. This simplification makes it easier to encode the rules into numerical features.

  - **Low Yield:** 
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group result in **high yield** due to the nitrogen's ability to coordinate with the metal center. If the nitrogen heterocycle is connected through additional aromatic rings or linkers, the yield is **low** because of steric hindrance and reduced electronic interaction.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (*Nicotinic acid*)

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing strong electron-withdrawing groups, such as perfluoroalkyl chains, result in **low yield** due to decreased electron density on coordinating atoms, leading to poor interaction with the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:** 
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with aliphatic thiol groups result in **high yield** due to the thiol's strong affinity for metal centers, enhancing coordination. In contrast, **aromatic thiols** lead to **low yield** because the thiol is less available for coordination and may cause catalyst deactivation.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  
  - **Low Yield:** 
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with flexible polyether chains (e.g., polyethylene glycol-like structures) linked to a terminal carboxyl group result in **low yield**. Their increased flexibility and polarity reduce effective interactions with the catalyst's active site due to unfavorable solvation and entropic effects.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:** 
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**
- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear, allowing us to determine whether a modifier will result in high or low yield based on the presence of free amino and carboxyl groups and the nature of the side chain. The physical-chemical insight is adequate, as coordinating functional groups enhance interaction with the catalyst, leading to higher yields, while hydrophobic side chains or blocked amino groups hinder coordination. The rule considers combinations of substructures—specifically, the amino acid backbone with varying side chains—satisfying the complexity criterion. It is supported by multiple data points, including both high yield (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid, tryptophan) and low yield examples (e.g., phenylalanine, N-acetyllysine), demonstrating good coverage.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear in distinguishing between electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups on aromatic carboxylic acids at the para position, enabling precise yield predictions. The physical-chemical insight is solid; electron-donating groups increase electron density, facilitating coordination with the catalyst, while electron-withdrawing groups have the opposite effect. The rule combines multiple structural features (aromatic ring, carboxyl group, substituent type, and position), aligning with the complexity criterion. It is well-supported by data, with high yield examples like 4-aminobenzoic acid and low yield examples like 4-formylbenzoic acid, indicating satisfactory coverage.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 lacks some clarity due to inconsistencies; while it states that modifiers without additional polar groups result in high yield, 5-aminopentanoic acid (which has an amino group) is listed as a high yield example. This contradiction reduces the rule's clarity. The physical-chemical insight regarding chain length and the effect of polar groups on coordination is reasonable. The rule addresses combinations of features, such as chain length and functional groups, meeting the complexity criterion. However, the inconsistency and potential exceptions weaken the rule’s reliability, despite it being supported by several data points across both high and low yields.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear and allows for straightforward application by identifying modifiers with nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group as high yield modifiers, and those connected via additional rings as low yield. The physical-chemical insight is appropriate, attributing higher yields to better coordination with the metal center. The rule considers complex structural features, satisfying the complexity criterion. It has good coverage, with multiple data points supporting both high yield (e.g., nicotinic acid) and low yield (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid) modifiers.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear in its distinction between modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group and those with isolated hydroxyl groups. The physical-chemical insight is acceptable, explaining that multiple coordination sites enhance binding. However, the rule falls short on coverage, as it is supported by only one high yield data point (gluconic acid), which undermines its reliability according to the coverage criterion requiring at least two supporting data points.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear, specifying that modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups like perfluoroalkyl chains result in low yield. The physical-chemical rationale is sound, as decreased electron density hinders interaction with the metal center. The rule is simple, focusing on a single functional group, which may limit its complexity. Coverage is minimal with only one supporting data point, reducing the rule's reliability.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 distinctly differentiates between aliphatic and aromatic thiol-containing modifiers regarding yield outcomes, making it clear and actionable. The physical-chemical insight is valid, considering the thiol group's affinity for metal centers in aliphatic contexts. The rule addresses combinations of structural features (thiol group context), meeting the complexity criterion. However, coverage is limited, supported by only one high yield and one low yield data point, which affects its overall reliability.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear and specific about modifiers with flexible polyether chains linked to a carboxyl group resulting in low yield. The physical-chemical insight is adequate, explaining the impact of flexibility and solvation on catalyst interaction. The rule combines several structural aspects, fulfilling the complexity criterion. It meets the coverage requirement with two supporting data points, although more data would strengthen its reliability.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear and provides sufficient detail to determine the yield outcome for modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxyl group. The physical-chemical reasoning is acceptable, highlighting potential side reactions and catalyst deactivation. The rule is complex, considering both functional groups and their positions relative to the carboxyl group. It meets the coverage criterion with two low yield examples, although additional data would enhance confidence in the rule.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 clearly identifies modifiers with N-acetylated amino acids or peptide bonds adjacent to the carboxyl group as resulting in low yield. The physical-chemical insight is appropriate, noting steric hindrance and blocked coordination sites. It satisfies the complexity criterion by addressing specific structural modifications. Coverage is sufficient with at least two supporting data points, bolstering the rule's validity.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 provides clear criteria by combining chain length, the presence of electron-rich aromatic rings, and their connection to the carboxyl group. It offers solid physical-chemical insight into how chain length affects π-interactions with the catalyst. The rule is complex and considers multiple structural features. It is well-supported by several data points across both high and low yields, fulfilling the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is clear in its focus on extended conjugated systems with coordinating oxygen atoms. The physical-chemical rationale is plausible, but the rule lacks sufficient coverage, with only one high yield example supporting it. This limitation affects the rule's reliability according to the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear and specific about modifiers with electron-donating halogenated methyl groups on aromatic rings resulting in high yield. The physical-chemical insight is acceptable, but the rule is only supported by one data point, which does not meet the coverage requirement, reducing its reliability.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Address the inconsistency in Rule 3.** The current Rule 3 states that modifiers without additional polar functional groups result in high yield, yet 5-aminopentanoic acid (which contains an amino group) is listed as a high-yield example. To improve clarity, revise the rule to reflect that medium-length aliphatic carboxylic acids with small polar groups that do not cause significant steric hindrance (such as amino groups located away from the reactive site) can result in high yield. This adjustment aligns the rule with the provided examples and eliminates contradictions.

- **Advice 2**: **Strengthen rules with limited supporting data by consolidating them.** Rules like Rule 5, Rule 6, Rule 12, and Rule 13 are based on single data points, which weakens their reliability. Consider merging these rules with other related rules to form broader, more general rules with better coverage. For example, combine Rule 5 (modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups) with Rule 10 (modifiers with functional groups enhancing coordination) to create a rule about modifiers possessing multiple coordinating sites leading to high yield.

- **Advice 3**: **Augment rules with additional supporting data.** To meet the coverage criterion, which requires at least two supporting data points, gather more examples that fit the conditions of Rules 5, 6, 12, and 13. This could involve reviewing existing data for overlooked examples or conducting additional experiments. Enhanced data support will increase the rules' robustness and applicability.

- **Advice 4**: **Improve the clarity and specificity of rules by refining their wording.** Ensure that each rule precisely defines the structural features and functional groups affecting yield. For instance, in Rule 7, specify that aliphatic thiol groups enhance yield due to strong metal affinity, whereas aromatic thiols may lead to catalyst poisoning and low yield. Clear definitions prevent misinterpretation and improve the rules' effectiveness.

- **Advice 5**: **Combine overlapping rules to reduce redundancy and improve coherence.** Rules addressing similar concepts, such as the influence of electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups (Rules 2, 6, and 13), can be merged into a single comprehensive rule. This unified rule would cover how substituents on aromatic rings impact electron density and, consequently, the coordination with the catalyst, simplifying the rule set.

- **Advice 6**: **Ensure consistency between rules and examples.** Review all rules to confirm that the examples provided accurately support the rules without contradictions. Adjust rules or reassign examples as necessary. For example, if an example does not fit the rule due to an oversight, either correct the rule's conditions or move the example to the appropriate rule.

- **Advice 7**: **Incorporate detailed physical-chemical insights into the rules.** Enrich each rule with concise explanations of how specific structural features affect the reaction yield. This not only aids in understanding the rationale behind the rules but also assists in predicting the behavior of untested modifiers. For example, explain how electron-rich environments facilitate metal coordination, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Advice 8**: **Standardize the format and terminology used in the rules.** Consistency in language and structure across all rules improves readability and usability. Use uniform terms for functional groups and molecular features (e.g., "electron-donating groups," "nitrogen heterocycles") and present the rules in a consistent format to facilitate quick reference and application.

- **Advice 9**: **Re-evaluate the necessity of less supported rules.** If additional data cannot be obtained for rules with single data points, consider whether they are essential for the rule set. It may be prudent to remove or de-emphasize these rules to focus on those with stronger support, thereby enhancing the overall reliability of the rule set.

- **Advice 10**: **Update rules based on new data or insights from ongoing research.** The rule set should be dynamic, incorporating new findings that may influence the understanding of modifier effects on yield. Encourage regular reviews and updates to keep the rules current and relevant.

- **Advice 1**: **Transform qualitative descriptions of functional groups into quantifiable descriptors that can be directly computed from SMILES strings. For instance, instead of stating "modifiers with coordinating functional groups (e.g., carboxylate or indole rings)", specify the exact substructures using SMARTS patterns or counts of specific functional groups (e.g., count of carboxylate groups, presence of indole rings).**

- **Advice 2**: **Simplify the rules by focusing on key functional groups and structural features that can be numerically quantified. Create descriptors such as "number of carboxylic acid groups," "number of free amino groups," "presence of specific heterocycles," or "total hydrogen bond donors and acceptors," which can be calculated directly from the molecular structure.**

- **Advice 3**: **Quantify electron-donating and electron-withdrawing effects using established chemical scales like Hammett sigma constants or calculating the electronic properties (e.g., partial charges) of substituents. Replace qualitative terms with numerical values that reflect the electronic influence of substituents on the aromatic ring or other critical parts of the molecule.**

- **Advice 4**: **For rules involving aliphatic chain lengths, define precise numerical ranges and encode them as features. For example, create a descriptor for "aliphatic chain length" as the number of carbons in the longest continuous chain, which can be directly computed from the SMILES representation.**

- **Advice 5**: **Replace ambiguous terms like "optimal hydrophobic interactions" and "steric hindrance" with quantifiable physicochemical properties. Utilize calculated properties such as LogP (octanol-water partition coefficient) for hydrophobicity and molecular volume or van der Waals surface area for steric effects. These parameters can be derived computationally and used as numerical features.**

- **Advice 6**: **Standardize the definitions of electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups to avoid inconsistencies. For example, clarify the effects of methyl groups, which are generally electron-donating due to hyperconjugation, and ensure the rules accurately reflect their influence in this specific reaction context.**

- **Advice 7**: **Incorporate descriptors for the presence of specific functional groups that are known to coordinate with the metal center, such as thiols, amines, and hydroxyls. Use binary (1/0) features to indicate the presence or absence of these groups, or count features for the number of each type present in the molecule.**

- **Advice 8**: **Utilize computational tools to calculate molecular descriptors and properties that influence coordination and reactivity. For example, calculate the Mulliken or Natural Population Analysis (NPA) charges on coordinating atoms, the HOMO-LUMO gap, or other electronic descriptors that can influence metal-ligand interactions and, consequently, the reaction yield.**

- **Advice 9**: **For modifiers containing heterocycles, define descriptors based on the type and position of heteroatoms within the ring system. For example, include features like "number of nitrogen atoms in heterocycles directly attached to carboxyl groups" or "presence of pyridine-like structures," which can be identified from SMILES using substructure searches.**

- **Advice 10**: **Convert rules about "flexible polyether chains" or "increased flexibility and polarity" into numerical descriptors such as the number of ether linkages, rotatable bonds, or polar surface area. These features can quantify the flexibility and polarity of the molecule and are calculable from the molecular structure.**

- **Advice 11**: **For rules involving adjacent hydroxyl groups, define a descriptor for "number of vicinal (adjacent) hydroxyl groups," which can be identified and counted using SMILES parsing algorithms. This quantifies the potential for hydrogen bonding and multiple coordination sites.**

- **Advice 12**: **Integrate machine learning approaches to model the relationship between the calculated numerical descriptors and the reaction yield. By creating a feature matrix from the descriptors derived from SMILES, algorithms can be trained to predict high or low yield, enhancing the predictive power of the rules.**

- **Advice 13**: **Review and refine the existing rules for any overlapping or conflicting statements. Consolidate rules where possible to reduce complexity. For instance, combine rules that address similar structural features or electronic effects to create a more streamlined and generalizable set of guidelines.**

- **Advice 14**: **Include negative examples in the dataset where the absence of certain features leads to low yield. This balance helps in training models to recognize both the presence and absence of features that are critical to the reaction outcome.**

- **Advice 15**: **Ensure that all descriptors and rules are compatible with computational chemistry software and molecular descriptor calculators. Utilize standardized nomenclature and formats to facilitate seamless data processing and feature extraction from SMILES strings.**

    - 4-formylbenzoic acid

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 5–8 carbons and without additional polar functional groups result in **high yield**. Introducing polar groups (e.g., hydroxy, amino) into longer aliphatic chains leads to **low yield** due to increased steric hindrance and disrupted hydrophobic interactions.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - Octanoic acid
    - 5-aminopentanoic acid
  
  - **Low Yield:** 
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group result in **high yield** due to the nitrogen's ability to coordinate with the metal center. If the nitrogen heterocycle is connected through additional aromatic rings or linkers, the yield is **low** because of steric hindrance and reduced electronic interaction.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (*Nicotinic acid*)
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
  
  - **Low Yield:** 
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group (e.g., sugar acids) result in **high yield** due to enhanced hydrogen bonding and multiple coordination sites. Single hydroxyl groups or hydroxyl groups distant from the carboxyl group result in **low yield** as they provide fewer coordination opportunities and may introduce steric hindrance.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (*Gluconic acid*)
  
  - **Low Yield:** 
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing thiol groups attached to aliphatic chains result in **high yield** due to the thiol's strong affinity for metal centers, enhancing coordination. Aromatic thiols lead to **low yield** because the thiol is less available for coordination and may cause catalyst deactivation.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  
  - **Low Yield:** 
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing strong electron-withdrawing groups, such as perfluoroalkyl chains, result in **low yield** due to decreased electron density on coordinating atoms, leading to poor interaction with the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:** 
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with flexible polyether chains or multiple ether linkages (e.g., polyethylene glycol-like structures) linked to a terminal carboxyl group result in **low yield**. Their increased flexibility and polarity reduce effective interactions with the catalyst's active site due to unfavorable solvation and entropic effects.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:** 
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers possessing aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid, especially on aromatic rings, result in **low yield**. These groups can participate in side reactions or coordinate in a manner that deactivates the catalyst.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:** 
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with extended conjugated systems containing coordinating oxygen atoms adjacent to the carboxyl group result in **high yield**. The delocalized electron systems and additional coordination sites facilitate stronger binding to the catalyst.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing electron-rich aromatic rings connected via an aliphatic chain (four or more carbons) to a carboxyl group result in **high yield**. The chain length allows for optimal positioning of the aromatic ring for π-interactions with the catalyst, enhancing binding. Shorter chains or absence of electron-donating substituents lead to **low yield**.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
    - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid
  
  - **Low Yield:** 
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows for unambiguous classification based on the presence of free amino and carboxyl groups with coordinating side chains. It provides solid physico-chemical insight into how these functional groups enhance coordination with the catalyst. The rule considers combinations of substructures, adding suitable complexity, and is well-supported by multiple data points, ensuring high coverage.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clearly defined and allows for straightforward classification based on the substituents on aromatic carboxylic acids at the para position. It offers sound physico-chemical reasoning about how electron-donating groups facilitate coordination with the metal center. The rule combines different substructures, adding appropriate complexity, and is supported by several data points, offering reasonable coverage.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is fairly clear in defining the chain lengths and the effect of polar functional groups on yield, allowing for effective classification. It provides appropriate physico-chemical insight into how steric hindrance and disrupted hydrophobic interactions influence the reaction. The rule considers multiple structural elements, adding necessary complexity, and is well-supported by several data points, ensuring good coverage.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 attempts to classify modifiers based on the direct attachment of nitrogen heterocycles to the carboxyl group, providing acceptable clarity. The physico-chemical insight is reasonable, considering the coordination abilities of nitrogen atoms. However, the rule does not fully account for modifiers like 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid, which results in high yield despite the heterocycle being connected via a linker. This inconsistency suggests the rule may need refinement to improve its coverage and accuracy.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 provides a clear guideline on the effect of multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group, offering reasonable physico-chemical insight into enhanced coordination through hydrogen bonding. However, the rule does not account for modifiers like 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, which contains a single hydroxyl group yet results in high yield. This indicates that the rule might need adjustment to consider such exceptions and improve its coverage.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear in distinguishing between thiol groups on aliphatic and aromatic chains, providing acceptable physico-chemical reasoning about thiol coordination with metal centers. However, the rule is supported by only two data points, limiting its coverage and reducing its robustness.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear and provides acceptable reasoning about the effect of strong electron-withdrawing groups on coordination with the metal center. However, it is supported by only one data point, limiting its coverage and reliability. Expanding the data set could enhance the validity of this rule.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 clearly targets modifiers with polyether chains, offering acceptable physico-chemical insights into why these structures result in low yield due to unfavorable solvation and entropic effects. However, with only two data points supporting it, the coverage is limited, suggesting a need for more data to strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear in specifying the effect of adjacent aldehyde or ketone groups on yield, providing reasonable physico-chemical insight into potential side reactions or catalyst deactivation. However, it is based on only two data points, limiting its coverage and necessitating more data for validation.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clearly defined and provides acceptable physico-chemical insight into how extended conjugation and coordinating oxygen atoms enhance binding to the catalyst. However, it is based on only one data point, limiting its coverage and reliability. Additional supporting data would help to confirm the rule's applicability.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11, while somewhat complex, provides clear guidance on the structural features that influence yield, focusing on chain length and electron-rich aromatic rings. The physico-chemical insight is acceptable, considering optimal positioning for π-interactions with the catalyst. The rule is well-supported by multiple data points, ensuring reasonable coverage and demonstrating a good balance between complexity and coverage.

Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: **Update the patterns in Rule 1 to correctly match α-amino acids like tryptophan and phenylalanine.** The current main pattern `'[NX3;H2][CX4;H][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'` may be too specific and may not match all α-amino acids. Consider using a more general pattern for α-amino acids, such as `'[NX3;H2][CX4H]([#6])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'`, which accounts for side chains on the α-carbon.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Modify the include and exclude pattern logic to ensure proper matching and assignment of high or low yield predictions.** In the current code, the include patterns must match for a positive prediction, but this may exclude valid cases like tryptophan. Adjust the code to allow for high yield prediction if either the main pattern matches (α-amino acid with coordinating side chain) or the molecule does not match any exclude patterns. Similarly, ensure that if the molecule matches any exclude patterns (e.g., phenyl group in phenylalanine), it correctly assigns a low yield prediction.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Correct the SMARTS patterns for include and exclude conditions in Rule 1.** The include pattern for the indole ring `'c1ccc2c(c1)[nH]c3ccccc23'` is incorrect and may not match indole-containing compounds like tryptophan. Use the correct SMARTS for indole, such as `'c1c[cH]c2c1cccc2'` or `'[nH]1ccccc1'`. Similarly, refine the exclude pattern for the phenyl group to `'c1ccccc1'` to ensure accurate matching.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Ensure that the code's logic properly assigns negative predictions when exclude patterns are matched, even if the main pattern is matched.** Currently, the code may not assign `-1` when a molecule matches both the main pattern and an exclude pattern. Modify the code to prioritize exclude patterns when they are matched, so that the presence of an exclude pattern results in a low yield prediction (`-1`).

- **Suggestion 5**: **Expand and test the SMARTS patterns and code for the remaining rules (Rules 6–11).** Since only Rules 1–5 are implemented, include the remaining rules to fully cover the dataset. This will improve the feature matrix and ensure that all modifiers are evaluated against all relevant rules.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Verify and correct the SMARTS patterns for other rules to match the natural language descriptions accurately.** For example, in Rule 2, ensure that electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups at the para position are correctly identified with accurate SMARTS patterns. Adjust patterns to match common substituents like amino (`-NH2`), hydroxy (`-OH`), methyl (`-CH3`), and formyl (`-CHO`) groups.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Improve the code's handling of molecules that cannot be parsed or matched.** Instead of defaulting to zeros, consider incorporating error handling or logging to identify why certain molecules are not matching any patterns. This will aid in debugging and refining the SMARTS patterns for better accuracy.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Use recursive SMARTS or adjust atom mapping to handle complex substituents and ring systems accurately.** For modifiers with complex structures (e.g., fused rings, heterocycles), ensure that the SMARTS patterns are capable of matching these features. This may involve using recursive definitions or more sophisticated pattern matching techniques.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Add unit tests or validation steps to verify that each rule correctly identifies the intended compounds.** Create a test suite with known compounds that should match or not match each rule, and use this to validate and refine the SMARTS patterns and code logic.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Consult chemical informatics resources or experts to refine SMARTS patterns.** Given the complexity of chemical structures and SMARTS syntax, collaborating with a cheminformatics specialist can help in writing more accurate patterns and improving the overall effectiveness of the code.

**Analysis of Current Rules Based on Metrics**

Upon examining the current rule metrics in comparison to the reference metrics, several observations can be made regarding their performance, particularly focusing on **confidence** and **lift**.

**1. Support Metrics**

- **Decrease in Train Support**: The current **train support** is **0.0114**, which is significantly lower than the reference metrics (\[0.1667, 0.1845\]) and the previous iterations' supports:
  - Iteration 1: **0.0408**
  - Iteration 2: **0.0648**
  - Iteration 3: **0.0248**
  - Current Iteration: **0.0114**

- **Implications**: A decreasing support suggests that the rules are applying to an increasingly smaller subset of the training data. This can be indicative of overfitting, where the rules become too specific and fail to generalize well to new data.

**2. Confidence Metrics**

- **Consistency in Train Confidence**: The current **train confidence** is **0.6000**, which is within the range of the reference metrics (\[0.5396, 0.6352\]) and is comparable to previous iterations:
  - Iteration 1: **0.6136**
  - Iteration 2: **0.6317**
  - Iteration 3: **0.6275**
  - Current Iteration: **0.6000**

- **Implications**: The confidence remains relatively stable, indicating that when the rule conditions are met, the likelihood of the predicted outcome remains consistent. However, with declining support, the reliability of this confidence diminishes due to the smaller sample size.

**3. Lift Metrics**

- **Slight Increase in Lift**: The current **train lift** is **1.2118**, slightly higher than the reference metrics (\[1.0559, 1.2048\]) and comparable to previous iterations:
  - Iteration 1: **1.2282**
  - Iteration 2: **1.2489**
  - Iteration 3: **1.2627**
  - Current Iteration: **1.2118**

- **Implications**: An increase in lift indicates that the rules are providing better predictive power over random chance. However, the high lift must be interpreted with caution due to the low support.

**4. Leverage Metrics**

- **Low and Decreasing Leverage**: The current **train leverage** is **0.0059**, which is lower than the positive reference metric (\[0.0289, -0.0041\]) and shows a decreasing trend:
  - Iteration 1: **0.0086**
  - Iteration 2: **0.0060**
  - Iteration 3: **0.0023**
  - Current Iteration: **0.0059**

- **Implications**: Low leverage suggests that the rule does not provide much additional information over the expected probability if the items were independent. Combined with low support, this indicates that the rule's practical significance may be minimal.

**5. Summary of Observations**

- The decreasing **support** across iterations indicates that the rules are becoming overly specific, applying to fewer instances in the dataset.
- The relatively stable **confidence** suggests the rules are still accurate for the instances they cover but may not be capturing enough of the dataset to be useful.
- The **lift** remains above 1, showing that the rules still provide value over random chance, but the low support undermines this benefit.
- The low and decreasing **leverage** further points to limited usefulness of the current rules in providing significant associations.

**Assessment of Local Minimum and Iterations**

Given that the metrics, particularly **support**, are decreasing without substantial gains in **confidence** or **lift**, it appears that the current approach may have reached a local minimum. The rules are becoming too narrow, capturing anomalies or specific cases rather than generalizable patterns. This suggests that further iterations following the same methodology may not yield improvements and that adjustments are necessary.

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

1. **Broaden the Rule Conditions**

   - **Generalize Overly Specific Criteria**: Review rules that have multiple specific conditions and consider combining or relaxing them to increase support.
   - **Example**: For Rule 5, instead of requiring "multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group," consider including modifiers with "additional polar groups" in general.

2. **Focus on High-Support Features**

   - **Identify Common Attributes**: Analyze the dataset to find common features among high-yield modifiers that are present in a larger portion of the data.
   - **Adjust Rules Accordingly**: Modify existing rules or create new ones that encapsulate these common attributes to increase support.

3. **Re-evaluate Low-Yield Examples**

   - **Investigate Contradictory Cases**: Examine instances where the rules predict high yield but the actual yield is low (or vice versa) to identify potential exceptions or additional factors.
   - **Incorporate Exceptions into Rules**: Amend the rules to account for these exceptions, possibly by adding conditional clauses.

4. **Simplify Complex Rules**

   - **Reduce Complexity**: Complex rules with multiple conditions can overfit the training data. Simplifying these rules can help them apply to more cases.
   - **Example**: Combine similar rules (e.g., Rules 2 and 9 regarding electron-withdrawing groups) to create a more general rule about the impact of electronic effects on yield.

5. **Incorporate Statistical Validation**

   - **Cross-Validation**: Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to ensure that the rules generalize well to unseen data.
   - **Monitor Test Metrics**: Evaluate the rules on test data to check for overfitting indicated by discrepancies between train and test metrics.

6. **Leverage Domain Knowledge**

   - **Consult Chemical Principles**: Utilize fundamental principles of coordination chemistry and catalysis to inform rule adjustments, ensuring they are chemically sound and not just data-driven anomalies.
   - **Adjust Rules to Reflect Mechanisms**: For example, consider the steric and electronic factors more broadly rather than focusing on specific functional groups.

7. **Increase Data Diversity**

   - **Expand the Dataset**: If possible, include more data points to enhance the robustness of the rules and provide more instances for higher support.
   - **Balance the Dataset**: Ensure a balanced representation of high and low-yield modifiers to prevent bias in rule creation.

8. **Iterative Refinement with Feedback**

   - **Incorporate Feedback Loops**: After adjusting the rules, re-evaluate the metrics to assess improvements.
   - **Set Stop Criteria**: Define clear criteria for acceptable levels of support, confidence, and lift to determine when the rules are satisfactory.

**Conclusion**

The current rules, while maintaining acceptable levels of confidence and lift, suffer from low support, limiting their utility. To improve the performance, it's essential to balance specificity with generalizability by broadening the rules, simplifying complex conditions, and ensuring they are grounded in chemical rationale. By implementing these recommendations, the rules can become more robust, capturing a larger portion of the data while still providing meaningful predictions.

**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

Based on the latest training results, the performance of the current rules has declined compared to previous iterations. The validation accuracy has decreased to **57.14%** from previous accuracies in the range of **68.57%** to **76%**. The consistent decrease in accuracy across iterations indicates that the current set of rules may not be capturing the essential features necessary for accurate predictions.

**Comparison with Previous Metrics:**

- **Previous Validation Accuracies:**
  - \[0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76\]; Test Accuracy: **0.75**
  - \[0.76, 0.68, 0.72, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76\]; Test Accuracy: **0.75**
  - \[0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76\]; Test Accuracy: **0.625**
  - \[0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76\]; Test Accuracy: **0.625**

- **Current Validation Accuracy:**
  - **0.5714**

The reduction in accuracy suggests that the current rules are less effective in generalizing the relationship between molecular features and the loading of modifiers on catalysts. The model's ability to predict high or low loadings accurately has diminished, indicating possible issues with the rules' comprehensiveness and applicability.

**Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting:**

The decreased performance implies potential **underfitting**, where the model or rules are too simplistic to capture the underlying patterns in the data. This may result from an overgeneralization in the rules or an insufficient number of rules to account for the diversity in molecular structures. The model might be missing critical features that influence the modifier's loading on the catalyst.

**Discrepancies and SHAP Analysis:**

Examining the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values provides insights into which rules contribute most to the predictions. Notably, the latest SHAP analysis shows that only **Rule 1** is contributing to the predictions, with no contributions from other rules present in previous iterations. This reliance on a single rule suggests a lack of feature diversity, leading to misclassifications.

For molecules where the **predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high** (underestimation), such as:

- **C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O**
  - Predicted: Low Loading
  - Experimental: **High Loading**
  - Rule 1 SHAP value: **-0.0198**

- **C1=CNC(=O)C=C1C(=O)O**
  - Predicted: Low Loading
  - Experimental: **High Loading**
  - Rule 1 SHAP value: **-0.0198**

The negative SHAP values for Rule 1 indicate that it is contributing to the underestimation. Since Rule 1 does not account for the features present in these molecules, it leads to incorrect predictions.

**Interpretation of Accuracy Improvements:**

The declining accuracy metrics suggest that the current rules are not improving the model's predictive capabilities. Instead, the reduced accuracy indicates that the model might have reached a local minimum where further iterations without substantial changes to the rules will not lead to significant improvements.

**Insights from SHAP Analysis:**

The SHAP analysis reveals that relying solely on Rule 1 is insufficient. In previous iterations, multiple rules contributed to the predictions, capturing a broader range of molecular features. The absence of other rules in the current model limits its ability to generalize and accurately predict the loading for diverse molecules.

---

**Recommendations for Improvement**

To enhance the model's performance, the following steps are recommended:

1. **Reintroduce and Refine Additional Rules:**

   - **Include Rules with High Negative SHAP Values for Underestimated Loadings:**
     - **Rule 4**: Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group result in high yield.
       - Molecules like **C1=CNC(=O)C=C1C(=O)O** (picolinic acid) are not adequately captured by Rule 1 but fit Rule 4.
     - **Action:** Incorporate Rule 4 into the feature matrix to account for molecules with nitrogen heterocycles, improving predictions for underrepresented structures.

2. **Adjust Rule 1 to Improve Generalization:**

   - **Issue with Rule 1:**
     - Overemphasis on α-amino acids with specific side chains may exclude other functional groups contributing to high loadings.
   - **Refinement Suggestions:**
     - Broaden Rule 1 to include amino acids and related compounds with coordinating functional groups beyond carboxylate and indole rings.
     - Include side chains with nitrogen or oxygen heterocycles, which can coordinate with the catalyst.

3. **Balance Rule Contributions in the Model:**

   - **Avoid Overreliance on a Single Rule:**
     - Ensure that the model considers multiple rules, preventing it from overfitting to features from Rule 1 alone.
   - **Action:**
     - Reweight the features or adjust the model parameters to give appropriate significance to all relevant rules.

4. **Expand the Feature Set:**

   - **Incorporate Additional Relevant Rules:**
     - **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position result in high yield.
     - **Rule 5**: Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group result in high yield.
   - **Action:**
     - Add these rules to the feature matrix to capture more nuances in molecular structures that contribute to high loading.

5. **Address Molecules with Misclassified Loadings:**

   - **Analyze Underestimated Molecules Individually:**
     - For each molecule with underestimated loading, identify which rules could account for their features.
     - **Example:** 4-Bromobenzoic acid (**C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O**) is not effectively captured by the current rules.
     - **Action:** Modify existing rules or create new ones to cover brominated aromatic acids that may have coordinating capabilities.

6. **Regularize the Model to Prevent Underfitting:**

   - **Enhance Model Complexity Appropriately:**
     - Introduce more features to capture the complexity of the data without overcomplicating the model.
   - **Action:**
     - Use cross-validation to fine-tune the model's complexity, ensuring it generalizes well to unseen data.

7. **Iterative Refinement and Evaluation:**

   - **Cycle of Improvement:**
     - Continuously update the rules based on SHAP analysis and model performance.
     - After adjustments, retrain the model and reassess accuracy and SHAP values.
   - **Action:**
     - Implement an iterative process where rules are regularly reviewed and modified based on empirical evidence from the model.

---

**Conclusion**

By expanding the feature set to include additional rules and adjusting existing ones, the model can better capture the diversity of molecular structures influencing the modifier loading on catalysts. Emphasizing a balanced contribution from all relevant rules will improve the model's generalization and predictive accuracy. Regular iterations and evaluations using SHAP analysis will guide the refinement process, leading to more effective and robust rules.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimization**

The current analysis of the rules for predicting the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction reveals several key points:

1. **Decreasing Support Indicates Over-Specificity**: The **train support** metrics have been decreasing across iterations (from 0.1667 to 0.0114), suggesting that the rules are becoming too specific and applying to a smaller subset of the data. This over-specificity can lead to overfitting, where the model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data.

2. **Stable Confidence with Low Utility**: Although the **train confidence** remains relatively stable around 60%, the low support undermines its practical significance. High confidence on a very small portion of data limits the rule's usefulness.

3. **Overreliance on Rule 1**: The SHAP analysis indicates that only **Rule 1** is significantly contributing to predictions, while other rules are not effectively capturing relevant features. This reliance leads to misclassifications, especially for molecules not covered by Rule 1.

4. **Decreased Validation Accuracy**: The validation accuracy has declined from approximately 76% to 57%, indicating that the model's predictive performance is deteriorating. This decrease suggests that the current rules are insufficient to generalize across the dataset.

5. **Underrepresentation of Important Features**: Molecules with high experimental yields are being incorrectly predicted as low yield due to the absence of rules that capture their structural features.

**Suggestions for Improving Current Rules**

1. **Broaden Rule 1 Patterns**:
   - **Include More General Patterns for α-Amino Acids**: Modify the SMARTS patterns to correctly match all α-amino acids, including those with various side chains.
   - **Correct SMARTS Patterns**: Use more accurate SMARTS for indole rings and other coordinating groups to ensure proper matching (e.g., `'[nH]1ccccc1'` for indole).

2. **Incorporate Additional Rules (Rules 2–11)**:
   - **Expand Feature Set**: Implement the remaining rules to cover a wider range of molecular features affecting the yield.
   - **Adjust SMARTS Patterns**: For each rule, refine the SMARTS patterns to accurately reflect the functional groups and structural motifs described.
   - **Examples**:
     - **Rule 2**: Accurately identify electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups at the para position.
     - **Rule 4**: Include modifiers with nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group.

3. **Refine Include and Exclude Logic**:
   - **Prioritize Exclude Patterns**: Modify the code logic to ensure that exclude patterns override include patterns when both are matched, assigning a low yield prediction appropriately.
   - **Ensure Negative Predictions**: Adjust the implementation so that molecules matching exclude patterns are correctly predicted as low yield, even if they match include patterns.

4. **Correct and Validate SMARTS Patterns**:
   - **Collaborate with Cheminformatics Experts**: Work with specialists to refine the SMARTS patterns for accuracy.
   - **Use Validated Patterns**: Ensure that patterns are tested against known compounds to confirm correct matching.

5. **Balance Rule Contributions**:
   - **Avoid Overreliance on Single Rules**: Ensure that the model considers contributions from multiple rules to capture diverse molecular features.
   - **Reweight Features**: Adjust the model parameters to give appropriate significance to all relevant rules.

6. **Simplify Overly Complex Rules**:
   - **Generalize Conditions**: Relax overly specific conditions to increase support while maintaining confidence.
   - **Combine Similar Rules**: Merge rules that address related features to create broader, more impactful rules.

7. **Enhance Data Diversity and Representation**:
   - **Expand Dataset**: Incorporate more data points, if possible, to improve the robustness of the rules.
   - **Balance High and Low Yield Examples**: Ensure an even distribution to prevent bias in rule development.

8. **Iterative Testing and Validation**:
   - **Implement Unit Tests**: Develop tests for each rule to verify correct functionality.
   - **Use Cross-Validation**: Employ techniques like k-fold cross-validation to assess the model's generalizability.

9. **Incorporate Domain Knowledge**:
   - **Apply Chemical Principles**: Leverage understanding of coordination chemistry and catalysis to inform rule adjustments.
   - **Understand Mechanistic Implications**: Consider how structural features influence the reaction mechanism.

10. **Enhance Error Handling and Logging**:
    - **Improve Debugging**: Implement error handling for molecules that cannot be parsed, aiding in refining patterns.
    - **Analyze Misclassifications**: Study cases where predictions do not match experimental values to identify gaps in the rules.

**Possibility for Further Optimization**

There is significant potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. By broadening the scope of the rules, correcting and refining SMARTS patterns, and incorporating additional rules to capture more molecular features, the model can improve both in support and predictive accuracy. Ensuring that the rules are general enough to apply to a wider range of compounds while being specific enough to retain high confidence will enhance the model's performance.

If the side chain is hydrophobic (e.g., phenyl group) or the amino group is blocked (e.g., acetylated), the yield is **low** due to reduced coordination with the catalyst.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (*Aspartic acid*)
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (*Glutamic acid*)
    - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (*Tryptophan*)
  
  - **Low Yield:** 
    - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (*Phenylalanine*)
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (*N-acetyllysine*)

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., amino, hydroxy) at the para position result in **high yield** due to increased electron density facilitating coordination with the metal center. Those with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., methyl, formyl) at the para position lead to **low yield** by decreasing electron density and hindering interaction with the catalyst.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - 4-aminobenzoic acid
  
  - **Low Yield:** 
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 5–8 carbons and without additional polar functional groups result in **high yield**. Introducing polar groups (e.g., hydroxy, amino) into longer aliphatic chains leads to **low yield** due to increased steric hindrance and disrupted hydrophobic interactions.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - Octanoic acid
    - 5-aminopentanoic acid
  
  - **Low Yield:** 
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group result in **high yield** due to the nitrogen's ability to coordinate with the metal center. If the nitrogen heterocycle is connected through additional aromatic rings or linkers, the yield is **low** because of steric hindrance and reduced electronic interaction.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (*Nicotinic acid*)
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
  
  - **Low Yield:** 
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group (e.g., sugar acids) result in **high yield** due to enhanced hydrogen bonding and multiple coordination sites. Single hydroxyl groups or hydroxyl groups distant from the carboxyl group result in **low yield** as they provide fewer coordination opportunities and may introduce steric hindrance.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (*Gluconic acid*)
  
  - **Low Yield:** 
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing thiol groups attached to aliphatic chains result in **high yield** due to the thiol's strong affinity for metal centers, enhancing coordination. Aromatic thiols lead to **low yield** because the thiol is less available for coordination and may cause catalyst deactivation.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  
  - **Low Yield:** 
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing strong electron-withdrawing groups, such as perfluoroalkyl chains, result in **low yield** due to decreased electron density on coordinating atoms, leading to poor interaction with the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:** 
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with flexible polyether chains or multiple ether linkages (e.g., polyethylene glycol-like structures) linked to a terminal carboxyl group result in **low yield**. Their increased flexibility and polarity reduce effective interactions with the catalyst's active site due to unfavorable solvation and entropic effects.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:** 
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers possessing aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid, especially on aromatic rings, result in **low yield**. These groups can participate in side reactions or coordinate in a manner that deactivates the catalyst.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:** 
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with extended conjugated systems containing coordinating oxygen atoms adjacent to the carboxyl group result in **high yield**. The delocalized electron systems and additional coordination sites facilitate stronger binding to the catalyst.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing electron-rich aromatic rings connected via an aliphatic chain (four or more carbons) to a carboxyl group result in **high yield**. The chain length allows for optimal positioning of the aromatic ring for π-interactions with the catalyst, enhancing binding. Shorter chains or absence of electron-donating substituents lead to **low yield**.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
    - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid
  
  - **Low Yield:** 
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Broaden Rule 1 SMARTS Patterns**  
  Update the SMARTS patterns in Rule 1 to include a wider range of α-amino acids with various side chains. Ensure that the patterns capture all α-amino acids with free amino and carboxyl groups, including those with coordinating functional groups like carboxylate or indole rings.

- **Advice 2**: **Correct SMARTS Patterns for Indole and Other Groups**  
  Refine the SMARTS patterns to accurately represent indole rings and other coordinating groups. For example, use `[nH]1c2ccccc2cc1` to match indole rings found in tryptophan. Verify that these patterns correctly identify the intended functional groups in the dataset.

- **Advice 3**: **Incorporate Additional Rules (Rules 2–11)**  
  Expand the rule set by implementing Rules 2 through 11 to capture a broader range of molecular features influencing yield. This will reduce overreliance on Rule 1 and improve the model's ability to generalize across different compounds.

- **Advice 4**: **Refine SMARTS Patterns for Additional Rules**  
  For each new rule, develop and refine SMARTS patterns that accurately reflect the described functional groups and structural motifs. Ensure that these patterns are specific enough to identify high-yield modifiers while being general enough to maintain adequate support.

- **Advice 5**: **Adjust Include and Exclude Logic**  
  Modify the rule logic to prioritize exclude patterns over include patterns. When a molecule matches both include and exclude patterns, the exclude pattern should take precedence, and the molecule should be predicted as low yield. This will prevent misclassification of compounds that possess deactivating features.

- **Advice 6**: **Balance Rule Contributions**  
  Analyze the contributions of all rules to the model's predictions. Adjust the weighting or thresholds of the rules to ensure that no single rule disproportionately influences the outcome. This will enhance the model's robustness and predictive accuracy.

- **Advice 7**: **Simplify Overly Complex Rules**  
  Review and simplify rules that are too specific or have low support. Generalize conditions where possible to increase the applicability of the rules without significantly reducing confidence. Consider merging similar rules to streamline the rule set.

- **Advice 8**: **Validate and Test SMARTS Patterns**  
  Collaborate with cheminformatics experts to validate all SMARTS patterns. Use test cases and known compounds to confirm that the patterns correctly identify the desired functional groups. This will improve the accuracy of the rule matching process.

- **Advice 9**: **Implement Iterative Testing and Validation**  
  Develop unit tests for each rule to verify their correct implementation. Employ cross-validation techniques to assess the model's performance and generalizability. Regularly update the rules based on validation results to continuously improve the model.

- **Advice 10**: **Enhance Data Representation**  
  If possible, expand the dataset to include more examples, especially for underrepresented classes. Ensure a balanced distribution of high and low yield examples to prevent bias in rule development and to improve model training.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with free amino and carboxyl groups, and side chains containing coordinating functional groups (e.g., carboxylate, indole rings) result in **high yield**. If the side chain is hydrophobic (e.g., phenyl group) or the amino group is modified (e.g., acetylated), the yield is **low** due to reduced coordination with the catalyst.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid *(Aspartic acid)*
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid *(Glutamic acid)*
    - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid *(Tryptophan)*
  
  - **Low Yield:** 
    - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid *(Phenylalanine)*
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid *(N-acetyllysine)*

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituents capable of coordinating to metal centers (e.g., amino, bromomethyl groups) result in **high yield** due to enhanced interaction with the catalyst. Those with non-coordinating or electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position lead to **low yield** by hindering effective coordination.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - 4-aminobenzoic acid
    - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  
  - **Low Yield:** 
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 3–8 carbons and without additional polar functional groups result in **high yield**. Introducing polar groups (e.g., hydroxy, amino) into longer aliphatic chains leads to **low yield** due to increased steric hindrance and disrupted hydrophobic interactions.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - Octanoic acid
    - 5-aminopentanoic acid
  
  - **Low Yield:** 
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group result in **high yield** due to the nitrogen's ability to coordinate with the metal center. If the nitrogen heterocycle is connected through additional aromatic rings or linkers, the yield is **low** because of steric hindrance and reduced electronic interaction.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid *(Nicotinic acid)*
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
  
  - **Low Yield:** 
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group (e.g., sugar acids) result in **high yield** due to enhanced hydrogen bonding and multiple coordination sites. Single hydroxyl groups or hydroxyl groups distant from the carboxyl group result in **low yield** as they provide fewer coordination opportunities and may introduce steric hindrance.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid *(Gluconic acid)*
  
  - **Low Yield:** 
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing thiol groups attached to aliphatic chains result in **high yield** due to the thiol's strong affinity for metal centers, enhancing coordination. Aromatic thiols lead to **low yield** because the thiol is less available for coordination and may cause catalyst deactivation.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  
  - **Low Yield:** 
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing electron-rich aromatic rings connected via an aliphatic chain (four or more carbons) to a carboxyl group result in **high yield**. The chain length allows for optimal positioning of the aromatic ring for π-interactions with the catalyst, enhancing binding. Shorter chains or absence of electron-donating substituents lead to **low yield**.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
    - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid
  
  - **Low Yield:** 
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with flexible polyether chains or multiple ether linkages (e.g., polyethylene glycol-like structures) linked to a terminal carboxyl group result in **low yield**. Their increased flexibility and polarity reduce effective interactions with the catalyst's active site due to unfavorable solvation and entropic effects.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:** 
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing strong electron-withdrawing groups, such as perfluoroalkyl or trifluoroacetyl groups, result in **low yield** due to decreased electron density on coordinating atoms, leading to poor interaction with the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:** 
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
    - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers possessing aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid, especially on aromatic rings, result in **low yield**. These groups can participate in side reactions or coordinate in a manner that deactivates the catalyst.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:** 
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
    - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with extended conjugated systems containing coordinating oxygen or nitrogen atoms adjacent to the carboxyl group result in **high yield**. The delocalized electron systems and additional coordination sites facilitate stronger binding to the catalyst.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: **For Rule 1**, the code does not correctly implement the side chain patterns specified under `'side_chain_patterns'`. Currently, these patterns are defined but not utilized in the matching logic. The code should be modified to include an additional check after matching the main patterns for the α-amino acid to verify that the side chain contains at least one of the `'side_chain_patterns'`. This can be done by searching for substructures matching the side chain patterns connected to the α-carbon. Ensure that the molecule passes all main patterns and at least one of the side chain patterns.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: **For Rule 2**, the patterns provided do not ensure that the coordinating substituents are at the para position on the aromatic ring. The SMARTS patterns should be refined to specifically match para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating groups. This can be achieved by using SMARTS that specify the substituent's position relative to the carboxylic acid group, such as `'c1cc([NX3H2])ccc1C(=O)O'` for para amino groups.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: **For Rule 3**, the code mentions a `'chain_length'` parameter but does not implement logic to utilize it. The code should be updated to calculate the carbon chain length of aliphatic carboxylic acids and check if it falls within the specified range (3–8 carbons). Additionally, the code should verify the absence of additional polar functional groups by checking for the absence of substructures like hydroxyl or amino groups along the chain using `'exclude_patterns'`.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: **For Rule 4**, the current pattern `'[n][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` may match heterocycles connected through additional rings. To ensure that nitrogen heterocycles are directly attached to the carboxyl group without additional linkers or rings, the SMARTS pattern should be adjusted to prevent matching extended systems. This can be achieved by specifying that the nitrogen heterocycle is a single ring directly bonded to the carboxyl group, for example, `'[nR][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` and excluding patterns where the nitrogen is part of a fused ring system.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: **For Rule 5**, the pattern `'[C](O)(O)[C](O)[C](O)[C](O)[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` is too specific and may miss valid sugar acids with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups. The pattern should be generalized to match any molecule with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group. This can be achieved by using recursive SMARTS or patterns that allow for variation in the number and position of hydroxyl groups, e.g., `'[C](O)[C](O)[C](O)[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'`.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: **For Rule 6**, the pattern `'[C][C][SX2H]'` is limited to a specific chain length and may not capture all aliphatic thiol-containing modifiers. The pattern should be broadened to match any aliphatic chain with a terminal thiol group. A revised pattern could be `'[CX4][CX4][CX4][SX2H]'` or use a variable length aliphatic chain `'[CX4]~[CX4]~[SX2H]'`.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: **For Rule 7**, the exclude pattern does not adequately prevent matching shorter chains. The code should implement chain length checks to ensure that only modifiers with aliphatic chains of four or more carbons are matched. This can be achieved by using SMARTS patterns that specify the minimum chain length, such as `'[c][C][C][C][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` and exclude shorter chains by patterns like `'[c][C][C][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'`.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: **In General**, the code should incorporate logical operators to combine patterns within each rule accurately. In some cases, rules require that certain patterns are present while others are absent. The current code checks patterns sequentially and may not capture the intended logic. Implementing a more sophisticated matching approach that allows for complex logical combinations (e.g., `(Pattern A AND Pattern B) AND NOT (Pattern C)`) will improve the accuracy.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: **Add Detailed Comments and Documentation**: To enhance the maintainability and readability of the code, include comments explaining the purpose of each SMARTS pattern and the logic behind combining them. This will help in future debugging and modification efforts.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: **Implement Testing and Validation**: Before applying the rules to the full dataset, test each rule individually on known compounds (e.g., the examples provided in the rules) to verify that the patterns correctly match high-yielding modifiers and exclude low-yielding ones. This step can help identify mismatches and refine patterns accordingly.

** End of Suggestions **
---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Standardize the Rules Using Quantifiable Molecular Descriptors**

  Reformulate the current rules to utilize quantifiable molecular descriptors that can be directly computed from SMILES strings. This includes parameters such as:

  - **Functional Group Counts**: Number of specific functional groups (e.g., carboxyl groups, amino groups, hydroxyl groups).
  - **Atom-Type Counts**: Counts of particular atom types (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur).
  - **Topological Descriptors**: Molecular weight, number of rotatable bonds, ring counts.
  - **Electronic Descriptors**: Partial charges, electron density parameters.
  - **Physicochemical Properties**: Log P (hydrophobicity), polar surface area, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors.

  By defining the rules based on these descriptors, you can create a numeric feature matrix suitable for data-driven modeling.

- **Advice 2**: **Convert Qualitative Descriptions into Threshold-Based Numeric Criteria**

  For rules that describe properties like "chain lengths of 3–8 carbons," set explicit numeric thresholds that can be applied to molecular descriptors. For example:

  - **Aliphatic Chain Length**: Use the exact carbon chain length as a descriptor and define yield outcomes based on specific length ranges.
  - **Electron-Withdrawing/Density Parameters**: Quantify electron-withdrawing effects using Hammett sigma constants or calculate electrophilicity indices.

- **Advice 3**: **Incorporate Substructure Searches and SMARTS Patterns**

  Define rules using SMARTS (SMILES Arbitrary Target Specification) patterns to identify specific substructures within molecules. This allows for computational identification of:

  - **Coordinating Functional Groups**: Presence of specific binding motifs (e.g., carboxylate anions, pyridine rings).
  - **Steric Hindrance Indicators**: Branching patterns, bulky substituents near coordination sites.

- **Advice 4**: **Use Molecular Fingerprints for Feature Representation**

  Employ molecular fingerprinting techniques (e.g., MACCS keys, Morgan fingerprints) to represent molecules as binary vectors indicating the presence or absence of substructures. This enables:

  - **Quantitative Similarity Assessments**: Compare modifiers based on structural similarity to known high-yielding compounds.
  - **Machine Learning Applications**: Input binary features into classification algorithms to predict yields.

- **Advice 5**: **Apply Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) Modeling**

  Develop QSAR models by correlating computed molecular descriptors with experimental yields. This involves:

  - **Descriptor Selection**: Use statistical methods to identify descriptors most correlated with high yield.
  - **Model Building**: Utilize regression or classification models to predict yields based on numeric descriptors.

- **Advice 6**: **Simplify and Consolidate Overlapping Rules**

  Analyze the current rules for redundancy and overlap. For instance, multiple rules may hinge on the presence of coordinating atoms (nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur). Consolidate these into a unified rule emphasizing:

  - **Coordination Number**: Total number of coordinating heteroatoms.
  - **Coordination Environment**: Spatial arrangement of coordinating sites relative to the carboxyl group.

- **Advice 7**: **Integrate Steric and Electronic Effects Quantitatively**

  Use parameters that quantify steric hindrance (e.g., molar refractivity, Verloop steric parameters) and electronic properties (e.g., HOMO-LUMO gap, Mulliken charges) to refine rules involving:

  - **Sterically Hindered Modifiers**: Assign numeric values to steric bulk near active sites.
  - **Electron-Rich/Electron-Poor Regions**: Quantify electron density to assess coordination potential.

- **Advice 8**: **Incorporate Solvation and Entropic Effects**

  Since some rules mention solvation and entropic factors (e.g., flexibility leading to low yield), include descriptors like:

  - **Flexibility Indices**: Number of rotatable bonds, conformational entropy estimates.
  - **Solvation Parameters**: Solvent-accessible surface area, solvatochromic parameters.

- **Advice 9**: **Create a Scoring or Weighting System**

  Assign weights or scores to different molecular features based on their impact on yield. For example:

  - **Coordinating Ability Score**: Higher scores for modifiers with multiple strong coordinating groups.
  - **Steric Hindrance Penalty**: Deduct points for bulky groups near coordination sites.
  - **Hydrophobic/Hydrophilic Balance**: Include a score reflecting the balance, tailored to the catalyst's environment.

- **Advice 10**: **Validate Refined Rules with Cross-Validation Techniques**

  Use statistical validation methods to test the predictive power of the new rules:

  - **Split Data into Training and Test Sets**: Ensure that the rules generalize beyond the given examples.
  - **Use Metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall**: Quantify the performance of the rules in predicting high or low yields.

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with free amino (-NH₂) and carboxyl (-COOH) groups, and side chains containing coordinating functional groups such as carboxylate or indole rings, result in a **high yield**. If the side chain is non-polar (e.g., phenyl group) or the amino group is modified (e.g., acetylated), the yield is **low** due to reduced coordination with the catalyst.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid)
    - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid)
    - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (Tryptophan)
  
  - **Low Yield:** 
    - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine)
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyllysine)

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents at the para position (e.g., amino, bromomethyl groups) lead to a **high yield** by enhancing coordination with the metal center. Those with electron-withdrawing groups or non-coordinating substituents at the para position result in a **low yield** due to decreased electron density and hindered coordination.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid*
    - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid*
  
  - **Low Yield:** 
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid*
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium chain lengths (5–8 carbons) and without additional polar functional groups result in a **high yield**. Introducing polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) into longer aliphatic chains leads to a **low yield** due to increased steric hindrance and disrupted hydrophobic interactions.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - *Octanoic acid*
    - *5-aminopentanoic acid*
  
  - **Low Yield:** 
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group (e.g., pyridine carboxylic acids, pyrazole carboxylic acids) result in a **high yield** due to the nitrogen's ability to coordinate with the metal center. If the nitrogen heterocycle is connected through additional aromatic rings or linkers, the yield is **low** because of steric hindrance and reduced electronic interaction.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**

    - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
  
  - **Low Yield:** 
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group (e.g., sugar acids) result in a **high yield** due to enhanced hydrogen bonding and multiple coordination sites. Modifiers with single hydroxyl groups or hydroxyl groups distant from the carboxyl group result in a **low yield** as they provide fewer coordination opportunities and may introduce steric hindrance.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
  
  - **Low Yield:** 
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing thiol (-SH) groups attached to short aliphatic chains result in a **high yield** due to the thiol's strong affinity for metal centers, enhancing coordination. Aromatic thiols lead to a **low yield** because the thiol group is less accessible for coordination and may cause catalyst deactivation.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*
  
  - **Low Yield:** 
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid*

**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify and Standardize Rules into Quantifiable Descriptors**
  
  Revise the current rules to focus on specific, quantifiable structural features that can be directly extracted from SMILES strings. For each rule, define clear molecular descriptors such as counts of functional groups, presence or absence of certain substructures, and numerical values for chain lengths or ring sizes. This standardization will facilitate the conversion of qualitative rules into quantitative features.

- **Advice 2**: **Develop a Feature Extraction Protocol Aligned with the Rules**
  
  Create a systematic protocol to extract molecular descriptors from the modifiers' SMILES representations. Utilize cheminformatics tools (e.g., RDKit, Open Babel) to automate the calculation of these descriptors. Ensure that the features align closely with the simplified rules to maintain consistency between the qualitative observations and quantitative data.

- **Advice 3**: **Consolidate Overlapping Rules for Clarity and Efficiency**
  
  Merge similar or overlapping rules to reduce redundancy. For instance, combine rules related to electron-donating groups enhancing yield and electron-withdrawing groups reducing yield into a single rule that considers the electronic nature of substituents. This consolidation will simplify the rule set and make it more user-friendly.

- **Advice 4**: **Translate Qualitative Rules into Numerical Features**
  
  Assign numerical values to features identified in the rules. For example:
  
  - **Functional Group Counts**: Number of amino groups, carboxyl groups, hydroxyl groups, thiol groups.
  - **Binary Indicators**: Presence (1) or absence (0) of specific rings (e.g., indole, pyridine).
  - **Chain Lengths**: Number of carbon atoms in aliphatic chains.
  - **Steric Factors**: Bulkiness scores based on substituent size.

  This approach enables the creation of a numeric feature matrix directly from SMILES.

- **Advice 5**: **Incorporate Computational Molecular Descriptors**
  
  Utilize established molecular descriptors that capture electronic, steric, and hydrophobic properties relevant to coordination chemistry. Examples include:
  
  - **Electronic Descriptors**: Partial charges, HOMO/LUMO energies, Hammett sigma constants.
  - **Steric Descriptors**: Connolly molecular surface area, Taft steric parameters.
  - **Hydrophobicity Descriptors**: LogP values, topological polar surface area (TPSA).

  These descriptors can be calculated computationally and provide quantitative measures aligned with the reaction outcomes.

- **Advice 6**: **Automate Descriptor Calculation Using Cheminformatics Tools**
  
  Implement software solutions to automate the extraction and calculation of molecular descriptors. Tools like RDKit can process SMILES strings to generate a wide array of descriptors efficiently, reducing manual errors and improving reproducibility.

- **Advice 7**: **Prioritize Features That Influence Metal Coordination**
  
  Focus on descriptors related to the modifiers' ability to coordinate with the metal center. Relevant features include:

  - **Coordination Sites**: Count of donor atoms (N, O, S) capable of metal binding.
  - **Chelation Potential**: Presence of chelating groups or ligands.
  - **Planarity and Conjugation**: Extended π-systems that can interact with the metal.

  Emphasizing these features will enhance the predictive power of the model concerning reaction yield.

- **Advice 8**: **Apply Machine Learning to Correlate Descriptors with Yield**
  
  Utilize statistical and machine learning models to analyze the relationship between the calculated descriptors and the experimental yields. Techniques such as regression analysis, decision trees, or support vector machines can identify the most significant features and improve prediction accuracy.

- **Advice 9**: **Continuous Refinement of Rules Based on Data Analysis**
  
  Regularly update and refine the rules based on insights from data analysis and modeling. If certain descriptors consistently show strong correlations with high or low yields, adjust the rules to reflect these findings, enhancing the rules' relevance and applicability.

- **Advice 10**: **Enhance Rule Accessibility and Documentation**
  
  Provide clear documentation and examples for each rule, illustrating how descriptors are calculated and applied. This transparency will assist users in understanding the rule set and facilitate its application in different contexts.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Reframe the Rules Using Computable Molecular Descriptors**  
  Modify the current rules to focus on molecular descriptors that can be directly computed from SMILES strings. Utilize features such as the presence and count of specific functional groups (e.g., amino groups, carboxyl groups), ring systems (aromatic vs. aliphatic), heteroatoms (N, O, S), and properties like molecular weight, logP, and topological polar surface area (TPSA). This will facilitate the generation of a numeric feature matrix for modeling.

- **Advice 2**: **Consolidate Overlapping Rules into Generalizable Categories**  
  Simplify the rules by grouping similar functional groups and structural motifs under broader categories. For example, instead of separate rules for modifiers with electron-donating groups at the para position (Rule 2) and modifiers with extended conjugated systems (Rule 12), create a unified rule for modifiers that increase electron density near the coordinating site. This consolidation reduces complexity and redundancy.

- **Advice 3**: **Implement Cheminformatics Tools for Automated Feature Extraction**  
  Utilize cheminformatics libraries like RDKit or Open Babel to extract molecular features from SMILES strings programmatically. Generate fingerprints (e.g., Morgan fingerprints), count functional groups, and calculate physicochemical properties. These numerical descriptors can serve as direct inputs for predictive modeling and rule refinement.

- **Advice 4**: **Adopt a Data-Driven Approach for Rule Refinement**  
  Analyze the existing dataset statistically to identify which molecular descriptors correlate strongly with yield outcomes. Use methods like correlation analysis, feature importance from machine learning models, or principal component analysis (PCA) to pinpoint critical features. Refine the rules based on these findings to ensure they are grounded in empirical data.

- **Advice 5**: **Simplify Rules by Prioritizing Key Functional Groups**  
  Focus on the most impactful functional groups that significantly affect the yield, such as free amino groups, carboxyl groups, and electron-donating substituents. Remove or merge rules associated with features that show minimal influence on the yield. This prioritization enhances the practical applicability of the rules.

- **Advice 6**: **Ensure Rules are Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive**  
  Redefine the rules to cover all relevant cases without overlap or ambiguity. Each modifier should be unambiguously classified based on the presence or absence of specific features. This clarity will improve consistency in applying the rules and prevent conflicting interpretations.

- **Advice 7**: **Include Negative Examples and Exceptions in Rule Definitions**  
  Acknowledge and document exceptions where certain modifiers do not conform to the general trends (e.g., modifiers with electron-donating groups but still resulting in low yield). Including these exceptions will enhance the robustness of the rules and help identify areas requiring further investigation.

- **Advice 8**: **Standardize Terminology and Structural Definitions**  
  Use consistent and standardized chemical terminology aligned with computational chemistry practices. Define functional groups and structural features using standardized substructure patterns that can be recognized computationally. This standardization will facilitate accurate parsing and interpretation of the rules.

- **Advice 9**: **Leverage Machine Learning for Rule Generation and Validation**  
  Employ machine learning models to learn patterns directly from the data. Algorithms like decision trees or random forests can identify complex nonlinear relationships between molecular features and yield. Use these models to validate existing rules or uncover new insights that can be translated into refined rules.

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with free amino (-NH₂) and carboxyl (-COOH) groups, and side chains containing additional coordinating functional groups such as carboxylate (-COOH), hydroxyl (-OH), or indole rings, result in a **high yield** due to enhanced coordination with the metal center. Modifiers that are α-amino acids with non-polar side chains (e.g., phenyl group) or modified amino groups result in a **low yield** due to reduced coordination.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid)

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with functional groups capable of coordinating (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) at positions ortho or para to the carboxyl group result in a **high yield** due to enhanced coordination ability. Modifiers lacking such groups or with non-coordinating substituents result in a **low yield**.**

    - *4-methylbenzoic acid*
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 5 to 8 carbons and no additional functional groups result in a **high yield** due to optimal chain length for catalyst interaction. Introducing polar functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) at positions distant from the carboxyl group in longer aliphatic chains leads to a **low yield** due to steric hindrance and reduced coordination efficiency.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - *Octanoic acid*

    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group or connected via short aliphatic chains result in a **high yield** due to favorable coordination of nitrogen atoms with the metal center. Modifiers where the nitrogen heterocycle is connected through additional aromatic rings result in a **low yield** due to steric hindrance and reduced coordination.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:** 
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups (polyols) near the carboxyl group result in a **high yield** due to enhanced hydrogen bonding and multiple coordination sites.

  - **High Yield:** 
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
  
  - **Low Yield:** 
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing thiol (-SH) groups attached to short aliphatic chains result in a **high yield** due to the thiol's strong affinity for metal centers, enhancing coordination. Thiol groups on aromatic rings lead to a **low yield** because the thiol group is less accessible for coordination due to steric hindrance.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*

  - **Low Yield:** 
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with aromatic rings connected to the carboxyl group via flexible aliphatic chains (of at least four carbons) and bearing electron-donating substituents (e.g., hydroxyl, methoxy) result in a **high yield** due to optimal spatial arrangement for interaction with the catalyst. Shorter chains or lack of such substituents reduce the yield.**

    - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*
    - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid*
  
  - **Low Yield:** 
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*

    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*
    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing strong electron-withdrawing groups, such as perfluoroalkyl or trifluoroacetyl groups, lead to a **low yield** due to decreased electron density on coordinating atoms, hindering interaction with the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:** 
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*
    - *4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing flexible polyether chains or multiple ether linkages attached to a carboxyl group result in a **low yield** due to increased flexibility and unfavorable entropy, reducing effective coordination with the catalyst.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:** 
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers where coordinating functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) are modified or sterically hindered, such as through acetylation or embedded in bulky groups, result in a **low yield** due to reduced accessibility to the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyllysine)
    - *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with extended conjugated systems containing coordinating oxygen or nitrogen atoms adjacent to the carboxyl group result in a **high yield** due to delocalized electrons enhancing coordination with the catalyst.**

    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths shorter than 5 carbons and containing polar functional groups (e.g., amino, thiol) close to the carboxyl group result in a **high yield** due to their ability to coordinate effectively with the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*
    - *5-aminopentanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with functional groups capable of forming covalent interactions or coordination bonds (e.g., halomethyl groups) at positions ortho or para to the carboxyl group on aromatic rings result in a **high yield** due to enhanced interaction with the catalyst.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid*

  - **Low Yield:** 
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (methyl group lacks the ability to coordinate)

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are small molecules with both carboxylate and adjacent hydroxyl groups result in a **high yield** due to bidentate coordination enhancing interaction with the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows one to determine the yield outcome based on the presence of specific functional groups in α-amino acids. It provides strong property insight by explaining how additional coordinating groups enhance metal coordination. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures, such as free amino and carboxyl groups with coordinating side chains. With five data points supporting the rule (three high yield, two low yield), it meets the coverage criterion and achieves a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear in distinguishing modifiers based on the presence of coordinating functional groups ortho or para to the carboxyl group on aromatic rings. It offers property insight by linking these positions to enhanced metal coordination. The rule involves combinations of sub-structures and is supported by four data points (one high yield, three low yield), satisfying the coverage requirement and balancing complexity with coverage.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 clearly correlates aliphatic chain length and the presence of additional functional groups with yield outcomes. It provides property insight by explaining how optimal chain lengths facilitate catalyst interaction, while distant polar groups cause steric hindrance. The rule considers combinations of chain length and functional groups and is supported by five data points (two high yield, three low yield), fulfilling the coverage criterion and maintaining a balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear in differentiating modifiers based on how nitrogen-containing heterocycles are connected to the carboxyl group. It provides property insight into steric effects and coordination ability. The rule encompasses combinations of structural features and is supported by four data points (three high yield, one low yield), meeting the coverage standard and balancing complexity with coverage.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear in its structural description, focusing on polyols near the carboxyl group. It offers property insight into how multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups enhance coordination through hydrogen bonding. However, it is supported by only one high-yield data point and two low-yield points, which does not fully meet the coverage criterion. The limited data support reduces the rule's robustness despite its complexity.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 clearly states the effect of thiol groups on yield based on their position. It provides property insight into the strong affinity of thiol groups for metal centers. Nonetheless, with only one high-yield data point and one low-yield point, the rule lacks sufficient coverage, diminishing its overall reliability.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear in describing the importance of flexible aliphatic chains and electron-donating substituents on aromatic rings. It provides property insight into optimal spatial arrangement and electron donation enhancing catalyst interaction. The rule considers combinations of structural features and is supported by three data points (two high yield, one low yield), meeting the minimal coverage requirement and balancing complexity with coverage.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear and provides property insight into how aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxyl group can interfere with catalyst activity. It is supported by three low-yield data points, satisfying the coverage criterion. The rule effectively balances complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 clearly links strong electron-withdrawing groups to decreased yield due to reduced electron density hindering coordination. It provides property insight and is supported by two low-yield data points, meeting the coverage requirement. The rule balances complexity and coverage well.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear in its description of how flexible polyether chains reduce coordination efficiency due to unfavorable entropy. It offers property insight and is supported by two low-yield data points, satisfying the coverage criterion and maintaining a balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 clearly explains how steric hindrance or modification of coordinating groups reduces yield. It provides property insight and is supported by two low-yield data points, meeting the coverage requirement. The rule balances complexity and coverage effectively.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is clear and provides property insight into how extended conjugated systems enhance coordination through delocalized electrons. It is supported by two high-yield data points, meeting the minimal coverage requirement. The rule considers combinations of structural features and balances complexity with coverage adequately.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear in specifying the effect of short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar groups near the carboxyl group. It offers property insight into effective coordination due to proximity of functional groups. Supported by two high-yield data points, it meets the coverage criterion and maintains a balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 is clear and provides property insight into how functional groups capable of forming covalent interactions enhance catalyst interaction. However, with only one high-yield data point and one low-yield point, the rule does not fully satisfy the coverage requirement, limiting its robustness.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 is clear in describing the importance of bidentate coordination from carboxylate and adjacent hydroxyl groups. While it offers property insight, it is based on a single high-yield data point, insufficient for the coverage criterion, which impacts the rule's reliability despite its complexity.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers where coordinating functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) are modified or sterically hindered, such as through acetylation or embedded in bulky groups, result in a **low yield** due to reduced accessibility to the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:** 
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyllysine)
    - *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with extended conjugated systems containing coordinating oxygen or nitrogen atoms adjacent to the carboxyl group result in a **high yield** due to delocalized electrons enhancing coordination with the catalyst.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths shorter than 5 carbons and containing polar functional groups (e.g., amino, thiol) close to the carboxyl group result in a **high yield** due to their ability to coordinate effectively with the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*
    - *5-aminopentanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with functional groups capable of forming covalent interactions or coordination bonds (e.g., halomethyl groups) at positions ortho or para to the carboxyl group on aromatic rings result in a **high yield** due to enhanced interaction with the catalyst.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid*

  - **Low Yield:** 
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (methyl group lacks the ability to coordinate)

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are small molecules with both carboxylate and adjacent hydroxyl groups result in a **high yield** due to bidentate coordination enhancing interaction with the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*

These rules collectively describe the relationship between the structural features of molecular modifiers and their influence on the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By considering combinations of functional groups and their positions within the modifiers, these rules can predict whether a given SMILES structure is likely to result in a high or low yield.---------------------------------------------------------------

**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: In the current code, the SMARTS patterns within each `patterns_high` and `patterns_low` list are combined using a logical AND (`all(...)`) during substructure matching. This means a molecule must match **all** patterns to be considered a match, which is not aligned with the natural language rules. To fix this, modify the code to use a logical OR for patterns within each list. Replace `all(mol.HasSubstructMatch(pat) for pat in rule['compiled_patterns_high'])` with `any(mol.HasSubstructMatch(pat) for pat in rule['compiled_patterns_high'])`, and similarly for `patterns_low`.

- **Suggestion 2**: For Rule 1, the SMARTS patterns should accurately reflect the relationship between the α-amino acid backbone and the side chains. Instead of listing the backbone and side chain patterns separately and combining them with an AND, create composite SMARTS patterns that represent the α-amino acids with specific side chains. For example:
  - High yield pattern: `[$([NX3H2][CX4H]([C][OX2H])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1])]` (α-amino acid with side chain containing -OH)
  - Low yield pattern: `[$([NX3H2][CX4H]([c])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1])]` (α-amino acid with phenyl side chain)

- **Suggestion 3**: Utilize more specific SMARTS patterns that capture the exact structural features described in the rules, including the position of functional groups. For example, for Rule 2, define patterns that specifically match amino or hydroxyl groups at ortho or para positions relative to the carboxyl group on the aromatic ring:
  - High yield patterns:
    - Ortho amino group: `c1c(N)cccc1C(=O)O`
    - Para hydroxyl group: `c1cc(O)ccc1C(=O)O`
  - Low yield patterns:
    - Aromatic carboxylic acid without coordinating groups: `c1ccccc1C(=O)O`

- **Suggestion 4**: Update the code to handle positional isomerism correctly. In SMARTS, include positional descriptors to ensure that functional groups are matched at the correct positions. For example, use `[$(c1cc(N)ccc1C(=O)O)]` to match an amino group at the para position in Rule 2.

- **Suggestion 5**: For rules involving chain lengths (e.g., Rule 3), adjust the SMARTS patterns to match exact chain lengths. Instead of general patterns, use patterns like `[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH3]` for a five-carbon chain carboxylic acid (pentanoic acid). This ensures precise matching for the specified chain lengths.

- **Suggestion 6**: Incorporate recursive SMARTS or use logical operators within the patterns to capture complex structural conditions. For example, in Rule 5, where multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups are required near the carboxyl group, use SMARTS like `[$([CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CH](O)[CH](O)[CH2])]`.

- **Suggestion 7**: Add explicit hydrogen atoms and stereochemistry where relevant, to improve specificity in matching. For example, include `[H]` atoms in SMARTS patterns when the presence or absence of hydrogen is significant according to the rule.

- **Suggestion 8**: Review and refine the SMARTS patterns using cheminformatics tools like RDKit's `Draw.MolToImage()` to visualize substructure matches, or SMARTS testers to ensure that patterns match the intended structures.

- **Suggestion 9**: Extend the code to cover all 15 rules, following the corrected pattern matching approach. Ensure that each rule is translated into SMARTS patterns that accurately represent the structural features described in the natural language rules.

- **Suggestion 10**: Implement a priority system in the code to handle cases where a molecule may match both high and low yield patterns within the same rule. Decide on a consistent method to resolve such conflicts, such as assigning priority to the low yield prediction if both patterns are matched.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

Upon reviewing the provided metrics and comparing them to the reference data, several observations can be made regarding the performance of the current rules. The focus will be on **confidence** and **lift**, as these metrics are crucial for evaluating the predictive power and usefulness of the rules.

---

### **1. Decrease in Train Confidence**

- **Previous Train Confidence**: 
  - Mean values: **0.6352** and **0.5396**
- **Current Train Confidence**: 
  - Initially ranged from **0.6** to **0.6317** in the earlier iterations.
  - **Final iteration**: **0.4**

**Interpretation**:

- The **train confidence** represents the proportion of instances where the rules' conditions lead to the correct prediction.
- A confidence value of **0.4** indicates that only **40%** of the time the rules correctly predict the yield when the conditions are met, which is significantly lower than previous mean values.
- The decrease from initial values of around **0.6** to **0.4** suggests a decline in the rules' predictive reliability over the course of the iterations.

---

### **2. Decline in Train Lift**

- **Previous Train Lift**: 
  - Mean values: **1.2048** and **1.0559**
- **Current Train Lift**: 
  - Earlier iterations ranged from **1.2118** to **1.2627**
  - **Final iteration**: **0.8**

**Interpretation**:

- **Lift** measures how much more likely the outcome is when the condition is present compared to when it is absent.
- A lift value **greater than 1** indicates that the rule is useful in improving prediction over random chance.
- The current lift of **0.8** (less than 1) implies that the rule is **not helpful** and that the presence of the condition actually decreases the likelihood of the predicted outcome compared to random chance.
- This is a significant decline from the earlier iterations and previous metrics where lift values were above 1.

---

### **3. Reduction in Train Support**

- **Previous Train Support**: 
  - Mean values: **0.1667** and **0.1845**
- **Current Train Support**: 
  - Decreased from **0.0408** to **0.0114** over iterations
  - **Final iteration**: **0.0**

**Interpretation**:

- **Support** represents the proportion of the dataset that meets both the rule's conditions and prediction.
- A support of **0.0** indicates that **no instances** in the training data fulfill the rule's conditions.
- This lack of support renders the confidence and lift metrics less meaningful, as they are based on an empty set of instances.

---

### **4. Negative Train Leverage**

- **Previous Train Leverage**: 
  - Values: **0.0289** and **-0.0041**
- **Current Train Leverage**: 
  - Earlier iterations fluctuated slightly but remained positive.
  - **Final iteration**: **-0.0029**

**Interpretation**:

- **Leverage** quantifies the difference between the observed support and the expected support if the rule's conditions and prediction were independent.
- A negative leverage indicates that the rule's conditions and prediction occur together **less frequently** than would be expected by chance, suggesting a negative association.
- The negative leverage in the final iteration confirms the decline in rule performance.

---

### **Summary of Observations**

- **Decreasing Confidence and Lift**: Suggests the rules are becoming less predictive and may not be capturing the true relationships in the data.
- **Zero Support**: Implies that the rules are too specific or not applicable to the dataset, making them ineffective.
- **Negative Leverage**: Indicates a possible inverse relationship between the conditions and the prediction, contrary to the intended effect.

---

**Implications on Rule Performance**

- The **combination of low confidence, lift below 1, zero support, and negative leverage** demonstrates a significant deterioration in the performance of the current rules compared to previous iterations.
- The rules have potentially become **overfitted** or **overly restrictive**, targeting conditions that are not present in the training data.
- The metrics suggest that the rules are not only ineffective but may also be misleading if relied upon for prediction.

---

**Potential Explanations**

1. **Over-Specificity of Rules**: The current rules may contain too many specific conditions or complex combinations of features that are rarely or never met in the dataset.

2. **Incorrect Rule Formulation**: The rules might be based on assumptions that do not hold true in the data, perhaps due to misinterpretation of the underlying chemistry or interactions.

3. **Data Imbalance**: There may be an imbalance in the dataset, with certain modifier types or yields underrepresented, leading to unreliable metrics.

4. **Local Minimum**: The iterative process may have settled into a local minimum where small changes no longer improve the metrics, indicating that further iterations may yield diminishing returns.

---

**Recommendations for Improvement**

1. **Simplify and Generalize Rules**:

   - **Reduce Over-Specificity**: Identify and remove excessively detailed conditions that limit the applicability of the rules.
   - **Focus on Key Features**: Prioritize the most impactful functional groups and structural features that consistently influence the yield.

2. **Reassess Rule Validity**:

   - **Consult Domain Expertise**: Engage with chemists or domain experts to validate the assumptions and mechanisms proposed in the rules.
   - **Empirical Testing**: Use statistical methods or experimental data to verify the relationships implied by the rules.

3. **Increase Data Support**:

   - **Expand Dataset**: Incorporate additional data to cover more instances where the rules may apply, improving support.
   - **Balance the Dataset**: Ensure that high and low yield examples are adequately represented to prevent skewed metrics.

4. **Iterative Refinement**:

   - **Review Previous Successful Rules**: Analyze earlier iterations where confidence and lift were higher to identify what aspects were effective.
   - **Avoid Overfitting**: Be cautious of adding too many conditions or exceptions that tailor the rules too closely to the training data.

5. **Alternative Metrics**:

   - **Evaluate Additional Metrics**: Consider using other metrics like the F1 score or ROC-AUC to gain a different perspective on rule performance.
   - **Cross-Validation**: Employ cross-validation techniques to assess the generalizability of the rules.

6. **Algorithmic Support**:

   - **Use Rule Mining Algorithms**: Implement algorithms like Apriori or FP-Growth to discover frequent patterns and associations in the data.
   - **Machine Learning Models**: Explore machine learning approaches to model the relationships and generate rules based on learned patterns.

---

**Conclusion**

The current iteration of rules exhibits diminished performance compared to previous iterations, as evidenced by lower confidence, lift below 1, zero support, and negative leverage. These indicators suggest the rules are not effectively capturing the relationships needed to predict the yield accurately.

To improve the current rules:

- **Simplify** and **generalize** the rules to increase their applicability.
- **Reevaluate** the underlying assumptions and ensure they align with both chemical principles and empirical data.
- **Expand and balance** the dataset to provide a stronger foundation for rule support.
- **Iteratively refine** the rules based on feedback from metrics and domain expertise.
- **Incorporate algorithmic methods** to assist in identifying robust and meaningful patterns.

By addressing these areas, the rules can be enhanced to provide more reliable predictions, ultimately contributing to better understanding and optimization of the catalytic process under investigation.

ML Commenter Message:
**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

Based on the latest training results and the provided reference metrics, the performance of the current set of rules has shown some variability and a general decline in predictive accuracy compared to previous iterations.

1. **Comparison of Accuracies:**

   - **Previous Iterations:**
     - Validation Accuracies were consistently around **0.76**.
     - Test Accuracies ranged between **0.625** and **0.75**.
  
   - **Current Iteration:**
     - Validation Accuracy is **0.5143**, significantly lower than previous values.
  
   - **Observation:**
     - The decrease in validation accuracy suggests that the current rules may not be as effective in capturing the underlying patterns as the previous rule sets.

2. **Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting:**

   - **Underfitting Indication:**
     - The significant drop in validation accuracy indicates that the model might be underfitting.
     - The model is unable to capture the complexity of the data, possibly due to overly generalized or ineffective rules.
  
   - **Overfitting Not Evident:**
     - Overfitting is less likely since we don't see a scenario where training accuracy is high while validation accuracy is low.

3. **SHAP Analysis and Rule Effectiveness:**

   - **Consistent Misclassifications:**
     - Several molecules with high experimental loading are being predicted as low loading.
     - Specifically, molecules:
       - *C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N*
       - *C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O*
       - *C1=CNC(=O)C=C1C(=O)O*
       - *C1=CN=CC=C1CCCC(=O)O*
       - *C1=C(C=NN1)C(=O)O*
  
   - **High Negative SHAP Values for Rule 4:**
     - For these misclassified molecules, **Rule 4** consistently shows a negative SHAP value (-0.0198 or -0.0185).
     - This suggests that **Rule 4** is contributing to underestimation of the loading.
  
   - **Rule 4 Impact:**
     - **Rule 4** pertains to "Modifiers containing nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group or connected via short aliphatic chains result in a **high yield**..."
     - However, the negative SHAP values indicate that the model is using this rule to predict **low loading**, which is contrary to the intended effect.
  
   - **Rule 1 and Rule 12 SHAP Values:**
     - In previous iterations, **Rule 1** and **Rule 12** had significant positive SHAP values contributing to accurate predictions of high loading.
     - In the current iteration, these rules are not present in the SHAP analysis, indicating they may have been modified or removed.
  
4. **Interpretation of Accuracy Trends:**

   - The decrease in accuracy suggests that the recent changes to the rules might have led to the loss of important predictive features.
   - The model might have become too simplistic (underfitting) due to the reduction or alteration of key rules that previously contributed positively.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

1. **Re-evaluate Rule 4:**

   - **Issue Identified:**
     - Rule 4 is intended to predict high yields for modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles connected to carboxyl groups.
     - Negative SHAP values for Rule 4 in cases where experimental loading is high suggest that the rule is not functioning as intended.
  
   - **Action:**
     - Review and refine **Rule 4** to ensure it correctly identifies and contributes positively to the prediction of high loading modifiers with nitrogen heterocycles.
     - Consider adding specificity to the rule to account for different types of nitrogen heterocycles and their positions.

2. **Restore or Reinforce Effective Rules:**

   - **Observations:**
     - **Rule 1** (regarding α-amino acids) and **Rule 12** (modifiers with extended conjugated systems adjacent to the carboxyl group) previously had positive contributions.
     - Their absence or reduced influence in the current model could be causing underfitting.
  
   - **Action:**
     - Reintroduce or strengthen **Rule 1** and **Rule 12** to leverage their predictive power.
     - Ensure that these rules are accurately capturing the key structural features that lead to high loading.

3. **Address Underfitting:**

   - **Expand Rule Set:**
     - Consider adding more nuanced rules that capture intermediate cases or exceptions not covered by current rules.
     - Ensure that the rules are neither too general nor too specific.
  
   - **Rule Interactions:**
     - Evaluate how different rules interact.
     - The combination of rules might be leading to contradictory predictions.
     - Adjust the rules to minimize negative interactions.

4. **Use SHAP Analysis to Refine Rules:**

   - **Positive SHAP Values in Misclassifications:**
     - Identify rules that contribute positively to incorrect high loading predictions.
     - For example, if there is an overestimation due to a rule with a high positive SHAP value, refine that rule to be more accurate.
  
   - **Negative SHAP Values in Underestimations:**
     - As with Rule 4, negative SHAP values in cases where high loading is predicted as low indicate that the rule is penalizing the prediction incorrectly.
     - Adjust these rules to ensure they contribute appropriately.

5. **Improve Generalization:**

   - **Balance Rule Specificity:**
     - Avoid overly specific rules that capture only a few molecules.
     - Generalize rules where possible, but maintain necessary specificity to capture important structural features.
  
   - **Cross-Validation:**
     - Continue using cross-validation to assess the model's performance and ensure that changes improve generalization.

6. **Iterative Refinement:**

   - **Monitor Performance Metrics:**
     - After each adjustment, reassess the validation accuracy and SHAP values.
     - Aim for gradual improvements rather than drastic changes.
  
   - **Threshold Adjustments:**
     - Reconsider thresholds within rules.
     - For example, chain length criteria in aliphatic acids (Rule 3) can be adjusted based on SHAP insights.

7. **Consider Additional Features:**

   - **Incorporate New Rules:**
     - If certain functional groups or structural motifs frequently appear in misclassified molecules, consider creating new rules to capture these features.
  
   - **Quantitative Descriptors:**
     - Supplement rules with quantitative descriptors (e.g., electron density, steric hindrance) to enhance the model's ability to differentiate between high and low loading modifiers.

**Conclusion**

The current set of rules appears to be less effective than previous iterations, likely due to underfitting introduced by changes or removals of key rules. By focusing on refining Rule 4, reintroducing effective rules like Rule 1 and Rule 12, and continuously leveraging SHAP analysis for targeted improvements, we can enhance the predictive accuracy of the model. Iterative refinement and careful balancing of rule specificity will be essential in developing a robust model that generalizes well to new data.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

The current set of rules for predicting the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction has shown a decline in performance based on the provided metrics and analyses. Key observations from the discussions are as follows:

1. **Performance Metrics Indicate Decline**:
   - **Decreasing Confidence and Lift**: The train confidence has decreased from around 0.6 to 0.4, and the train lift has dropped below 1, indicating that the rules are less effective than random chance in predicting high yields.
   - **Zero Support and Negative Leverage**: The train support has reached zero, and the train leverage is negative, suggesting that the rules are either too specific or incorrectly formulated, matching no instances in the training data.

2. **SHAP Analysis Reveals Misclassifications**:
   - Molecules that experimentally yield high modifier loading are being misclassified as low loading.
   - **Rule 4** is contributing negatively to the predictions, as indicated by negative SHAP values in cases where it should support high loading predictions.
   - Effective rules from previous iterations, such as **Rule 1** (α-amino acids) and **Rule 12** (extended conjugated systems), are no longer contributing positively, possibly due to alterations or removal.

**Directions and Suggestions for Improvement**:

1. **Modify Pattern Matching Logic**:
   - **Use Logical OR Instead of AND**: Change the code to use a logical OR when combining SMARTS patterns within each rule. This aligns with the natural language interpretation of the rules, where a molecule needs to match any one of the patterns to be considered a match for high or low yield.

2. **Refine SMARTS Patterns for Specificity**:
   - **Accurate Representation of Structural Features**: Ensure that SMARTS patterns precisely reflect the structural elements described in the natural language rules.
   - **Composite Patterns**: For rules involving specific combinations of features (e.g., α-amino acids with certain side chains), create composite SMARTS patterns that encompass the entire substructure rather than separate patterns combined with an AND logic.

3. **Address Issues with Rule 4**:
   - **Correct the Polarity of Rule 4**: Adjust Rule 4 so that it appropriately predicts high yields for modifiers containing nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group or connected via short aliphatic chains.
   - **Ensure Positive Contribution**: Modify the rule so that it contributes positively in the SHAP analysis for molecules it is intended to cover.

4. **Reintroduce Effective Rules from Previous Iterations**:
   - **Restore Rule 1 and Rule 12**: Bring back the rules that previously had a significant positive impact on predictions, ensuring they are correctly implemented.
   - **Enhance Rule Definitions**: Refine these rules to better capture the key structural features that lead to high yields, such as specifying positions of functional groups and stereochemistry when relevant.

5. **Adjust for Positional Isomerism and Stereochemistry**:
   - Include positional descriptors in SMARTS patterns to match functional groups at the correct positions.
   - Incorporate stereochemical information where it influences the yield.

6. **Avoid Over-Specificity and Overfitting**:
   - **Generalize Rules Appropriately**: Balance specificity with generalization to prevent rules from being too narrow, which can lead to zero support.
   - **Simplify Complex Patterns**: Reduce complexity in SMARTS patterns where overcomplication does not contribute to better predictions.

7. **Implement Priority System for Conflicting Matches**:
   - Establish a consistent method to resolve cases where a molecule matches both high and low yield patterns within the same rule, such as prioritizing the low yield prediction or assigning weights.

8. **Validate and Test Adjustments Iteratively**:
   - After making changes, re-evaluate the rules using cross-validation and SHAP analysis to ensure that modifications lead to improvements.
   - Monitor performance metrics closely to avoid introducing new issues.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

Based on the analyses and suggestions, there is a clear possibility for further optimizing the current rules without overfitting:

- **Improving Pattern Matching Logic**: By adjusting the logical operators and refining SMARTS patterns, the rules can better align with the chemical principles and the data.
- **Correcting Misaligned Rules**: Fixing rules like Rule 4 to function as intended can enhance predictive accuracy.
- **Reincorporating Effective Rules**: Bringing back and refining rules that previously contributed positively can restore and improve model performance.
- **Balancing Specificity and Generalization**: Adjusting the level of detail in the rules can prevent overfitting while capturing essential patterns.

**Please Optimize Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with free amino (-NH₂) and carboxyl (-COOH) groups, and side chains containing additional coordinating functional groups such as carboxylate (-COOH), hydroxyl (-OH), or indole rings, result in a **high yield** due to enhanced coordination with the metal center. Modifiers that are α-amino acids with non-polar side chains (e.g., phenyl group) or modified amino groups result in a **low yield** due to reduced coordination.**

  **Examples:**

    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 5 to 8 carbons and no additional functional groups result in a **high yield** due to optimal chain length for catalyst interaction. Introducing polar functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) at positions distant from the carboxyl group in longer aliphatic chains leads to a **low yield** due to steric hindrance and reduced coordination efficiency.**

    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group or connected via short aliphatic chains result in a **high yield** due to favorable coordination of nitrogen atoms with the metal center.

    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
  
  - **Low Yield:** 
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing thiol (-SH) groups attached to short aliphatic chains result in a **high yield** due to the thiol's strong affinity for metal centers, enhancing coordination. Thiol groups on aromatic rings lead to a **low yield** because the thiol group is less accessible for coordination due to steric hindrance.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*

  - **Low Yield:** 
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with aromatic rings connected to the carboxyl group via flexible aliphatic chains (of at least four carbons) and bearing electron-donating substituents (e.g., hydroxyl, methoxy) result in a **high yield** due to optimal spatial arrangement for interaction with the catalyst. Shorter chains or lack of such substituents reduce the yield.**

    - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*
    - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid*
  
  - **Low Yield:**

    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing strong electron-withdrawing groups, such as perfluoroalkyl or trifluoroacetyl groups, lead to a **low yield** due to decreased electron density on coordinating atoms, hindering interaction with the metal center.**

    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*
    - *4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing flexible polyether chains or multiple ether linkages attached to a carboxyl group result in a **low yield** due to increased flexibility and unfavorable entropy, reducing effective coordination with the catalyst.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:** 
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers where coordinating functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) are modified or sterically hindered, such as through acetylation or embedded in bulky groups, result in a **low yield** due to reduced accessibility to the metal center.**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*
    - *5-aminopentanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with functional groups capable of forming covalent interactions or coordination bonds (e.g., halomethyl groups) at positions ortho or para to the carboxyl group on aromatic rings result in a **high yield** due to enhanced interaction with the catalyst.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid*

  - **Low Yield:** 
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (methyl group lacks the ability to coordinate)

---

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Modify the logical operators in your rule implementation to use logical OR (`|`) instead of AND (`&`) when combining SMARTS patterns within each rule.** This change will ensure that a molecule matching any one of the SMARTS patterns within a rule will be considered a match, aligning with the natural language intent of "Modifiers that are... result in a high yield".

- **Advice 2**: **Refine the SMARTS patterns within each rule to accurately reflect the structural features described in the natural language rules.** Ensure that the SMARTS patterns capture all key functional groups and their relative positions. For example, for Rule 1 (α-amino acids with coordinating side chains), include patterns that represent the side chains with carboxylate (`-C(=O)[O-]`), hydroxyl (`-OH`), or indole rings.

- **Advice 3**: **Correct Rule 4 by adjusting the SMARTS patterns to properly identify modifiers containing nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group or connected via short aliphatic chains.** Ensure that the patterns include pyridine carboxylic acids and similar structures, and that they contribute positively to high yield predictions.

- **Advice 4**: **Reintroduce and correctly implement effective rules from previous iterations, such as Rule 1 and Rule 12.** For Rule 1, focus on α-amino acids with free amino and carboxyl groups and coordinating side chains. For Rule 12, ensure that modifiers with extended conjugated systems adjacent to the carboxyl group are accurately captured.

- **Advice 5**: **Include positional descriptors and stereochemistry in your SMARTS patterns where they influence the yield.** Specify positions such as ortho (`o`), meta (`m`), or para (`p`) on aromatic rings, and use stereochemical markers (e.g., `@`, `@@`) to represent chiral centers when necessary.

- **Advice 6**: **Avoid over-specificity in your SMARTS patterns to prevent zero support and overfitting.** Generalize patterns by focusing on essential functional groups and connectivity rather than overly detailed features. For example, instead of specifying exact chain lengths or substituents, use ranges or wildcard atoms where appropriate.

- **Advice 7**: **Implement a priority system or conflict resolution method for cases where a molecule matches both high and low yield patterns within the same rule.** One approach is to assign weights to each match and calculate a cumulative score, or to prioritize low yield predictions to err on the side of caution.

- **Advice 8**: **Simplify complex SMARTS patterns by breaking them into smaller, more manageable sub-patterns that can be combined logically.** This makes the patterns more readable and easier to debug, ensuring they function as intended.

- **Advice 9**: **Validate the adjusted rules iteratively by testing them against the dataset and analyzing performance metrics such as confidence, lift, support, and leverage.** Use SHAP analysis to identify the impact of each rule on the predictions and make further adjustments as needed.

- **Advice 10**: **Ensure that each rule's implementation in code matches the natural language description precisely.** Cross-check the SMARTS patterns and logical operators against the rule descriptions to confirm alignment.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows us to determine high or low yield modifiers based on the presence of α-amino acids with polar side chains (additional -COOH or -OH groups). The rule provides good physical-chemical insight into how coordinating groups enhance metal interaction. It considers combinations of sub-structures, specifically the amino acid backbone and side chain functional groups. The rule is well-supported by multiple data points, balancing complexity and coverage effectively.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear in specifying that aromatic carboxylic acids with para amino or hydroxyl groups result in high yield, while non-coordinating or electron-withdrawing groups result in low yield. The rule provides solid physical-chemical insight into how the substituents affect electron density and coordination ability. It considers combinations of structural features and is supported by multiple data points, achieving a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear and allows us to determine modifiers based on chain length and terminal functional groups. It provides good physical-chemical insight into how terminal coordinating groups affect the reaction and considers combinations of sub-structures (chain length and functional group position). The rule is supported by multiple data points, showing appropriate balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 clearly specifies that modifiers with nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group result in high yield, while those with additional aromatic rings leading to steric hindrance result in low yield. The rule provides good insight into coordination via nitrogen atoms and sterics. It considers sub-structures and is supported by several data points, achieving a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 clearly describes modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group leading to high yield due to enhanced coordination. It provides good physical-chemical insight. It considers combinations of sub-structures and is supported by data points, balancing complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear but perhaps oversimplified, specifying that aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 6 to 8 carbons without additional functional groups result in high yield. Physical-chemical insight into hydrophobic interactions is provided. However, coverage is low, supported by only one data point (octanoic acid). The rule's simplicity may limit its applicability.

The physical-chemical insight is sound. The rule considers combinations of structural features and is supported by multiple data points, balancing complexity and coverage appropriately.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 clearly states that modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxyl group or on the aromatic ring result in low yield due to side reactions and decreased coordination ability. The physical-chemical reasoning is appropriate. The rule is supported by several data points, effectively balancing complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 clearly differentiates between thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings resulting in low yield due to sterics, and thiol groups on short aliphatic chains resulting in high yield. The physical-chemical insight is logical. The rule considers structural combinations and is supported by data, balancing complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear but relies on a specific structural feature (halomethyl group at the para position) and is supported by only one data point. While the physical-chemical insight is plausible, the low coverage limits the rule's robustness.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 describes modifiers with fused nitrogen-containing heterocycles and keto forms leading to high yield due to resonance stabilization enhancing coordination. While it offers physical-chemical insight, the rule is complex and is supported by only two data points, which limits its coverage.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is detailed, specifying both chain length and the presence of electron-donating groups on the aromatic ring for high yield modifiers. It provides good physical-chemical insight into spatial orientation and electron effects. While the rule is complex, it is supported by several data points, achieving a balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 clearly states that modifiers with amide bonds or bulky substituents near the carboxyl group result in low yield due to steric hindrance. The physical-chemical reasoning is sound. The rule considers combinations of structural features and is supported by multiple data points, balancing complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 clearly states that amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking additional coordinating groups result in low yield due to hydrophobic side chains and absence of coordination sites. However, the rule is only supported by one data point (phenylalanine), and there is a counterexample (tryptophan, which shows high yield). This limits the rule's coverage and suggests that the rule may need refinement.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Enhance Rule Coverage and Support**
  
  For rules that are supported by only one or two data points (e.g., Rules 6, 7, 11, and 12), consider gathering additional data or examples to strengthen their validity. If more data cannot be found, evaluate whether these rules can be combined with other rules to improve coverage and reduce redundancy.

- **Advice 2**: **Merge Overlapping Rules for Clarity**
  
  Identify and merge rules that have overlapping criteria to simplify the rule set. For example, Rules 6 and 13 both address aliphatic carboxylic acids with specific chain lengths and coordinating groups. Combining them into a single rule about optimal chain length and functional group presence can reduce complexity and enhance clarity.

- **Advice 3**: **Refine Rules with Exceptions**
  
  Adjust rules that have notable exceptions or counterexamples. For instance, Rule 15 states that amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking additional coordinating groups result in low yield, yet tryptophan (which has an indole ring) results in a high yield. Modify the rule to account for aromatic side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms like nitrogen.

- **Advice 4**: **Provide Deeper Physical-Chemical Insights**
  
  Expand the physical-chemical explanations in the rules to improve understanding. For example, in rules concerning chain length (e.g., Rule 3), explain why certain chain lengths favor effective coordination with the metal center. This deeper insight can help in predicting yields for untested modifiers.

- **Advice 5**: **Streamline Rules with Limited Data Support**
  
  Reassess the necessity of rules that are based on minimal data and possibly consolidate them with other rules. For example, Rule 11, which relies on a single high-yield example involving halomethyl groups, could be integrated into a broader rule about substituents that enhance metal coordination.

- **Advice 6**: **Generalize Electronic Effects in Modifiers**
  
  Combine rules that deal with electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., Rules 2 and 7) into a comprehensive rule addressing how the electronic nature of substituents near the carboxyl group influences coordination ability and, consequently, the yield.

- **Advice 7**: **Clarify Complex Structural Criteria**
  
  Simplify and clarify rules with complex criteria to make them more accessible. For instance, in Rule 4, clearly differentiate between modifiers with nitrogen heterocycles directly attached versus those connected via additional rings. Including structural diagrams or more detailed descriptions can aid understanding.

- **Advice 8**: **Validate and Adjust Rules Using the Dataset**
  
  Cross-examine the rules against all data points to ensure their predictions match the observed yields. If discrepancies are found, adjust the rules accordingly. This iterative validation helps refine the rules for better predictive accuracy.

- **Advice 9**: **Include Contrasting Examples in Each Rule**
  
  Strengthen rules by providing both high-yield and low-yield examples where applicable. This contrast enhances the rule's predictive power and provides clearer guidance on structural features that influence the yield.

- **Advice 10**: **Ensure Consistent Criteria Across Rules**
  
  Standardize the terminology and criteria used in different rules to maintain consistency. Define terms like "short aliphatic chain," "bulkiness," and "terminal position" uniformly throughout the rules to prevent confusion and overlapping interpretations.

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that contain both a carboxylate (-COOH) group and a free amino (-NH₂) group on the α-carbon, with side chains containing additional polar coordinating groups such as carboxyl (-COOH), result in a **high yield**. The combination of multiple coordinating sites enhances interaction with the metal center. If the amino group is blocked (e.g., acetylated) or the side chain lacks additional coordinating groups, the yield is **low** due to reduced coordination capability.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid)
    - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid)

  - **Low Yield:** 
    - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine)
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyllysine)

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with an electron-donating group such as an amino (-NH₂) or hydroxyl (-OH) at the para position result in a **high yield**. These groups increase electron density and provide additional coordination sites, enhancing interaction with the metal center. Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., formyl, nitro) or non-coordinating substituents at the same positions result in a **low yield** due to decreased electron density and coordination ability.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid*
    - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid*

  - **Low Yield:** 
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 3 to 8 carbons and a free amino (-NH₂) or thiol (-SH) group at the ω (terminal) position result in a **high yield**. The terminal polar groups provide effective coordination with the metal center, and the optimal chain length facilitates proper spatial orientation. Modifiers with longer chains, internal polar groups, or lacking terminal coordinating groups result in a **low yield** due to reduced coordination efficiency.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - *5-aminopentanoic acid*
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*
    - *Octanoic acid*

  - **Low Yield:** 
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group result in a **high yield**, as nitrogen atoms can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity. If the nitrogen heterocycle is connected via additional aromatic rings or is sterically hindered, the yield is **low** due to decreased coordination efficiency.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
    - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*

  - **Low Yield:** 
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Pyridyl connected via benzene ring)

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl (-OH) groups (polyols) near the carboxyl group result in a **high yield**. The presence of several coordinating hydroxyl groups enhances interaction with the metal center. Modifiers with single hydroxyl groups, hydroxyl groups distant from the carboxyl group, or additional electron-withdrawing groups result in a **low yield** due to fewer coordination opportunities or decreased electron density.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)

  - **Low Yield:** 
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that contain strong electron-withdrawing groups such as fluoroalkyl chains (e.g., trifluoromethyl, perfluoroalkyl) near the carboxyl group result in a **low yield**. These groups decrease electron density at the coordination sites, hindering interaction with the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*
    - *4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with flexible ether linkages (e.g., polyether chains) connected to the carboxyl group result in a **low yield**. Increased conformational flexibility and steric hindrance reduce effective coordination with the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with aldehyde (-CHO) or ketone (>C=O) functional groups adjacent to the carboxyl group or on the aromatic ring result in a **low yield**. These groups can engage in side reactions and decrease coordination ability with the metal center due to electron-withdrawing effects.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*
    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains capable of additional coordination through heteroatoms (e.g., indole nitrogen in tryptophan) result in a **high yield**. The extra coordination site enhances interaction with the metal center. Aromatic side chains lacking such coordinating heteroatoms result in a **low yield** due to limited coordination.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (Tryptophan)

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine)

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers where potential coordinating amino groups are blocked or modified (e.g., acetylation) result in a **low yield**. Blocking reduces the number of available coordination sites, hindering effective interaction with the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyllysine)
    - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid*

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with thiol (-SH) groups directly attached to an aliphatic chain result in a **high yield**. The thiol group provides a strong coordination site for the metal center. Conversely, thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings result in a **low yield** due to steric hindrance and decreased accessibility for coordination.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*

  - **Low Yield:** 
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with conjugated systems containing keto groups adjacent to aromatic rings connected directly to the carboxyl group result in a **high yield**. Resonance-stabilized structures enhance coordination with the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with aromatic groups connected via an aliphatic chain of 4 to 5 carbons and possessing electron-donating groups (e.g., hydroxyl, methoxy) on the aromatic ring result in a **high yield**. This combination promotes optimal spatial orientation and increased electron density for effective coordination with the metal center. Shorter chains or lack of electron-donating substituents reduce the yield.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*
    - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (Shorter chain length)

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with steric bulk near coordination sites or bulky substituents that hinder approach to the metal center result in a **low yield**. This includes modifiers where coordinating groups are attached via additional rings or bulky groups, reducing accessibility.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Pyridyl connected via benzene ring)
    - *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are simple aromatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups result in a **low yield**. The lack of electron-donating or coordinating substituents on the aromatic ring leads to insufficient interaction with the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid*
    - *2-oxoheptanedioic acid*

These rules combine multiple functional groups and structural features, considering underlying physicochemical properties such as coordination ability, electron density, steric hindrance, and chain length. Each rule predicts whether a molecular modifier will result in a high or low yield for the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction based on its specific characteristics. The rules aim to cover a broad range of the dataset while balancing simplicity and complexity to provide both general and detailed insights.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: **Rule 1** is clear and allows us to determine the yield based on the presence of both a carboxylate and a free amino group on the α-carbon, along with side chains containing additional coordinating groups like carboxyl (-COOH). It provides strong physical-chemical insight into how multiple coordinating sites enhance interaction with the metal center. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures and is supported by multiple data points, achieving a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 2** clearly explains the effect of electron-donating groups at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids on the yield. It offers solid property insights by emphasizing increased electron density and additional coordination sites. The rule considers both functional groups and their positions, is supported by several examples, and strikes a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 3** lacks clarity due to contradictory examples. While it states that aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 3 to 8 carbons and a terminal amino (-NH₂) or thiol (-SH) group result in a high yield, the inclusion of **octanoic acid**, which lacks these groups, as a high-yield example is confusing. This inconsistency reduces clarity. The rule needs refinement to accurately reflect the impact of chain length and terminal functional groups on the yield.

- **Comment 4**: **Rule 4** is clear and considers modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group. It provides good physical-chemical insight into coordination with metal centers and considers structural combinations. The rule is well-supported by data points and achieves a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** effectively identifies modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl (-OH) groups near the carboxyl group as resulting in a high yield. It provides strong property insights into how several coordinating hydroxyl groups enhance metal interaction. The rule considers combinations of functional groups, is well-supported by data, and maintains a good balance.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** is clear and provides good insights into how strong electron-withdrawing groups like fluoroalkyl chains decrease electron density at coordination sites, resulting in a low yield. It is adequately supported by data points and maintains an acceptable balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** is clear in associating flexible ether linkages connected to the carboxyl group with a low yield due to increased conformational flexibility and steric hindrance. It offers relevant property insights and is supported by examples, achieving a good balance.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** clearly states that modifiers with aldehyde (-CHO) or ketone (>C=O) groups adjacent to the carboxyl group or on the aromatic ring result in a low yield. It provides property insights into potential side reactions and decreased coordination ability due to electron-withdrawing effects. The rule is supported by data points and maintains balance.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** effectively distinguishes between amino acids with aromatic side chains capable of additional coordination through heteroatoms (e.g., indole nitrogen in tryptophan) and those without. It is clear, provides good property insight, considers combinations of sub-structures, and is well-supported, achieving a good balance.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** is clear in indicating that blocking or modifying potential coordinating amino groups leads to a low yield. It offers property insight into how blocking reduces available coordination sites, hindering metal interaction. The rule is supported by data points and maintains an acceptable balance.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** distinguishes between thiol (-SH) groups on aliphatic chains (high yield) versus aromatic rings (low yield). It is clear, provides strong property insights into coordination efficiency, considers sub-structure combinations, and is supported by data, achieving a good balance.

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** is clear in associating modifiers with conjugated keto systems adjacent to aromatic rings directly connected to the carboxyl group with a high yield. It provides property insights into resonance stabilization enhancing metal coordination, is supported by data points, and maintains balance.

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13** clearly links aliphatic carboxylic acids with aromatic groups connected via an aliphatic chain of 4 to 5 carbons and possessing electron-donating groups on the aromatic ring to a high yield. It offers property insights, considers combinations of structural features, is well-supported by data, and achieves a good balance.

- **Comment 14**: **Rule 14** is clear about how steric bulk near coordination sites or bulky substituents hinder metal interaction, resulting in a low yield. It provides property insights, considers combinations of structural features, and is supported by the dataset, maintaining balance.

- **Comment 15**: **Rule 15** lacks some clarity due to inconsistent examples. It states that simple aromatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups result in a low yield but includes **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**, which is an aliphatic dicarboxylic acid with a ketone group, not an aromatic compound. This inconsistency reduces clarity and suggests the rule could be refined to improve accuracy and alignment between the description and examples.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that contain both a carboxylate (-COOH) group and a free amino (-NH₂) group on the α-carbon, with side chains containing additional polar coordinating groups such as carboxyl (-COOH), result in a **high yield**. The combination of multiple coordinating sites enhances interaction with the metal center. If the amino group is blocked (e.g., acetylated) or the side chain lacks additional coordinating groups, the yield is **low** due to reduced coordination capability.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid)
    - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid)

  - **Low Yield:** 
    - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine)
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyllysine)

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with an electron-donating group such as an amino (-NH₂) or hydroxyl (-OH) at the para position result in a **high yield**. These groups increase electron density and provide additional coordination sites, enhancing interaction with the metal center. Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., formyl, nitro) or non-coordinating substituents at the same positions result in a **low yield** due to decreased electron density and coordination ability.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid*
    - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid*

  - **Low Yield:** 
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 3 to 8 carbons and a free amino (-NH₂) or thiol (-SH) group at the ω (terminal) position result in a **high yield**. The terminal polar groups provide effective coordination with the metal center, and the optimal chain length facilitates proper spatial orientation. Modifiers with longer chains, internal polar groups, or lacking terminal coordinating groups result in a **low yield** due to reduced coordination efficiency.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - *5-aminopentanoic acid*
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*
    - *Octanoic acid*

  - **Low Yield:** 
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group result in a **high yield**, as nitrogen atoms can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity. If the nitrogen heterocycle is connected via additional aromatic rings or is sterically hindered, the yield is **low** due to decreased coordination efficiency.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
    - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*

  - **Low Yield:** 
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Pyridyl connected via benzene ring)

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl (-OH) groups (polyols) near the carboxyl group result in a **high yield**. The presence of several coordinating hydroxyl groups enhances interaction with the metal center. Modifiers with single hydroxyl groups, hydroxyl groups distant from the carboxyl group, or additional electron-withdrawing groups result in a **low yield** due to fewer coordination opportunities or decreased electron density.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)

  - **Low Yield:** 
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that contain strong electron-withdrawing groups such as fluoroalkyl chains (e.g., trifluoromethyl, perfluoroalkyl) near the carboxyl group result in a **low yield**. These groups decrease electron density at the coordination sites, hindering interaction with the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*
    - *4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with flexible ether linkages (e.g., polyether chains) connected to the carboxyl group result in a **low yield**. Increased conformational flexibility and steric hindrance reduce effective coordination with the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with aldehyde (-CHO) or ketone (>C=O) functional groups adjacent to the carboxyl group or on the aromatic ring result in a **low yield**. These groups can engage in side reactions and decrease coordination ability with the metal center due to electron-withdrawing effects.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*
    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains capable of additional coordination through heteroatoms (e.g., indole nitrogen in tryptophan) result in a **high yield**. The extra coordination site enhances interaction with the metal center. Aromatic side chains lacking such coordinating heteroatoms result in a **low yield** due to limited coordination.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (Tryptophan)

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine)

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers where potential coordinating amino groups are blocked or modified (e.g., acetylation) result in a **low yield**. Blocking reduces the number of available coordination sites, hindering effective interaction with the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyllysine)
    - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid*

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with thiol (-SH) groups directly attached to an aliphatic chain result in a **high yield**. The thiol group provides a strong coordination site for the metal center. Conversely, thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings result in a **low yield** due to steric hindrance and decreased accessibility for coordination.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:** 
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*

  - **Low Yield:** 
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with conjugated systems containing keto groups adjacent to aromatic rings connected directly to the carboxyl group result in a **high yield**. Resonance-stabilized structures enhance coordination with the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with aromatic groups connected via an aliphatic chain of 4 to 5 carbons and possessing electron-donating groups (e.g., hydroxyl, methoxy) on the aromatic ring result in a **high yield**. This combination promotes optimal spatial orientation and increased electron density for effective coordination with the metal center. Shorter chains or lack of electron-donating substituents reduce the yield.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*
    - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (Shorter chain length)

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with steric bulk near coordination sites or bulky substituents that hinder approach to the metal center result in a **low yield**. This includes modifiers where coordinating groups are attached via additional rings or bulky groups, reducing accessibility.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Pyridyl connected via benzene ring)
    - *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are simple aromatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups result in a **low yield**. The lack of electron-donating or coordinating substituents on the aromatic ring leads to insufficient interaction with the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid*
    - *2-oxoheptanedioic acid*

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules combine multiple functional groups and structural features, considering underlying physicochemical properties such as coordination ability, electron density, steric hindrance, and chain length. Each rule predicts whether a molecular modifier will result in a high or low yield for the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction based on its specific characteristics. The rules aim to cover a broad range of the dataset while balancing simplicity and complexity to provide both general and detailed insights.---------------------------------------------------------------

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: *Enhance Rule 2 to include all electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups at the para position.* The current code for Rule 2 only checks for amino (-NH₂) and hydroxyl (-OH) groups as electron-donating substituents and formyl and nitro groups as electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position. To align more closely with the natural language rule, modify the code to include other electron-donating groups (e.g., methoxy (-OCH₃), alkyl groups) and electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., halogens, cyano (-CN), trifluoromethyl (-CF₃)) at the para position. This can be done by creating more general SMARTS patterns that capture a wider range of substituents.

- **Suggestion 2**: *Generalize the chain length and structural criteria in Rule 3.* The current code strictly checks for unbranched aliphatic chains where internal carbons have a degree of 2 and are not in rings. This might exclude valid modifiers with slight branching or flexibility in their aliphatic chains. Update the code to allow for chains with permissible branching or varying degrees, as long as the chain length between the carboxyl group and the terminal amino or thiol group is within the specified range (3 to 8 carbons).

- **Suggestion 3**: *Expand the detection of electron-withdrawing groups in Rule 6.* The code currently only identifies trifluoromethyl groups (-CF₃) as strong electron-withdrawing groups. Modify the SMARTS pattern to detect other fluoroalkyl chains (e.g., perfluoroalkyl groups like -C₂F₅, -C₃F₇) and additional strong electron-withdrawing groups near the carboxyl group, such as nitro (-NO₂), cyano (-CN), and sulfonyl (-SO₂-) groups.

- **Suggestion 4**: *Broaden the polyether pattern in Rule 7 to capture various ether linkages.* The existing SMARTS pattern for detecting polyether chains is very specific and may not identify all modifiers with flexible ether linkages connected to the carboxyl group. Replace it with a more general pattern that can match ethers of varying lengths and configurations, such as repetitive -[O][C]- units. For example, use a recursive SMARTS pattern like '[OX2][CX4](CO)*[CX4][OX2]' to match different polyether chains.

- **Suggestion 5**: *Correct the SMARTS patterns in Rule 9 to accurately represent amino acids with coordinating heteroatoms.* The current SMARTS patterns for tryptophan and phenylalanine include a dot ('.'), which denotes separate molecules and may not correctly match the intended substructures within a single molecule. Revise the patterns to remove the dot and correctly identify the indole ring of tryptophan and the phenyl ring of phenylalanine connected to the amino acid backbone. For example, use patterns like '[NX3H2][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX2H1])[CX3H]c1c[nH]c2ccccc12]' for tryptophan.

- **Suggestion 6**: *Generalize SMARTS patterns across all rules to cover more applicable structures.* Instead of targeting only specific examples, adjust the SMARTS patterns to embody the general features described in each rule. For instance, in Rule 4, replace the pattern with one that matches any nitrogen heterocycle directly attached to a carboxyl group, such as '[nH0;r][c][C](=O)[O;H1,-]'.

- **Suggestion 7**: *Review and refine SMARTS patterns to ensure accuracy and completeness.* Go through each SMARTS pattern in the code and compare it with the functional groups and structural features described in the natural language rules. Ensure that the patterns are neither too restrictive nor too broad, and adjust them to accurately capture all relevant compounds. Utilize RDKit's substructure search capabilities effectively by testing patterns on known examples.

- **Suggestion 8**: *Include additional substructure checks where applicable.* For rules involving steric hindrance (Rule 14) or the presence of specific functional groups (Rule 8), consider implementing additional checks for bulkiness or adjacency of groups to the carboxyl function. This might involve calculating the Steric Hindrance Index or using molecular descriptors to quantify bulkiness.

- **Suggestion 9**: *Incorporate more thorough validation and testing of the code.* Test the revised code against a larger set of molecules, including both positive and negative examples for each rule, to ensure that the rules are applied correctly. This will help identify any remaining issues in the SMARTS patterns or logic.

- **Suggestion 10**: *Improve error handling and add informative comments.* Ensure that all try-except blocks are only catching expected exceptions and that any errors are logged or reported for debugging. Additionally, enhance the code comments to explain the purpose of each SMARTS pattern and logic used, aiding future maintenance and updates.

**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify the Rules into Quantifiable Parameters**

  Transform the current rules into a set of quantifiable molecular descriptors that can be directly extracted from SMILES strings. Identify key functional groups and structural features that influence the yield and represent them numerically. For example:
  
  - **Count of Functional Groups**: Number of carboxylate (-COOH), amino (-NH₂), hydroxyl (-OH), thiol (-SH), and other coordinating groups.
  - **Chain Lengths**: Numerical values for the length of aliphatic chains.
  - **Presence of Aromatic Rings**: Binary indicator (1 for presence, 0 for absence).
  - **Electron Donating/Withdrawing Groups**: Assign numerical values based on Hammett sigma constants or other electronic parameters.

- **Advice 2**: **Develop a Numerical Feature Matrix Using Cheminformatics Tools**

  Utilize cheminformatics libraries like RDKit to parse SMILES strings and calculate molecular descriptors. Create a feature matrix with the following properties:

  - **Structural Descriptors**: Molecular weight, number of rings, ring sizes, number of rotatable bonds.
  - **Electronic Descriptors**: Partial charges, LogP values, topological polar surface area (TPSA).
  - **Functional Group Counts**: Enumerate specific functional groups relevant to coordination (e.g., counts of -NH₂, -OH, -SH, -COOH).
  - **Connectivity Descriptors**: Eccentric connectivity index, adjacency matrices.

- **Advice 3**: **Convert Qualitative Rules into Quantitative Thresholds**

  Redefine rules with clear numerical thresholds. For instance:

  - **Rule 1 Modified**: Modifiers with **≥2 coordinating functional groups** (e.g., amino and carboxylate groups) within **2 bonds** of each other result in high yield.
  - **Rule 3 Modified**: Aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths **between 3 and 8 carbons** and a terminal coordinating group (e.g., -NH₂, -SH) result in high yield.

- **Advice 4**: **Create a Standardized Descriptor Table for Modifiers**

  Develop a table where each modifier is represented by standardized descriptors, such as:

  - **Modifier Name**
  - **SMILES String**
  - **Functional Group Counts**: Number of -COOH, -NH₂, -OH, -SH groups.
  - **Chain Lengths**: Number of carbons in the longest aliphatic chain.
  - **Aromaticity**: Number of aromatic rings.
  - **Steric Factors**: Cumulative steric hindrance values.

- **Advice 5**: **Employ Molecular Fingerprints for Feature Extraction**

  Use molecular fingerprinting methods (e.g., ECFP, MACCS keys) to convert molecular structures into binary vectors representing the presence or absence of substructures. These fingerprints can serve as features in machine learning models.

- **Advice 6**: **Consolidate Overlapping Rules and Eliminate Redundancies**

  Review the current rules to identify overlaps and redundancies. Merge similar rules and focus on the primary factors affecting yield. For example:

  - Combine rules related to electron-donating groups enhancing coordination (Rules 2, 5, 9) into a single rule with quantifiable descriptors.
  - Group rules that address steric hindrance (Rules 4, 7, 14) and represent steric effects numerically.

- **Advice 7**: **Incorporate Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) Modeling**

  Use QSAR modeling to correlate numerical molecular descriptors with yield outcomes. This approach will allow for the prediction of yield based on calculated properties and can handle continuous variables effectively.

- **Advice 8**: **Assign Numerical Scores to Functional Groups Based on Coordination Ability**

  Create a scoring system where functional groups are assigned numerical values reflecting their coordination strength. For example:

  - **Strong Coordinators**: -NH₂, -SH (Score: +2)
  - **Moderate Coordinators**: -OH, pyridine nitrogen (Score: +1)
  - **Weak/Non-Coordinators**: -CH₃, phenyl groups (Score: 0)
  - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups**: -NO₂, -CF₃ (Score: -1)

  Sum the scores for each modifier to get an overall coordination score, which can be correlated with yield.

- **Advice 9**: **Develop a Decision Tree or Flowchart Based on Numerical Criteria**

  Create a decision tree where each node represents a quantifiable property leading to a high or low yield classification. This visual representation can simplify the prediction process and aid in feature extraction.

- **Advice 10**: **Use Machine Learning Algorithms Suitable for Numerical Data**

  Apply machine learning models such as Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, or Neural Networks that can handle numerical feature matrices. Ensure that the features used are derived from the modifiers' structural and electronic properties.

**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify and Quantify Rules**: Modify the current rules to focus on quantifiable molecular descriptors that can be directly extracted from SMILES strings. For example, instead of stating "Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups in proximity to the carboxyl group result in a high yield," specify "Modifiers with two or more hydroxyl groups within three bonds of the carboxyl group result in a high yield." This allows for numeric representation of features like the count of hydroxyl groups and their distances from the carboxyl group.

- **Advice 2**: **Use Standardized Molecular Descriptors**: Incorporate standardized cheminformatics descriptors that can be calculated computationally, such as molecular weight, LogP (octanol-water partition coefficient), topological polar surface area (TPSA), number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, and counts of specific atom types (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur). These descriptors can be easily generated from SMILES and used to create a numeric feature matrix.

- **Advice 3**: **Define Clear Structural Features**: Rephrase the rules to specify clear structural features that can be identified programmatically. For example, instead of "Modifiers containing nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group," specify "Modifiers with a pyridine or pyrazole ring directly bonded to the carboxyl carbon atom." This clarity enables automated substructure searches.

- **Advice 4**: **Implement Substructure Fingerprints**: Use substructure fingerprints or molecular fragments (e.g., MACCS keys, Morgan fingerprints) to represent the presence or absence of specific functional groups or substructures mentioned in the rules. This allows for a binary or count-based numeric representation of the features.

- **Advice 5**: **Quantify Steric and Electronic Effects**: For rules involving steric hindrance or electronic properties, utilize quantifiable parameters such as Van der Waals volumes, Sterimol parameters, or computed partial charges. These values can numerically represent steric bulk and electron density, facilitating inclusion in the feature matrix.

- **Advice 6**: **Eliminate Ambiguity in Language**: Remove subjective terms like "short," "long," "bulky," or "near." Replace them with explicit numerical thresholds. For instance, define "short aliphatic chains" as "aliphatic chains of 1 to 5 carbon atoms."

- **Advice 7**: **Standardize Functional Group Counts**: Specify exact counts of functional groups required for high yield. For example, "Modifiers with exactly one amino group and two carboxyl groups result in a high yield." This precision aids in creating discrete numeric features.

- **Advice 8**: **Consolidate Overlapping Rules**: Review the rules for redundancy and overlap. Consolidate similar rules to reduce complexity. For example, combine rules about electron-donating groups enhancing yield into one rule with a list of specific substituents and their positions.

- **Advice 9**: **Map Rules to Computable Properties**: Ensure each rule can be directly associated with computable properties from the molecular structure. Utilize cheminformatics toolkits (like RDKit) to programmatically calculate these properties from SMILES strings, ensuring consistency and efficiency.

- **Advice 10**: **Incorporate Machine Learning Feature Selection**: Use statistical methods or machine learning algorithms to analyze the dataset and identify which molecular features are most predictive of yield. Refine the rules based on these insights to focus on the most impactful descriptors.

Modifiers with fewer hydroxyl groups or hydroxyl groups distant from the carboxyl group result in a **low yield** due to fewer coordination opportunities.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
    - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing thiol (-SH) groups attached to short aliphatic chains result in a **high yield**. Thiol groups are strong ligands that effectively coordinate with the metal center. Thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings result in a **low yield** due to steric hindrance and reduced accessibility for coordination.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid*

---

These groups reduce electron density at coordination sites, hindering interaction with the metal center. Modifiers without such groups or with electron-donating groups result in a **high yield** due to better coordination.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*

  - **High Yield:**
    - *Octanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths up to eight carbons and without additional functional groups result in a **high yield**. The lack of bulky substituents allows for better interaction with the metal center. Modifiers with polar groups distant from the carboxyl group result in a **low yield** due to decreased solubility and reduced coordination efficiency.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *Octanoic acid*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with bulky side chains or blocked coordination sites (e.g., acylated amino groups) result in a **low yield**. Steric hindrance reduces accessibility to the metal center, hindering effective coordination.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyllysine)
    - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid*
    - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine)

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with flexible polyether chains lacking strong coordinating groups result in a **low yield**. The increased conformational flexibility and absence of effective coordination sites reduce interaction with the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with conjugated systems containing multiple coordinating heteroatoms (e.g., oxygen, nitrogen) result in a **high yield**. Delocalized electron systems and the presence of multiple coordination sites facilitate strong binding to the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*
    - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (Tryptophan)

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with aliphatic chains linking aromatic rings bearing coordinating groups (e.g., hydroxyl (-OH), methoxy (-OCH₃)) result in a **high yield** if the chain length allows optimal flexibility and proximity to the metal center. Shorter chains may result in a **low yield** due to reduced flexibility and steric constraints.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*
    - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid*
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with coordination-inhibiting substituents, such as bulky groups or multiple rings between the functional group and the carboxyl group, result in a **low yield**. These structural features impede effective interaction with the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid*

These rules have been developed through a detailed analysis of the provided dataset, considering the underlying physicochemical properties that influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. The rules focus on direct combinations of substructures and functional groups within the molecular modifiers, such as coordination sites, electron-donating or -withdrawing groups, steric effects, and chain lengths.

Each rule clearly predicts whether a modifier will result in a high or low yield based on its structural features. By combining multiple functional groups and considering their combined effects, these rules provide clear guidelines for predicting the performance of different modifiers in the reaction.

The set of 12 rules strikes a balance between simple rules with higher coverage and more complex rules with lower coverage, effectively covering a broad range of the dataset. This approach facilitates better selection and design of modifiers to optimize and control the yield of the target reaction.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with free amino (-NH₂) and carboxyl (-COOH) groups, especially those with small or additional carboxyl-containing side chains, result in a **high yield**. The presence of accessible coordination sites enhances interaction with the metal center, improving catalyst activity. Bulky side chains or blocked amino groups reduce the yield due to steric hindrance and decreased coordination ability.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid)
    - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid)

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating electron-donating substituents such as amino (-NH₂) or hydroxyl (-OH) groups at the para position result in a **high yield**. These groups enhance electron density and provide additional coordination sites. Modifiers with non-coordinating substituents (e.g., methyl) or electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., formyl (-CHO)) at the para position result in a **low yield** due to decreased coordination ability.**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid*
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group result in a **high yield**. The lone pair electrons on the nitrogen can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalyst performance. If the nitrogen heterocycle is connected via an additional aromatic ring or bulky group, the yield is **low** due to steric hindrance and reduced coordination efficiency.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
    - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Pyridine ring attached through a benzene ring)

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups near the carboxyl group, such as sugar acids, result in a **high yield**. The additional hydroxyl groups offer multiple coordination sites and enhance solubility, improving interaction with the metal center. Modifiers with fewer hydroxyl groups or hydroxyl groups distant from the carboxyl group result in a **low yield** due to fewer coordination opportunities.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
    - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing thiol (-SH) groups attached to short aliphatic chains result in a **high yield**. Thiol groups are strong ligands that effectively coordinate with the metal center. Thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings result in a **low yield** due to steric hindrance and reduced accessibility for coordination.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., formyl (-CHO), fluorinated alkyl chains) near the carboxyl group result in a **low yield**. These groups reduce electron density at coordination sites, hindering interaction with the metal center. Modifiers without such groups or with electron-donating groups result in a **high yield** due to better coordination.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*

  - **High Yield:**
    - *Octanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths up to eight carbons and without additional functional groups result in a **high yield**. The lack of bulky substituents allows for better interaction with the metal center. Modifiers with polar groups distant from the carboxyl group result in a **low yield** due to decreased solubility and reduced coordination efficiency.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *Octanoic acid*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with bulky side chains or blocked coordination sites (e.g., acylated amino groups) result in a **low yield**. Steric hindrance reduces accessibility to the metal center, hindering effective coordination.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyllysine)
    - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid*
    - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine)

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with flexible polyether chains lacking strong coordinating groups result in a **low yield**. The increased conformational flexibility and absence of effective coordination sites reduce interaction with the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with conjugated systems containing multiple coordinating heteroatoms (e.g., oxygen, nitrogen) result in a **high yield**. Delocalized electron systems and the presence of multiple coordination sites facilitate strong binding to the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*
    - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (Tryptophan)

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with aliphatic chains linking aromatic rings bearing coordinating groups (e.g., hydroxyl (-OH), methoxy (-OCH₃)) result in a **high yield** if the chain length allows optimal flexibility and proximity to the metal center. Shorter chains may result in a **low yield** due to reduced flexibility and steric constraints.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*
    - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid*
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with coordination-inhibiting substituents, such as bulky groups or multiple rings between the functional group and the carboxyl group, result in a **low yield**. These structural features impede effective interaction with the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid*

**End of Rules**

These rules have been developed through a detailed analysis of the provided dataset, considering the underlying physicochemical properties that influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. The rules focus on direct combinations of substructures and functional groups within the molecular modifiers, such as coordination sites, electron-donating or -withdrawing groups, steric effects, and chain lengths.

Each rule clearly predicts whether a modifier will result in a high or low yield based on its structural features. By combining multiple functional groups and considering their combined effects, these rules provide clear guidelines for predicting the performance of different modifiers in the reaction.

The set of 12 rules strikes a balance between simple rules with higher coverage and more complex rules with lower coverage, effectively covering a broad range of the dataset. This approach facilitates better selection and design of modifiers to optimize and control the yield of the target reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: Modify the code to use logical **'AND'** between substructure patterns for rules that require multiple features to be present simultaneously. Currently, the code uses an **'OR'** logic within each rule, matching if any one of the substructures is found. For example, for **'Rule 1 High'**, the code should ensure that the molecule contains **both** a primary amine **and** a carboxylic acid group to match the rule, not just one of them.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Incorporate the **'small_side_chain'** pattern into **'Rule 1 High'** matching criteria. The rule specifies that the amino acids should have small or additional carboxyl-containing side chains. Ensure that the code checks for the presence of a small side chain along with the primary amine and carboxylic acid groups using **logical 'AND'** between all three patterns.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For rules where certain substructures must **not** be present (e.g., **'Rule 1 High'** requires the absence of bulky side chains or blocked amino groups), implement logical **'NOT'** conditions. Use functions like `HasSubstructMatch` in combination with `InvertSubstructMatch` to ensure that molecules with undesirable features do not falsely match the rule.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Adjust the substructure patterns to more accurately reflect the **specific positions** of substituents. For instance, in **'Rule 2'**, specify that the substituents are at the **para position** using SMARTS patterns that enforce this position (e.g., using substitution count or explicit ring atom numbering). This will improve the accuracy of matching para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: Include additional electron-withdrawing groups, such as the **nitro (-NO₂)** group, in the **'Rule 2 Low'** patterns. The nitro group is a strong electron-withdrawing group and should be considered when matching modifiers that result in a low yield according to **'Rule 2'**.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: For **'Rule 3'**, refine the SMARTS patterns to ensure that the **nitrogen heterocycle is directly attached to the carboxyl group** without any intervening atoms. Use more specific SMARTS patterns that prevent matching heterocycles connected via additional rings or chains, which are meant to be matched by **'Rule 3 Low'**.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: Enhance the pattern matching logic to handle **logical combinations** of substructures within a rule. Consider using the `CombineMols` function or other RDKit functionalities to create composite patterns that represent the required combinations of features, enabling more precise rule matching.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Implement **unit tests** using the example molecules provided for each rule. Verify that each rule correctly matches the high-yield and low-yield examples as intended. This will help identify discrepancies in the pattern matching and allow for targeted adjustments to the SMARTS patterns.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: For **'Rule 9 Low'**, ensure that the pattern for polyether chains accurately reflects **flexible chains lacking strong coordinating groups**. Adjust the SMARTS pattern to match longer polyether chains and confirm that strong coordinating groups like amines, hydroxyls, and thiols are **absent**.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Review and update the SMARTS patterns by consulting standard chemical definitions or using tools like **SMARTSviewer** to visualize and validate the patterns. This will help ensure that the patterns accurately represent the intended functional groups and structural features.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rules Based on Metrics**

Based on the provided metrics, the current set of rules shows some improvement in terms of **confidence** and **lift** compared to the previous metrics. Here's a detailed analysis:

---

**Comparison with Previous Metrics:**

1. **Confidence:**
   - **Previous Train Confidence:** Average of [0.6352, 0.5396] ≈ **0.5874**
   - **Current Train Confidence:** **0.6146**
   - **Observation:** The current confidence has increased compared to the average of previous iterations. This suggests that the rules are more reliable in predicting high yields when the conditions are met.

2. **Lift:**
   - **Previous Train Lift:** Average of [1.2048, 1.0559] ≈ **1.1304**
   - **Current Train Lift:** **1.2198**
   - **Observation:** The lift has improved, indicating that the rules are better at predicting high yields beyond what would be expected by random chance. A lift greater than 1 signifies a positive association between the rule conditions and the outcome.

3. **Support:**
   - **Previous Train Support:** [0.1667, 0.1845]
   - **Current Train Support:** **0.1008**
   - **Observation:** The support has decreased compared to previous values. While higher confidence and lift are desirable, lower support means the rules cover a smaller portion of the dataset.

4. **Leverage:**
   - **Previous Train Leverage:** [0.0289, -0.0041]
   - **Current Train Leverage:** **0.0076**
   - **Observation:** The leverage is positive but lower than the highest previous value. This indicates that the rules offer some improvement over random chance but might not be capturing strong associations.

---

**Interpretation of Current Metrics:**

- **Confidence (0.6146):** Approximately 61% of the time, when the rule conditions are met, the predicted outcome (high yield) is correct. This is a moderate level of confidence, showing that the rules have reasonable predictive power.

- **Lift (1.2198):** The rules are about 22% more effective at predicting high yields than random chance. This indicates a meaningful association between the rule conditions and the high yield outcome.

- **Support (0.1008):** The rules apply to about 10% of the training data. While this is lower than previous supports, it might be acceptable if the rules are targeting specific, important subsets of data.

- **Leverage (0.0076):** The positive leverage suggests that the rules capture some of the association between the conditions and high yields beyond random chance. However, the value is relatively small, indicating that the strength of this association is modest.

---

**Assessment of Local Minimum and Iterations:**

Given that the improvements in confidence and lift are incremental and that support has decreased, it's possible that the rule generation process is approaching a **local minimum**. The adjustments made in recent iterations seem to yield diminishing returns. The balance between confidence, lift, and support suggests that further iterations with the current approach may not lead to significant improvements.

---

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules:**

1. **Enhance Rule Coverage:**
   - **Issue:** Lower support indicates that the rules are not covering enough of the dataset.
   - **Solution:** Adjust the rules to encompass a broader range of modifiers without sacrificing too much confidence and lift. This could involve generalizing certain conditions or combining similar rules.

2. **Optimize Rule Specificity:**
   - **Issue:** Highly specific rules might have high confidence and lift but low support.
   - **Solution:** Find a balance between specificity and generality. Rules should be specific enough to be accurate but general enough to apply to a significant portion of the data.

3. **Analyze Misclassified Cases:**
   - **Issue:** Understanding where the rules fail can provide insights.
   - **Solution:** Examine cases where the rules predict high yield but the actual yield is low (false positives) and vice versa. Identify patterns or features in these cases to refine the rules.

4. **Incorporate Additional Features:**
   - **Issue:** Current rules may not account for all relevant molecular features.
   - **Solution:** Consider integrating other molecular descriptors, such as electronic properties, steric factors, or solvent effects. Including these may improve the predictive power of the rules.

5. **Use Multivariate Analysis:**
   - **Issue:** The interaction between multiple features might be affecting the outcome.
   - **Solution:** Employ multivariate statistical methods or machine learning techniques to capture complex relationships between features.

6. **Cross-Validation:**
   - **Issue:** Overfitting to the training data can inflate confidence and lift.
   - **Solution:** Use cross-validation to assess the generalizability of the rules. This helps ensure that the rules perform well on unseen data.

7. **Prioritize High Leverage Rules:**
   - **Issue:** Leverage indicates the strength of the association beyond chance.
   - **Solution:** Focus on rules with higher leverage values, even if their support is lower. These rules may reveal stronger and more meaningful associations.

8. **Simplify Rule Set:**
   - **Issue:** A large number of complex rules can be difficult to interpret and implement.
   - **Solution:** Trim redundant or less impactful rules. A streamlined set of core rules may be more effective and easier to apply.

9. **Iterate with Domain Expertise:**
   - **Issue:** Purely data-driven approaches might miss context-specific nuances.
   - **Solution:** Collaborate with chemists or domain experts to interpret the rules and suggest modifications based on chemical knowledge.

10. **Evaluate External Validation Metrics:**
    - **Issue:** Internal metrics may not fully capture the practical utility of the rules.
    - **Solution:** Consider additional metrics like precision, recall, or F1 score, especially if the dataset is imbalanced. These can provide a more nuanced view of rule performance.

---

**Conclusion:**

The current rules have slightly improved in terms of confidence and lift, indicating better predictive capability compared to previous iterations. However, the decreased support and modest leverage suggest that the rules may not be capturing the full complexity of the data. The incremental nature of the improvements hints at reaching a local minimum.

To enhance the performance further, it would be beneficial to:

- Broaden the coverage of the rules without significantly compromising confidence and lift.
- Leverage additional molecular features and domain knowledge.
- Employ advanced analytical methods to uncover deeper patterns.
- Regularly validate the rules with cross-validation or external datasets to ensure robustness.

By implementing these strategies, we can aim to develop a more effective and generalizable set of rules that can reliably predict high-yield outcomes in the catalytic process.

**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

**1. Overall Accuracy Assessment**

The latest 5-fold validation accuracy obtained using the classification model is **0.6**. Comparing this to the previous validation accuracies provided:

- **Previous Accuracies for Reference:**
  - Validation Accuracy: \[0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76\]; Test Accuracy: 0.75
  - Validation Accuracy: \[0.76, 0.68, 0.72, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76\]; Test Accuracy: 0.75
  - Validation Accuracy: \[0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76\]; Test Accuracy: 0.625
  - Validation Accuracy: \[0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76\]; Test Accuracy: 0.625

The current accuracy of **0.6** indicates a decrease in model performance compared to previous iterations, which consistently had higher validation accuracies around **0.76**. This suggests that the current set of rules may not be as effective in predicting the catalyst loading as the previous rules.

**2. Overfitting and Underfitting Analysis**

- **Overfitting:** The drop in accuracy could indicate that the model is overfitting to the training data and not generalizing well to unseen data. Overfitting occurs when the model captures noise or random fluctuations in the training data instead of the underlying distribution.

- **Underfitting:** Alternatively, the model may be underfitting if the rules are too simplistic or not capturing the complexity of the data. Underfitting happens when the model is too simple to represent the data adequately.

Given the decrease in accuracy and the simplicity of the SHAP values (in many cases only one rule is contributing significantly), it's plausible that the model is underfitting.

**3. SHAP Analysis and Discrepancies**

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values help identify how each rule contributes to the model's predictions for each molecule.

- **Overestimations (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**

  For molecules where the predicted loading is **high** but the experimental value is **low**, the rule with the most **positive** SHAP value is likely contributing to the misprediction.

  **Examples:**

  1. **Molecule:** C1=CC=C(C=C1)C\[C@@H\](C(=O)O)N
     - **Predicted Loading:** High
     - **Experimental Value:** Low
     - **Rule Contribution:**
       - **Rule14 SHAP value for high loading:** 0.07738

  2. **Molecule:** C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O
     - **Predicted Loading:** High
     - **Experimental Value:** Low
     - **Rule Contribution:**
       - **Rule14 SHAP value for high loading:** 0.07738

  3. **Molecule:** C(CCCC(=O)O)CCCN
     - **Predicted Loading:** High
     - **Experimental Value:** Low
     - **Rule Contribution:**
       - **Rule14 SHAP value for high loading:** 0.07738

  4. **Molecule:** COCCOCCOCC(=O)O
     - **Predicted Loading:** High
     - **Experimental Value:** Low
     - **Rule Contribution:**
       - **Rule14 SHAP value for high loading:** 0.06000

  5. **Molecule:** C1=CC(=CC=C1C=O)C(=O)O
     - **Predicted Loading:** High
     - **Experimental Value:** Low
     - **Rule Contribution:**
       - **Rule14 SHAP value for high loading:** 0.05571

  In these cases, **Rule 14** is consistently contributing positively to the high loading predictions, despite the experimental values being low.

- **Underestimations (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**

  For molecules where the predicted loading is **low** but the experimental value is **high**, the rule with the most **negative** SHAP value is likely contributing to the misprediction.

  **Examples:**

  1. **Molecule:** C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)NCC(=O)O)O
     - **Predicted Loading:** Low
     - **Experimental Value:** High
     - **Rule Contribution:**
       - **Rule14 SHAP value for high loading:** -0.50000

  2. **Molecule:** CSCC\[C@@H\](C(=O)NCC(=O)O)N
     - **Predicted Loading:** Low
     - **Experimental Value:** High
     - **Rule Contribution:**
       - **Rule14 SHAP value for high loading:** -0.50000

  In these cases, **Rule 14** has a large negative SHAP value, contributing significantly to the low loading prediction when the experimental value is high.

**4. Interpretation of Accuracy Metrics**

- The decrease in accuracy suggests that the current rules may not be improving the model's predictive capability.
- The fluctuations in accuracy across iterations (e.g., from 0.714 to 0.457 to 0.571 to 0.6) indicate instability in the model's performance.
- The presence of high SHAP values (both positive and negative) for **Rule 14** in mispredicted cases signals that this rule may be overly influential and could be causing misclassifications.

**5. Insights from SHAP Analysis**

- **Dominance of a Single Rule:** The SHAP values indicate that **Rule 14** is the primary contributor to the model's predictions in many cases. This overreliance on a single rule can lead to poor generalization and mispredictions.
- **Consistent Misclassification Patterns:** The same rule is involved in multiple misclassifications, suggesting a systemic issue with **Rule 14**.
- **Lack of Rule Diversity:** The current model may not be leveraging the full set of rules effectively, possibly due to redundancy or overlap in rule definitions.

---

**Recommendations for Improvement**

**1. Refine Rule 14**

- **Issue:** **Rule 14** is not explicitly defined in the provided set of rules. It seems to be a newly added rule that is now heavily influencing the model's predictions.
- **Action:**
  - **Clarify and Review Rule 14:** Ensure that Rule 14 is clearly defined and assess its intended purpose.
  - **Evaluate Rule Applicability:** Check if the structural features described in Rule 14 are too general or too specific, causing it to incorrectly influence many molecules.
  - **Adjust Rule Specificity:** Modify Rule 14 to be more precise in capturing the relevant structural features associated with high yield, reducing false positives.

**2. Balance Rule Contributions**

- **Issue:** Overreliance on a single rule can lead to overfitting and poor model performance.
- **Action:**
  - **Diversify Rule Impact:** Adjust the model or rule weighting to ensure that multiple rules contribute meaningfully to the predictions.
  - **Reduce Rule Redundancy:** Check for overlap between rules that might be causing one rule to dominate the predictions.
  - **Normalize SHAP Values:** Implement techniques to prevent any single rule from having excessively high SHAP values unless justified.

**3. Adjust Rules with High Negative SHAP Values**

- **Issue:** Rules with high negative SHAP values are contributing to underestimations in predicted loading.
- **Action:**
  - **Reassess Rules with Negative Impact:** Specifically, revisit rules that consistently contribute negative SHAP values in cases where the experimental loading is high.
  - **Fine-tune Rule Definitions:** Modify these rules to better capture the structural features that actually lead to high yield, reducing false negatives.

**4. Improve Generalization**

- **Issue:** The model may be overfitting to specific features captured by the rules, leading to poor performance on validation data.
- **Action:**
  - **Simplify Overly Complex Rules:** If any rules are too complex or too specific to certain molecules, generalize them to cover a broader range without losing predictive power.
  - **Incorporate Missing Structural Features:** Identify any key structural features not currently accounted for in the rules that could improve model predictions.
  - **Cross-Validate Rules:** Ensure that rules perform well across different folds in cross-validation to confirm their generalizability.

**5. Use Insights from SHAP Analysis**

- **Leverage SHAP Values Systematically:**
  - **Pattern Recognition:** Look for patterns in SHAP values across multiple molecules to identify which structural features consistently lead to mispredictions.
  - **Iterative Refinement:** Use these patterns to iteratively refine the rules, focusing on the ones most frequently implicated in errors.

- **Collaborate with Domain Experts:**
  - **Chemical Insight:** Engage with chemists to interpret why certain rules may be failing and how molecular structures influence catalyst loading.
  - **Rule Validation:** Have experts validate the revised rules for chemical plausibility and relevance.

**6. Validate and Iterate**

- **Test Revised Rules:**
  - **Retrain the Model:** Incorporate the refined rules into the model and evaluate the performance on the validation set.
  - **Monitor Accuracy Metrics:** Observe if there is an improvement in accuracy and stability across iterations.

- **Set Performance Benchmarks:**
  - **Aim for Consistent Accuracy:** Work towards achieving validation accuracies comparable to or better than the baseline reference (0.76).
  - **Avoid Local Minima:** Ensure that the model doesn't settle into a local minimum by continuously challenging and testing the rules.

---

**Conclusion**

The current rules, particularly **Rule 14**, are not sufficiently effective, as evidenced by the decreased validation accuracy and the SHAP analysis indicating mispredictions. By refining Rule 14, balancing the contributions of all rules, and adjusting rules causing underestimations, we can improve the model's predictive performance. Utilizing SHAP insights allows for targeted refinements, and iterative testing ensures that the model moves towards better generalization and accuracy.

---

**Next Steps**

1. **Clarify and Adjust Rule 14:**
   - Define Rule 14 explicitly.
   - Modify it based on the insights from mispredictions and SHAP values.

2. **Re-evaluate All Rules:**
   - Assess each rule for overlap, redundancy, and contribution to predictions.
   - Simplify or enhance rules as needed to improve coverage and specificity.

3. **Conduct Further Validation:**
   - After adjustments, retrain the model.
   - Perform cross-validation and compare new accuracies with baseline metrics.

4. **Document Changes:**
   - Keep detailed records of rule modifications and their impact on model performance.
   - Use this documentation for future refinements and to understand the evolution of the model.

By following these recommendations, the model should improve in its ability to accurately predict the catalyst loading, leading to better guidance for selecting and designing modifiers in the catalytic process.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimization**

**1. Analysis of Current Rules and Metrics**

The current set of rules shows modest improvements in terms of confidence and lift compared to previous iterations:

- **Confidence** increased to **61%** from an average of **58%**.
- **Lift** improved to **1.22**, indicating that the rules are about **22%** more effective than random chance.
- **Support**, however, decreased to **10%**, meaning the rules apply to a smaller portion of the dataset.
- The **leverage** is positive but relatively small (**0.0076**), suggesting only a modest improvement over random chance.

Despite these improvements, the overall **validation accuracy** of the model decreased to **60%**, down from previous accuracies of **76%**. This suggests that while individual rules may be stronger, the overall model performance has declined.

**2. Issues Identified**

- **Overreliance on Rule 14**: SHAP analysis indicates that Rule 14 is disproportionately influencing predictions, leading to misclassifications.
- **Low Support**: The rules cover a smaller portion of the dataset, potentially missing key patterns.
- **Underfitting**: The model may be too simplistic, failing to capture the complexity of the data.
- **Rule Definitions**: Some rules may be too general or too specific, causing incorrect matches.
- **Overlapping Rules**: Redundancy or overlap between rules can cause certain rules to dominate.

**Suggestions to Improve Current Rules**

1. **Refine Rule Definitions**:

   - **Rule 1**: Use logical **'AND'** between substructure patterns to ensure that both the primary amine and carboxylic acid groups are present simultaneously, along with a small side chain.
   - **Rule 2**: Adjust substructure patterns to accurately reflect substituents at the **para position**. Incorporate additional electron-withdrawing groups like **nitro (-NO₂)** in the low-yield patterns.
   - **Rule 3**: Ensure that the nitrogen heterocycle is directly attached to the carboxyl group without intervening atoms.
   - **Rule 9**: Update the pattern for polyether chains to accurately reflect flexible chains lacking strong coordinating groups.

2. **Implement Logical Operators**:

   - Use logical **'NOT'** conditions to exclude molecules with undesirable features (e.g., bulky side chains or blocked amino groups in Rule 1).
   - Use logical combinations within rules to capture the required presence or absence of multiple features.

3. **Enhance Rule Coverage**:

   - Generalize rules where possible to cover more of the dataset without significantly compromising on confidence and lift.
   - Combine similar rules to reduce redundancy and increase support.

4. **Balance Rule Contributions**:

   - Adjust the model or rule weighting to prevent overreliance on a single rule (e.g., Rule 14).
   - Ensure that multiple rules contribute meaningfully to predictions.

5. **Analyze Misclassified Cases**:

   - Examine molecules that are consistently misclassified to identify patterns or features that the current rules are missing.
   - Refine rules based on insights from misclassifications.

6. **Incorporate Additional Features**:

   - Consider integrating other molecular descriptors, such as electronic properties, steric factors, or solubility parameters.
   - Use chemoinformatics tools to extract relevant features that may improve predictive power.

7. **Enhance Specificity and Flexibility**:

   - Avoid overly general rules that may capture irrelevant molecules.
   - Use SMARTS patterns to specify exact substructures and positions, improving the accuracy of rule matching.

8. **Use Multivariate Analysis**:

   - Employ machine learning techniques to capture complex relationships between features.
   - Use statistical methods to analyze the interplay between multiple molecular features.

9. **Implement Unit Testing**:

   - Create unit tests using the example molecules provided to verify that each rule correctly matches high-yield and low-yield cases.
   - Adjust patterns based on test results to ensure accurate rule application.

10. **Iterative Refinement with Domain Expertise**:

    - Collaborate with chemists to interpret why certain rules may be failing and how molecular structures influence yield.
    - Use expert insights to refine and validate the rules.

**Possibility for Further Optimization**

Given the identified issues and the provided suggestions, there is a clear possibility for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. Refining rule definitions, adjusting pattern matching logic, and balancing rule contributions can enhance model performance and predictive accuracy.

    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with free amino (-NH₂) and carboxyl (-COOH) groups, especially those with small or additional carboxyl-containing side chains, result in a **high yield**. The presence of accessible coordination sites enhances interaction with the metal center, improving catalyst activity. Bulky side chains or blocked amino groups reduce the yield due to steric hindrance and decreased coordination ability.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid)
    - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid)
    - *5-aminopentanoic acid* (5-Aminovaleric acid)

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine)
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyllysine)

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating electron-donating substituents such as amino (-NH₂) or hydroxyl (-OH) groups at the para position result in a **high yield**. These groups enhance electron density and provide additional coordination sites. Modifiers with non-coordinating substituents (e.g., methyl) or electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., formyl (-CHO)) at the para position result in a **low yield** due to decreased coordination ability.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid*
    - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid*
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group result in a **high yield**. The lone pair electrons on the nitrogen can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalyst performance. If the nitrogen heterocycle is connected via an additional aromatic ring or bulky group, the yield is **low** due to steric hindrance and reduced coordination efficiency.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
    - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Pyridine ring attached through a benzene ring)

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups near the carboxyl group, such as sugar acids, result in a **high yield**. The additional hydroxyl groups offer multiple coordination sites and enhance solubility, improving interaction with the metal center. Modifiers with fewer hydroxyl groups or hydroxyl groups distant from the carboxyl group result in a **low yield** due to fewer coordination opportunities.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
    - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing thiol (-SH) groups attached to short aliphatic chains result in a **high yield**. Thiol groups are strong ligands that effectively coordinate with the metal center. Thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings result in a **low yield** due to steric hindrance and reduced accessibility for coordination.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., formyl (-CHO), fluorinated alkyl chains) near the carboxyl group result in a **low yield**. These groups reduce electron density at coordination sites, hindering interaction with the metal center. Modifiers without such groups or with electron-donating groups result in a **high yield** due to better coordination.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*

  - **High Yield:**
    - *Octanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths up to eight carbons and without additional functional groups result in a **high yield**. The lack of bulky substituents allows for better interaction with the metal center. Modifiers with polar groups distant from the carboxyl group result in a **low yield** due to decreased solubility and reduced coordination efficiency.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *Octanoic acid*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with bulky side chains or blocked coordination sites (e.g., acylated amino groups) result in a **low yield**. Steric hindrance reduces accessibility to the metal center, hindering effective coordination.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyllysine)
    - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid*
    - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine)

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with flexible polyether chains lacking strong coordinating groups result in a **low yield**. The increased conformational flexibility and absence of effective coordination sites reduce interaction with the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with conjugated systems containing multiple coordinating heteroatoms (e.g., oxygen, nitrogen) result in a **high yield**. Delocalized electron systems and the presence of multiple coordination sites facilitate strong binding to the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*
    - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (Tryptophan)

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with aliphatic chains linking aromatic rings bearing coordinating groups (e.g., hydroxyl (-OH), methoxy (-OCH₃)) result in a **high yield** if the chain length allows optimal flexibility and proximity to the metal center. Shorter chains may result in a **low yield** due to reduced flexibility and steric constraints.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*
    - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid*
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with coordination-inhibiting substituents, such as bulky groups or multiple rings between the functional group and the carboxyl group, result in a **low yield**. These structural features impede effective interaction with the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid*

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been developed through a detailed analysis of the provided dataset, considering the underlying physicochemical properties that influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. The rules focus on direct combinations of substructures and functional groups within the molecular modifiers, such as coordination sites, electron-donating or -withdrawing groups, steric effects, and chain lengths.

Each rule clearly predicts whether a modifier will result in a high or low yield based on its structural features. By combining multiple functional groups and considering their combined effects, these rules provide clear guidelines for predicting the performance of different modifiers in the reaction.

The set of 12 rules strikes a balance between simple rules with higher coverage and more complex rules with lower coverage, effectively covering a broad range of the dataset. This approach facilitates better selection and design of modifiers to optimize and control the yield of the target reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Refine Rule 1** by ensuring that the amino acids identified have both free amino (-NH₂) and carboxyl (-COOH) groups present **simultaneously**, along with small or additional carboxyl-containing side chains. Use logical **'AND'** in your substructure patterns to require the presence of both functional groups. Incorporate logical **'NOT'** to exclude modifiers with bulky side chains or blocked amino groups, which can reduce yield due to steric hindrance.

- **Advice 2**: **Adjust Rule 2** to more accurately target aromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating electron-donating substituents at the **para position**. Modify your substructure patterns to specifically recognize para-substituted aromatic rings with amino (-NH₂) or hydroxyl (-OH) groups. Include electron-withdrawing groups like nitro (-NO₂) or formyl (-CHO) in the low-yield patterns to better distinguish between high-yield and low-yield modifiers.

- **Advice 3**: **Refine Rule 3** by ensuring that nitrogen heterocycles are **directly attached** to the carboxyl group without any intervening atoms or rings. Update your substructure patterns to exclude modifiers where the nitrogen-containing ring is connected via additional aromatic rings or bulky groups, which can hinder coordination due to increased steric bulk.

- **Advice 4**: **Update Rule 9** by accurately defining the substructure pattern for flexible polyether chains lacking strong coordinating groups. Adjust the patterns to recognize modifiers with polyether chains (e.g., -O-CH₂-CH₂-O-) and ensure that these chains do not contain strong ligands like amino or hydroxyl groups. This will improve the specificity in identifying low-yield modifiers due to reduced coordination with the metal center.

- **Advice 5**: **Implement Logical Operators** in your rule definitions. Use logical **'AND'**, **'OR'**, and **'NOT'** within your SMARTS patterns to specify the required combination of features. For example, in Rule 1, the pattern should include **'[N]' AND '[C(=O)O]'** and **'NOT'** bulky side chains. This will enhance the precision of your rules by capturing the necessary structural features while excluding interfering groups.

- **Advice 6**: **Enhance Rule Coverage** by generalizing certain rules to encompass a broader range of modifiers without sacrificing confidence. For instance, consider combining Rules 4 and 10, which both involve modifiers with multiple coordinating groups, to create a more inclusive rule that captures modifiers with multiple hydroxyl or heteroatom-containing conjugated systems.

- **Advice 7**: **Balance Rule Contributions** by ensuring that no single rule disproportionately influences the predictions. Re-evaluate the weighting of each rule in your model to prevent overreliance on any one rule, such as the previously mentioned overemphasis on Rule 14. This can be achieved by normalizing rule impacts or incorporating a voting system where each rule contributes equally to the final prediction.

- **Advice 8**: **Analyze Misclassified Cases** by closely examining modifiers that are incorrectly predicted. Identify common structural features or patterns among these misclassified compounds. For example, if certain modifiers with unexpected functional groups result in a high yield, investigate whether additional rules or adjustments to existing rules can account for these exceptions.

- **Advice 9**: **Incorporate Additional Molecular Descriptors** into your rule set. Beyond substructure patterns, consider factors such as electronic properties (e.g., electron density, pKa values), steric hindrance (e.g., molecular volume), and solubility. Utilizing chemoinformatics tools to calculate these descriptors can provide a more nuanced understanding of how different modifiers affect yield.

- **Advice 10**: **Enhance Specificity Using SMARTS Patterns**. Refine your SMARTS queries to precisely capture the spatial arrangement of atoms and the exact positions of functional groups. For example, specify the position of substituents on aromatic rings (e.g., para, meta) and the connectivity of heterocycles to carboxyl groups. This will reduce false positives and improve rule accuracy.

- **Advice 11**: **Implement Unit Testing** for your rules using the provided dataset. Create test cases for each rule with both positive and negative examples. Verify that each rule correctly identifies high-yield and low-yield modifiers as intended. Use the results to fine-tune your rules, ensuring they perform accurately across the entire dataset.

- **Advice 12**: **Iteratively Refine Rules with Domain Expertise** by collaborating with chemists or chemical engineers. Discuss the mechanistic reasons behind why certain modifiers enhance or inhibit yield. Incorporate this expert knowledge into your rules to capture subtle effects that may not be evident from structural analysis alone.

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with free amino (-NH₂) and carboxyl (-COOH) groups directly attached to short aliphatic chains, without bulky side chains or blocking groups, result in a **high yield**. The combination of free amino and carboxyl groups enhances coordination with the metal center, improving catalyst activity. Bulky substituents or blocked amino groups reduce yield due to steric hindrance and decreased coordination ability.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid)
    - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid)
    - *5-aminopentanoic acid* (5-Aminovaleric acid)

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine)
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyllysine)

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents such as amino (-NH₂) or hydroxyl (-OH) groups at the para position result in a **high yield**. This combination enhances electron density and provides additional coordination sites. Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., formyl (-CHO)) or non-coordinating substituents at the para position result in a **low yield** due to decreased coordination ability.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid*
    - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles (e.g., pyridine or pyrazole rings) directly attached to the carboxyl group result in a **high yield**. The lone pair electrons on nitrogen enhance coordination with the metal center. If the nitrogen heterocycle is connected via an additional aromatic ring, leading to steric hindrance, the yield is **low** due to reduced coordination efficiency.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
    - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Pyridine ring attached through a benzene ring)

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with thiol (-SH) groups attached to short aliphatic chains near the carboxyl group result in a **high yield**. The combination of thiol and carboxyl groups provides strong coordination with the metal center. Thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings lead to a **low yield** due to steric hindrance and decreased accessibility for coordination.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups near the carboxyl group, such as sugar acids, result in a **high yield**. The additional hydroxyl groups offer multiple coordination sites, enhancing interaction with the metal center. Modifiers with fewer hydroxyl groups or hydroxyl groups distant from the carboxyl group result in a **low yield** due to fewer coordination opportunities.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
    - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with moderate chain lengths (up to eight carbons) and without additional functional groups result in a **high yield**. The simplicity of the structure allows for effective interaction with the metal center. Modifiers with polar groups distant from the carboxyl group or very long chains result in a **low yield** due to steric factors and reduced coordination efficiency.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *Octanoic acid*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups near the carboxyl group, such as formyl (-CHO) or highly fluorinated alkyl chains, result in a **low yield**. These groups reduce electron density at coordination sites, hindering effective interaction with the metal center. Modifiers with electron-donating groups enhance coordination and result in a **high yield**.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*

  - **High Yield:**
    - *Octanoic acid* (contains no electron-withdrawing groups)

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with bulky side chains, blocked amino groups (e.g., acylated amino groups), or multiple rings between functional groups and the carboxyl group result in a **low yield**. Steric hindrance reduces accessibility to the metal center, impeding effective coordination.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyllysine)
    - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine)
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with flexible polyether chains lacking strong coordinating groups result in a **low yield**. The increased conformational flexibility and absence of effective coordination sites reduce interaction with the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with conjugated ring systems containing multiple coordinating heteroatoms (e.g., oxygen, nitrogen) result in a **high yield**. The combination of conjugation and multiple coordination sites facilitates strong binding to the metal center, enhancing catalyst performance.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*
    - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (Tryptophan)

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with free amino (-NH₂) and carboxyl (-COOH) groups directly attached to short aliphatic chains, without bulky side chains or blocking groups, result in a **high yield**. The combination of free amino and carboxyl groups enhances coordination with the metal center, improving catalyst activity. Bulky substituents or blocked amino groups reduce yield due to steric hindrance and decreased coordination ability.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid)
    - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid)
    - *5-aminopentanoic acid* (5-Aminovaleric acid)

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine)
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyllysine)

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents such as amino (-NH₂) or hydroxyl (-OH) groups at the para position result in a **high yield**. This combination enhances electron density and provides additional coordination sites. Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., formyl (-CHO)) or non-coordinating substituents at the para position result in a **low yield** due to decreased coordination ability.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid*
    - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles (e.g., pyridine or pyrazole rings) directly attached to the carboxyl group result in a **high yield**. The lone pair electrons on nitrogen enhance coordination with the metal center. If the nitrogen heterocycle is connected via an additional aromatic ring, leading to steric hindrance, the yield is **low** due to reduced coordination efficiency.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
    - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Pyridine ring attached through a benzene ring)

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with thiol (-SH) groups attached to short aliphatic chains near the carboxyl group result in a **high yield**. The combination of thiol and carboxyl groups provides strong coordination with the metal center. Thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings lead to a **low yield** due to steric hindrance and decreased accessibility for coordination.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups near the carboxyl group, such as sugar acids, result in a **high yield**. The additional hydroxyl groups offer multiple coordination sites, enhancing interaction with the metal center. Modifiers with fewer hydroxyl groups or hydroxyl groups distant from the carboxyl group result in a **low yield** due to fewer coordination opportunities.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
    - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with moderate chain lengths (up to eight carbons) and without additional functional groups result in a **high yield**. The simplicity of the structure allows for effective interaction with the metal center. Modifiers with polar groups distant from the carboxyl group or very long chains result in a **low yield** due to steric factors and reduced coordination efficiency.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *Octanoic acid*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups near the carboxyl group, such as formyl (-CHO) or highly fluorinated alkyl chains, result in a **low yield**. These groups reduce electron density at coordination sites, hindering effective interaction with the metal center. Modifiers with electron-donating groups enhance coordination and result in a **high yield**.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*

  - **High Yield:**
    - *Octanoic acid* (contains no electron-withdrawing groups)

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with bulky side chains, blocked amino groups (e.g., acylated amino groups), or multiple rings between functional groups and the carboxyl group result in a **low yield**. Steric hindrance reduces accessibility to the metal center, impeding effective coordination.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyllysine)
    - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine)
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with flexible polyether chains lacking strong coordinating groups result in a **low yield**. The increased conformational flexibility and absence of effective coordination sites reduce interaction with the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with conjugated ring systems containing multiple coordinating heteroatoms (e.g., oxygen, nitrogen) result in a **high yield**. The combination of conjugation and multiple coordination sites facilitates strong binding to the metal center, enhancing catalyst performance.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*
    - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (Tryptophan)

**End of Rules**

These rules have been developed by carefully analyzing the provided dataset and considering the underlying physicochemical properties that influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. The rules focus on combinations of substructures and functional groups within the molecular modifiers, such as coordination sites, electron-donating or -withdrawing groups, steric effects, and chain lengths.

Each rule clearly predicts whether a modifier will result in a high or low yield based on its structural features. By combining multiple functional groups and considering their combined effects, these rules provide clear guidelines for predicting the performance of different modifiers in the reaction.

The set of 10 rules maintains a suitable balance between simple rules with higher coverage and more complex rules with lower coverage, effectively covering a broad range of the dataset. This approach facilitates better selection and design of modifiers to optimize and control the yield of the target reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For **Rule 1**, the `exclude_bulky_groups` SMARTS pattern `[#6][#6X3,#6X4][!#1][!#6X4]` may not effectively exclude bulky side chains or blocking groups. This pattern might not correctly identify substituents larger than hydrogen on the aliphatic chain. Consider revising this pattern to detect branching or bulky substituents by looking for carbons bonded to more than two non-hydrogen atoms. For example, use a pattern like `[CX4;$([C](C)(C)[!H])]` to identify tertiary carbons indicative of branching.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: For **Rule 1**, the code does not account for the length of the aliphatic chain between the amino and carboxyl groups. Since the rule specifies "short aliphatic chains," consider adding a condition that limits the chain length. You can implement this by specifying the maximum number of carbons between the amino and carboxyl groups in the SMARTS pattern, such as `[NX3H2][CX4][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` for a chain length of two carbons.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For **Rule 2**, the `exclude_electron_withdrawing` pattern `c1cc([CX3H=O,F,Cl,Br,I])ccc1` may not cover all electron-withdrawing groups. Electron-withdrawing groups include nitro (-NO₂) and cyano (-CN) groups, among others. Expand the pattern to include these groups by modifying it to `c1cc([CX3H=O,F,Cl,Br,I,N+](=O)[O-],C#N)ccc1`.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: For **Rule 2**, ensure that the `para_amino_or_hydroxyl` pattern `c1cc([NX3H2,OX2H])ccc1C(=O)O` correctly identifies substituents at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid. Verify that the numbering in the SMARTS corresponds to the para position. If necessary, adjust the pattern to `c1cc([NX3H2,OX2H])cc(c1)C(=O)O` to ensure accurate matching.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: For **Rule 3**, the `nitrogen_heterocycle_carboxylic_acid` pattern `[#7][#6]C(=O)O` does not correctly represent nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to a carboxyl group. This pattern matches an amine group attached to a carbonyl rather than a heterocyclic ring. Replace this pattern with one that matches nitrogen-containing heterocycles bonded to a carboxyl group, such as `[nH0,r5,r6][c;r5,r6]C(=O)O` to capture heterocycles like pyridine and pyrazole carboxylic acids.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: For **Rule 3**, the `exclude_connected_via_aromatic` pattern `c1ccc(cc1)[a][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` might not effectively exclude modifiers where the nitrogen heterocycle is connected via an additional aromatic ring. Consider refining the pattern to specifically match nitrogen heterocycles separated from the carboxyl group by a benzene ring, such as `c1ccc(cc1)n2cccc2` to identify a pyridine ring attached through a benzene ring.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: For **Rule 4**, the `thiol_aliphatic_carboxylic_acid` pattern `[SX2H][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` may be too restrictive and only matches thiol groups directly attached via a single carbon to the carboxyl group. To account for thiol groups "near" the carboxyl group, adjust the pattern to allow for short aliphatic chains, such as `[SX2H][CX4][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` or use a variable length with a maximum limit, like `[SX2H]CC{0,2}C(=O)O`.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: For **Rule 4**, the `exclude_thiol_on_aromatic` pattern `[c][SX2H]` may not sufficiently exclude thiol groups attached to aromatic rings, especially if the thiol is part of a larger substituent. Ensure that the pattern accounts for thiol groups directly bonded to aromatic carbons by using `[c][SX2H]` and consider adding patterns to exclude thiols attached via heteroatoms like oxygen or nitrogen.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: For **Rule 5**, the `multiple_hydroxyls_near_carboxyl` pattern `[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CX4][OX2H][CX4][OX2H]` is very specific and may miss molecules that fit the rule but have varying chain lengths or additional hydroxyl groups. Generalize the pattern to detect multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group by allowing flexible chain lengths and optional additional hydroxyls, such as `[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CX4][CX4][OX2H]`, possibly using recursive SMARTS or specifying repetitions.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: For **Rule 6**, the `aliphatic_carboxylic_acid` pattern `C(=O)[OX2H1][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4]` fixes the chain length to eight carbons, excluding shorter chains that the rule says should also result in a high yield. Modify the pattern to allow for chain lengths "up to eight carbons" by using a variable repetition in SMARTS, such as `C(=O)[OX2H1][CX4]CC{0,6}`.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: For **Rule 6**, the `exclude_functional_groups` pattern `[#7,#8,#16]` does not specify the position of these groups relative to the carboxyl group. As the rule mentions functional groups distant from the carboxyl group, adjust the pattern to exclude molecules where these groups are present beyond a certain position in the chain. Use a SMARTS pattern like `C(=O)[OX2H1][CX4][CX4][CX4][$([CX4][#7,#8,#16])]` to detect these groups at the fourth carbon or beyond.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: For **Rule 7**, the `electron_withdrawing_near_carboxyl` pattern `[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CX4][CX3](=O)[#6]` may not capture all electron-withdrawing groups near the carboxyl group. Expand this pattern to include other electron-withdrawing groups like nitro or cyano by using a pattern such as `[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][#6][$(C(=O)[#6]),$(C#N),$(N(=O)=O)]`.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: For **Rule 7**, the `highly_fluorinated_chain` pattern `[CX4][CX4][CX4][F,Cl,Br,I]` might miss modifiers with longer chains or higher degrees of halogenation. To capture highly fluorinated alkyl chains, use a more general pattern like `[CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][$(F),$(Cl),$(Br),$(I)]{2,}` to identify chains with multiple halogens.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: For **Rule 8**, the patterns for `bulky_side_chains`, `blocked_amino_group`, and `multiple_rings_between` may not effectively identify all relevant structures. For `bulky_side_chains`, consider detecting tertiary carbons indicating branching with `[CX4]([CX4])[CX4]`. For `blocked_amino_group`, adjust the pattern to `[NX3][CX3](=O)` but ensure it specifically detects acylated amino groups. For `multiple_rings_between`, refine the pattern to detect modifiers where two or more rings are between functional groups and the carboxyl group.

- ** Suggestion 15 **: For **Rule 9**, the `polyether_chain` pattern `[OX2][CX4][OX2][CX4][OX2]` is too specific and may not match modifiers with longer or shorter polyether chains. Generalize the pattern by allowing variable lengths using repetitions, such as `([OX2][CX4]){2,}[OX2]`, to capture chains with multiple ethylene glycol units.

- ** Suggestion 16 **: For **Rule 10**, the `conjugated_heteroatom_rings` pattern `[c][n,o][c][n,o][c][n,o][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` is overly specific and may not match all conjugated ring systems with multiple coordinating heteroatoms. Broaden the pattern to include other heterocyclic systems by using recursive SMARTS or more general patterns, such as `[$(c),$(n),$(o)]1[$(c),$(n),$(o)][$(c),$(n),$(o)][$(c),$(n),$(o)]1[C](=O)O`.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with free amino (-NH₂) and carboxyl (-COOH) groups directly attached to short aliphatic chains, without bulky side chains or blocking groups, result in a **high yield**. The combination of free amino and carboxyl groups enhances coordination with the metal center, improving catalyst activity. Bulky substituents or blocked amino groups reduce yield due to steric hindrance and decreased coordination ability.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid)
    - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid)
    - *5-aminopentanoic acid* (5-Aminovaleric acid)

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine)
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyllysine)

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents such as amino (-NH₂) or hydroxyl (-OH) groups at the para position result in a **high yield**. This combination enhances electron density and provides additional coordination sites. Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., formyl (-CHO)) or non-coordinating substituents at the para position result in a **low yield** due to decreased coordination ability.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid*
    - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles (e.g., pyridine or pyrazole rings) directly attached to the carboxyl group result in a **high yield**. The lone pair electrons on nitrogen enhance coordination with the metal center. If the nitrogen heterocycle is connected via an additional aromatic ring, leading to steric hindrance, the yield is **low** due to reduced coordination efficiency.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
    - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Pyridine ring attached through a benzene ring)

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with thiol (-SH) groups attached to short aliphatic chains near the carboxyl group result in a **high yield**. The combination of thiol and carboxyl groups provides strong coordination with the metal center. Thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings lead to a **low yield** due to steric hindrance and decreased accessibility for coordination.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups near the carboxyl group, such as sugar acids, result in a **high yield**. The additional hydroxyl groups offer multiple coordination sites, enhancing interaction with the metal center. Modifiers with fewer hydroxyl groups or hydroxyl groups distant from the carboxyl group result in a **low yield** due to fewer coordination opportunities.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
    - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with moderate chain lengths (up to eight carbons) and without additional functional groups result in a **high yield**. The simplicity of the structure allows for effective interaction with the metal center. Modifiers with polar groups distant from the carboxyl group or very long chains result in a **low yield** due to steric factors and reduced coordination efficiency.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *Octanoic acid*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups near the carboxyl group, such as formyl (-CHO) or highly fluorinated alkyl chains, result in a **low yield**. These groups reduce electron density at coordination sites, hindering effective interaction with the metal center. Modifiers with electron-donating groups enhance coordination and result in a **high yield**.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*

  - **High Yield:**
    - *Octanoic acid* (contains no electron-withdrawing groups)

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with bulky side chains, blocked amino groups (e.g., acylated amino groups), or multiple rings between functional groups and the carboxyl group result in a **low yield**. Steric hindrance reduces accessibility to the metal center, impeding effective coordination.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyllysine)
    - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine)
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with flexible polyether chains lacking strong coordinating groups result in a **low yield**. The increased conformational flexibility and absence of effective coordination sites reduce interaction with the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with conjugated ring systems containing multiple coordinating heteroatoms (e.g., oxygen, nitrogen) result in a **high yield**. The combination of conjugation and multiple coordination sites facilitates strong binding to the metal center, enhancing catalyst performance.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*
    - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (Tryptophan)

**End of Rules**

These rules have been developed by carefully analyzing the provided dataset and considering the underlying physicochemical properties that influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. The rules focus on combinations of substructures and functional groups within the molecular modifiers, such as coordination sites, electron-donating or -withdrawing groups, steric effects, and chain lengths.

Each rule clearly predicts whether a modifier will result in a high or low yield based on its structural features. By combining multiple functional groups and considering their combined effects, these rules provide clear guidelines for predicting the performance of different modifiers in the reaction.

The set of 10 rules maintains a suitable balance between simple rules with higher coverage and more complex rules with lower coverage, effectively covering a broad range of the dataset. This approach facilitates better selection and design of modifiers to optimize and control the yield of the target reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Adjust the 'exclude_patterns' SMARTS in Rule 1 to be more specific to the chain between the amino and carboxyl groups, rather than excluding any rings or bulky groups elsewhere in the molecule.** For example, modify the exclude pattern `[r]` to detect rings only within the aliphatic chain connecting the amino and carboxyl groups. This can be achieved by integrating the ring exclusion directly into the main 'patterns' SMARTS or by specifying the context in which the ring should be excluded.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Review and correct the SMARTS patterns in Rule 1 to ensure they match amino acids with free amino and carboxyl groups correctly.** The current patterns are too restrictive, only matching specific chain lengths. Modify the patterns to allow for variable chain lengths (e.g., using `{1,3}` to represent 1 to 3 carbons) and to accommodate side chains that are not bulky. For example, use `[NX3H2][CX4H2][CX4H2]{1,3}[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]`.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Refine the logic for applying 'exclude_patterns' in the code to prevent over-exclusion of molecules.** Currently, if any 'exclude_pattern' matches anywhere in the molecule, the entire molecule is excluded. Modify the code to apply 'exclude_patterns' only to the same region where the 'patterns' are matched. This can be done by using the `MolSubstructMatch` function with the `useChirality=True` parameter and matching the substructure atom indices.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Verify that the 'compiled_patterns' and 'compiled_exclude_patterns' are correctly structured and that the code iterates over them properly.** Ensure that each pattern and exclude pattern is a single SMARTS string or that the groups are logically combined using appropriate operators.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Add debugging statements or logs to the code to output information about pattern matching for each molecule.** This will help identify whether the patterns are not matching due to incorrect SMARTS or whether the issue lies elsewhere in the code logic.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Test each SMARTS pattern individually using RDKit or another tool to confirm they match the intended substructures.** This ensures that the SMARTS syntax is correct and that the patterns align with the chemical structures described in the rules.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Simplify or generalize the SMARTS patterns to capture all relevant molecules.** For instance, in Rule 2, instead of specifying the para position rigidly, allow for ortho and meta positions if they are acceptable according to the rule. Use recursive SMARTS or wildcards where appropriate to capture variations in molecular structures.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Refine 'exclude_patterns' to avoid unintended exclusions.** For example, in Rule 2, ensure that the exclude patterns for electron-withdrawing groups only target substituents near the carboxyl group and not elsewhere in the molecule.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Ensure that the 'prediction' values assigned in the code correspond accurately to the 'high yield' and 'low yield' outcomes described in each rule.** Double-check that a '1' is used for 'high yield' and '-1' for 'low yield' across all rules consistently.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Re-express complex SMARTS patterns in simpler terms or break them into smaller components.** This can improve matching accuracy and make the patterns easier to debug and maintain. For example, in Rule 3, consider separating the nitrogen heterocycle identification from the carboxyl group attachment to simplify pattern matching.

** End of Suggestions **
---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Translate Qualitative Rules into Quantifiable Descriptors**  
  Modify the current rules to define clear, quantifiable molecular descriptors that can be computed directly from the SMILES representations. For example, specify the exact number of amino groups, carboxyl groups, or hydroxyl groups. Instead of general terms like "short aliphatic chains" or "bulky side chains," define chain lengths in terms of the number of carbon atoms or calculate molecular volume.

- **Advice 2**: **Implement Computationally Recognizable Substructures**  
  Rewrite the rules using SMARTS patterns or specific substructures that can be identified computationally. This allows for automated parsing of molecular structures to determine the presence or absence of key functional groups or motifs mentioned in the rules.

- **Advice 3**: **Create Binary and Numerical Features for Machine Learning**  
  For each rule, define features as binary indicators (e.g., `has_free_amino = 1 if free amino group present else 0`) or numerical values (e.g., `num_hydroxyl_groups`). This structured approach enables the construction of a feature matrix suitable for statistical modeling or machine learning algorithms.

- **Advice 4**: **Quantify Steric and Electronic Effects with Molecular Descriptors**  
  Use computational chemistry tools to calculate molecular descriptors that capture steric hindrance (e.g., van der Waals volume, topological polar surface area) and electronic properties (e.g., HOMO-LUMO gap, partial charges). Incorporate these descriptors into the rules to provide numerical values that reflect steric and electronic influences on yield.

- **Advice 5**: **Standardize Terminology and Thresholds**  
  Define specific thresholds or criteria within the rules. For example, specify that "chain lengths up to eight carbons result in high yield" or "electron-donating groups with Hammett sigma constants less than -0.1 enhance yield." This precision allows for consistent interpretation and application of the rules.

- **Advice 6**: **Utilize Molecular Fingerprints for Structural Representation**  
  Employ molecular fingerprinting techniques (e.g., MACCS keys, Morgan fingerprints) to represent molecules numerically based on their structural features. Fingerprints can capture the presence of specific substructures and functional groups, facilitating the generation of a numerical feature matrix.

- **Advice 7**: **Incorporate Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) Models**  
  Build QSAR models using the numerical descriptors derived from the improved rules. This approach leverages statistical correlations between molecular features and yield, enhancing predictive capabilities.

- **Advice 8**: **Develop a Hierarchical Feature Extraction Strategy**  
  Prioritize features based on their impact on yield as indicated by the rules. Start with primary coordination sites (e.g., counts of amino, carboxyl, hydroxyl groups), then include secondary features (e.g., chain length, steric bulk). This hierarchy aids in systematic feature extraction and analysis.

- **Advice 9**: **Automate Feature Extraction with Computational Tools**  
  Use cheminformatics libraries (e.g., RDKit) to automate the extraction of defined features from SMILES strings. Automation increases efficiency and reduces the likelihood of manual errors in generating the feature matrix.

- **Advice 10**: **Validate and Refine Rules with Statistical Analysis**  
  Apply statistical methods to assess the significance of each feature in predicting yield. Use this analysis to refine the rules further, focusing on features with strong predictive power and reconsidering or combining less impactful ones.

**End of Rules**

These rules have been developed by analyzing the provided dataset and considering the underlying physicochemical properties that influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. The rules focus on combinations of substructures and functional groups within the molecular modifiers, such as coordination sites, electron-donating or -withdrawing groups, steric effects, chain lengths, and the presence of heteroatoms.

Each rule predicts whether a modifier will result in a high or low yield based on its structural features. By combining multiple functional groups and considering their combined effects, these rules provide guidelines for predicting the performance of different modifiers in the reaction.

The set of 12 rules maintains a suitable balance between simple rules with higher coverage and more complex rules with lower coverage, effectively covering a broad range of the dataset. This approach facilitates better selection and design of modifiers to optimize and control the yield of the target reaction.

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine)
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyllysine)

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents such as amino (-NH₂) or hydroxyl (-OH) groups at the para position relative to the carboxyl group result in a **high yield**. This enhances electron density and provides additional coordination sites. Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., formyl (-CHO)) or non-coordinating substituents at the same position result in a **low yield** due to decreased coordination ability.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid*
    - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles (e.g., pyridine or pyrazole rings) directly attached to the carboxyl group result in a **high yield**. The nitrogen atom's lone pair enhances coordination with the metal center. If the nitrogen heterocycle is connected via an additional aromatic ring, increasing steric hindrance, the yield is **low** due to reduced coordination efficiency.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
    - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with thiol (-SH) groups attached to short aliphatic chains near the carboxyl group result in a **high yield**. The thiol group provides strong coordination with the metal center. Thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings lead to a **low yield** due to steric hindrance and decreased accessibility for coordination.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with moderate chain lengths (up to eight carbons) and without additional functional groups result in a **high yield**. The simplicity of the structure allows efficient interaction with the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *Octanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups near the carboxyl group, such as sugar acids or polyhydroxy acids, result in a **high yield**. The additional hydroxyl groups offer multiple coordination sites, enhancing interaction with the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
    - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., formyl (-CHO), fluoroalkyl groups) near the carboxyl group result in a **low yield**. These groups reduce electron density at coordination sites, hindering effective interaction with the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with bulky side chains, blocked amino groups (e.g., acylated amino groups), or multiple rings between functional groups and the carboxyl group result in a **low yield**. Steric hindrance reduces accessibility to the metal center, impeding effective coordination.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyllysine)
    - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine)
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with flexible polyether chains lacking strong coordinating groups result in a **low yield**. The increased conformational flexibility and absence of effective coordination sites reduce interaction with the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with conjugated ring systems containing multiple coordinating heteroatoms (e.g., oxygen, nitrogen) result in a **high yield**. The combination of conjugation and multiple coordination sites facilitates strong binding to the metal center, enhancing catalyst performance.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*
    - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (Tryptophan)

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl (-OH) or amino (-NH₂) groups distant from the carboxyl group (more than three carbons away) result in a **low yield** due to reduced coordination ability near the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with polycyclic or highly conjugated systems without effective coordinating groups result in a **low yield**. The lack of coordinating heteroatoms and increased steric bulk hinder interaction with the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid*
    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been developed by analyzing the provided dataset and considering the underlying physicochemical properties that influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. The rules focus on combinations of substructures and functional groups within the molecular modifiers, such as coordination sites, electron-donating or -withdrawing groups, steric effects, chain lengths, and the presence of heteroatoms.

Each rule predicts whether a modifier will result in a high or low yield based on its structural features. By combining multiple functional groups and considering their combined effects, these rules provide guidelines for predicting the performance of different modifiers in the reaction.

The set of 12 rules maintains a suitable balance between simple rules with higher coverage and more complex rules with lower coverage, effectively covering a broad range of the dataset. This approach facilitates better selection and design of modifiers to optimize and control the yield of the target reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Properly Implement Conditional Checks in the Code**

  The current code does not effectively implement the conditions specified in the rules. For example, in **Rule 1**, the conditions `max_chain_length`, `no_aromatic_rings`, and `no_bulky_side_chains` are mentioned but not adequately checked in the code. Modify the code to include explicit implementations for these conditions. Use functions to calculate the maximum aliphatic chain length, check for aromatic rings, and identify bulky side chains.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Accurate Calculation of Aliphatic Chain Length**

  The method used to calculate `max_chain_length` is incorrect. Instead of using `Chem.FindAllPathsOfLengthN`, which may not accurately reflect the longest chain, use a method like `Chem.rdmolops.GetLongestAliphaticChain(mol)` or implement a custom function to traverse the molecule and determine the longest continuous chain of aliphatic (non-ring) carbons.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Implement 'No Bulky Side Chains' Condition**

  For **Rule 1**, include a check for bulky side chains or branching in the molecule. This can be done by analyzing each carbon in the aliphatic chain to see if it has more than two heavy atom neighbors (branching) or by identifying bulky substituents attached to the chain. Use `GetSubstructMatches` with SMARTS patterns that define branching points or bulky groups.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Implement Positional Substructure Conditions**

  In **Rule 2**, the `substructure_conditions` like `'para_EDG_to_COOH'` are specified but not implemented. Write code to identify electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position relative to the carboxyl group on an aromatic ring. This can be achieved by mapping the carboxyl group to the ring and checking the substituents at the opposite position.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Enhance SMARTS Patterns for Specific Functionalities**

  Improve the SMARTS patterns to accurately reflect the functional groups and their positions. For example, in **Rule 3**, ensure that the patterns for nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group are specific enough to match pyridine or pyrazole rings connected to the carboxyl group without intervening atoms.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Implement Proximity Checks for Functional Groups**

  For rules like **Rule 6** and **Rule 11**, where the proximity of hydroxyl or amino groups to the carboxyl group is important, implement functions to calculate the shortest path between these groups. Use methods like `Chem.GetShortestPath(mol, atom1_idx, atom2_idx)` to determine if the groups are near or distant from each other according to the rule definitions.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Check for Multiple Functional Groups**

  In **Rule 6**, the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups is crucial. Modify the code to count the number of hydroxyl groups in the molecule and ensure they are in proximity to the carboxyl group. Implement a loop that searches for `[OX2H]` atoms and counts them, considering their distance from the carboxyl group atoms.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Correctly Identify Polycyclic and Conjugated Systems**

  In **Rule 10** and **Rule 12**, the identification of polycyclic or highly conjugated systems is essential. Enhance the code to detect such systems by checking for multiple fused rings or extended conjugation. Use `mol.GetRingInfo()` and analyze the rings' fusion and aromaticity.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Improve Handling of Electron-Withdrawing Groups**

  For **Rule 7**, ensure that all relevant electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) near the carboxyl group are identified. Expand the SMARTS patterns to include other common EWGs, and implement proximity checks to confirm they are near the carboxyl group.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Enhance Error Handling and Provide Debugging Information**

  Modify the exception handling to provide informative error messages instead of silently appending zeros. This will help in debugging and ensuring that molecules are correctly analyzed. Consider logging warnings or errors when a molecule cannot be parsed or when a rule's conditions cannot be fully evaluated.

- **Suggestion 11**: **Validate SMARTS Patterns Against Known Examples**

  Test each SMARTS pattern against molecules with known structures to ensure they match correctly. For instance, validate the patterns for primary amines, carboxylic acids, and thiol groups by checking them against simple molecules like ethanolamine, acetic acid, and ethanethiol.

- **Suggestion 12**: **Use RDKit's Built-in Functional Group Identification**

  RDKit has built-in functionalities and predefined functional group definitions (`rdkit.Chem.Fragments`) that can simplify the identification of certain groups. Utilize these where appropriate to improve reliability and reduce the potential for errors in SMARTS pattern definitions.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

---

**1. Comparison with Previous Metrics**

To assess the performance of the current rules, we'll compare the current metrics with the previous metrics provided, focusing on the training data.

**Previous Rule Metrics (Average):**

- **Train Support:** Average of 0.1667 and 0.1845 = **0.1756**
- **Train Confidence:** Average of 0.6352 and 0.5396 = **0.5874**
- **Train Lift:** Average of 1.2048 and 1.0559 = **1.1304**
- **Train Leverage:** Average of 0.0289 and -0.0041 = **0.0124**

**Current Rule Metrics:**

- **Train Support:** **0.1929**
- **Train Confidence:** **0.5387**
- **Train Lift:** **1.0800**
- **Train Leverage:** **0.0042**

**Observations:**

- **Support:**
  - **Increase from 0.1756 to 0.1929**
    - *Interpretation:* The rules now cover a larger proportion of the training data. This suggests that the rules are more general and apply to more instances.
- **Confidence:**
  - **Decrease from 0.5874 to 0.5387**
    - *Interpretation:* The proportion of cases where the rule predictions are correct, given the rule conditions are met, has declined. This indicates a reduction in predictive precision.
- **Lift:**
  - **Decrease from 1.1304 to 1.0800**
    - *Interpretation:* The lift is still above 1, meaning the rules are better than random chance. However, the strength of this improvement has lessened, suggesting that the rules are less effective at improving prediction over the baseline probability than before.
- **Leverage:**
  - **Decrease from 0.0124 to 0.0042**
    - *Interpretation:* The rules provide less additional support over what would be expected by chance. This decrease indicates weaker associations between the rule conditions and predictions.

---

**2. Assessment of Local Minimum and Iteration Sufficiency**

- **Trend Analysis:**
  - The iterations show fluctuations in metrics without a consistent upward trend in performance.
  - In earlier iterations, some metrics (e.g., confidence and lift) were higher than the current values.
- **Local Minimum Indicator:**
  - The decrease in key metrics like confidence, lift, and leverage suggests that we may be approaching a local minimum.
  - Increasing support at the expense of confidence and lift indicates a trade-off where the rules become too general, reducing their predictive value.
- **Iteration Sufficiency:**
  - Since further iterations have not yielded improvements in critical metrics, it may indicate that sufficient iterations have been performed under the current methodology.
  - Continuing without altering the approach may not lead to significant enhancements.

---

**3. Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

**A. Enhance Rule Precision**

- **Increase Specificity:**
  - Refine rules to include more specific conditions that are strongly associated with the high yield outcome.
  - Avoid broad terms that might introduce noise and reduce confidence.
- **Example Improvement:**
  - In Rule 5, instead of "Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with moderate chain lengths (up to eight carbons)...," specify the optimal chain length or functional groups that contribute most to high yield.

**B. Evaluate Individual Rule Performance**

- **Rule Metrics Breakdown:**
  - Analyze each rule's individual metrics to identify which rules are contributing positively or negatively to overall performance.
  - Focus on improving or removing rules with low confidence and lift.
- **Adjust Underperforming Rules:**
  - For rules with low individual metrics, revisit the conditions and consider adding constraints or rephrasing to better capture the relationship.

**C. Balance Support and Confidence**

- **Optimize Between Generality and Precision:**
  - Aim for a balance where rules cover a meaningful portion of data (support) but still maintain high accuracy (confidence).
  - Prioritize rules that contribute to higher confidence and lift, even if their support is lower.

**D. Incorporate Additional Data Analysis**

- **Feature Importance Analysis:**
  - Utilize statistical methods or machine learning models to identify which molecular features are most predictive of high yield.
  - Incorporate these findings into the rules to enhance their predictive power.
- **Correlation Studies:**
  - Perform correlation analysis between functional groups and yields to discover hidden relationships.

**E. Apply Cross-Validation Techniques**

- **Prevent Overfitting:**
  - Use cross-validation to test the rules on different subsets of data to ensure they generalize well.
  - Monitor performance on validation sets and adjust rules accordingly.

**F. Engage Domain Expertise**

- **Consult Chemists:**
  - Collaborate with organic chemists to gain insights into mechanistic pathways that could inform rule refinement.
  - Validate the chemical plausibility of the rules to ensure they make sense scientifically.

**G. Introduce New Rules or Modify Existing Ones**

- **Explore Untapped Patterns:**
  - Investigate molecular features or patterns not currently covered by the rules.
  - Consider environmental factors, reaction conditions, or catalyst properties that might influence yield.
- **Simplify Complex Rules:**
  - Simplify overly complex rules that might be causing overfitting or low confidence.

**H. Monitor and Adjust Thresholds**

- **Adjust Confidence and Lift Thresholds:**
  - Set minimum acceptable values for confidence and lift to maintain rule quality.
  - Rules not meeting these thresholds should be re-evaluated.

**I. Reduce Redundancy and Overlap**

- **Consolidate Similar Rules:**
  - Identify and merge rules that cover overlapping conditions to streamline the rule set.
- **Eliminate Contradictory Rules:**
  - Remove rules that conflict with each other or introduce ambiguity.

---

**4. Specific Suggestions for Current Rules**

- **Rule 1 and Rule 8 Overlap:**
  - Both address amino acids with specific functional groups. Consider unifying these rules to eliminate redundancy.
- **Rule Clarity and Consistency:**
  - Ensure that terms and definitions are used consistently across all rules to avoid confusion.
- **Address Low-Yield Exceptions:**
  - Investigate modifiers that do not conform to the rules and result in unexpected yields. Adjust rules to account for these exceptions.
- **Incorporate Quantitative Descriptors:**
  - Use quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) parameters, such as molecular weight, electronegativity, or steric factors, to refine rules.

---

**5. Conclusion**

The current metrics indicate that while the rules cover more data (higher support), their predictive effectiveness has decreased (lower confidence, lift, and leverage). This suggests that the rules have become too generalized, reducing their ability to accurately predict high yields.

To move forward:

- **Adopt a More Targeted Approach:** Focus on enhancing the precision of the rules rather than expanding their coverage indiscriminately.
- **Reassess the Rule Development Strategy:** Consider integrating data-driven techniques with expert knowledge to refine the rules effectively.
- **Ensure Scientific Validity:** Align rule adjustments with established chemical principles to maintain relevance and applicability.

By implementing these recommendations, it is anticipated that the rules can achieve a better balance between coverage and predictive power, ultimately improving their utility in predicting catalytic performance.

---

**Next Steps**

- **Conduct Detailed Rule Analysis:** Perform a comprehensive evaluation of each rule's performance metrics.
- **Iterative Refinement:** Apply the suggested improvements and monitor changes in metrics.
- **Validation:** Test the refined rules on an independent dataset to assess generalizability.
- **Documentation:** Keep detailed records of changes and their impacts to inform future iterations.

---

**Note:** Continuous monitoring and adaptive refinement are key to developing effective predictive rules in complex systems like catalytic chemistry. Combining statistical analysis with domain expertise will yield the most robust and insightful results.

ML Commenter Message:
**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

**1. Comparison with Previous Metrics**

- **Previous Validation Accuracies**: The validation accuracies in previous iterations were consistently high, ranging from **0.68 to 0.76**, with test accuracies between **0.625 and 0.75**.
- **Current Validation Accuracy**: In the latest iteration, the 5-fold cross-validation accuracy has decreased to **0.5429**.
  
This decrease in validation accuracy suggests that the current set of rules is less effective compared to previous iterations. The model's performance has diminished, indicating potential issues with the rules' predictive power or overfitting/underfitting.

**2. Assessing Overfitting and Underfitting**

- **Possible Overfitting**: The fluctuation in validation accuracies across iterations (ranging from **0.4571 to 0.76**) could indicate that some rules are too specific to the training data, capturing noise rather than underlying patterns.
- **Possible Underfitting**: The overall decrease in accuracy and inconsistent performance suggest that the current rules may not be capturing essential features required for accurate predictions, pointing towards underfitting.

**3. Analyzing Discrepancies Using SHAP Values**

To identify which rules may be contributing to incorrect predictions, we'll analyze molecules where there is a discrepancy between predicted and experimental values and examine the associated SHAP values.

---

**a. Underestimated Loadings (Predicted Low, Experimental High)**

For these molecules, rules with high negative SHAP values are likely problematic.

1. **Molecule**: *C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N*

   - **Predicted**: Low
   - **Experimental**: High
   - **SHAP Values**:
     - **Rule2**: **-0.0321**
     - **Rule3**: **-0.0190**
     - **Rule5**: **-0.0447**

   **Analysis**: Rule5 has the most significant negative SHAP value, suggesting that it strongly contributes to the underestimation.

2. **Molecule**: *C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O*

   - **Predicted**: Low
   - **Experimental**: High
   - **SHAP Values**:
     - **Rule2**: **-0.0321**
     - **Rule3**: **-0.0190**
     - **Rule5**: **-0.0447**

   **Analysis**: Again, Rule5 is contributing significantly to the underestimation.

3. **Molecule**: *C1=CN=CC=C1CCCC(=O)O*

   - **Predicted**: Low
   - **Experimental**: High
   - **SHAP Values**:
     - **Rule2**: **-0.0136**
     - **Rule3**: **-0.2303**
     - **Rule5**: **-0.2204**

   **Analysis**: Both Rule3 and Rule5 have large negative SHAP values, with Rule3 being more negative, indicating they are contributing to the underestimation.

4. **Molecule**: *C(C(=O)O)NC(CO)(CO)CO*

   - **Predicted**: Low
   - **Experimental**: High
   - **SHAP Values**:
     - **Rule2**: **-0.0331**
     - **Rule3**: **-0.0643**
     - **Rule5**: **-0.0693**

   **Analysis**: Rule5 again shows a significant negative SHAP value.

5. **Molecule**: *C(CS)C(=O)O*

   - **Predicted**: Low
   - **Experimental**: High
   - **SHAP Values**:
     - **Rule2**: **-0.0331**
     - **Rule3**: **-0.0643**
     - **Rule5**: **-0.0693**

   **Analysis**: Consistent with previous observations, Rule5 is contributing to the underestimation.

---

**b. Overestimated Loadings (Predicted High, Experimental Low)**

For these molecules, rules with high positive SHAP values are likely problematic.

1. **Molecule**: *C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)N*

   - **Predicted**: High
   - **Experimental**: Low
   - **SHAP Values**:
     - **Rule2**: **-0.0806**
     - **Rule3**: **-0.0257**
     - **Rule5**: **0.0115**

   **Analysis**: Rule5 has a small positive SHAP value, but the overall SHAP values are low, suggesting other factors may be contributing.

2. **Molecule**: *C(CCN)CC(=O)O*

   - **Predicted**: Low
   - **Experimental**: High
   - **SHAP Values**:
     - **Rule2**: **-0.0065**
     - **Rule3**: **-0.0506**
     - **Rule5**: **-0.0539**

   **Analysis**: Rule5 has a moderately negative SHAP value, contributing to underestimation.

3. **Molecule**: *C1=CC=C2C(=C1)C(=CN2)C[C@H](C(=O)O)N*

   - **Predicted**: Low
   - **Experimental**: High
   - **SHAP Values**:
     - **Rule2**: **-0.3217**
     - **Rule3**: **-0.0140**
     - **Rule5**: **-0.1642**

   **Analysis**: Rule2 has a significantly negative SHAP value, indicating it may be causing underestimation.

---

**4. Interpretation of Accuracy Metrics**

The decrease in validation accuracy compared to previous iterations suggests that the current rules may not be capturing the essential features necessary for accurate predictions. The inconsistent performance indicates that additional refinement is needed, and a local minimum has not yet been reached.

**5. Insights from SHAP Analysis**

- **Rule5**:

  - Frequently shows high negative SHAP values in cases of underestimated loadings.
  - May be too broadly defined or incorrectly penalizing certain molecular features.

- **Rule2**:

  - Exhibits significant negative SHAP values for some molecules with underestimated loadings.
  - Potentially contributing to underfitting by not adequately capturing the influence of certain substituents.

- **Rule3**:

  - Shows both high positive and negative SHAP values.
  - Indicates that the rule may not be specific enough, leading to inconsistent contributions.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

**1. Refine Rule5**

- **Current Rule**:

  - **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with moderate chain lengths (up to eight carbons) and without additional functional groups result in a **high yield**.*

- **Issues Identified**:

  - Rule5 is contributing to underestimation in several cases.
  - Molecules with additional functional groups near the carboxyl group are being misclassified.

- **Suggested Refinement**:

  - **Modify Rule5 to account for additional functional groups**:

    *"Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids **without additional polar or coordinating functional groups** (e.g., hydroxyl, amino, thiol) and with chain lengths between four to eight carbons result in a **low yield** due to lack of effective coordination sites."*

- **Rationale**:

  - This adjustment recognizes that the presence of additional functional groups can enhance coordination, and their absence may lead to lower yields.

**2. Adjust Rule2**

- **Current Rule**:

  - **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents such as amino (-NH₂) or hydroxyl (-OH) groups at the para position relative to the carboxyl group result in a **high yield**. Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups result in a **low yield**.*

- **Issues Identified**:

  - Rule2 may be too rigid, not accounting for ortho/meta positions or the effect of multiple substituents.

- **Suggested Refinement**:

  - **Expand Rule2 to include substituent positions and cumulative effects**:

    *"Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) at any position on the ring enhance electron density and result in a **high yield**. Multiple electron-donating groups further increase yield. Electron-withdrawing groups or absence of electron-donating groups result in a **low yield**."*

- **Rationale**:

  - This accounts for the influence of substituents at various positions and the additive effect of multiple groups, potentially improving prediction accuracy.

**3. Enhance Specificity of Rule3**

- **Current Rule**:

  - **Rule 3**: *Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group result in a **high yield**.*

- **Issues Identified**:

  - Rule3 may be too general, leading to inconsistent SHAP contributions.

- **Suggested Refinement**:

  - **Specify the types of nitrogen heterocycles and consider steric effects**:

    *"Modifiers containing small, planar nitrogen heterocycles (e.g., pyridine, pyrrole) directly attached to the carboxyl group result in a **high yield** due to effective coordination. Larger or fused nitrogen heterocycles, or those with additional steric hindrance, result in a **low yield**."*

- **Rationale**:

  - By distinguishing between different nitrogen heterocycles and their steric properties, the rule becomes more precise.

**4. Address Overfitting/Underfitting**

- **Generalization Improvement**:

  - **Simplify overly complex rules** that may be overfitting the training data.
  - **Ensure rules are based on fundamental chemical principles** that are broadly applicable.

- **Example**:

  - Review rules like Rule8 and Rule12, which may be too specific or redundant, and consider consolidating them to reduce complexity.

**5. Incorporate Additional Functional Groups**

- **Observation**:

  - Some molecules with underpredicted loadings contain functional groups not adequately captured by current rules (e.g., thiol groups in *C(CS)C(=O)O*).

- **Suggestion**:

  - **Introduce or refine rules to account for these functional groups**.

- **Proposed New Rule**:

  - **Rule14**: *Modifiers with thiol (-SH) groups adjacent to the carboxyl group enhance coordination and result in a **high yield**.*

  - **Rationale**:

    - Thiol groups are strong coordinating ligands and can significantly impact the metal-modifier interaction.

**6. Iterative Refinement Using SHAP Insights**

- **Methodology**:

  - Continue to analyze SHAP values in misclassified cases to identify patterns.
  - **Adjust rules that consistently contribute to incorrect predictions**.
  - **Validate changes by observing improvements in validation accuracy**.

**Conclusion**

By refining the rules based on the insights from the SHAP analysis and addressing underfitting issues, we can enhance the model's predictive performance. The suggested adjustments aim to improve the generalization of the rules and better capture the underlying chemical factors influencing the catalytic activity.

**Summary and Suggestions for Optimizing Current Rules**

---

As the manager tasked with extracting rules from SMILES to describe the catalytic action of modified catalysts, I have reviewed the current rules, performance metrics, and the detailed discussions provided. Below is a summary of the key points and suggestions for improving the current rules to enhance their predictive accuracy without overfitting.

### **I. Summary of Discussions and Analysis**

#### **A. Performance Metrics Comparison**

- **Decrease in Predictive Performance**: The current validation accuracy has decreased to **54.29%**, down from previous accuracies ranging between **68% and 76%**. This indicates a decline in the model's ability to accurately predict the yield based on the current rules.
  
- **Metrics Analysis**:
  - **Train Support** increased, suggesting that the rules cover more data.
  - **Train Confidence**, **Lift**, and **Leverage** decreased, indicating that while more data is covered, the accuracy and strength of the rules have diminished.

#### **B. SHAP Analysis Feedback**

- **Identification of Problematic Rules**: SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values highlighted that certain rules contribute negatively to the model's predictions.
  
- **Key Observations**:
  - **Rule 5**: Frequently shows high negative SHAP values in cases where the model underestimates the yield, suggesting it may be too broadly defined or incorrectly penalizing certain molecular features.
  - **Rule 2**: Also contributes to underestimation, possibly due to being too rigid or not accounting for all relevant substituent positions and cumulative effects.
  - **Rule 3**: Exhibits inconsistent SHAP contributions, indicating it may be too general and needs refinement.

#### **C. Analysis of Underperforming Predictions**

- **Underestimated Yield**: Molecules that experimentally result in a high yield but are predicted as low by the model often share common features not adequately captured by the current rules.
  
- **Overestimated Yield**: Some molecules are predicted to have a high yield contrary to experimental results, pointing to rules that may overgeneralize or not consider inhibitory structural features.

### **II. Directions to Optimize Current Rules**

Based on the analysis, the following suggestions are made to refine and improve the current rules:

#### **1. Refine Rule 5**

- **Issue**: Rule 5 is too broad, leading to underestimation of modifiers with additional functional groups that actually enhance yield.
  
- **Current Rule 5**:
  - *Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with moderate chain lengths (up to eight carbons) and without additional functional groups result in a **high yield**.*
  
- **Suggested Revision**:
  - **Revised Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids **without additional polar or coordinating functional groups** (e.g., hydroxyl, amino, thiol) result in a **low yield** due to a lack of effective coordination sites.*
  
- **Rationale**: This adjustment recognizes that the absence of coordinating groups reduces the modifier's ability to interact effectively with the metal center, leading to lower yields.

#### **2. Adjust Rule 2**

- **Issue**: Rule 2 may be too rigid, not accounting for electron-donating groups (EDGs) at positions other than the para position or the cumulative effect of multiple EDGs.
  
- **Current Rule 2**:
  - *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with EDGs such as amino (-NH₂) or hydroxyl (-OH) groups at the para position result in a **high yield**. Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) result in a **low yield**.*
  
- **Suggested Revision**:
  - **Revised Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) at **any position** on the ring enhance electron density and result in a **high yield**. The presence of multiple EDGs further increases the yield. Modifiers with electron-withdrawing substituents result in a **low yield**.*
  
- **Rationale**: This broader inclusion accounts for the influence of EDGs regardless of their position and recognizes the additive effect of multiple EDGs on increasing electron density and coordination ability.

#### **3. Enhance Specificity of Rule 3**

- **Issue**: Rule 3 is too general, leading to inconsistent predictive contributions.
  
- **Current Rule 3**:
  - *Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group result in a **high yield**.*
  
- **Suggested Revision**:
  - **Revised Rule 3**: *Modifiers containing small, planar nitrogen heterocycles (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole) directly attached to the carboxyl group result in a **high yield** due to effective coordination with the metal center. Modifiers with larger or fused nitrogen heterocycles, or those with significant steric hindrance, result in a **low yield**.*
  
- **Rationale**: Specifying the size and planarity of the heterocycles helps account for steric effects and ensures that only those capable of effective coordination are associated with high yields.

#### **4. Implement Proper Conditional Checks in Code**

- **Suggestion**:
  - **Code Implementation**: Ensure that all conditions specified in the rules are correctly implemented in the code. This includes calculating maximum aliphatic chain lengths, checking for bulky side chains or branching, and identifying specific substituent positions.
  
- **Rationale**: Accurate implementation of the rules' conditions is crucial for the model to correctly interpret molecular structures and make accurate predictions.

#### **5. Enhance SMARTS Patterns for Functional Groups**

- **Suggestion**:
  - **SMARTS Improvement**: Refine the SMARTS patterns used to identify functional groups and their positions, ensuring they are specific and accurate.
  
- **Rationale**: Precise SMARTS patterns are essential for correctly matching molecular substructures to the rules, which directly impacts prediction accuracy.

#### **6. Incorporate Proximity and Positional Checks**

- **Suggestion**:
  - **Proximity Checks**: Implement methods to calculate the proximity of functional groups to the carboxyl group, such as shortest path calculations between atoms.
  
- **Rationale**: The effectiveness of certain functional groups often depends on their position relative to the carboxyl group, affecting their ability to coordinate with the metal center.

#### **7. Correct Identification of Polycyclic and Conjugated Systems**

- **Suggestion**:
  - **Ring Analysis**: Use molecular ring information to accurately identify polycyclic systems and assess their impact on steric hindrance and coordination ability.
  
- **Rationale**: Proper identification of these systems ensures that rules considering steric effects and conjugation are applied correctly.

#### **8. Improve Handling of Electron-Withdrawing Groups**

- **Suggestion**:
  - **EWG Identification**: Expand the identification of EWGs to include all relevant groups and ensure their proximity to key functional sites is considered.
  
- **Rationale**: Correctly identifying EWGs and their influence is important for predicting their effect on electron density and coordination ability.

#### **9. Validate and Test Rule Conditions**

- **Suggestion**:
  - **Validation**: Test each rule against known examples to ensure the conditions are correctly implemented and yield expected results.
  
- **Rationale**: Validation helps detect errors in rule implementation and ensures reliability.

#### **10. Use RDKit's Built-in Functional Group Identification**

- **Suggestion**:
  - **RDKit Functions**: Utilize RDKit's predefined functional group identifiers to improve accuracy and reduce the potential for errors in custom definitions.
  
- **Rationale**: Leveraging well-tested libraries enhances reliability and efficiency in identifying molecular features.

#### **11. Simplify and Consolidate Overlapping Rules**

- **Suggestion**:
  - **Rule Consolidation**: Review all rules for overlap or redundancy and consider merging similar rules to simplify the rule set.
  
- **Rationale**: A streamlined set of rules reduces complexity and potential conflicts, aiding in better generalization and maintenance.

#### **12. Address Overfitting and Underfitting**

- **Suggestion**:
  - **Balance Generality and Specificity**: Ensure that rules are neither too broad (leading to underfitting) nor too specific (leading to overfitting). Adjust rules to achieve an optimal balance by focusing on fundamental chemical principles.
  
- **Rationale**: Properly balanced rules are more likely to generalize well to new data, improving predictive performance.

### **III. Possibility for Further Optimization**

Based on the analysis, there is significant potential for further optimization of the current rules without causing overfitting:

- **Performance Indicates Underfitting**: The decrease in validation accuracy suggests that the rules are not capturing the essential features necessary for accurate predictions, indicating underfitting.

- **Refinement Opportunities**: By refining the rules as suggested, especially those identified as problematic (Rules 2, 3, and 5), we can enhance the model's ability to accurately predict yields.

- **Data-Driven Adjustments**: Utilizing SHAP values and other data-driven insights allows for targeted improvements that are less likely to result in overfitting.

- **Chemical Validity**: Ensuring that all rule refinements are grounded in chemical knowledge helps maintain the balance between model complexity and generalizability.

### **Conclusion**

Considering these factors, further optimization of the current rules is both possible and advisable. Implementing the suggested refinements should enhance the model's predictive accuracy and robustness.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents such as amino (-NH₂) or hydroxyl (-OH) groups at the para position relative to the carboxyl group result in a **high yield**. This enhances electron density and provides additional coordination sites. Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., formyl (-CHO)) or non-coordinating substituents at the same position result in a **low yield** due to decreased coordination ability.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles (e.g., pyridine or pyrazole rings) directly attached to the carboxyl group result in a **high yield**. The nitrogen atom's lone pair enhances coordination with the metal center. If the nitrogen heterocycle is connected via an additional aromatic ring, increasing steric hindrance, the yield is **low** due to reduced coordination efficiency.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
    - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with thiol (-SH) groups attached to short aliphatic chains near the carboxyl group result in a **high yield**. The thiol group provides strong coordination with the metal center. Thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings lead to a **low yield** due to steric hindrance and decreased accessibility for coordination.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with moderate chain lengths (up to eight carbons) and without additional functional groups result in a **high yield**. The simplicity of the structure allows efficient interaction with the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *Octanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups near the carboxyl group, such as sugar acids or polyhydroxy acids, result in a **high yield**. The additional hydroxyl groups offer multiple coordination sites, enhancing interaction with the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
    - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., formyl (-CHO), fluoroalkyl groups) near the carboxyl group result in a **low yield**. These groups reduce electron density at coordination sites, hindering effective interaction with the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with bulky side chains, blocked amino groups (e.g., acylated amino groups), or multiple rings between functional groups and the carboxyl group result in a **low yield**. Steric hindrance reduces accessibility to the metal center, impeding effective coordination.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyllysine)
    - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine)
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with flexible polyether chains lacking strong coordinating groups result in a **low yield**. The increased conformational flexibility and absence of effective coordination sites reduce interaction with the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with conjugated ring systems containing multiple coordinating heteroatoms (e.g., oxygen, nitrogen) result in a **high yield**. The combination of conjugation and multiple coordination sites facilitates strong binding to the metal center, enhancing catalyst performance.**

  **Examples:**

  - **High Yield:**
    - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*
    - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (Tryptophan)

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl (-OH) or amino (-NH₂) groups distant from the carboxyl group (more than three carbons away) result in a **low yield** due to reduced coordination ability near the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with polycyclic or highly conjugated systems without effective coordinating groups result in a **low yield**. The lack of coordinating heteroatoms and increased steric bulk hinder interaction with the metal center.**

  **Examples:**

  - **Low Yield:**
    - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid*
    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been developed by analyzing the provided dataset and considering the underlying physicochemical properties that influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. The rules focus on combinations of substructures and functional groups within the molecular modifiers, such as coordination sites, electron-donating or -withdrawing groups, steric effects, chain lengths, and the presence of heteroatoms.

Each rule predicts whether a modifier will result in a high or low yield based on its structural features. By combining multiple functional groups and considering their combined effects, these rules provide guidelines for predicting the performance of different modifiers in the reaction.

The set of 12 rules maintains a suitable balance between simple rules with higher coverage and more complex rules with lower coverage, effectively covering a broad range of the dataset. This approach facilitates better selection and design of modifiers to optimize and control the yield of the target reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------
