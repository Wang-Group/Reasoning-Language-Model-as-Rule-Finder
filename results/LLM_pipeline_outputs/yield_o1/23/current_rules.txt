**Start of Rules**

1. **Modifiers that are α-Amino Acids with Carboxyl and Amino Groups on Adjacent Carbons**
   - **Description**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids**, having both **amino (–NH₂)** and **carboxyl (–COOH)** groups bonded to the **same carbon atom**.
   - **Prediction**: Associated with **high yield**.
   - **Rationale**: The proximity of amino and carboxyl groups allows for **bidentate coordination** to metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity by stabilizing the metal ion through chelation.
   - **Examples**: _(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (L-aspartic acid)_, _(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (L-glutamic acid)_, _(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (L-tryptophan)_.

   - **Description**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with an **amino (–NH₂)** or **nitro (–NO₂)** group at the **para position** relative to the carboxyl group.
   - **Prediction**: Associated with **high yield**.
   - **Rationale**: Para-substituted amino or nitro groups enhance the ligand's ability to **coordinate with metal centers** through resonance and electron delocalization, improving catalytic performance.
   - **Examples**: _4-aminobenzoic acid_, _4-nitrobenzoic acid_.

3. **Heterocyclic Carboxylic Acids with Nitrogen Atoms in the Ring**
   - **Description**: Modifiers that contain **heterocyclic aromatic rings** with **nitrogen atoms**, directly attached to a **carboxyl group**.
   - **Prediction**: Associated with **high yield**.

4. **Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups Near Carboxyl Group**
   - **Description**: Modifiers that possess **multiple hydroxyl groups (–OH)** in proximity to the **carboxyl group**, forming **polyol structures**.
   - **Prediction**: Associated with **high yield**.
   - **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase the number of **potential coordination sites**, strengthening metal-ligand interactions.
   - **Example**: _(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (D-gluconic acid)_.

5. **Long-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Without Additional Functional Groups**
   - **Description**: Modifiers that are **straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **six or more carbons** and **no other functional groups**.
   - **Prediction**: Associated with **high yield**.
   - **Rationale**: Their hydrophobic nature and lack of steric hindrance allow them to integrate into the catalyst's hydrophobic regions without blocking active sites.
   - **Example**: _Octanoic acid_.

6. **Modifiers with Aldehyde Groups Attached to Aromatic Rings**
   - **Description**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with an **aldehyde group (–CHO)** attached to the aromatic ring.
   - **Prediction**: Associated with **low yield**.
   - **Rationale**: Aldehyde groups can participate in **side reactions** or inhibit catalyst function by forming **Schiff bases** with amines, reducing the availability of active metal sites.
   - **Examples**: _4-formylbenzoic acid_, _5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid_.

7. **Modifiers Containing Polyether Chains**
   - **Description**: Modifiers with multiple **ether linkages (–O–)** within their molecular structure.
   - **Prediction**: Associated with **low yield**.
   - **Rationale**: Polyether chains may not coordinate effectively with metal centers and could introduce flexibility that disrupts the catalyst's structure.
   - **Examples**: _2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid_, _3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid_.

8. **Long-Chain Aliphatic Acids with Terminal Polar Groups**
   - **Description**: Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic acids** (≥6 carbons) with **terminal amino (–NH₂)** or **hydroxyl (–OH)** groups.
   - **Prediction**: Associated with **low yield**.
   - **Rationale**: Terminal polar groups may introduce **steric hindrance** or create unfavorable interactions, hindering effective coordination with the metal center.
   - **Examples**: _7-aminoheptanoic acid_, _7-hydroxyheptanoic acid_, _8-aminooctanoic acid_.

9. **Modifiers with Amide Bonds Adjacent to Carboxyl Group**
   - **Description**: Modifiers containing **amide bonds (–CONH–)** near the **carboxyl group**.
   - **Prediction**: Associated with **low yield**.
   - **Rationale**: Amide groups are less likely to donate electrons due to **resonance stabilization**, reducing their effectiveness as ligands and possibly introducing steric hindrance.
   - **Examples**: _2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid_, _2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid_.

10. **Amino Acids with Non-Coordinating Aromatic Side Chains**
    - **Description**: **Amino acids** with **aromatic side chains** lacking coordinating heteroatoms or substituents capable of metal coordination.
    - **Prediction**: Associated with **low yield**.
    - **Rationale**: The absence of additional coordination sites and potential steric bulk from the aromatic ring may hinder effective interaction with the metal center.
    - **Example**: _(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (L-phenylalanine)_.

11. **Modifiers with Electron-Withdrawing Perfluorinated Alkyl Chains**
    - **Description**: Modifiers containing **perfluoroalkyl groups** attached to the **carboxyl group**.
    - **Prediction**: Associated with **low yield**.
    - **Rationale**: Strong electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms reduce electron density on coordinating oxygen atoms, weakening metal-ligand interactions.
    - **Example**: _2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid_.

12. **Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Para-Hydroxy Substituents**
    - **Description**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with a **hydroxy group (–OH)** at the **para position** relative to the carboxyl group.
    - **Prediction**: Associated with **low yield**.
    - **Rationale**: Despite being a potential coordinating group, the **para-hydroxy substituent** may result in less effective coordination or deactivation of the catalyst, possibly due to strong hydrogen bonding or competing reactions.
    - **Examples**: _4-hydroxybenzoic acid_, _3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid_.

13. **Modifiers with Sulfur-Containing Thiol Groups Near Carboxyl Group**
    - **Description**: Modifiers that have **thiol groups (–SH)** in proximity to the **carboxyl group** (within two carbons).
    - **Prediction**: Associated with **high yield**.
    - **Rationale**: **Thiol groups** can form strong metal-sulfur bonds, enhancing catalyst stability through effective coordination with the metal center.
    - **Example**: _3-sulfanylpropanoic acid_.

14. **Modifiers Where Heterocyclic Rings are Directly Attached to Carboxyl Group**
    - **Description**: Modifiers in which **nitrogen-containing heterocyclic rings** are directly connected to the **carboxyl group**.
    - **Prediction**: Yield depends on the ability of the heterocycle to coordinate; may be associated with **high yield** if the heterocycle can coordinate effectively.
    - **Rationale**: Direct attachment of heterocyclic rings with coordinating nitrogen atoms can facilitate strong metal-ligand interactions, but the position and electron density of the nitrogen atoms are crucial.
    - **Examples**: Positive example: _1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid_ (**high yield**); negative example: _4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid_ (**low yield**).

15. **Modifiers with Extended Conjugation Between Carboxyl Group and Distal Heterocycle**
    - **Description**: Modifiers with a **conjugated system** separating the **carboxyl group** from a **heterocyclic ring** containing coordinating heteroatoms.
    - **Prediction**: Often associated with **low yield**.
    - **Rationale**: The extended conjugation may **delocalize electron density** away from coordinating sites, reducing the effectiveness of coordination with the metal center.
    - **Example**: _4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid_ (**low yield**) vs. _4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid_ (**high yield**).
