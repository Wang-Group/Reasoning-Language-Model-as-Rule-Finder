**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are Î±-amino dicarboxylic acids (amino acids with two carboxyl groups) result in high yield.**

  - *Examples*: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (glutamic acid), (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid)
  - *Rationale*: The presence of both an amino group and two carboxylic acid groups enhances coordination with metal centers, improving catalyst performance through chelation.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with amino or nitro groups directly attached to the ring result in high yield; those with aldehyde (formyl), methyl, or mercapto groups at the same position result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*: 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Amino and nitro groups can enhance electronic interactions with the catalyst, while formyl, methyl, and mercapto groups may hinder these interactions or cause steric hindrance.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers with heteroaromatic carboxylic acids, especially pyridine derivatives, result in high yield when the carboxylic acid is positioned to favor coordination.**

  - *Examples*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (nicotinic acid), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Rationale*: Heteroatoms like nitrogen can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length chains (6 to 8 carbons) result in high yield unless terminal functional groups interfere.**

  - *High Yield Example*: Octanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Medium-length chains provide optimal hydrophobic interactions without introducing steric hindrance from terminal groups.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with terminal amino or hydroxyl groups on long aliphatic chains result in low yield.**

  - *Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Terminal polar groups on long chains may interfere with catalyst binding or lead to undesirable interactions, reducing yield.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains, especially adjacent hydroxyls, result in high yield.**

  - *Example*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid)
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance solubility and can form hydrogen bonds with the catalyst, improving performance.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with mercapto (thiol) groups on aliphatic chains result in high yield; those with mercapto groups on aromatic rings result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiol groups can form strong bonds with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity, whereas aromatic thiols may lead to catalyst poisoning or deactivation.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains result in low yield due to their strong electron-withdrawing effects and hydrophobicity.**

  - *Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Perfluorinated groups decrease solubility and disrupt interactions with the catalyst, hindering the reaction.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with aldehyde (formyl) groups on aromatic rings result in low yield.**

  - *Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can coordinate with metal centers or undergo side reactions, deactivating the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with aromatic rings connected to carboxylic acids via aliphatic chains of four or more carbons result in high yield; similar modifiers with shorter chains result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility and appropriate spacing for optimal interactions with the catalyst, whereas shorter chains may cause steric hindrance or unfavorable electronic effects.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with bulky substituents directly attached to aromatic rings result in low yield due to steric hindrance.**

  - *Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Bulky groups can prevent effective interaction between the modifier and the catalyst's active sites.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing adjacent ketone or amide groups to the carboxylic acid result in low yield.**

  - *Examples*: 4-oxoheptanedioic acid, (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
  - *Rationale*: Ketone and amide groups near the carboxylic acid can chelate metal ions or interfere with catalytic activity, leading to reduced yield.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains, such as indole or pyrrole rings, result in high yield; those with simple aromatic side chains result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan)
  - *Low Yield Example*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine)
  - *Rationale*: Heteroaromatic rings can coordinate with metal centers and facilitate electron delocalization, enhancing reactivity, while simple aromatic rings lack these capabilities.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with polyglycol ether chains result in low yield due to their high flexibility and potential to interfere with catalyst binding.**

  - *Example*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
  - *Rationale*: Flexible ether chains can adopt conformations that hinder effective interaction with the catalyst, reducing yield.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with electron-rich heterocycles or conjugated keto groups adjacent to carboxylic acids result in high yield.**

  - *Examples*: 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Rationale*: Electron-rich heterocycles and conjugated keto groups can stabilize metal centers and enhance catalytic activity through favorable electronic interactions.
