- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing both amino (-NH₂) and carboxylic acid (-COOH) groups on short aliphatic chains (carbon chain length ≤ 5) tend to result in high yields.**
  - *Rationale*: Short-chain amino acids can coordinate effectively with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity.
  
- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position (e.g., nitro (-NO₂), bromomethyl (-CH₂Br)) tend to result in high yields.**
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, improving coordination to the metal center and facilitating electron transfer during catalysis.
  
- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde functional groups (-CHO) tend to result in low yields.**
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups may engage in side reactions or inhibit catalyst activity by coordinating too strongly to the metal center, blocking active sites.
  
- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains tend to result in low yields.**
  - *Rationale*: Fluorinated chains are highly electron-withdrawing and hydrophobic, which may disrupt optimal catalyst-modifier interactions and reduce solubility in the reaction medium.
  
- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing electron-rich nitrogen heterocycles (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole) directly attached to a carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yields.**
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen heterocycles can act as additional coordination sites, stabilizing the metal center and promoting catalytic activity.
  
- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with electron-donating groups at the para position (e.g., methyl (-CH₃), methoxy (-OCH₃)) tend to result in low yields.**
  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, weakening coordination to the metal center and potentially reducing catalyst efficiency.
  
- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing thiol groups (-SH) attached to short aliphatic chains tend to result in high yields, while those with thiol groups attached to aromatic rings tend to result in low yields.**
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols can form optimal interactions with the catalyst without causing steric hindrance, whereas aromatic thiols may bind too strongly or introduce steric effects that inhibit catalysis.
  
- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with long aliphatic chains (carbon chain length ≥ 7) substituted with polar groups (e.g., amino, hydroxy) tend to result in low yields.**
  - *Rationale*: Longer chains can introduce flexibility and steric bulk that disrupt effective catalyst-modifier interactions and may reduce catalyst accessibility.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing highly polar polyether chains (e.g., multiple ethoxy (-OCH₂CH₂-) units) tend to result in low yields.**
  - *Rationale*: Highly polar chains may increase solvation and mobility, reducing the effective concentration of the modifier at the catalyst surface.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing electron-rich heterocycles (e.g., indole in tryptophan) tend to result in high yields, while those with purely aromatic side chains (e.g., phenyl in phenylalanine) tend to result in low yields.**
  - *Rationale*: Electron-rich heterocycles can facilitate better coordination and electron transfer compared to simple aromatic rings.

The rule provides strong property insight, considering the coordination of amino acids with metal centers. It balances complexity by combining functional groups and has good coverage with multiple supporting data points.

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 2** is clear and effectively identifies modifiers with aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position. Modifiers 1 and 21 fit this rule and result in high yields, supporting the rule's validity. The property insight is adequate, explaining how increased acidity enhances coordination. The rule has appropriate complexity and satisfactory coverage.

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 3** is straightforward and clear, focusing on modifiers containing aldehyde groups leading to low yields. Modifiers 19 and 20 support this rule by resulting in low yields. The property insight is sound, addressing potential side reactions or inhibition of catalyst activity. While simple, the rule is effective and has sufficient coverage.

- **Comment 4**: **Rule 4** is clear but has limited coverage due to its specificity (perfluorinated alkyl chains). Modifier 14 supports the rule by showing low yield. The property insight is reasonable, considering the effects of highly electron-withdrawing and hydrophobic fluorinated chains. While the rule is clear and the rationale is acceptable, the coverage is narrow, and expanding the rule could enhance its applicability.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** is generally clear, identifying modifiers with electron-rich nitrogen heterocycles attached to a carboxylic acid group. Modifiers 16 and 22 support the rule with high yields, but modifier 12 contradicts it by resulting in a low yield. The property insight is good, but the rule may need refinement to account for exceptions. The complexity is appropriate, but the mixed data suggests the rule doesn't fully capture all influencing factors.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** is clear and identifies modifiers with electron-donating groups at the para position leading to low yields. Modifiers 23 and 30 support the rule with low yields, but modifier 7 contradicts it by resulting in a high yield.

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows for straightforward identification of modifiers that match the structural description—amino acids with short, non-aromatic side chains (carbon chain length ≤ 5), containing both amino and carboxyl groups. The data supports this rule, as all matching modifiers result in high yields. The physical-chemical rationale is sound, focusing on effective coordination with metal centers via amino and carboxyl groups. The rule effectively combines substructures and has good coverage with multiple supporting data points. Overall, Rule 1 scores highly on all criteria.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear in its specification of aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position leading to high yields. The rationale about increased acidity and improved coordination is logical and aligns with known chemical principles. The rule considers specific functional group combinations and substitution patterns, showcasing appropriate complexity. It is supported by at least two data points, satisfying the coverage criterion. Rule 2 is well-founded and scores well across all criteria.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 clearly states that modifiers containing aldehyde groups tend to result in low yields, which is directly supported by the data. The rationale that aldehyde groups may engage in side reactions or inhibit catalyst activity is reasonable. While the rule is simple, it is effective and sufficiently supported by two data points. Rule 3 meets the criteria for clarity, property insight, complexity, and coverage.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 provides a clear distinction between modifiers with thiol groups on short aliphatic chains (high yields) versus those attached directly to aromatic rings (low yields). The data aligns with this rule, and the rationale regarding optimal interactions and steric effects is convincing. The rule combines functional group identity with structural context, adding appropriate complexity. With two supporting data points, Rule 4 satisfies the coverage requirement and scores well on all criteria.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 distinguishes between modifiers with nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to carboxylic acid groups (high yields) and those where the heterocycle is further removed (low yields. While the rule is clear, there is an exception in the data: **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**, where the nitrogen heterocycle is connected via a butanoic chain, results in a high yield contrary to the rule's prediction. This exception challenges the rule's reliability and suggests that the structural relationship may not be the sole determinant of yield. Despite a reasonable rationale and appropriate complexity, the rule's predictive accuracy is compromised. Rule 5 scores lower on clarity and coverage due to this inconsistency.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear and effectively differentiates between amino acids with aromatic side chains containing electron-rich heterocycles (high yields) and those with simple aromatic side chains (low yields). The data supports this rule, with tryptophan yielding high results and phenylalanine yielding low results. The rationale is solid, based on electron transfer facilitation by electron-rich heterocycles. The rule combines specific functional groups and is supported by two data points, meeting the coverage criterion. Rule 6 scores well on all criteria.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 clearly states that modifiers with long aliphatic chains (carbon chain length ≥ 7) substituted with polar groups tend to result in low yields, whereas simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without polar substituents can result in high yields. The data supports this distinction. The rationale regarding steric bulk and disruption of catalyst-modifier interactions is sound. The rule demonstrates appropriate complexity by considering both chain length and substituent polarity. With multiple supporting data points, Rule 7 satisfies the coverage requirement and scores highly across the criteria.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 clearly identifies modifiers containing polyether chains as tending to result in low yields, which is supported by the data. The rationale about increased solvation and reduced effective concentration at the catalyst surface is plausible. The rule is specific in its focus on polyether chains, adding necessary complexity. With two data points supporting the rule, it meets the coverage criterion. Rule 8 scores well on all counts.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 states that modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl chains tend to result in low yields. However, it is supported by only one data point in the dataset—**2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**—which results in a low yield. While the rationale is reasonable, the rule falls short on the coverage criterion, as there are not at least two data points to support it. Due to insufficient data support, Rule 9 scores low on coverage and should be reconsidered or validated with additional data.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear in describing that modifiers containing aromatic rings with electron-donating groups connected via longer aliphatic chains (carbon chain length ≥ 4) to a carboxylic acid tend to result in high yields, while those with shorter chains tend to result in low yields. The data supports this, with high yields for longer chains and low yields for shorter ones. The rationale regarding spatial arrangement and effective interaction with the catalyst is logical. The rule combines multiple structural factors, adding complexity. With several data points supporting both aspects of the rule, it meets the coverage criterion and scores highly.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 clearly states that modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups attached directly to small aliphatic chains tend to result in high yields. The data supports this rule, and the rationale about enhanced hydrogen bonding and coordination is sound. The rule considers specific combinations of functional groups, contributing to complexity. With two supporting data points, it meets the minimum coverage criterion. Rule 11 scores well on all criteria.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to carboxylic acid groups (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole carboxylic acids) tend to result in high yields, while those where the heterocycle is further removed tend to result in low yields.**
  - *Rationale*: Direct attachment of nitrogen heterocycles enhances coordination with the metal center due to the lone pair on nitrogen, improving catalytic efficiency. Distance reduces this effect.
  - *Examples*:
    - **High Yield**:
      - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)
      - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing thiol groups (-SH) on short aliphatic chains (carbon chain length ≤ 3) tend to result in high yields, while thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings result in low yields.**
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols form favorable interactions with the catalyst without causing steric hindrance. Aromatic thiols may bind too strongly or interfere with active sites.
  - *Examples*:
    - **High Yield**:
      - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

  - *Examples*:
    - **High Yield**:
      - Octanoic acid
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
      - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
      - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl chains tend to result in low yields.**
  - *Rationale*: Perfluorinated chains are highly electron-withdrawing and hydrophobic, which can destabilize catalyst-modifier interactions and reduce solubility in the reaction medium.
  - *Example*:
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing polyether chains (e.g., multiple ethoxy (-OCH₂CH₂-) units) tend to result in low yields.**
  - *Rationale*: Highly polar polyether chains increase solvation and mobility, reducing effective concentration at the catalyst surface and hindering catalyst-modifier interactions.
  - *Example*:
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups attached to small aliphatic chains tend to result in high yields.**
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst, improving performance and stability.
  - *Example*:
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers where an electron-donating aromatic ring is connected to the carboxylic acid via a longer aliphatic chain (carbon chain length ≥ 4) tend to result in high yields, while shorter chains (carbon chain length ≤ 3) tend to result in low yields.**
  - *Rationale*: Longer chains allow the aromatic ring to interact favorably without steric hindrance, enhancing catalyst-modifier interactions. Shorter chains may not provide optimal spatial arrangement.
  - *Examples*:
    - **High Yield**:
      - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
      - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are acetamido derivatives of amino acids tend to result in low yields.**
  - *Rationale*: Acetamido groups may sterically hinder coordination sites or reduce the availability of functional groups necessary for optimal catalyst interaction.
  - *Example*:
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing methylsulfanyl (-S-CH₃) groups in the side chain of amino acids tend to result in low yields.**
  - *Rationale*: Methylsulfanyl groups may interfere with catalyst interactions due to steric hindrance or electronic effects.
  - *Example*:
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar substituents tend to result in high yields.**
  - *Rationale*: Unsubstituted aliphatic chains can interact favorably with the catalyst without introducing steric hindrance or competing coordination sites.
  - *Example*:
    - Octanoic acid

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing aromatic rings fused with oxygen-containing heterocycles (e.g., benzofuran derivatives) attached to carboxylic acid groups tend to result in high yields.**
  - *Rationale*: These structures may enhance electron delocalization and coordination with the metal center, improving catalytic activity.
  - *Example*:
    - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid

**Explanation and Considerations:**

- **Combination of Substructures**: The rules focus on how different functional groups and structural features combine to influence the yield. For instance, the combination of amino and carboxyl groups in amino acids (Rule 1), or the effect of electron-withdrawing/donating groups on aromatic carboxylic acids (Rules 2 and 3).

- **Physicochemical Properties**: The underlying principles involve electronic effects (e.g., electron-withdrawing/donating groups affecting acidity and coordination ability), steric factors (e.g., chain length and branching affecting steric hindrance), and coordination chemistry (e.g., ability of heteroatoms to interact with the metal center).

- **Predictive Clarity**: Each rule specifies whether modifiers fitting the description tend to result in high or low yields, providing clear guidelines for prediction.

- **Coverage and Balance**: The rules cover a broad range of modifiers from the dataset, including amino acids, aromatic compounds, aliphatic acids, and compounds with various functional groups. There is a balance between broader rules with higher coverage (e.g., Rules 1, 2, 3) and more specific rules that capture nuanced effects (e.g., Rules 9, 15).

- **Simplification and Refinement**: Overlapping and less predictive rules were consolidated or refined to improve their clarity and applicability. For example, Rules 2 and 3 distinguish between electron-withdrawing and electron-donating substituents on aromatic rings, providing a clear guideline based on substituent effects.

- **Exceptions and Special Cases**: Some compounds may not fit perfectly into the rules due to specific structural features or interactions (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid in Rule 2). These exceptions highlight the importance of considering the full molecular context when applying the rules.

    - **Example**:
      - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid — **Low Yield**

14. **Modifiers with bulky or multiple substituents on aromatic rings that can cause steric hindrance tend to result in low yields, unless compensatory factors enhance interaction.**

    - **Rationale**: Steric hindrance can impede the modifier's ability to coordinate effectively with the metal center.

    - **Example**:
      - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid — **High Yield** (Exception due to potential favorable electronic effects)

15. **Modifiers containing electron-rich heterocyclic aromatic rings fused with carbonyl groups tend to result in high yields.**

    - **Rationale**: Electron-rich heterocycles with carbonyl groups can provide multiple coordination sites and facilitate electron transfer, enhancing catalytic performance.

    - **Example**:
      - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid — **High Yield**

**End of Rules**

**Explanation and Considerations:**

- **Combination of Substructures**: The rules focus on how different functional groups and structural features combine to influence the yield. For instance, Rule 1 combines the presence of amino and carboxyl groups with short side chains in α-amino acids, emphasizing the importance of both functional groups and molecular size.

- **Physicochemical Properties**: The underlying principles involve electronic effects (e.g., electron-withdrawing/donating groups affecting acidity and coordination ability), steric factors (e.g., chain length and branching affecting steric hindrance), hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance, and coordination chemistry (e.g., ability of heteroatoms to interact with the metal center).

- **Predictive Clarity**: Each rule specifies whether modifiers fitting the description tend to result in high or low yields, providing clear guidelines for prediction.

- **Coverage and Balance**: The rules cover a broad range of modifiers from the dataset, including amino acids, aromatic compounds, aliphatic acids, and compounds with various functional groups. There is a balance between broader rules with higher coverage (e.g., Rules 1, 2, 3) and more specific rules that capture nuanced effects (e.g., Rules 7, 13).

- **Refinement of Current Rules**: The new set of rules refines and consolidates the current rules, removing overlaps and enhancing clarity. Terrible or redundant rules have been abandoned or integrated into more comprehensive ones, as advised.

- **Exceptions and Special Cases**: Some compounds may not fit perfectly into the rules due to specific structural features or interactions (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid in Rule 4 and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid in Rule 3). These exceptions highlight the complexity of chemical interactions and the importance of considering the full molecular context when applying the rules.

  Rule 8 indicates that modifiers with flexible polyether chains result in low yields due to steric and solvation effects. The rationale provides adequate insight into how these features hinder coordination. The rule considers complex structural elements, fulfilling the complexity criterion. However, with only one example (2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid), coverage is limited. Additional examples would enhance the rule's balance and applicability.

- **Comment 9**:

  Rule 9 specifies that perfluorinated alkyl chain modifiers lead to low yields. The rationale about electron-withdrawing effects and coordination issues is sound. Complexity is satisfactory, focusing on the presence of perfluorinated chains. Coverage is limited with only one example (nonafluoropentanoic acid). More data points would strengthen the rule's coverage and balance.

- **Comment 10**:

  Rule 10 clearly states that amino acids with hydrophobic aromatic side chains lacking coordinating groups result in low yields. The rationale is logical, explaining the minimal impact on catalytic activity. The rule addresses complexity by combining amino acid structure with side-chain properties. Supported by Phenylalanine as an example and Tryptophan as a counterexample, coverage is acceptable. The rule maintains a good balance.

- **Comment 11**:

  Rule 11 asserts that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains yield high results. The rationale about coordination through hydroxyl groups is valid. Complexity is present by considering polyol functionality. Coverage is limited to one example (Gluconic acid). Including additional examples would improve coverage and balance.

- **Comment 12**:

  Rule 12 highlights that N-acylated amino acids result in low yields due to decreased coordination. The rationale provides clear property insight. Complexity is adequate, focusing on the N-acylation of amino acids. Coverage is minimal with only one example (6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid). More supporting data would enhance the rule's effectiveness.

- **Comment 13**:

  Rule 13 specifies that thiol groups attached to aromatic rings lead to low yields. The rationale regarding potential catalyst interference is reasonable. The rule meets complexity requirements by combining thiol functionality with aromatic structures. With limited examples (4-sulfanylbenzoic acid and a counterexample), coverage is modest. Additional data would improve balance.

- **Comment 14**:

  Rule 14 states that electron-rich aromatic rings with methoxy groups connected via aliphatic chains result in high yields. The rationale is plausible but could benefit from deeper insight into how methoxy groups enhance π-interactions. Complexity is present, but coverage is limited to one example (4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid). More examples would strengthen coverage and balance.

- **Comment 15**:

  Rule 15 clearly indicates that modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups on aliphatic chains lead to low yields. The rationale about side reactions and hindrance of catalysis is solid. The rule demonstrates appropriate complexity by considering both functional groups and their position. Supported by two examples (4-oxoheptanedioic acid and 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid), it satisfies coverage and maintains good balance.

    - **Examples**:
      - 4-formylbenzoic acid — **Low Yield**
      - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid — **Low Yield**

12. **Modifiers that are N-acylated amino acids tend to result in low yields due to reduced coordination ability of the amino group.**

    - **Rationale**: Acylation blocks the amino group, preventing it from coordinating with the metal center and diminishing catalytic enhancement.

    - **Example**:
      - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid — **Low Yield**

13. **Modifiers with thiol groups attached to aliphatic chains tend to result in high yields, whereas those attached to aromatic rings tend to result in low yields.**

**Explanation and Considerations:**

- **Combination of Functional Groups**: Each rule highlights combinations of functional groups, such as amino and carboxylic acid groups, electron-withdrawing substituents on aromatic rings, or hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on aliphatic chains. These combinations are crucial for understanding how different modifiers interact with the catalyst.

- **Physicochemical Properties**: The rules are grounded in chemical principles like electron donation/withdrawal, steric hindrance, coordination chemistry, and hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions. For example, electron-withdrawing groups enhance acidity and coordination ability, while steric hindrance from long chains can reduce effectiveness.

- **Predictive Clarity**: Each rule clearly predicts the expected yield outcome (high or low) for modifiers fitting the described structural features. This allows for the assessment of new modifiers based on their structures.

- **Coverage and Balance**: The rules cover a broad range of the dataset, addressing various types of modifiers, including amino acids, aromatic carboxylic acids, aliphatic acids with different substituents, and heteroaromatic compounds. The balance between simple and complex rules ensures wide applicability while capturing nuanced effects.

- **Examples and Counterexamples**: Providing both examples and counterexamples for each rule illustrates the applicability and limits of the rule, reinforcing its validity and helping to avoid misclassification.

- **Abandoning and Refining Rules**: Less effective or redundant rules from previous iterations have been refined or omitted. For instance, rules that were overly specific or did not significantly contribute to understanding the relationship between structure and yield were consolidated into more comprehensive rules.

     - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid — **Low Yield** (Hydroxy group is electron-donating)

3. **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino (-NH₂) or thiol (-SH) groups on short chains (C3–C5) tend to result in high yields; those with longer chains (≥ C7) result in low yields.**

   - **Rationale**: Short chains allow effective coordination without significant steric hindrance, enhancing catalyst interaction. Longer chains introduce steric hindrance, reducing coordination efficiency.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - 5-aminopentanoic acid — **High Yield**
     - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid — **High Yield**

   - **Counterexamples (Low Yield)**:
     - 7-aminoheptanoic acid — **Low Yield**
     - 8-aminooctanoic acid — **Low Yield**

4. **Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the nitrogen atom adjacent or ortho to the carboxyl group tend to result in high yields. Those with the nitrogen atom distant from the carboxyl group tend to result in low yields.**

   - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms positioned near the carboxyl group can serve as additional coordination sites, forming stable chelate rings with the metal center. Distant nitrogen atoms are less effective in coordination.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid) — **High Yield**
     - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid — **High Yield**

5. **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted at the para position with aldehyde (-CHO) groups tend to result in low yields due to potential side reactions and interfering coordination.**

   - **Rationale**: Aldehyde groups can form strong complexes with the metal center or participate in side reactions, inhibiting the catalytic cycle.

   - **Examples**:
     - 4-formylbenzoic acid — **Low Yield**
     - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid — **Low Yield**

6. **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (polyols) on aliphatic chains tend to result in high yields due to enhanced coordination and hydrogen bonding.**

   - **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can form hydrogen bonds and coordinate with the metal center, improving catalyst interaction and stability.

   - **Example**:
     - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid) — **High Yield**

7. **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains tend to result in low yields due to strong electron-withdrawing effects and poor coordination ability.**

   - **Rationale**: Highly electronegative fluorine atoms reduce electron density on the carboxylate, hindering coordination with the metal center and potentially affecting solubility.

   - **Example**:
     - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid — **Low Yield**

8. **Modifiers containing flexible polyether chains (e.g., multiple ethoxy (-OCH₂CH₂-) units) tend to result in low yields due to steric hindrance and solvation effects.**

   - **Rationale**: Polyether chains can interfere with effective coordination by occupying space around the metal center and altering the local environment.

   - **Example**:
     - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid — **Low Yield**

9. **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms capable of coordination, such as indole nitrogen, tend to result in high yields. Those lacking heteroatoms in the side chain tend to result in low yields.**

   - **Rationale**: Heteroatoms in aromatic side chains can participate in additional coordination with the metal center, enhancing catalyst stability.

   - **Example (High Yield)**:
     - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan) — **High Yield**

   - **Counterexample (Low Yield)**:
     - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine) — **Low Yield**

10. **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids without polar substituents tend to result in high yields when of medium chain length (C6–C8), while those with polar substituents or significantly longer chains tend to result in low yields.**

    - **Rationale**: Optimal chain length provides favorable hydrophobic interactions without steric hindrance or interference from polar groups.

    - **Example (High Yield)**:
      - Octanoic acid — **High Yield**

    - **Counterexample (Low Yield)**:
      - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid — **Low Yield** (Hydroxyl group may disrupt hydrophobic interactions)

11. **Modifiers that are N-acylated amino acids tend to result in low yields due to reduced coordination ability of the amino group.**

    - **Rationale**: Acylation blocks the amino group, preventing it from coordinating with the metal center and diminishing catalytic enhancement.

    - **Example**:
      - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid — **Low Yield**

12. **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol (-SH) groups attached to the aromatic ring tend to result in low yields, while those with thiol groups on aliphatic chains result in high yields.**

    - **Rationale**: Thiol groups on aromatic rings may bind too strongly or interfere with the catalyst, whereas thiol groups on aliphatic chains provide additional coordination without significant steric hindrance.

    - **Examples**:
      - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid — **High Yield**
      - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid — **Low Yield**

13. **Modifiers with methoxy (-OCH₃) substituted aromatic rings connected via short aliphatic chains to carboxylic acid groups tend to result in high yields.**

    - **Rationale**: Methoxy groups increase electron density and can facilitate π-π interactions or coordination with the metal center, enhancing catalyst performance.

    - **Example**:
      - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid — **High Yield**

14. **Modifiers with ketone (C=O) groups on aliphatic chains adjacent to the carboxyl group tend to result in low yields due to potential chelation that disrupts optimal catalyst geometry.**

    - **Rationale**: Ketone groups may coordinate with the metal center in a way that interferes with the active catalytic site.

    - **Example**:
      - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid — **Low Yield**

15. **Modifiers with substituted aromatic rings capable of forming intramolecular hydrogen bonds or chelating with the metal center enhance yield, especially when such groups are ortho to the carboxyl group.**

    - **Rationale**: Intramolecular interactions can stabilize the modifier-metal complex, improving catalytic efficiency.

    - **Example**:
      - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid — **High Yield**

     - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* — **Low Yield**

---

10. **Modifiers with bulky side chains or groups that increase steric hindrance near the coordinating sites tend to result in low yields due to difficulty in metal complex formation.**

    - **Rationale**: Bulky groups near coordination sites hinder the approach and binding of metal ions, decreasing catalytic activity.

    - **Examples**:
      - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* — **Low Yield** (Bulky pyridyl group may obstruct coordination)
      - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid* — **Low Yield** (Bulky polyether chain introduces steric hindrance)

---

11. **Modifiers with aldehyde groups attached to the aromatic ring tend to result in low yields due to possible side reactions or interference with coordination.**

---

13. **Modifiers containing electron-donating groups capable of forming additional coordination bonds (e.g., methoxy groups on an extended chain) tend to result in high yields due to enhanced interaction with the metal center.**

    - **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups increase electron density, facilitating stronger coordination with the metal ion.

    - **Example**:
      - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid* — **High Yield**

    - **Counterexample**:
      - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid* — **Low Yield** (Despite methoxy groups, the bulky chain may hinder coordination)

---

14. **Modifiers with functional groups that can participate in resonance stabilization of the coordinating carboxylate group tend to result in high yields due to increased stability of the metal complex.**

    - **Rationale**: Resonance stabilization can delocalize charge and enhance the binding affinity of the coordinating groups.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear in identifying heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with a heteroatom adjacent to the carboxyl group as high-yield modifiers. The rationale appropriately explains the chelation involving the heteroatom and carboxylate. The rule's complexity arises from considering both heteroaromatic rings and positional relationships of functional groups. Supported by data points and counterexamples, the rule exhibits good coverage.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 effectively communicates that long aliphatic chains with polar substituents lead to low yields due to steric hindrance and reduced coordination efficiency. The rationale is clear and provides meaningful chemical insight. The rule considers chain length and presence of polar groups, demonstrating complexity. It is supported by multiple examples and a counterexample from the dataset, ensuring adequate coverage.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear in highlighting that α-amino acids with additional coordinating groups in the side chain yield high results, even if bulky. The rationale underscores the compensating effect of extra coordination sites. The rule's complexity is evident in combining amino acid structures with side-chain functionalities. While supported by an example and a counterexample, the coverage is limited, and additional data points would strengthen it.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 clearly states that electron-withdrawing groups on the carboxylic acid lead to low yields due to decreased electron density affecting coordination. The rationale is sound, but the rule's coverage is limited to a single example, reducing its overall strength. Including more data points would improve its robustness.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 indicates that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group result in high yields, attributing this to increased coordination and hydrogen bonding. The rationale is valid, and the rule has appropriate complexity. However, coverage is limited, with only one supporting example, suggesting the need for more data to confirm its generality.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 specifies that thiol groups on short aliphatic chains enhance yield due to sulfur's strong coordinating ability. The rationale is chemically sound. The rule is clear and combines functional group presence with chain length, adding complexity. Coverage is modest, with one example and a counterexample, indicating a need for additional supporting data.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear in stating that N-acylated amino acids or modifiers with blocked primary amino groups result in low yields due to fewer available coordination sites. The rationale is logical. However, the rule lacks sufficient coverage, being supported by only one example. More data points are necessary to validate this rule fully.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 addresses the impact of steric hindrance from bulky side chains near coordinating sites on yield. The rationale is appropriate, highlighting how steric factors impede metal complex formation. The rule combines considerations of sterics and functional group placement, adding complexity. It is well-supported by multiple examples and counterexamples, demonstrating good coverage.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 clearly explains that modifiers with aldehyde groups attached to aromatic rings tend to result in low yields due to side reactions or interference with coordination. The rationale is plausible. While the rule has adequate clarity, its coverage is limited to two examples, suggesting that additional data would enhance its credibility.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 states that medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar substituents tend to yield high results due to minimal steric hindrance. The rationale is clear, but the rule's coverage is limited, with one example and one counterexample. More data points are needed to confirm the rule's general applicability.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 discusses the positive effect of electron-donating groups capable of forming additional coordination bonds on yield. The rationale is solid, focusing on enhanced metal interaction. The rule has complexity by considering specific functional groups and their electronic effects. However, coverage is limited to one example and one counterexample, indicating the need for further data.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 highlights that functional groups participating in resonance stabilization of the carboxylate increase yield due to greater complex stability. The rationale is chemically valid, but the rule may lack practical clarity for easy application. Coverage is minimal, with only one example supporting it, necessitating more data to substantiate the rule.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 suggests that modifiers with side chains capable of π-π stacking interactions can enhance yield if they do not interfere with coordination sites. The rationale is reasonable, but the rule lacks clarity in identifying applicable modifiers. Coverage is limited, with one example and one counterexample, indicating that more evidence is required to verify the rule's validity.

     - *4-nitrobenzoic acid* — **High Yield**
     - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid* — **High Yield**

   - **Counterexample**:
     - *4-formylbenzoic acid* — **Low Yield** (Aldehyde groups can interfere with coordination or undergo side reactions)

---

9. **Modifiers that are N-acylated amino acids tend to result in low yields due to reduced availability of the amino group for coordination.**

   - **Rationale**: Acylation blocks the amino group, preventing it from coordinating with the metal center, thereby reducing the overall chelation capability.

   - **Example**:
     - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* — **Low Yield**

---

10. **Modifiers with bulky or rigid structures that create steric hindrance near the coordinating groups tend to result in low yields due to difficulty in metal complex formation.**

    - **Rationale**: Bulky groups or rigid linkers can prevent the effective approach and binding of the metal ion to the coordinating sites.

    - **Examples**:
      - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* — **Low Yield**
      - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid* — **Low Yield**

    - **Examples**:
      - *4-formylbenzoic acid* — **Low Yield**
      - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid* — **Low Yield**

---

13. **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing coordinating heterocycles (e.g., indole ring in tryptophan) tend to result in high yields due to additional coordination sites.**

    - **Rationale**: Heterocyclic nitrogen atoms in side chains can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalyst stability and activity.

    - **Example**:
      - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (Tryptophan) — **High Yield**

    - **Counterexample**:
      - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine) — **Low Yield** (Phenyl group lacks coordinating nitrogen)

---

14. **Modifiers with flexible aliphatic linkers connecting the carboxylate to additional coordinating groups tend to result in high yields due to the ability to adopt favorable coordination geometries.**

    - **Rationale**: Flexibility allows the molecule to adjust and optimize interactions with the metal center.

    - **Examples**:
      - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid* — **High Yield**
      - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid* — **High Yield**

    - **Counterexample**:
      - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* — **Low Yield** (Shorter linker may limit flexibility)

---

15. **Modifiers with long, flexible, hydrophilic chains (e.g., polyether chains) tend to result in low yields due to entropic penalties and steric hindrance reducing effective coordination.**

    - **Rationale**: Extended hydrophilic chains can introduce steric bulk and decrease the effective concentration of coordinating groups near the metal center.

    - **Example**:
      - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid* — **Low Yield**

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (having an amino group and two carboxylic acid groups on adjacent carbons) tend to result in high yields.**

   - **Rationale**: The amino and dicarboxylic acid groups can chelate the metal center effectively, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity.

   - **Examples**:
     - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid) — **High Yield**
     - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid) — **High Yield**

   - **Counterexamples**:
     - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine) — **Low Yield** (Lacks a second carboxylic acid group)

---

2. **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted at the para position with electron-donating groups capable of metal coordination (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, bromomethyl) tend to result in high yields.**

   - **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups at the para position enhance the electron density of the carboxylate and provide additional coordination sites, improving metal binding.

   - **Examples**:
     - *4-aminobenzoic acid* — **High Yield**
     - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid* — **High Yield**
     - *4-nitrobenzoic acid* — **High Yield** (Though nitro is electron-withdrawing, its ability to coordinate can enhance metal binding)

   - **Counterexamples**:
     - *4-methylbenzoic acid* — **Low Yield** (Methyl group is less effective in coordination)
     - *4-formylbenzoic acid* — **Low Yield** (Formyl group can interfere with coordination)

---

3. **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with unbranched chains of medium length (5-8 carbons) and lacking additional polar substituents tend to result in high yields.**

   - **Rationale**: Such acids can coordinate without steric hindrance or electronic interference from other groups, promoting efficient catalyst formation.

   - **Example**:
     - *Octanoic acid* — **High Yield**

   - **Counterexamples**:
     - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* — **Low Yield** (Hydroxyl group introduces polarity)
     - *7-aminoheptanoic acid* — **Low Yield** (Amino group can interfere with coordination)

---

4. **Modifiers containing both a thiol (-SH) group and a carboxylic acid on a short aliphatic chain tend to result in high yields.**

   - **Rationale**: Thiol and carboxylate groups can form strong coordination bonds with metals, enhancing catalyst activity.

   - **Example**:
     - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid* — **High Yield**

   - **Counterexample**:
     - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* — **Low Yield** (Aromatic ring may reduce thiol accessibility)

---

5. **Modifiers that are polyhydroxylated carboxylic acids (carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups) tend to result in high yields.**

   - **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can engage in additional hydrogen bonding and coordination, stabilizing the metal complex.

   - **Examples**:
     - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid) — **High Yield**
     - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid* — **High Yield**

---

6. **Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms in the ring adjacent to the carboxylate group tend to result in high yields.**

   - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms can act as additional coordination sites, enhancing metal-ligand interactions.

   - **Examples**:
     - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid) — **High Yield**
     - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid* — **High Yield**
     - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid* — **High Yield**

   - **Counterexample**:
     - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* — **Low Yield** (Nitrogen is not adjacent to the carboxylate)

---

7. **Modifiers that are amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains capable of metal coordination tend to result in high yields.**

   - **Rationale**: Heteroaromatic side chains can provide additional coordination sites, enhancing catalyst effectiveness.

   - **Example**:
     - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (Tryptophan) — **High Yield**

   - **Counterexample**:
     - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine) — **Low Yield** (Phenyl group lacks coordination ability)

---

8. **Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., fluorinated chains, formyl groups) near the carboxylate tend to result in low yields.**

   - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups reduce the electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, weakening metal coordination.

   - **Examples**:
     - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid* — **Low Yield**
     - *4-formylbenzoic acid* — **Low Yield**

---

9. **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids linked via flexible aliphatic chains to additional coordinating groups tend to result in high yields if the chain length allows effective coordination.**

   - **Rationale**: Optimal chain length permits the coordinating group to interact with the metal center, enhancing catalyst activity.

   - **Examples**:
     - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid* — **High Yield**
     - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid* — **High Yield**

   - **Counterexample**:
     - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* — **Low Yield** (Shorter chain may prevent effective coordination)

---

10. **Modifiers that are N-acylated amino acids or have blocked amino groups tend to result in low yields due to decreased coordination capacity.**

    - **Rationale**: Acylation hinders the amino group's ability to coordinate with the metal.

    - **Example**:
      - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* — **Low Yield**

---

11. **Modifiers with long, flexible ether chains adjacent to the carboxylate group tend to result in low yields.**

    - **Rationale**: Ether chains can increase flexibility and solubility but may reduce effective metal coordination due to steric hindrance or conformational freedom.

    - **Example**:
      - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid* — **Low Yield**

---

12. **Modifiers containing carbonyl groups within the aliphatic chain near the carboxylate tend to result in low yields.**

    - **Rationale**: Internal carbonyl groups can interfere with metal coordination by competing for binding or altering electronic properties.

    - **Example**:
      - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid* — **Low Yield**

---

13. **Modifiers with polar substituents (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) on long aliphatic chains tend to result in low yields due to steric and electronic effects.**

    - **Rationale**: Polar groups distant from the carboxylate can introduce steric hindrance and disrupt optimal metal coordination.

    - **Examples**:
      - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* — **Low Yield**
      - *8-aminooctanoic acid* — **Low Yield**

---

14. **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted at positions that hinder coordination (e.g., ortho-substitution) tend to result in low yields.**

    - **Rationale**: Substituents at positions adjacent to the carboxylate can create steric hindrance, reducing metal binding efficiency.

    - **Example**:
      - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid* — **Low Yield** (Ortho-formyl and hydroxyl groups may hinder coordination)

---

15. **Modifiers with bulky electron-donating groups that do not effectively participate in coordination tend to result in low yields.**

    - **Rationale**: Bulky groups can prevent the modifier from approaching the metal center closely enough for effective coordination.

    - **Example**:
      - *4-methylbenzoic acid* — **Low Yield**
