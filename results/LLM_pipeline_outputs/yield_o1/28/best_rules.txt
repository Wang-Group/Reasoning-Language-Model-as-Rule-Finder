**Start of Rules**

1. **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with acidic side chains containing additional carboxylic acid groups tend to result in high yields.**

   - **Rationale**: The presence of extra carboxylic acid groups enhances chelation with the metal center, improving catalytic activity through stable coordination.

   - **Examples**:
     - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid) — **High Yield**
     - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid) — **High Yield**

   - **Counterexample**:
     - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine) — **Low Yield** (Lacks additional carboxyl group for effective chelation)

2. **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted at the para position with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro (-NO₂), bromomethyl (-CH₂Br)) tend to result in high yields.**

   - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing its ability to coordinate with the metal center and facilitate electron transfer during catalysis.

   - **Examples**:
     - 4-nitrobenzoic acid — **High Yield**
     - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid — **High Yield**

   - **Counterexamples**:
     - 4-methylbenzoic acid — **Low Yield** (Methyl group is electron-donating)
     - 4-formylbenzoic acid — **Low Yield** (Aldehyde may interfere with coordination)

3. **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino (-NH₂) or thiol (-SH) groups located on short (C3–C5) chains tend to result in high yields, while the same groups on longer chains (≥ C7) tend to result in low yields.**

   - **Rationale**: Short chains allow effective coordination without significant steric hindrance, enhancing catalyst interaction. Longer chains increase steric hindrance, reducing coordination efficiency.

   - **Examples (High Yield)**:
     - 5-aminopentanoic acid — **High Yield**
     - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid — **High Yield**

   - **Counterexamples (Low Yield)**:
     - 7-aminoheptanoic acid — **Low Yield**
     - 8-aminooctanoic acid — **Low Yield**

4. **Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic carboxylic acids, particularly pyridine derivatives with the nitrogen atom adjacent or ortho to the carboxyl group, tend to result in high yields.**

   - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms positioned near the carboxyl group can serve as additional coordination sites, forming stable chelate rings with the metal center and enhancing catalytic stability.

   - **Examples**:
     - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid) — **High Yield**
     - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid — **High Yield**

   - **Counterexample**:
     - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid — **Low Yield** (Nitrogen is further from the carboxyl group, reducing chelation efficiency)

5. **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted at the para position with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl (-CH₃), methoxy (-OCH₃), hydroxy (-OH)) tend to result in low yields.**

   - **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, reducing its ability to effectively coordinate with the metal center.

   - **Examples**:
     - 4-methylbenzoic acid — **Low Yield**
     - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid — **Low Yield**

6. **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (polyols) on aliphatic chains tend to result in high yields due to enhanced coordination and hydrogen bonding.**

   - **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can form hydrogen bonds and coordinate with the metal center, improving catalyst interaction and stability.

   - **Example**:
     - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid) — **High Yield**

7. **Modifiers with aldehyde (-CHO) groups attached to aromatic rings tend to result in low yields due to potential side reactions and strong metal binding that interferes with catalysis.**

   - **Rationale**: Aldehyde groups can form strong complexes with the metal center or participate in side reactions, inhibiting the catalytic cycle.

   - **Examples**:
     - 4-formylbenzoic acid — **Low Yield**
     - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid — **Low Yield**

8. **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains tend to result in low yields due to strong electron-withdrawing effects and poor coordination ability.**

   - **Rationale**: Highly electronegative fluorine atoms reduce electron density, hindering coordination with the metal center and potentially affecting solubility.

   - **Example**:
     - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid — **Low Yield**

9. **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms capable of coordination, such as indole nitrogen, tend to result in high yields.**

   - **Rationale**: Heteroatoms in aromatic side chains can participate in additional coordination with the metal center, enhancing catalyst stability.

   - **Example**:
     - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan) — **High Yield**

   - **Counterexample**:
     - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine) — **Low Yield** (Lacks coordinating heteroatoms in the side chain)

10. **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol (-SH) groups attached to the aromatic ring tend to result in low yields, while those with thiol groups on aliphatic chains result in high yields.**

    - **Rationale**: Thiol groups on aromatic rings may bind too strongly or interfere with the catalyst, whereas thiol groups on aliphatic chains provide additional coordination without significant steric hindrance.

    - **Examples**:
      - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid — **High Yield**
      - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid — **Low Yield**

11. **Modifiers with long aliphatic chains (≥ C7) without polar substituents tend to result in variable yields depending on chain length and steric factors.**

    - **Rationale**: Long hydrophobic chains may enhance interactions with the catalyst surface but can also introduce steric hindrance, affecting catalytic efficiency.

    - **Examples**:
      - Octanoic acid — **High Yield** (Optimal chain length without polar groups)
      - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid — **Low Yield** (Polar hydroxyl group may disrupt hydrophobic interactions)

12. **Modifiers containing flexible polyether chains (e.g., multiple ethoxy (-OCH₂CH₂-) units) tend to result in low yields due to steric hindrance and solvation effects.**

    - **Rationale**: Polyether chains can interfere with effective coordination by occupying space around the metal center and altering the local environment.

    - **Example**:
      - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid — **Low Yield**

13. **Modifiers that are N-acylated amino acids tend to result in low yields due to reduced coordination ability of the amino group.**

    - **Rationale**: Acylation blocks the amino group, preventing it from coordinating with the metal center and diminishing catalytic enhancement.

    - **Example**:
      - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid — **Low Yield**

14. **Modifiers with methoxy (-OCH₃) substituted aromatic rings connected via short aliphatic chains to carboxylic acid groups tend to result in high yields.**

    - **Rationale**: Methoxy groups increase electron density and can facilitate π-π interactions or coordination with the metal center, enhancing catalyst performance.

    - **Example**:
      - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid — **High Yield**

15. **Modifiers with ketone (C=O) groups on aliphatic chains tend to result in low yields due to potential chelation that disrupts optimal catalyst geometry.**

    - **Rationale**: Ketone groups may coordinate with the metal center in a way that interferes with the active catalytic site.

    - **Example**:
      - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid — **Low Yield**
