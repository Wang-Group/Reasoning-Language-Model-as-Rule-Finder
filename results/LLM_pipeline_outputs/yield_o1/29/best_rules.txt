After analyzing the dataset and considering the chemical properties of the modifiers, here are the rules that describe the relationship between molecular modifiers and the yield of the reaction:

**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with carboxylic acid side chains**, such as **aspartic acid** and **glutamic acid**, result in a **high yield**. The presence of multiple carboxylate groups adjacent to an amino group enhances coordination with the metal center through bidentate chelation.

   - Examples:
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, such as **nitro** or **bromomethyl** groups, result in a **high yield**. Electron-withdrawing substituents increase the acidity of the carboxylate, enhancing metal coordination by stabilizing the negative charge.

   - Examples:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with amino groups at the para position** result in a **high yield**. The amino group can act as an additional coordination site, forming stronger complexes with the metal center.

   - Example:
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms within the ring** result in a **high yield**. The nitrogen atoms serve as additional coordination sites, enhancing metal-ligand interactions.

   - Examples:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with proximal functional groups (amino, hydroxyl, or thiol) within three carbons of the carboxylate** result in a **high yield**. These functional groups enhance chelation with the metal center by forming stable bidentate ligands.

   - Examples:
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with adjacent hydroxyl or carbonyl groups capable of chelation** result in a **high yield**. The adjacent functional groups facilitate the formation of stable chelate rings with the metal center.

   - Examples:
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
     - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) groups at the ortho or para position** result in a **low yield**. The aldehyde groups may participate in side reactions or hinder metal coordination due to steric effects.

   - Examples:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with distal functional groups (more than three carbons away from the carboxylate)** result in a **low yield**. The increased flexibility and distance reduce effective chelation with the metal center.

   - Examples:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position** (excluding amino groups) result in a **low yield**. Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylate, weakening coordination with the metal center.

   - Examples:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with bulky, sterically hindering groups adjacent to the carboxylate and lack additional coordinating sites** result in a **low yield**. Steric hindrance interferes with effective metal coordination.

    - Examples:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with perfluorinated alkyl chains** result in a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms decreases the basicity of the carboxylate oxygen, weakening metal coordination.

    - Example:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **long polyether chains attached to the carboxylate group** result in a **low yield**. The flexibility and steric bulk of the ether chains reduce effective coordination due to entropic factors and steric hindrance.

    - Example:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length (6-8 carbons) unbranched hydrocarbon chains without interfering functional groups** result in a **high yield**. The hydrophobic chains may enhance interactions with the catalyst framework.

    - Example:
      - **Octanoic acid**

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with bulky side chains lacking additional coordinating groups**, such as aromatic rings without coordinating heteroatoms, result in a **low yield** due to steric hindrance.

    - Examples:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **thiol-containing aromatic carboxylic acids** result in a **high yield**. Thiol groups form strong bonds with metals, enhancing catalyst stability.

    - Example:
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**
