**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Short-Chain Aliphatic Amino Acids Yield High; Longer-Chain Analogs Yield Low**

  Modifiers that are aliphatic amino acids with a carbon chain length of 4 or 5 carbons and an amino group at the α-position result in high yield. Longer-chain amino acids (6 carbons or more) yield low. This may be due to optimal coordination and minimal steric hindrance with the catalyst for shorter chains.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)
      - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)
      - 5-aminopentanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:**
      - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
      - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
      - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 2**: **Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing, Metal-Coordinating Groups Yield High; Electron-Donating or Non-Coordinating Groups Yield Low**

  Modifiers that are benzoic acid derivatives with electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position capable of coordinating with metal centers (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl) result in high yield. Those with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy) or non-coordinating substituents yield low. Coordination enhances interaction with the catalyst.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 4-aminobenzoic acid
      - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
      - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-methylbenzoic acid
      - 4-formylbenzoic acid
      - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 3**: **Nitrogen-Containing Heterocyclic Carboxylic Acids Yield High**

  Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids with nitrogen-containing aromatic rings, such as pyridine and pyrazole carboxylic acids, result in high yield. Their ability to coordinate with metal centers enhances catalytic activity.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Niacin)
      - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
      - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 4**: **Straight-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Yield High; Addition of Polar Functional Groups Lowers Yield**

  Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups result in high yield. Introducing polar groups like hydroxyl or amino decreases the yield, potentially due to altered solubility or interference with catalyst coordination.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - Octanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
      - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
      - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups on Short Chains Yield High; Single Hydroxyl on Long Chains Yields Low**

  Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups on short aliphatic chains enhance solubility and interaction with the catalyst, resulting in high yield. A single hydroxyl group on a longer chain does not have the same effect and yields low.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid

- **Rule 6**: **Aliphatic Thiol Groups Yield High; Aromatic Thiol Groups Yield Low**

  Modifiers with thiol (–SH) groups on aliphatic chains result in high yield, likely due to effective coordination with the metal catalyst. Thiol groups attached to aromatic rings may lead to catalyst poisoning or deactivation, yielding low.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 7**: **Highly Fluorinated Aliphatic Chains Yield Low**

  Modifiers with multiple fluorine atoms in aliphatic chains result in low yield. The strong electronegativity and hydrophobic nature of fluorinated chains can reduce interactions with the catalyst and hinder the reaction.

  *Example:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with Carbonyl Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acids Yield Low**

  Modifiers possessing aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acids tend to yield low. These carbonyl groups might chelate with the metal catalyst or participate in side reactions, reducing catalytic efficiency.

  *Examples:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-formylbenzoic acid
      - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
      - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with Extended Conjugation Involving Heterocycles Yield High**

  Modifiers containing extended conjugated systems with oxygen or nitrogen heterocycles enhance electron delocalization and coordination with the catalyst, resulting in high yield.

  *Example:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 10**: **Hydroxyphenyl Groups Connected by Long Aliphatic Chains Yield High; Short Chains Yield Low**

  Modifiers with hydroxyphenyl groups linked by aliphatic chains of five or more carbons to a carboxylic acid yield high, possibly due to increased flexibility and optimal interaction with the catalyst. Shorter chains may not provide this advantage.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with Polyether Chains Yield Low**

  Modifiers containing polyether chains, such as methoxyethoxy units, result in low yield. These moieties may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorable solvation effects, impeding effective catalyst interaction.

  *Example:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid

- **Rule 12**: **Bulky Non-Coordinating Substituents Yield Low**

  Modifiers with bulky substituents that cannot effectively coordinate with the metal catalyst lead to low yield. Steric hindrance may prevent proper interaction with the active sites.

  *Examples:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
      - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 13**: **Aromatic Rings with Amino Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acids Yield High**

  Modifiers where an amino group is directly attached to an aromatic ring adjacent to a carboxylic acid enhance metal coordination, resulting in high yield.

  *Example:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 4-aminobenzoic acid

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with Methoxy Groups Without Coordinating Substituents Yield Low**

  Modifiers featuring methoxy groups attached to aromatic rings or aliphatic chains yield low if they lack other coordinating groups. Methoxy groups are electron-donating but do not coordinate effectively with metal catalysts.

  *Examples:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
      - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid (Note: Despite containing methoxy groups, this compound yields high, possibly due to other contributing factors.)

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with Fused Nitrogen Heterocyclic Aromatic Systems Yield High**

  Modifiers containing fused aromatic systems with nitrogen heterocycles (e.g., indole ring in tryptophan) can delocalize electrons and coordinate with metal centers effectively, yielding high.

  *Example:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)
