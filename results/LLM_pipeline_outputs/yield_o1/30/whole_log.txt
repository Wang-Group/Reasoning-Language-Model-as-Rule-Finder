Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Combine or Remove Rules with Insufficient Coverage**

  Rules that are only supported by one data point (Rules 7, 10, 12, 13, 14) have insufficient coverage. Consider combining them with similar rules to increase their coverage or remove them if they cannot be supported with additional data. For example, merge Rule 7 (highly fluorinated aliphatic chains yield low) with other rules that relate to hydrophobic modifiers yielding low yield.

- **Advice 2**: **Clarify and Refine Rules with Ambiguities**

  Rules that lack clarity or have conflicting data (Rules 9 and 15) need to be refined. For Rule 9, avoid ambiguous terms like "variable results" and clearly specify the structural features that lead to high or low yield. For Rule 15, resolve any conflicting data points and ensure the rule accurately reflects the trends observed.

- **Advice 3**: **Increase Coverage by Generalizing or Merging Similar Rules**

  To improve coverage, consider generalizing rules or merging similar ones. For instance, combine Rules 6 and 12, both of which involve carbonyl groups (aldehyde and ketone) leading to low yield, into a single rule about modifiers with carbonyl groups adjacent to carboxylic acids resulting in low yield.

- **Advice 4**: **Expand Existing Rules to Include Additional Data Points**

  Review the dataset to identify additional modifiers that fit within existing rules but are not currently included. This can help strengthen the rules by increasing their coverage. For example, see if other modifiers with hydroxyl groups (Rule 5) or heterocyclic carboxylic acids (Rule 3) can be incorporated.

- **Advice 5**: **Introduce New Rules Based on Unaddressed Data Patterns**

  Analyze the dataset for patterns not covered by existing rules and consider formulating new rules. For instance, modifiers with amino groups on aromatic rings may influence yield; if this pattern exists, create a rule to capture it.

- **Advice 6**: **Ensure Each Rule Provides Clear Property Insight**

  Revisit each rule to ensure it offers a clear and specific property insight that explains the observed effect on yield. Avoid overly broad or vague statements. This will enhance the usefulness and applicability of the rules.

- **Advice 7**: **Validate Rules Against the Full Dataset**

  Cross-check each rule against the entire dataset to confirm that it consistently predicts high or low yield for relevant modifiers. This helps to identify exceptions or necessary refinements to the rules.

**End of Rules**
---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**
- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear in specifying that short-chain aliphatic amino acids (3-5 carbons, no aromatic rings) yield high, while longer chains (6+ carbons) yield low. The structural criteria are well-defined, and the examples in the dataset support the rule, with multiple data points on each side. The rule provides property insight by implicating chain length as a factor influencing yield, possibly due to steric or electronic effects. The complexity is appropriate; it considers both chain length and the absence of aromatic rings. Overall, the rule meets the criteria of clarity, property insight, complexity, and coverage.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 attempts to correlate para-substituent electronic effects with yield, stating that electron-withdrawing groups result in high yield, while electron-donating or bulky groups result in low yield. However, there are inconsistencies with this rule. For example, 4-aminobenzoic acid is listed as high yield, but the amino group is generally electron-donating. Similarly, 4-formylbenzoic acid, which contains an electron-withdrawing formyl group, is listed as low yield. This suggests a lack of clarity and property insight in the rule. The rule may need to be refined to accurately reflect the observed data. The complexity of the rule is acceptable, but the coverage is undermined by these inconsistencies.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear in stating that heterocyclic carboxylic acids yield high, supported by examples in the dataset. The property insight is sound, as heterocyclic compounds can coordinate with metal centers, potentially facilitating electron transfer in the catalytic process. The complexity is appropriate, focusing on heterocyclic structures. The rule is well-supported by data points, meeting the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 states that long-chain (6-8 carbons) aliphatic carboxylic acids yield high, while amino-substituted analogs yield low. The rule is clear and offers property insight by suggesting that the addition of amino groups decreases yield due to increased polarity or interference with the catalyst. However, the coverage is limited, with only one data point (octanoic acid) supporting high yield for the unmodified long-chain acids. For the amino-substituted analogs, there are two data points showing low yield, which partially supports the rule. The rule's complexity is acceptable, but the limited coverage reduces its robustness.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 states that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups yield high, attributing this to enhanced solubility and hydrogen-bonding interactions with the catalyst. The rule is clear and provides reasonable property insight. However, the coverage is limited, with only two data points supporting the rule and no contrasting low-yield examples. The complexity is acceptable. To strengthen the rule, additional data points would be beneficial.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 states that modifiers with aldehyde groups yield low due to potential side reactions like Schiff base formation or catalyst poisoning. The rule is clear and offers property insight. However, the coverage is minimal, with only two data points supporting the rule. The rule's complexity is low. To enhance the rule's robustness, more data points and perhaps contrasting high-yield examples without aldehyde groups would be helpful.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 differentiates between thiol groups on aliphatic chains (high yield) and aromatic rings (low yield). The rule is clear and offers plausible property insight. However, the coverage is very limited, with only one data point for each case. The rule's complexity is acceptable. To strengthen the rule, additional data points are needed to confirm the trend.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 states that modifiers with highly fluorinated aliphatic chains yield low due to hydrophobicity affecting interactions with catalytic sites. The rule is clear and offers reasonable property insight. However, the coverage is minimal, with only one data point supporting the rule. The complexity is low. Additional data points are needed to confirm this pattern.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 suggests that modifiers with extended conjugated aromatic systems yield high due to π-π stacking interactions. While the rule provides property insight, the term "extended conjugated aromatic systems" is somewhat vague and may lack clarity. The coverage is limited, with only two data points. The complexity is acceptable. To improve the rule, clearer definitions and more supporting data would be beneficial.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 states that modifiers with polyether chains yield low due to steric hindrance or unfavorable solvation effects. The rule is clear and offers property insight. However, the coverage is minimal, with only one data point. The complexity is acceptable. Additional examples are needed to support the rule.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 states that hydroxyphenyl groups with longer aliphatic linkers yield high, while those with shorter linkers yield low. The rule is clear and provides property insight. The complexity is appropriate, considering both chain length and functional groups. The coverage is minimal, with only one example for each case. More data points are needed to confirm this trend.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 suggests that modifiers with ketone groups near carboxylic acids yield low due to chelation with metal centers or interference with catalytic activity. The rule is clear and offers property insight. However, the coverage is minimal, with only one data point. The complexity is acceptable. More supporting data is needed.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 states that modifiers with bulky aromatic substituents not conjugated with the carboxylic acid yield low. While the rule provides property insight, it may lack clarity due to the complexity of defining "not conjugated" in this context. The coverage is minimal, with only two data points. The complexity of the rule is high. Clarification and additional data points would strengthen the rule.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Refine Rule 2 to Align with Observed Data**  
  The current Rule 2 suggests that electron-withdrawing groups at the para position lead to high yield, while electron-donating groups result in low yield. However, the data shows inconsistencies—for example, 4-aminobenzoic acid (an electron-donating amino group) yields high, and 4-formylbenzoic acid (an electron-withdrawing formyl group) yields low. Refine the rule to focus on the ability of the substituents to coordinate with the metal center or participate in specific interactions rather than solely on their electronic nature. Consider grouping substituents based on their coordination potential or steric effects.

- **Advice 2**: **Increase Coverage by Combining Similar Rules**  
  Many rules (e.g., Rules 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13) have limited coverage with only one or two supporting data points. To enhance robustness, consider combining rules that share common structural features or mechanisms. For instance, merge Rules 4 and 5 to create a broader rule about aliphatic carboxylic acids with functional groups that enhance solubility or interact favorably with the catalyst.

- **Advice 3**: **Clarify Vague Terminology in Rules**  
  Terms like "extended conjugated aromatic systems" in Rule 9 are vague and may lead to misinterpretation. Provide specific structural criteria, such as the minimum number of fused rings or specific aromatic systems (e.g., indole, benzofuran). This will improve clarity and applicability.

- **Advice 4**: **Re-express Rules to Reflect Functional Group Context**  
  Recognize that the same functional group can have different effects depending on its context in the molecule. For example, amino groups in aliphatic chains might decrease yield (Rule 4), while the same groups in aromatic systems may coordinate with the catalyst and increase yield (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid). Adjust the rules to account for these contextual differences.

- **Advice 5**: **Incorporate Functional Group Combinations and Positions**  
  Develop rules that consider combinations of functional groups and their positions within the molecule. For example, the presence of both hydroxyl and carboxylic acid groups on an aliphatic chain may enhance yield (as in gluconic acid), while the same groups in other positions might not have the same effect.

- **Advice 6**: **Gather Additional Data to Support Low-Coverage Rules**  
  For rules with minimal data support, such as Rules 7 (thiol groups), 8 (fluorinated chains), and 10 (polyether chains), collect more experimental data. Additional examples will help confirm whether these patterns hold true and justify retaining or modifying the rules.

- **Advice 7**: **Clarify and Refine Rule 13 Regarding Bulky Aromatics**  
  The definition of "bulky aromatic substituents not conjugated with the carboxylic acid" is unclear. Provide explicit structural examples or criteria, such as specifying the size of the aromatic group or the nature of its linkage to the carboxylic acid. Re-evaluate the rule to focus on steric hindrance effects and gather more data to support it.

- **Advice 8**: **Emphasize Specific Interactions Over General Electronic Effects**  
  Instead of broadly categorizing substituents as electron-donating or -withdrawing, focus on their ability to participate in specific interactions (e.g., metal coordination, hydrogen bonding). This approach may provide better property insight and explain exceptions observed in the data.

- **Advice 9**: **Prioritize Rules with Strong Support and Clear Insights**  
  Focus on refining and retaining rules that have robust data support and offer clear property insights, such as Rules 1 and 3. Consider omitting or significantly revising rules that cannot be adequately supported, to improve the overall quality and reliability of the rule set.

- **Advice 10**: **Consider Steric and Electronic Effects Together**  
  In rules where electronic effects don't fully explain the observed yields (e.g., Rule 2), incorporate steric considerations. For example, bulky substituents may hinder catalyst interaction regardless of their electronic nature. Adjust the rules to reflect the combined influence of steric and electronic factors.

      - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid – High Yield

- **Rule 4**: **Long-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Yield High; Amino-Substituted Analogs Yield Low**

  Modifiers that are long-chain (6 carbons or more) aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups result in high yield. Introducing amino groups into the chain decreases the yield, possibly due to increased polarity or interference with catalyst coordination.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - Octanoic acid – High Yield
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 7-aminoheptanoic acid – Low Yield
      - 8-aminooctanoic acid – Low Yield

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups Yield High**

  Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially on aliphatic chains, result in high yield due to enhanced solubility and hydrogen-bonding interactions with the catalyst. These interactions may facilitate better dispersion and accessibility of active sites.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid) – High Yield
      - 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid – High Yield

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers Containing Carbonyl Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acids Yield Low**

  Modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acids tend to result in low yield. These carbonyl groups might chelate with metal centers or undergo side reactions, hindering the catalyst's activity.

  *Examples:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-formylbenzoic acid – Low Yield
      - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid – Low Yield
      - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid – Low Yield

- **Rule 7**: **Thiol Groups on Aliphatic Chains Yield High; Thiol Groups on Aromatic Rings Yield Low**

  Modifiers with thiol (sulfanyl) groups attached to aliphatic chains result in high yield, likely due to their ability to enhance interactions with the metal center. Thiol groups on aromatic rings may lead to catalyst deactivation, resulting in low yield.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid – High Yield
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid – Low Yield

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with Highly Fluorinated Aliphatic Chains Yield Low**

  Highly fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids result in low yield. The strong electronegativity and hydrophobicity of fluorinated chains can reduce interactions with the catalyst and impede the reaction.

  *Example:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid – Low Yield

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with Extended Conjugated Aromatic Systems Yield High**

  Modifiers containing extended conjugated aromatic systems directly attached to carboxylic acid groups facilitate π-π stacking and electronic interactions with the catalyst, resulting in high yield.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid – High Yield
      - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan) – High Yield
    - **Low Yield:**
      - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine) – Low Yield

- **Rule 10**: **Hydroxyphenyl Groups with Longer Aliphatic Linkers Yield High; Shorter Linkers Yield Low**

  Modifiers with hydroxyphenyl groups connected via longer aliphatic chains (five carbons or more) result in high yield, while those with shorter chains yield low. Longer linkers may provide flexibility, enhancing interactions with the catalyst.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid – High Yield
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid – Low Yield

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with Polyether Chains Yield Low**

  Modifiers containing polyether chains, such as methoxyethoxy groups, result in low yield. These chains may cause steric hindrance or unfavorable solvation effects, interfering with catalyst interaction.

  *Example:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid – Low Yield

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with Bulky Non-Conjugated Aromatic Substituents Yield Low**

  Modifiers with bulky aromatic substituents that are not directly conjugated with the carboxylic acid group result in low yield. Steric hindrance or lack of effective electronic interaction with the catalyst may reduce effectiveness.

  *Examples:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid – Low Yield
      - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid – Low Yield

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Short-Chain Aliphatic Amino Acids Yield High; Long-Chain Amino Acids Yield Low**

  Modifiers that are aliphatic amino acids with carbon chain lengths of 4 to 5 carbons (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) result in high yield. Those with longer aliphatic chains (6 carbons or more) yield low. This may be due to the optimal size and coordination ability of shorter chains with the catalyst.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid) – High Yield
      - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid) – High Yield
      - 5-aminopentanoic acid – High Yield
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 7-aminoheptanoic acid – Low Yield
      - 8-aminooctanoic acid – Low Yield
      - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid – Low Yield

- **Rule 2**: **Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids with Metal-Coordinating Groups Yield High; Non-Coordinating Groups Yield Low**

  Modifiers that are benzoic acid derivatives with substituents at the para position capable of coordinating with metal centers (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl) result in high yield. Substituents that are non-coordinating or solely electron-donating (e.g., methyl) yield low. Coordination enhances interaction with the catalyst.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 4-aminobenzoic acid – High Yield
      - 4-nitrobenzoic acid – High Yield
      - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid – High Yield
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-methylbenzoic acid – Low Yield
      - 4-formylbenzoic acid – Low Yield

- **Rule 3**: **Heterocyclic Carboxylic Acids Yield High**

  Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids, such as pyridine carboxylic acids and pyrazole carboxylic acids, result in high yield. Their heteroaromatic rings can coordinate with metal centers and facilitate electron transfer, enhancing catalytic activity.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid – High Yield
      - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid – High Yield
      - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid – High Yield

- **Rule 4**: **Long-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Yield High; Amino-Substituted Analogs Yield Low**

  Modifiers that are long-chain (6 carbons or more) aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups result in high yield. Introducing amino groups into the chain decreases the yield, possibly due to increased polarity or interference with catalyst coordination.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - Octanoic acid – High Yield
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 7-aminoheptanoic acid – Low Yield
      - 8-aminooctanoic acid – Low Yield

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups Yield High**

  Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially on aliphatic chains, result in high yield due to enhanced solubility and hydrogen-bonding interactions with the catalyst. These interactions may facilitate better dispersion and accessibility of active sites.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid) – High Yield
      - 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid – High Yield

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers Containing Carbonyl Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acids Yield Low**

  Modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acids tend to result in low yield. These carbonyl groups might chelate with metal centers or undergo side reactions, hindering the catalyst's activity.

  *Examples:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-formylbenzoic acid – Low Yield
      - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid – Low Yield
      - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid – Low Yield

- **Rule 7**: **Thiol Groups on Aliphatic Chains Yield High; Thiol Groups on Aromatic Rings Yield Low**

  Modifiers with thiol (sulfanyl) groups attached to aliphatic chains result in high yield, likely due to their ability to enhance interactions with the metal center. Thiol groups on aromatic rings may lead to catalyst deactivation, resulting in low yield.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid – High Yield
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid – Low Yield

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with Highly Fluorinated Aliphatic Chains Yield Low**

  Highly fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids result in low yield. The strong electronegativity and hydrophobicity of fluorinated chains can reduce interactions with the catalyst and impede the reaction.

  *Example:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid – Low Yield

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with Extended Conjugated Aromatic Systems Yield High**

  Modifiers containing extended conjugated aromatic systems directly attached to carboxylic acid groups facilitate π-π stacking and electronic interactions with the catalyst, resulting in high yield.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid – High Yield
      - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan) – High Yield
    - **Low Yield:**
      - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine) – Low Yield

- **Rule 10**: **Hydroxyphenyl Groups with Longer Aliphatic Linkers Yield High; Shorter Linkers Yield Low**

  Modifiers with hydroxyphenyl groups connected via longer aliphatic chains (five carbons or more) result in high yield, while those with shorter chains yield low. Longer linkers may provide flexibility, enhancing interactions with the catalyst.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid – High Yield
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid – Low Yield

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with Polyether Chains Yield Low**

  Modifiers containing polyether chains, such as methoxyethoxy groups, result in low yield. These chains may cause steric hindrance or unfavorable solvation effects, interfering with catalyst interaction.

  *Example:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid – Low Yield

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with Bulky Non-Conjugated Aromatic Substituents Yield Low**

  Modifiers with bulky aromatic substituents that are not directly conjugated with the carboxylic acid group result in low yield. Steric hindrance or lack of effective electronic interaction with the catalyst may reduce effectiveness.

  *Examples:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid – Low Yield
      - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid – Low Yield

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: Modify Rule 1 in the code to exclude aromatic systems. Currently, the code counts the chain length between the amine and carboxylic acid irrespective of whether it's aliphatic or aromatic. Since Rule 1 specifically refers to aliphatic amino acids, the code should ensure that the path between the amine and carboxylic acid consists only of aliphatic (non-aromatic) carbons.
- ** Suggestion 2 **: Adjust the SMARTS patterns in Rule 1 to explicitly match aliphatic chains. You can use the `[C;!R]` notation to specify non-aromatic carbons. For example, redefine the patterns to ensure that both the amine and carboxylic acid are connected via an aliphatic chain without traversing any aromatic atoms.
- ** Suggestion 3 **: For Rule 2, revise the SMARTS patterns to accurately detect para-substituted benzoic acids with coordinating groups. The current patterns may not correctly identify molecules like 4-aminobenzoic acid. Use explicit substitution patterns to ensure that the substituents are at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid group.
- ** Suggestion 4 **: Modify the `benzoic_acid` pattern in Rule 2 to specify the carboxylic acid at the para position relative to the substituent. For example, use a SMARTS like `c1cc(ccc1[X])C(=O)[OH]`, where `[X]` represents the para-substituent. This will help in distinguishing between para, meta, and ortho substitutions.
- ** Suggestion 5 **: In Rule 4, replace the specific SMILES `'C[C@H](CCCC)C(=O)[OH]'` with a more general SMARTS pattern that matches long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids. For instance, use `'CCCCCCC(=O)[OH]'` to match chains with six or more carbons. Additionally, account for any stereochemistry by removing chirality specifications unless necessary.
- ** Suggestion 6 **: Update the `amino_substituted` pattern in Rule 4. The pattern `'*N*'` is too broad and matches any molecule containing nitrogen. Instead, use a SMARTS pattern that identifies amino groups attached to the aliphatic chain of the carboxylic acid, such as `'CCCNCC(=O)[OH]'` for a three-carbon chain with an amino group.
- ** Suggestion 7 **: Refine the SMARTS pattern in Rule 3 to accurately capture heterocyclic carboxylic acids. The current pattern `'[cH,r5,r6][cH,r5,r6]C(=O)[OH]'` might match unintended structures. Consider using a pattern like `'[n,o,s][#6]C(=O)[OH]'` to match heteroatoms in a ring directly attached to a carboxylic acid.
- ** Suggestion 8 **: Incorporate validation steps in the code to ensure that each rule applies exclusively to its intended molecular features. This may involve adding checks for ring sizes, heteroatoms, or specific functional group arrangements to prevent misclassification.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Short-Chain Aliphatic Amino Acids Yield High; Long-Chain Amino Acids Yield Low**

  Modifiers that are aliphatic amino acids with carbon chain lengths of 4 to 5 carbons (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) result in high yield. Those with longer aliphatic chains (6 carbons or more) yield low. This may be due to the optimal size and coordination ability of shorter chains with the catalyst.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid) – High Yield
      - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid) – High Yield
      - 5-aminopentanoic acid – High Yield
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 7-aminoheptanoic acid – Low Yield
      - 8-aminooctanoic acid – Low Yield
      - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid – Low Yield

- **Rule 2**: **Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids with Metal-Coordinating Groups Yield High; Non-Coordinating Groups Yield Low**

  Modifiers that are benzoic acid derivatives with substituents at the para position capable of coordinating with metal centers (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl) result in high yield. Substituents that are non-coordinating or solely electron-donating (e.g., methyl) yield low. Coordination enhances interaction with the catalyst.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 4-aminobenzoic acid – High Yield
      - 4-nitrobenzoic acid – High Yield
      - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid – High Yield
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-methylbenzoic acid – Low Yield
      - 4-formylbenzoic acid – Low Yield

- **Rule 3**: **Heterocyclic Carboxylic Acids Yield High**

  Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids, such as pyridine carboxylic acids and pyrazole carboxylic acids, result in high yield. Their heteroaromatic rings can coordinate with metal centers and facilitate electron transfer, enhancing catalytic activity.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid – High Yield
      - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid – High Yield
      - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid – High Yield

- **Rule 4**: **Long-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Yield High; Amino-Substituted Analogs Yield Low**

  Modifiers that are long-chain (6 carbons or more) aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups result in high yield. Introducing amino groups into the chain decreases the yield, possibly due to increased polarity or interference with catalyst coordination.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - Octanoic acid – High Yield
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 7-aminoheptanoic acid – Low Yield
      - 8-aminooctanoic acid – Low Yield

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups Yield High**

  Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially on aliphatic chains, result in high yield due to enhanced solubility and hydrogen-bonding interactions with the catalyst. These interactions may facilitate better dispersion and accessibility of active sites.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid) – High Yield
      - 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid – High Yield

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers Containing Carbonyl Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acids Yield Low**

  Modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acids tend to result in low yield. These carbonyl groups might chelate with metal centers or undergo side reactions, hindering the catalyst's activity.

  *Examples:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-formylbenzoic acid – Low Yield
      - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid – Low Yield
      - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid – Low Yield

- **Rule 7**: **Thiol Groups on Aliphatic Chains Yield High; Thiol Groups on Aromatic Rings Yield Low**

  Modifiers with thiol (sulfanyl) groups attached to aliphatic chains result in high yield, likely due to their ability to enhance interactions with the metal center. Thiol groups on aromatic rings may lead to catalyst deactivation, resulting in low yield.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid – High Yield
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid – Low Yield

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with Highly Fluorinated Aliphatic Chains Yield Low**

  Highly fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids result in low yield. The strong electronegativity and hydrophobicity of fluorinated chains can reduce interactions with the catalyst and impede the reaction.

  *Example:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid – Low Yield

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with Extended Conjugated Aromatic Systems Yield High**

  Modifiers containing extended conjugated aromatic systems directly attached to carboxylic acid groups facilitate π-π stacking and electronic interactions with the catalyst, resulting in high yield.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid – High Yield
      - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan) – High Yield
    - **Low Yield:**
      - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine) – Low Yield

- **Rule 10**: **Hydroxyphenyl Groups with Longer Aliphatic Linkers Yield High; Shorter Linkers Yield Low**

  Modifiers with hydroxyphenyl groups connected via longer aliphatic chains (five carbons or more) result in high yield, while those with shorter chains yield low. Longer linkers may provide flexibility, enhancing interactions with the catalyst.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid – High Yield
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid – Low Yield

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with Polyether Chains Yield Low**

  Modifiers containing polyether chains, such as methoxyethoxy groups, result in low yield. These chains may cause steric hindrance or unfavorable solvation effects, interfering with catalyst interaction.

  *Example:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid – Low Yield

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with Bulky Non-Conjugated Aromatic Substituents Yield Low**

  Modifiers with bulky aromatic substituents that are not directly conjugated with the carboxylic acid group result in low yield. Steric hindrance or lack of effective electronic interaction with the catalyst may reduce effectiveness.

  *Examples:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid – Low Yield
      - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid – Low Yield

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Align the SMILES Set with the Feature Matrix**

  There is a mismatch between the number of SMILES strings (24) and the number of rows in the feature matrix (36). Ensure that each SMILES string corresponds to one row in the feature matrix. This alignment is crucial for accurate mapping and evaluation.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Correct Chain Length Calculation in Rule 1**

  In Rule 1, instead of counting the number of carbons in the shortest path between the amine and carboxylic acid groups, identify the side chain connected to the α-carbon of the amino acid. The chain length should be the number of carbons in the side chain (excluding the α-carbon). Modify the code to accurately identify and count the side chain carbons to distinguish between short and long-chain amino acids.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Generalize the SMARTS Patterns in Rule 2**

  The SMARTS patterns for para-substituted benzoic acids with coordinating and non-coordinating groups are too specific. Generalize the patterns to match any para-substituted benzoic acid with metal-coordinating groups (e.g., `[NX3;H2,H1,H0]`, `[OX1-,OX2]`, `[SX2]`) and non-coordinating groups (e.g., alkyl, aldehyde). Use wildcard patterns or specify properties (like donor atoms) to capture a broader range of substituents.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Expand Heterocycle Patterns in Rule 3**

  The heterocycle pattern in Rule 3 only matches five-membered rings, whereas the rule includes six-membered heterocycles like pyridine. Modify the SMARTS pattern to include both five- and six-membered heteroaromatic rings, such as `[n,o,s]1cccc1` and `[n,o,s]1ccccc1`, to accurately identify all relevant heterocyclic carboxylic acids.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Parameterize Chain Length in Rule 4**

  In Rule 4, the `long_chain_acid_pattern` is hard-coded for a specific chain length. Replace it with a pattern that matches aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of six carbons or more, such as `CCCCCCC(=O)[OH]` and use recursive SMARTS or quantifiers to specify chain lengths (e.g., `C[C;R0][C;R0]{4,}`).

- **Suggestion 6**: **Refine Amino Substituent Detection in Rule 4**

  The `amino_substituted_pattern` in Rule 4 may not detect all amino-substituted analogs. Update it to match amino groups anywhere on the carbon chain, not just directly attached to a carbon atom, using a pattern like `[$([NX3H2,NX3H1][C;!R])]`.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Implement Missing Rules and Update Code**

  The code currently only implements Rules 1 to 4. Extend the code to include the remaining rules (Rules 5 to 12). Carefully translate each natural language rule into the corresponding SMARTS patterns, ensuring they accurately reflect the described chemical features.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Validate SMARTS Patterns Against Examples**

  For each rule, test the SMARTS patterns against the provided examples to confirm that they match high-yield and low-yield modifiers appropriately. Adjust the patterns as needed based on the validation results.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Improve Error Handling and Molecule Parsing**

  Enhance the code's robustness by adding error handling for cases where the SMILES strings may not parse correctly or where substructure searches might fail due to different tautomeric forms or resonance structures. Use standardized molecule representations (e.g., Kekulization, tautomer normalization) to improve matching accuracy.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Add Comments and Documentation to Code**

  Include detailed comments and documentation within the code to explain the purpose of each SMARTS pattern, the logic behind each rule implementation, and any assumptions made. This will aid in future code maintenance and facilitate collaboration.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Standardize Numerical Descriptors for Molecular Features**

  To facilitate the generation of a numeric feature matrix, it's essential to express the molecular features in terms of standardized numerical descriptors. For example, instead of categorical descriptions like "short-chain" or "long-chain" amino acids, specify the exact carbon chain length or range (e.g., chain length = 4–5 carbons yields high; chain length ≥6 carbons yields low). Utilize numerical values for features such as:

  - Carbon chain length
  - Number of functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino, carboxyl)
  - Positions of substituents on aromatic rings (e.g., para-position = 1 if substituted, 0 if not)
  - Electronic properties (e.g., Hammett sigma constants for substituents)

- **Advice 2**: **Quantify Electronic and Steric Effects**

  Incorporate quantitative measures of electronic and steric effects to make the rules more precise. Use parameters such as:

  - **Electronic Effects**: Quantify substituents using their electron-donating or electron-withdrawing strengths (e.g., Taft or Hammett constants).
  - **Steric Effects**: Use steric parameters like molar refractivity or Verloop parameters to account for the size and shape of substituents.

- **Advice 3**: **Use Molecular Descriptors Common in QSAR Studies**

  Apply molecular descriptors commonly used in Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) models to encode the modifiers numerically:

  - **Hydrophobicity (Log P)**
  - **Topological Polar Surface Area (TPSA)**
  - **Molecular Weight**
  - **Number of Rotatable Bonds**
  - **Hydrogen Bond Donors/Acceptors**

- **Advice 4**: **Create a Structured Feature Matrix**

  Develop a feature matrix where each row represents a modifier, and each column represents a quantified molecular feature. This structure aids in statistical analysis and model building. Ensure that:

  - All modifiers are represented consistently.
  - Missing values are minimized or appropriately imputed.

- **Advice 5**: **Simplify and Generalize the Rules**

  Revise the rules to reduce complexity and overlap. Consolidate similar rules and focus on the most impactful features. For example:

  - Combine Rules 1 and 4 by creating a rule that specifies the optimal carbon chain length for aliphatic carboxylic acids and amino acids.
  - Merge Rules 2 and 9 by focusing on the presence of metal-coordinating groups and conjugated systems, quantified by specific descriptors.

- **Advice 6**: **Incorporate Machine-Learnable Features**

  Modify the rules to include features that machine learning algorithms can easily interpret:

  - **Binary Indicators**: Presence or absence of specific functional groups (1 or 0).
  - **Counts**: Number of times a particular feature appears (e.g., number of hydroxyl groups).
  - **Distances**: Number of bonds between functional groups (e.g., distance from carboxyl group to amino group).

- **Advice 7**: **Use Hierarchical Classification of Functional Groups**

  Classify functional groups hierarchically to capture both general and specific features:

  - **Level 1**: Broad categories (e.g., aliphatic, aromatic, heterocyclic).
  - **Level 2**: Specific functional groups (e.g., carboxylic acid, hydroxyl group).
  - **Level 3**: Substituent positions and patterns (e.g., para-substituted aromatic ring).

- **Advice 8**: **Annotate Modifiers with SMARTS Patterns**

  Utilize SMILES Arbitrary Target Specification (SMARTS) patterns to precisely define structural features:

  - Create SMARTS patterns for high-yielding motifs.
  - Use these patterns to identify and annotate modifiers programmatically.

- **Advice 9**: **Perform Statistical Analysis to Identify Key Features**

  Analyze the existing dataset statistically to determine which features most strongly correlate with high yield:

  - Use methods like correlation coefficients or feature importance from machine learning models.
  - Focus the rules on these key features to improve predictive power.

- **Advice 10**: **Validate and Iterate the Rules**

  After revising the rules, validate them against the dataset to ensure they accurately predict the yield outcomes:

  - Check for consistency between the rules and experimental results.
  - Refine the rules based on discrepancies to improve accuracy.

** End of Advice **
---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Short-Chain Aliphatic Amino Acids Yield High; Longer-Chain Analogs Yield Low**

  Modifiers that are aliphatic amino acids with a carbon chain length of 4 or 5 carbons and an amino group at the α-position result in high yield. Longer-chain amino acids (6 carbons or more) yield low. This may be due to optimal coordination and minimal steric hindrance with the catalyst for shorter chains.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)
      - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)
      - 5-aminopentanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:**
      - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
      - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
      - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 2**: **Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing, Metal-Coordinating Groups Yield High; Electron-Donating or Non-Coordinating Groups Yield Low**

  Modifiers that are benzoic acid derivatives with electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position capable of coordinating with metal centers (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl) result in high yield. Those with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy) or non-coordinating substituents yield low. Coordination enhances interaction with the catalyst.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 4-aminobenzoic acid
      - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
      - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-methylbenzoic acid
      - 4-formylbenzoic acid
      - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 3**: **Nitrogen-Containing Heterocyclic Carboxylic Acids Yield High**

  Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids with nitrogen-containing aromatic rings, such as pyridine and pyrazole carboxylic acids, result in high yield. Their ability to coordinate with metal centers enhances catalytic activity.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Niacin)
      - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
      - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 4**: **Straight-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Yield High; Addition of Polar Functional Groups Lowers Yield**

  Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups result in high yield. Introducing polar groups like hydroxyl or amino decreases the yield, potentially due to altered solubility or interference with catalyst coordination.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - Octanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
      - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
      - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups on Short Chains Yield High; Single Hydroxyl on Long Chains Yields Low**

  Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups on short aliphatic chains enhance solubility and interaction with the catalyst, resulting in high yield. A single hydroxyl group on a longer chain does not have the same effect and yields low.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid

- **Rule 6**: **Aliphatic Thiol Groups Yield High; Aromatic Thiol Groups Yield Low**

  Modifiers with thiol (–SH) groups on aliphatic chains result in high yield, likely due to effective coordination with the metal catalyst. Thiol groups attached to aromatic rings may lead to catalyst poisoning or deactivation, yielding low.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 7**: **Highly Fluorinated Aliphatic Chains Yield Low**

  Modifiers with multiple fluorine atoms in aliphatic chains result in low yield. The strong electronegativity and hydrophobic nature of fluorinated chains can reduce interactions with the catalyst and hinder the reaction.

  *Example:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with Carbonyl Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acids Yield Low**

  Modifiers possessing aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acids tend to yield low. These carbonyl groups might chelate with the metal catalyst or participate in side reactions, reducing catalytic efficiency.

  *Examples:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-formylbenzoic acid
      - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
      - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with Extended Conjugation Involving Heterocycles Yield High**

  Modifiers containing extended conjugated systems with oxygen or nitrogen heterocycles enhance electron delocalization and coordination with the catalyst, resulting in high yield.

  *Example:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 10**: **Hydroxyphenyl Groups Connected by Long Aliphatic Chains Yield High; Short Chains Yield Low**

  Modifiers with hydroxyphenyl groups linked by aliphatic chains of five or more carbons to a carboxylic acid yield high, possibly due to increased flexibility and optimal interaction with the catalyst. Shorter chains may not provide this advantage.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with Polyether Chains Yield Low**

  Modifiers containing polyether chains, such as methoxyethoxy units, result in low yield. These moieties may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorable solvation effects, impeding effective catalyst interaction.

  *Example:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid

- **Rule 12**: **Bulky Non-Coordinating Substituents Yield Low**

  Modifiers with bulky substituents that cannot effectively coordinate with the metal catalyst lead to low yield. Steric hindrance may prevent proper interaction with the active sites.

  *Examples:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
      - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 13**: **Aromatic Rings with Amino Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acids Yield High**

  Modifiers where an amino group is directly attached to an aromatic ring adjacent to a carboxylic acid enhance metal coordination, resulting in high yield.

  *Example:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 4-aminobenzoic acid

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with Methoxy Groups Without Coordinating Substituents Yield Low**

  Modifiers featuring methoxy groups attached to aromatic rings or aliphatic chains yield low if they lack other coordinating groups. Methoxy groups are electron-donating but do not coordinate effectively with metal catalysts.

  *Examples:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
      - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid (Note: Despite containing methoxy groups, this compound yields high, possibly due to other contributing factors.)

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with Fused Nitrogen Heterocyclic Aromatic Systems Yield High**

  Modifiers containing fused aromatic systems with nitrogen heterocycles (e.g., indole ring in tryptophan) can delocalize electrons and coordinate with metal centers effectively, yielding high.

  *Example:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)

**End of Rules**
---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows us to determine the yield based on the carbon chain length and the position of the amino group in aliphatic amino acids. It provides strong physical-chemical insight, attributing high yields to optimal coordination and minimal steric hindrance in shorter chains. The rule considers both chain length and functional groups, offering a good balance between complexity and coverage with multiple supporting data points.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is well-defined, focusing on para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing, metal-coordinating groups yielding high, and those with electron-donating or non-coordinating groups yielding low. It offers solid physical-chemical insight into how electron-withdrawing substituents enhance metal coordination. The rule effectively balances complexity and coverage, supported by multiple data points that validate its applicability.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 provides clear guidance by identifying nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids as yielding high. It offers adequate physical-chemical insight into the role of nitrogen heterocycles in metal coordination. While the rule is clear and considers specific substructures, its coverage could be strengthened with additional data points, although it currently meets the minimum requirement.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is straightforward and clear, stating that straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids yield high, while the addition of polar functional groups lowers the yield. The rule provides reasonable physical-chemical insight into how polar groups may alter solubility or interfere with catalyst coordination. It effectively balances complexity by considering both the absence and presence of functional groups and is well-supported by multiple data points.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 lacks sufficient coverage, with limited data points supporting the high yield for modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on short chains. While it offers some physical-chemical insight into enhanced solubility and catalyst interaction, the rule's complexity may not justify its limited applicability. Additional data is needed to strengthen the rule's reliability.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear in distinguishing between aliphatic and aromatic thiol groups' effects on yield. However, the rule's coverage is minimal, relying on a single high-yield and one low-yield example. Despite providing physical-chemical insight into metal coordination and potential catalyst poisoning, the limited data reduces confidence in the rule's general applicability.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 identifies that highly fluorinated aliphatic chains yield low, attributing this to reduced catalyst interaction due to electronegativity and hydrophobicity. The rule is clear but has very limited coverage with only one supporting data point. This minimal coverage hampers its effectiveness and reliability for broader application.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear and supported by several data points showing that modifiers with carbonyl groups adjacent to carboxylic acids yield low. It offers adequate physical-chemical insight, suggesting possible chelation or side reactions with the catalyst. The rule balances complexity by focusing on specific functional group arrangements and has sufficient coverage to support its validity.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 has low coverage, supported by only one data point. While it introduces the concept that extended conjugation involving heterocycles yields high, the rule lacks clarity due to its vague description. The physical-chemical insight is plausible but not sufficiently detailed, and more data points are needed to validate this rule.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 discusses the impact of chain length in hydroxyphenyl-substituted aliphatic acids on yield. Despite offering some physical-chemical insight, the rule is based on minimal data, with only one high-yield and one low-yield example. The limited coverage and specificity reduce its reliability for predicting outcomes with new modifiers.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 addresses modifiers with polyether chains yielding low, suggesting steric hindrance or unfavorable solvation effects. The rule is clear but has insufficient coverage, supported by a single data point. This minimal support limits its applicability and confidence in the rule's generalizability.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is clear in stating that bulky non-coordinating substituents yield low. It provides reasonable physical-chemical insight into how steric hindrance may prevent proper catalyst interaction. The rule considers combinations of substructures and is supported by at least two data points, offering a balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 overlaps with Rule 2, focusing on aromatic rings with amino groups adjacent to carboxylic acids yielding high. While it provides adequate physical-chemical insight into enhanced metal coordination, the rule's coverage is limited to a single data point. The redundancy and minimal support reduce its added value beyond what is already covered in Rule 2.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 is unclear and contains contradictory information. The rule states that modifiers with methoxy groups without coordinating substituents yield low, yet provides an example where such a compound yields high. This inconsistency undermines the rule's clarity and reliability, and the lack of sufficient supporting data further weakens its validity.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 introduces the idea that modifiers with fused nitrogen heterocyclic aromatic systems yield high, exemplified by tryptophan. While the rule offers physical-chemical insight into electron delocalization and metal coordination, it is supported by only one data point. The limited coverage necessitates more data to confirm the rule's applicability and strengthen its predictive power.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Clarify and Correct Rule 2 Regarding Metal Coordination**

  **Issue**: Rule 2 currently states that para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing, metal-coordinating groups yield high, while electron-donating or non-coordinating groups yield low. However, there is inconsistency because 4-aminobenzoic acid (an electron-donating group) yields high.

  **Suggestion**:

  - **Focus on Metal-Coordinating Ability**: Redefine the rule to emphasize that substituents capable of coordinating with metal centers (regardless of their electron-donating or -withdrawing nature) lead to high yield.
  - **Remove Conflicting Information**: Eliminate references to electron-donating or -withdrawing properties that do not align with the observed data.
  - **Practical Implementation**: Adjust the rule to state:

    > **Rule 2 (Revised)**: **Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids with Metal-Coordinating Groups Yield High; Non-Coordinating Groups Yield Low**

    This focuses on the presence of functional groups (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl) that can coordinate with the metal catalyst, leading to high yield.

- **Advice 2**: **Combine Overlapping Rules Related to Heterocyclic and Conjugated Systems**

  **Issue**: Rules 3, 9, and 15 all deal with heterocyclic or conjugated aromatic systems yielding high due to enhanced coordination but are fragmented.

  **Suggestion**:

  - **Create a Unified Rule**: Merge these rules into a single rule that covers modifiers with heterocyclic aromatic systems containing nitrogen or oxygen.
  - **Enhance Clarity and Coverage**: Provide a broader definition that can be applied more generally.

  **Practical Implementation**:

    > **Rule (Combined)**: **Modifiers with Nitrogen or Oxygen-Containing Heterocyclic Aromatic Systems Yield High**

    This consolidated rule simplifies the rule set and encompasses more compounds, improving usability.

- **Advice 3**: **Strengthen Rules with Limited Data by Including More Examples or Revising**

  **Issue**: Rules 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, and 15 have limited supporting data, reducing their reliability.

  **Suggestion**:

  - **Collect Additional Data**: Search for more compounds that fit these rules to validate them.
  - **Revise or Eliminate Weak Rules**: If additional data is not available, consider combining these rules with others or removing them to prevent confusion.

  **Practical Implementation**:

  - For Rule 5 (Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups Yield High), find more examples or integrate it with Rule 1 or Rule 4 if appropriate.
  - For Rule 6 (Thiol Groups), assess whether the effect is significant across more data points.
  - Focus on rules with strong support and practical significance.

- **Advice 4**: **Address Contradictions in Rules Involving Methoxy Groups**

  **Issue**: Rule 14 states that modifiers with methoxy groups without coordinating substituents yield low, yet an example provided yields high.

  **Suggestion**:

  - **Reevaluate the Rule**: Examine the data to understand why exceptions occur.
  - **Clarify Exceptions**: If other functional groups contribute to high yield despite the presence of methoxy groups, note this in the rule.

  **Practical Implementation**:

    - Modify the rule to:

      > **Rule (Revised)**: **Modifiers with Methoxy Groups Yield Low Unless Accompanied by Strong Metal-Coordinating Functionalities**

    - Provide explanations for exceptions to guide proper application.

- **Advice 5**: **Enhance Physical-Chemical Insights in Rules**

  **Issue**: Some rules lack detailed explanations, which can limit understanding and application.

  **Suggestion**:

  - **Include Mechanistic Rationale**: Add explanations on how specific groups influence the reaction, such as electronic effects, steric hindrance, or solubility factors.
  - **Link to Catalyst Interaction**: Describe how modifiers affect the coordination environment of the metal center.

  **Practical Implementation**:

  - For each rule, include a brief discussion of the underlying chemistry.
  - For example, in the revised Rule 2, explain that metal-coordinating groups can form coordination bonds with the Fe center, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Advice 6**: **Prioritize Rules Based on Data Strength and Predictive Power**

  **Issue**: Not all rules are equally robust or valuable for predictions.

  **Suggestion**:

  - **Focus on High-Confidence Rules**: Emphasize rules with strong data support and clear trends.
  - **Simplify the Rule Set**: Remove or consolidate less reliable rules to make the set more user-friendly.

  **Practical Implementation**:

  - Create a tiered rule set where primary rules have strong support, and secondary rules are used with caution.
  - Ensure that the rules included are those that consistently predict the yield outcome based on the dataset.

- **Advice 7**: **Include Structural Features in SMILES-Based Rules**

  **Issue**: To practically apply the rules, specific structural identifiers need to be translated into SMILES patterns.

  **Suggestion**:

  - **Define SMILES Substructures**: For each rule, specify the SMILES patterns corresponding to the functional groups or motifs described.
  - **Use SMARTS Notation for Substructures**: Incorporate SMARTS patterns to identify functional groups within SMILES strings.

  **Practical Implementation**:

  - For example, in the revised Rule 2:

    - Metal-coordinating groups can be identified by SMARTS patterns for amino (`[NH2]`), nitro (`[N+](=O)[O-]`), or bromomethyl (`[CH2]Br`) substituents at the para position.
  
  - Provide these patterns alongside the rules to facilitate computational screening.

- **Advice 8**: **Ensure Consistent Terminology and Definitions**

  **Issue**: Inconsistent use of terms (e.g., 'long-chain' vs. specific carbon numbers) can cause confusion.

  **Suggestion**:

  - **Standardize Definitions**: Use consistent terminology for chain lengths, functional group positions, and substituent types.
  - **Specify Carbon Counts**: When referring to chain lengths, provide exact numbers (e.g., C4-C5 for short chains, C6+ for long chains).

  **Practical Implementation**:

  - Update rules to include precise definitions.
  - For example, revise Rule 1 to specify "carbon chain lengths of exactly 4 or 5 carbons".

- **Advice 9**: **Incorporate Negative Rules Where Appropriate**

  **Issue**: Some compounds consistently yield low, and identifying these can prevent ineffective modifications.

  **Suggestion**:

  - **Explicitly State Negative Predictors**: Define structures or functional groups that reliably result in low yields.
  - **Balance Positive and Negative Rules**: This will improve the overall predictive power of the rule set.

  **Practical Implementation**:

  - For example, create a rule such as:

    > **Rule**: **Modifiers with Polyether Chains Yield Low**

    - Clearly list such structures to avoid in future designs.

- **Advice 10**: **Validate and Update Rules with Ongoing Data**

  **Issue**: As new data becomes available, rules may need adjustments.

  **Suggestion**:

  - **Implement Continuous Validation**: Regularly test rules against new compounds.
  - **Be Open to Refinement**: Update rules to reflect new findings and improve accuracy.

  **Practical Implementation**:

  - Establish a feedback mechanism where experimental results are used to validate and refine the rules over time.
  - Encourage collaboration between experimentalists and modelers to maintain an up-to-date rule set.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Short-Chain Aliphatic Amino Acids Yield High; Longer-Chain Analogs Yield Low**

  Modifiers that are aliphatic amino acids with a carbon chain length of 4 or 5 carbons and an amino group at the α-position result in high yield. Longer-chain amino acids (6 carbons or more) yield low. This may be due to optimal coordination and minimal steric hindrance with the catalyst for shorter chains.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)
      - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)
      - 5-aminopentanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:**
      - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
      - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
      - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 2**: **Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing, Metal-Coordinating Groups Yield High; Electron-Donating or Non-Coordinating Groups Yield Low**

  Modifiers that are benzoic acid derivatives with electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position capable of coordinating with metal centers (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl) result in high yield. Those with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy) or non-coordinating substituents yield low. Coordination enhances interaction with the catalyst.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 4-aminobenzoic acid
      - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
      - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-methylbenzoic acid
      - 4-formylbenzoic acid
      - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 3**: **Nitrogen-Containing Heterocyclic Carboxylic Acids Yield High**

  Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids with nitrogen-containing aromatic rings, such as pyridine and pyrazole carboxylic acids, result in high yield. Their ability to coordinate with metal centers enhances catalytic activity.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Niacin)
      - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
      - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 4**: **Straight-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Yield High; Addition of Polar Functional Groups Lowers Yield**

  Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups result in high yield. Introducing polar groups like hydroxyl or amino decreases the yield, potentially due to altered solubility or interference with catalyst coordination.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - Octanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
      - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
      - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups on Short Chains Yield High; Single Hydroxyl on Long Chains Yields Low**

  Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups on short aliphatic chains enhance solubility and interaction with the catalyst, resulting in high yield. A single hydroxyl group on a longer chain does not have the same effect and yields low.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid

- **Rule 6**: **Aliphatic Thiol Groups Yield High; Aromatic Thiol Groups Yield Low**

  Modifiers with thiol (–SH) groups on aliphatic chains result in high yield, likely due to effective coordination with the metal catalyst. Thiol groups attached to aromatic rings may lead to catalyst poisoning or deactivation, yielding low.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 7**: **Highly Fluorinated Aliphatic Chains Yield Low**

  Modifiers with multiple fluorine atoms in aliphatic chains result in low yield. The strong electronegativity and hydrophobic nature of fluorinated chains can reduce interactions with the catalyst and hinder the reaction.

  *Example:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with Carbonyl Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acids Yield Low**

  Modifiers possessing aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acids tend to yield low. These carbonyl groups might chelate with the metal catalyst or participate in side reactions, reducing catalytic efficiency.

  *Examples:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-formylbenzoic acid
      - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
      - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with Extended Conjugation Involving Heterocycles Yield High**

  Modifiers containing extended conjugated systems with oxygen or nitrogen heterocycles enhance electron delocalization and coordination with the catalyst, resulting in high yield.

  *Example:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 10**: **Hydroxyphenyl Groups Connected by Long Aliphatic Chains Yield High; Short Chains Yield Low**

  Modifiers with hydroxyphenyl groups linked by aliphatic chains of five or more carbons to a carboxylic acid yield high, possibly due to increased flexibility and optimal interaction with the catalyst. Shorter chains may not provide this advantage.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with Polyether Chains Yield Low**

  Modifiers containing polyether chains, such as methoxyethoxy units, result in low yield. These moieties may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorable solvation effects, impeding effective catalyst interaction.

  *Example:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid

- **Rule 12**: **Bulky Non-Coordinating Substituents Yield Low**

  Modifiers with bulky substituents that cannot effectively coordinate with the metal catalyst lead to low yield. Steric hindrance may prevent proper interaction with the active sites.

  *Examples:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
      - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 13**: **Aromatic Rings with Amino Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acids Yield High**

  Modifiers where an amino group is directly attached to an aromatic ring adjacent to a carboxylic acid enhance metal coordination, resulting in high yield.

  *Example:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 4-aminobenzoic acid

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with Methoxy Groups Without Coordinating Substituents Yield Low**

  Modifiers featuring methoxy groups attached to aromatic rings or aliphatic chains yield low if they lack other coordinating groups. Methoxy groups are electron-donating but do not coordinate effectively with metal catalysts.

  *Examples:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
      - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid (Note: Despite containing methoxy groups, this compound yields high, possibly due to other contributing factors.)

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with Fused Nitrogen Heterocyclic Aromatic Systems Yield High**

  Modifiers containing fused aromatic systems with nitrogen heterocycles (e.g., indole ring in tryptophan) can delocalize electrons and coordinate with metal centers effectively, yielding high.

  *Example:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Refine the SMARTS pattern for Rule 7 to accurately represent highly fluorinated aliphatic chains**. The current pattern `'[CX4](F)(F)(F)'` matches any trifluoromethyl group, including those attached to non-aliphatic carbons (e.g., attached directly to heteroatoms or aromatic rings). Rule 7 specifies that modifiers with multiple fluorine atoms in *aliphatic chains* yield low. Update the SMARTS pattern to capture fluorinated aliphatic chains with multiple fluorinated carbons, such as `'[*][C;R0;X4](F)(F)[C;R0;X4](F)(F)[*]'`, which looks for consecutive aliphatic carbons each bearing fluorines.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Adjust the code for Rule 4 to accurately identify straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids and the presence of additional polar functional groups**. The current code may incorrectly assign high or low yields without properly checking for chain branching or ring structures. Modify the SMARTS for straight-chain carboxylic acids to exclude rings and branches, e.g., `'C(-C)(-C)-C(=O)[O;H1,-]'`. Additionally, ensure the code checks for the absence of any other functional groups besides the terminal carboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Improve the chain length calculation in `check_rule1` for Rule 1**. The current function `get_chain_length_from_alpha` may not accurately calculate the chain length from the alpha carbon to the terminal carbon, potentially including side chains or overestimating the chain length. Refine the function to trace the longest linear carbon chain starting from the alpha carbon, excluding branches. Utilize breadth-first search (BFS) limiting traversal to acyclic, aliphatic carbon atoms.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Enhance the SMARTS patterns in Rule 2 to ensure correct identification of para-substituted benzoic acids with coordinating groups**. The current code may not specifically check that the substituents are at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid group. Update the SMARTS to `'c1cc([$(N),$(N(=O)=O),$(CBr)])ccc1C(=O)[O;H1,-]'`, where `[$(N),$(N(=O)=O),$(CBr)]` represents the amino, nitro, or bromomethyl groups at the para position.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Refine the handling of Rule 5 to distinguish between multiple hydroxyl groups on short chains and single hydroxyl groups on long chains**. The current code might not accurately differentiate chain lengths or the number of hydroxyl groups. Implement more specific SMARTS patterns to check for short aliphatic chains (e.g., 5 carbons or fewer) with two or more hydroxyl groups, such as `'[C&R0]-[C&R0]-[C&R0]-[C&R0]-C(=O)[O;H1,-]'` with multiple `-OH` groups attached.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Implement the remaining rules (8 to 15) in the code to provide a complete feature matrix**. This will enable a thorough evaluation of the transformation effectiveness. Each rule should have a corresponding function, similar to `check_rule1` to `check_rule7`, with appropriate SMARTS patterns and logic based on the natural language descriptions.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Update the SMARTS pattern for Rule 13 to accurately identify aromatic rings with amino groups adjacent to carboxylic acids**. The current pattern `'[c][NX3;H2,H1][c][C](=O)[O;H1,-]'` may not correctly capture all relevant molecules. Modify it to `'c1ccc([NH2])cc1C(=O)[O;H1,-]'` to ensure the amino group is directly attached to the aromatic ring and adjacent (ortho or para) to the carboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Ensure that the context and connectivity of functional groups are correctly considered in all SMARTS patterns**. For example, in Rule 7, the fluorine atoms should be attached to carbons within an aliphatic chain, not to carbons of functional groups like carbonyls or aromatic systems. Adjust patterns to check for fluorine substitutions along linear aliphatic chains.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Validate and test the SMARTS patterns against known positive and negative examples**. For each rule, create a set of test molecules that should match or not match the SMARTS patterns. This will help verify that the patterns are accurately capturing the intended structures and can be adjusted based on test results.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Consider advanced features like recursive SMARTS or molecular fingerprints for complex rules**. For rules involving extended conjugation (Rule 9) or fused aromatic heterocycles (Rule 15), simple SMARTS patterns may be insufficient. Use recursive SMARTS or substructure searches that can capture these more complex molecular features.

- This indicates that when the rule conditions are met, there is approximately a **59.19% chance** of correctly predicting the outcome.
- The confidence level remains **moderate** but has not significantly improved.

---

**Lift:**

- **Current Train Lift:** **1.1849**
- **Previous Train Lift:** **1.2048**, **1.0559**

*Interpretation:*

- The current lift is **slightly below** the first previous value and **above** the second.
- A lift value **greater than 1** signifies that the rule is **better than random chance** at predicting the outcome.
- The **current lift** reflects a **moderate association**, similar to previous iterations.

---

**Leverage:**

- **Current Train Leverage:** **0.0095**
- **Previous Train Leverage:** **0.0289**, **-0.0041**

*Interpretation:*

- The current leverage is **lower** than the first previous value but **higher** than the second, which was negative.
- **Positive leverage** indicates the rule has predictive power **above chance**, but the small value suggests the association is **weak**.

---

### **Overall Performance Assessment**

- **Support Decrease:** The drop in support suggests the rules are covering **fewer data instances**, potentially affecting the rules' **generalizability** and **practical usefulness**.
- **Confidence Stability:** Confidence remains at a **moderate level**, indicating **no significant improvement** in the accuracy of the predictions when the rule conditions are satisfied.
- **Lift Consistency:** The lift values have remained relatively **stable**, showing **no substantial enhancement** in the rules’ ability to predict the outcome compared to the prior probability.
- **Leverage Weakness:** The low leverage value points to a **limited increase** in the rule’s predictive power over random chance.

---

### **Local Minimum Consideration**

- The metrics suggest that the current iteration has **not achieved significant improvements** over previous iterations.
- The **stagnation** in confidence and lift, coupled with the **reduced support**, indicates that we may have reached a **local minimum** in rule performance.
- **Further iterations** using the current approach may yield **diminishing returns**, suggesting a need to **re-evaluate** the strategy.

---

### **Recommendations for Rule Improvement**

To enhance the current rules' performance, the following strategies are recommended:

1. **Expand Rule Coverage (Increase Support):**
   - **Generalize Rule Conditions:**
     - Broaden specific conditions within the rules to **encompass a wider range** of data points.
     - **Combine similar rules** to reduce redundancy and increase overall support.
   - **Example Action:**
     - For rules that specify exact chain lengths or positions, consider using **ranges** or **patterns** to include more compounds.

2. **Enhance Predictive Accuracy (Improve Confidence and Lift):**
   - **Identify Strong Predictors:**
     - Utilize statistical techniques (e.g., **correlation analysis, feature importance metrics**) to pinpoint variables with the **strongest influence** on the outcome.
     - Focus on these variables when formulating or modifying rules.
   - **Optimize Rule Conditions:**
     - Refine existing rules to **eliminate ambiguity** and enhance specificity where it contributes to higher confidence.

3. **Mitigate Overfitting Risks:**
   - **Simplify Rules:**
     - Avoid overly complex rules that may not generalize well to new data.
     - Ensure each rule has a balance between **complexity and generalizability**.
   - **Cross-Validation:**
     - Employ cross-validation techniques to test the rules on multiple subsets of data, ensuring they perform consistently.

4. **Integrate Additional Data or Features:**
   - **Expand Dataset:**
     - Incorporate more data points, possibly from **external datasets**, to provide a richer basis for rule generation.
   - **Add Relevant Features:**
     - Consider additional chemical descriptors or properties (e.g., **lipophilicity, electronic effects**) that may influence catalytic activity.

5. **Explore Alternative Rule-Induction Methods:**
   - **Machine Learning Algorithms:**
     - Use algorithms such as **decision trees, random forests, or association rule mining** to uncover patterns not evident through manual rule creation.
   - **Unsupervised Learning:**
     - Apply clustering methods to identify **natural groupings** in the data that may inform new rules.

6. **Re-evaluate Current Rules:**
   - **Rule Testing and Validation:**
     - Systematically test each rule against the data to assess its individual performance.
     - **Eliminate or revise** rules that contribute minimally or negatively to overall metrics.
   - **Incorporate Feedback:**
     - Engage domain experts to review the rules for **chemical plausibility** and **practical relevance**.

---

### **Specific Suggestions Based on Current Rules**

- **Rule Consolidation:**
  - **Merge overlapping rules** to reduce complexity and improve support.
  - For example, Rules 1, 4, and 5 all deal with **chain length and functional group presence**; consider combining them into a comprehensive rule regarding aliphatic chain modifiers.
  
- **Adjust Rule Specificity:**
  - **Broaden overly specific conditions** to include more compounds.
  - For instance, Rules 7 and 11 focus on specific substituents (fluorination, polyethers) yielding low. Generalizing to "Modifications that increase steric hindrance or electronegativity reduce yield" could cover more cases.

- **Reconsider Underperforming Rules:**
  - **Eliminate or revise rules** that contribute to low support without significantly improving confidence or lift.
  - Rules with **limited examples** or **exceptions** (e.g., Rule 14) may need refinement.

- **Incorporate Positive Interactions:**
  - Identify combinations of features that **synergistically enhance** catalytic performance.
  - For example, modifiers with **both electron-donating groups and metal-coordinating abilities**.

---

### **Conclusion**

The analysis indicates that the current set of rules has **not substantially improved** in terms of confidence and lift when compared to previous iterations, and the **decrease in support** suggests a **narrowing applicability**. To progress beyond this **local minimum**, it is essential to:

- **Reassess and broaden the rules** to cover more data points without sacrificing predictive power.
- **Leverage advanced analytical methods** and incorporate additional data to uncover new patterns.
- **Balance specificity and generality** to enhance both the practical utility and the predictive accuracy of the rules.

By implementing these recommendations, we can aim to develop a set of rules that not only predict high yields with greater confidence and reliability but also apply to a broader range of modifiers, thereby enhancing the overall effectiveness of the catalytic research program.

---

**Next Steps:**

- **Collaborate with team members** to discuss these findings and decide on the most feasible strategies to implement.
- **Prioritize actions** that are likely to yield the most significant improvements in rule performance.
- **Schedule iterative reviews** after implementing changes to continually assess progress and adjust the approach as needed.

ML Commenter Message:
# Performance Evaluation of Current Rules

Upon reviewing the latest training results, several critical observations can be made regarding the performance of the current rules:

- **Significant Drop in Validation Accuracy**: The current 5-fold validation accuracy is **0.457**, which is substantially lower than the previous reference validation accuracies of **approximately 0.76**. Similarly, the test accuracy has decreased from values like **0.75** to **0.625** or even lower in previous runs.

- **Indication of Underfitting**: The marked decrease in validation accuracy suggests that the current rules are not capturing the underlying patterns necessary for accurate predictions. This underperformance implies that the model may be **underfitting**, struggling to generalize from the training data to unseen data.

- **Ineffectiveness of Current Rules**: The existing set of rules appears insufficient for the complexity of the dataset. The rules may be too simplistic, overly broad, or missing critical chemical features that influence the catalyst modifier loading.

# SHAP Analysis and Detailed Insights

The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values provide insights into how each rule contributes to the model's predictions for individual molecules. By analyzing the SHAP values, we can identify which rules are contributing to mispredictions and need refinement.

## Analyzing Misclassifications

### Underestimations (Predicted Low, Experimental High)

In these cases, the model predicts a **low loading**, but the experimental value shows a **high loading**. According to the guidance, the rule with the most **negative SHAP value** for high loading is likely attributing to the underestimation.

#### Examples:

1. **Molecule**: `C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N`
   - **Rule2 SHAP**: +0.03748
   - **Rule5 SHAP**: **-0.03748**
   - **Analysis**: Rule 5 has a negative SHAP value, suggesting it's pushing the prediction towards low loading. This indicates that Rule 5 may not be adequately accounting for the features of this molecule.

2. **Molecule**: `C([C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](C(=O)O)O)O)O)O)O`
   - **Rule2 SHAP**: +0.03748
   - **Rule5 SHAP**: **-0.03748**
   - **Analysis**: Similar to the first molecule, Rule 5 negatively impacts the prediction, leading to underestimation.

3. **Molecule**: `C1=CC(=C(C=C1C=O)C(=O)O)O`
   - **Rule2 SHAP**: -0.43682
   - **Rule5 SHAP**: -0.06317
   - **Analysis**: Both Rule 2 and Rule 5 have negative SHAP values, with Rule 2 having a more significant impact. This suggests issues with both rules for this molecule.

4. **Molecule**: `C1=CNC(=O)C=C1C(=O)O`
   - **Rule2 SHAP**: **-0.04548**
   - **Rule5 SHAP**: -0.05451
   - **Analysis**: Rule 2 has a notable negative SHAP value, indicating it may be incorrectly influencing the prediction towards low loading.

### Overestimations (Predicted High, Experimental Low)

In these cases, the model predicts a **high loading**, but the experimental value shows a **low loading**. The rule with the most **positive SHAP value** for high loading is likely causing the overestimation.

#### Examples:

1. **Molecule**: `C(CCCO)CCC(=O)O`
   - **Rule2 SHAP**: -0.00214
   - **Rule5 SHAP**: **+0.06642**
   - **Analysis**: Rule 5 has a positive SHAP value, pushing the prediction towards high loading when it should be low, indicating a potential issue with Rule 5.

2. **Molecule**: `C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O`
   - **Rule2 SHAP**: +0.03122
   - **Rule5 SHAP**: **+0.30211**
   - **Analysis**: Rule 5 is significantly contributing to the overestimation, suggesting it may need refinement.

3. **Molecule**: `C(CCCO)CC(=O)O`
   - **Rule2 SHAP**: -0.01567
   - **Rule5 SHAP**: **+0.08718**
   - **Analysis**: Positive SHAP value from Rule 5 leads to overestimation.

## Patterns Identified

- **Rule 5**:
  - Frequently exhibits **negative SHAP values** in underestimations and **positive SHAP values** in overestimations.
  - Suggests that Rule 5 is contributing inconsistently to the predictions, leading to misclassifications.

- **Rule 2**:
  - Shows significant **negative SHAP values** in several underestimations.
  - Indicates that Rule 2 might be suppressing the prediction of high loading when it is actually high.

# Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment

The substantial decrease in validation accuracy without evidence of high training accuracy suggests that the model is **underfitting**. This means:

- The model lacks complexity to capture the underlying data patterns.
- The current rules do not encompass all necessary features influencing the target variable.
- Additional rules or features may be required to improve predictive performance.

# Recommendations for Improvement

Based on the SHAP analysis and performance evaluation, the following recommendations are proposed to enhance the current rules:

## 1. Refine Rule 5

### **Current Rule 5**:

- **Description**: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on short chains yield high; single hydroxyl on long chains yields low.
- **Issue**: Rule 5 contributes to both overestimations and underestimations, indicating that it may be too general or misclassified.

### **Suggested Refinements**:

- **Specify Chain Length and Hydroxyl Positions**:
  - Precisely define what constitutes a "short chain" (e.g., chains with 3-5 carbons).
  - Detail the positions of hydroxyl groups that promote high loading.
  - Example: *Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on chains of 3-5 carbons, with hydroxyls at adjacent carbons, yield high loading.*

- **Introduce Exceptions**:
  - Identify molecules that do not conform to Rule 5 and adjust the rule to exclude them.
  - For instance, molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups but additional functional groups that interfere with loading should be excluded.

- **Consider Steric Effects**:
  - Assess how steric hindrance from bulky groups may affect the applicability of Rule 5.
  - Modify the rule to account for steric factors that could lower loading despite multiple hydroxyl groups.

## 2. Adjust Rule 2

### **Current Rule 2**:

- **Description**: Para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing, metal-coordinating groups yield high; electron-donating or non-coordinating groups yield low.
- **Issue**: Rule 2 sometimes incorrectly contributes to low loading predictions when the experimental value is high.

### **Suggested Refinements**:

- **Clarify Electron-Withdrawing Groups**:
  - Provide a specific list of substituents considered electron-withdrawing and capable of metal coordination.
  - Example: *Nitro, amino, and halogen groups at the para position yield high loading.*

- **Differentiate between Substituents**:
  - Recognize that not all electron-withdrawing groups equally impact loading.
  - Adjust the rule to reflect the relative strength of different substituents.

- **Incorporate Ortho and Meta Positions**:
  - Consider the effect of substituents at positions other than para.
  - Expand the rule to include molecules where the position of the substituent influences loading.

## 3. Introduce Additional Rules

### **Identify Missing Chemical Features**:

- **Heterocyclic Compounds**: Some underestimations involve heterocyclic carboxylic acids. Develop rules that better capture the behavior of such compounds.
  - **New Rule Suggestion**: *Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids with ring systems capable of resonance stabilization yield high loading.*

### **Address Long-Chain Aliphatic Acids**:

- The molecule `CCCCCCCC(=O)O` (octanoic acid) is underestimated. Consider adding or refining a rule to capture the effect of longer aliphatic chains.

  - **New Rule Suggestion**: *Long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (7 carbons or more) without polar functional groups yield high loading due to increased hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst.*

## 4. Improve Generalization

### **Avoid Overfitting Specific Cases**:

- Ensure that rules are not overly tailored to specific molecules at the expense of general applicability.
  
### **Increase Rule Complexity Where Necessary**:

- Introduce quantitative descriptors or thresholds (e.g., electronegativity values, pKa ranges) to make rules more precise.

### **Consider Multivariate Interactions**:

- Explore rules that account for interactions between multiple functional groups within a molecule.
  
## 5. Utilize SHAP Analysis for Rule Refinement

### **Iterative Refinement Process**:

- Continue using SHAP values to identify problematic rules in future iterations.
- Focus on rules that consistently contribute to mispredictions.

### **Feedback Loop Between Model and Rules**:

- Use model performance and SHAP insights to inform rule adjustments.
- After modifying rules, retrain the model and reassess SHAP contributions.

## 6. Re-Evaluate Molecules with High Misclassification Rates

### **Investigate Outliers**:

- Examine molecules that are frequently misclassified to identify unique features not captured by current rules.

### **Potentially Exclude or Specially Treat Outliers**:

- If certain molecules do not conform to any rule patterns, consider treating them as exceptions or developing specific rules.

# Conclusion

The current set of rules demonstrates limitations in accurately predicting the catalyst modifier loading, as evidenced by the decreased validation accuracy and SHAP analysis. To address these issues:

- **Refine existing rules** like Rule 5 and Rule 2 to be more precise and better reflect the chemical behavior influencing loading.
- **Introduce new rules** to capture missing features and improve the model's ability to generalize.
- **Use SHAP analysis** systematically to guide rule adjustments and understand the impact of each rule.
- **Adopt an iterative approach** to model training and rule refinement, ensuring continuous improvement in predictive performance.

By implementing these recommendations, it is anticipated that the model's accuracy will improve, moving closer to or surpassing previous validation accuracies. Continuously refining the rules based on empirical evidence and model feedback will enhance the robustness and reliability of the predictive framework for catalyst modifier loading.

The current set of rules for predicting the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction shows suboptimal performance, as evidenced by the metrics and analyses provided:

- **Significant Drop in Validation Accuracy**: The 5-fold validation accuracy has decreased to **45.71%**, a notable decline from previous accuracies of approximately **76%**. This indicates that the model's predictive capability has diminished.
  
- **SHAP Analysis Highlights Misclassifications**: The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis reveals that certain rules, particularly **Rule 2** and **Rule 5**, are contributing to both overestimations and underestimations of the modifier loading on the catalyst. This inconsistency suggests that these rules may not be accurately capturing the underlying chemical behavior.

- **Underfitting Indication**: The low validation accuracy, coupled with no evidence of overfitting (i.e., training accuracy is not significantly higher than validation accuracy), suggests that the model is underfitting. It lacks the complexity necessary to model the data adequately.

**2. Analysis of Specific Rules**

- **Rule 2 (Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids)**:
  - **Issue**: Rule 2 sometimes incorrectly predicts low loading for molecules that experimentally have high loading. The SHAP values indicate that Rule 2 contributes negatively in these cases.
  - **Possible Cause**: The current SMARTS patterns may not be accurately identifying all relevant functional groups or their positions, particularly the para-substitution pattern and metal-coordinating capabilities.

- **Rule 5 (Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups)**:
  - **Issue**: Rule 5 contributes to misclassifications by both overestimating and underestimating the yield. It seems to inconsistently predict the effect of hydroxyl groups on different chain lengths.
  - **Possible Cause**: The rule may be too general or not adequately specifying the effect of chain length and the number or position of hydroxyl groups.

**3. Suggestions to Improve Current Rules**

**A. Refine Rule 2**

- **Clarify Substituent Positions**: Ensure that the SMARTS patterns specifically identify para-substituted benzoic acids. Modify the pattern to target substituents at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid group.

- **Update Metal-Coordinating Groups**: Expand or refine the list of electron-withdrawing, metal-coordinating substituents. Explicitly include groups known to coordinate with metals (e.g., amino, nitro, halogens like bromine).

- **Consider Other Positions**: Examine whether substitutions at ortho or meta positions affect yield and update the rule accordingly.

**B. Refine Rule 5**

- **Specify Chain Length and Hydroxyl Group Count**: Clearly define what constitutes a "short chain" (e.g., 3-5 carbons) and stipulate the minimum number of hydroxyl groups required to impact yield positively.

- **Detail Hydroxyl Group Positions**: Indicate that hydroxyl groups should be on adjacent carbons or in specific configurations that favor interaction with the catalyst.

- **Exclude Confounding Functional Groups**: Modify the rule to exclude molecules where additional functional groups negate the positive effect of multiple hydroxyl groups.

**C. Introduce New Rules or Modify Existing Ones**

- **Rule for Heterocyclic Compounds with Metal-Coordinating Ability**:
  - **Suggestion**: Develop a rule that captures the behavior of nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids, as they have shown high yield due to their ability to coordinate with metal centers.

- **Rule for Long-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids**:
  - **Suggestion**: Create or adjust a rule that addresses long-chain aliphatic acids without polar functional groups, which may yield high due to hydrophobic interactions enhancing catalyst interaction.

**D. Improve SMARTS Patterns Across Rules**

- **Ensure Accurate Representation**: Review and update all SMARTS patterns to precisely match the chemical structures described in the rules. This includes correctly capturing chain lengths, functional group positions, and connectivity.

- **Test SMARTS Patterns**: Validate the updated SMARTS patterns against a set of known molecules to ensure they match the intended structures and exclude incorrect ones.

**E. Incorporate Additional Chemical Descriptors**

- **Consider Steric and Electronic Effects**: Introduce descriptors or thresholds for steric hindrance (e.g., branching, bulky groups) and electronic properties (e.g., electronegativity, resonance effects) to enhance rule specificity.

- **Utilize Quantitative Structure-Property Relationships (QSPR)**: Integrate quantitative data where possible to refine rules based on measurable properties.

**F. Re-evaluate and Simplify Rules**

- **Consolidate Overlapping Rules**: Combine rules that cover similar chemical features to increase support and reduce complexity.

- **Eliminate Redundant or Ineffective Rules**: Remove rules that do not contribute significantly to improving predictive performance or that have low support and confidence.

**4. Potential for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

There is potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting:

- **Addressing Underfitting**: Since the model is underfitting, increasing its complexity by refining the rules should improve performance. This involves making the rules more precise and better aligned with the underlying chemical principles.

- **Balancing Specificity and Generality**: By carefully refining the rules to be neither too broad nor too narrow, we can improve the model's ability to generalize without overfitting.

- **Iterative Testing and Validation**: Applying changes iteratively and validating the model's performance at each step helps prevent overfitting.

- **Incorporating Domain Expertise**: Collaborating with chemists to ensure that the rules make chemical sense can improve their effectiveness and applicability.

---

**Conclusion**

The current analysis indicates that the rules can be further optimized to enhance the model's predictive capabilities. By refining the existing rules, introducing new ones where necessary, and improving the specificity of SMARTS patterns, we can address the underfitting issue and improve both the accuracy and reliability of the predictions.

  Modifiers that are aliphatic amino acids with a carbon chain length of 4 or 5 carbons and an amino group at the α-position result in high yield. Longer-chain amino acids (6 carbons or more) yield low. This may be due to optimal coordination and minimal steric hindrance with the catalyst for shorter chains.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)
      - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)

      - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
      - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 4**: **Straight-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Yield High; Addition of Polar Functional Groups Lowers Yield**

  Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups result in high yield. Introducing polar groups like hydroxyl or amino decreases the yield, potentially due to altered solubility or interference with catalyst coordination.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - Octanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
      - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
      - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups on Short Chains Yield High; Single Hydroxyl on Long Chains Yields Low**

  Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups on short aliphatic chains enhance solubility and interaction with the catalyst, resulting in high yield. A single hydroxyl group on a longer chain does not have the same effect and yields low.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid

- **Rule 6**: **Aliphatic Thiol Groups Yield High; Aromatic Thiol Groups Yield Low**

  Modifiers with thiol (–SH) groups on aliphatic chains result in high yield, likely due to effective coordination with the metal catalyst. Thiol groups attached to aromatic rings may lead to catalyst poisoning or deactivation, yielding low.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 7**: **Highly Fluorinated Aliphatic Chains Yield Low**

  Modifiers with multiple fluorine atoms in aliphatic chains result in low yield. The strong electronegativity and hydrophobic nature of fluorinated chains can reduce interactions with the catalyst and hinder the reaction.

  *Example:*

      - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 10**: **Hydroxyphenyl Groups Connected by Long Aliphatic Chains Yield High; Short Chains Yield Low**

  Modifiers with hydroxyphenyl groups linked by aliphatic chains of five or more carbons to a carboxylic acid yield high, possibly due to increased flexibility and optimal interaction with the catalyst. Shorter chains may not provide this advantage.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with Polyether Chains Yield Low**

  Modifiers containing polyether chains, such as methoxyethoxy units, result in low yield. These moieties may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorable solvation effects, impeding effective catalyst interaction.

  *Example:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid

- **Rule 12**: **Bulky Non-Coordinating Substituents Yield Low**

  Modifiers with bulky substituents that cannot effectively coordinate with the metal catalyst lead to low yield. Steric hindrance may prevent proper interaction with the active sites.

  *Examples:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
      - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 13**: **Aromatic Rings with Amino Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acids Yield High**

  Modifiers where an amino group is directly attached to an aromatic ring adjacent to a carboxylic acid enhance metal coordination, resulting in high yield.

  *Example:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 4-aminobenzoic acid

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with Methoxy Groups Without Coordinating Substituents Yield Low**

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Refine Rule 2 for Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids**

  - **Update SMARTS Patterns**: Modify the SMARTS patterns in Rule 2 to specifically identify para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing, metal-coordinating groups at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid.
    - **Include Metal-Coordinating Groups**: Ensure the patterns include substituents like amino (`-NH2`), nitro (`-NO2`), halogens (e.g., bromo), and bromomethyl groups.
    - **Exclude Electron-Donating Groups**: Exclude modifiers with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy) or non-coordinating substituents.
  - **Example SMARTS Pattern for High Yield**:
    - `C1=CC([NX3;H2,H1;!$(N-C=O),OX1,O,NX2])=CC=C1C(=O)O`  
      - This pattern matches benzoic acids with a metal-coordinating group (N or O donor) at the para position.
  - **Validation**: Test the updated SMARTS patterns against known high and low yield modifiers to ensure accurate classification.

- **Advice 2**: **Refine Rule 5 for Multiple Hydroxyl Groups on Short Chains**

  - **Specify Chain Length and Hydroxyl Count**: Define "short aliphatic chains" as chains with 5 or fewer carbons and specify that high yield requires multiple (e.g., 3 or more) hydroxyl groups.
  - **Detail Hydroxyl Group Positions**: Indicate that hydroxyl groups should be on adjacent carbons to enhance interaction with the catalyst.
  - **Update SMARTS Pattern**:
    - High Yield: `O[C@@H]([C@@H](O)[C@@H](O)[C@H](O)CO)C(=O)O`  
      - Matches modifiers like gluconic acid with multiple hydroxyls on a short chain.
    - Low Yield Exclusion: Ensure that compounds with a single hydroxyl on long chains (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) do not match the high-yield pattern.
  - **Exclude Confounding Functional Groups**: Modify the rule to exclude modifiers with additional polar groups that may interfere with catalyst coordination.

- **Advice 3**: **Improve SMARTS Patterns Across All Rules**

  - **Accurate Representation**: Review and update all SMARTS patterns to precisely match the chemical structures described in the rules.
  - **Testing SMARTS Patterns**: Validate each pattern against known modifiers to confirm they match intended structures and exclude incorrect ones.
  - **Example**: For Rule 1 (Short-Chain Aliphatic Amino Acids):
    - High Yield Pattern: `N[C@@H](C(=O)O)C`  
      - Matches short-chain amino acids like alanine and aspartic acid.
    - Exclude longer chains by limiting the pattern to a specific number of carbons.

- **Advice 4**: **Introduce a New Rule for Nitrogen-Containing Heterocyclic Carboxylic Acids**

  - **Rule Statement**: Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole carboxylic acids) yield high due to effective metal coordination.
  - **SMARTS Pattern**:
    - High Yield: `[nX2]1cccc1C(=O)O`  
      - Matches pyridine carboxylic acids.
    - `[nH]1nccc1C(=O)O`  
      - Matches pyrazole carboxylic acids.
  - **Validation**: Ensure these patterns accurately identify known high-yield modifiers like niacin and exclude non-relevant compounds.

- **Advice 5**: **Adjust Rule 4 for Straight-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids**

  - **Emphasize Chain Length and Lack of Polar Groups**: Specify that high yield is associated with unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups.
  - **Update SMARTS Pattern**:
    - High Yield: `CCCCCCCC(=O)O`  
      - Matches octanoic acid and similar long-chain acids.
    - Exclude Low Yield Modifiers: Modify the pattern to exclude acids with hydroxyl or amino groups (e.g., `C[CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4]C(=O)O`).
  - **Clarify Rule Scope**: Clearly state that the presence of polar groups on the aliphatic chain lowers yield due to interference with catalytic activity.

- **Advice 6**: **Re-evaluate and Simplify Rules**

  - **Consolidate Overlapping Rules**: Identify rules covering similar chemical features (e.g., Rules 9 and 15 regarding heterocycles) and merge them to increase clarity and support.
  - **Remove Ineffective Rules**: Analyze the impact of each rule on the model's performance and eliminate those with low contribution or redundant scope.
  - **Prioritize High-Impact Rules**: Focus on rules that have strong support from both the data and chemical reasoning.

- **Advice 7**: **Incorporate Additional Chemical Descriptors**

  - **Steric Hindrance**: Introduce descriptors for steric bulk (e.g., branching, bulky substituents) to account for modifiers that may hinder catalyst access.
  - **Electronic Effects**: Include parameters like electronegativity or resonance effects to quantify the impact of substituents on metal coordination.
  - **Implement QSPR Models**: Use Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship models to provide a quantitative basis for rule refinement.

- **Advice 8**: **Iteratively Test and Validate Model Improvements**

  - **Retrain the Model**: After refining rules and SMARTS patterns, retrain the model to assess improvements in predictive accuracy.
  - **Cross-Validation**: Use k-fold cross-validation to evaluate model performance and ensure changes address underfitting without overfitting.
  - **SHAP Analysis**: Re-run SHAP analysis to identify any remaining misclassifications and refine rules accordingly.

- **Advice 9**: **Collaborate with Chemists for Expert Input**

  - **Expert Review**: Engage with chemists to ensure that all rules and patterns align with chemical intuition and experimental observations.
  - **Incorporate Feedback**: Use their insights to adjust rules, especially in cases where data is limited or ambiguous.
  - **Continuous Improvement**: Establish a feedback loop for ongoing rule refinement as new data becomes available.

- **Advice 10**: **Document All Changes and Rationales**

  - **Change Log**: Maintain detailed records of all rule modifications, including changes to SMARTS patterns and the reasons behind them.
  - **Version Control**: Use version control systems to track changes and enable rollback if needed.
  - **Transparency**: Ensure documentation is clear and accessible to all team members for collaboration and future reference.

      - 4-aminobenzoic acid
      - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
      - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-methylbenzoic acid
      - 4-methoxybenzoic acid (if present in the dataset)

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with Carbonyl Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acids Yield Low**

      - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
      - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid

- **Rule 5**: **Straight-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Yield High; Addition of Polar Functional Groups at Distal Positions Lowers Yield**

  Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups yield high. Introducing polar groups like hydroxyl or amino at distal (terminal) positions decreases the yield, potentially due to altered solubility or interference with catalyst coordination.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - Octanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
      - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
      - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups on Short Chains Yield High; Single Hydroxyl on Long Chains Yields Low**

  Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups on short aliphatic chains enhance solubility and interaction with the catalyst, resulting in high yield. A single hydroxyl group on longer chains does not have the same effect and yields low, possibly due to insufficient interaction with the catalyst.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid

- **Rule 7**: **Aliphatic Thiol Groups Yield High; Aromatic Thiol Groups Yield Low**

  Modifiers with thiol (–SH) groups on aliphatic chains result in high yield, likely due to effective coordination with the metal catalyst. Thiol groups attached to aromatic rings may lead to catalyst poisoning or deactivation, resulting in low yield.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with Fused Aromatic Systems Yield High**

  Modifiers containing fused aromatic systems, especially those with heteroatoms (e.g., oxygen, nitrogen), enhance electron delocalization and coordination with the catalyst, leading to high yield.

      - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid
      - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with Polyether Chains Yield Low**

  Modifiers featuring polyether chains, such as methoxyethoxy units, result in low yield. These chains may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorable solvation effects, hindering effective catalyst interaction.

  *Example:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with Highly Fluorinated Aliphatic Chains Yield Low**

  Modifiers with multiple fluorine atoms in aliphatic chains yield low. The strong electronegativity and hydrophobic nature of fluorinated chains can reduce interactions with the catalyst and hinder the reaction.

  *Example:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid

- **Rule 11**: **Hydroxyphenyl Groups Connected by Longer Aliphatic Chains Yield High; Shorter Chains Yield Low**

  Modifiers with hydroxyphenyl groups connected to carboxylic acids via aliphatic chains of five or more carbons yield high, possibly due to increased flexibility and optimal interaction with the catalyst. Shorter chains may not provide sufficient separation, resulting in low yield.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with Bulky, Non-Coordinating Substituents Yield Low**

  Modifiers with bulky substituents that cannot effectively coordinate with the metal catalyst lead to low yield. Steric hindrance may prevent proper alignment and interaction with the active sites of the catalyst.

  *Examples:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
      - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with Methoxy Groups Without Additional Coordinating Groups Yield Low**

  Modifiers featuring methoxy groups attached to aromatic rings yield low if they lack other coordinating groups. Methoxy groups are electron-donating but do not coordinate effectively with metal catalysts, possibly reducing catalytic activity.

  *Examples:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
    - **Note:** An exception is 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid, which yields high, possibly due to other functional groups enhancing coordination.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with Fused Nitrogen Heterocycles Yield High**

  Modifiers containing fused nitrogen heterocyclic systems, such as indole rings, can delocalize electrons and coordinate effectively with metal centers, resulting in high yield.

  *Example:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with Aldehyde or Ketone Groups Adjacent to Aromatic Rings Yield Low**

  Modifiers where an aldehyde or ketone group is directly attached to an aromatic ring adjacent to a carboxylic acid tend to yield low, possibly due to competing coordination or deactivating effects on the catalyst.

  *Examples:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-formylbenzoic acid
      - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Reframe Rules Using Quantifiable Molecular Descriptors**

  Modify the existing rules to be based on specific, quantifiable molecular descriptors that can be directly calculated from SMILES strings. For instance, instead of qualitative statements like "short-chain aliphatic amino acids yield high," specify exact parameters such as:

  - Chain length (number of carbon atoms)
  - Position of functional groups (e.g., amino group at the α-position)
  - Degree of branching
  - Presence and position of heteroatoms

  This change allows for easier translation of rules into numeric features suitable for computational modeling.

- **Advice 2**: **Consolidate Overlapping and Redundant Rules**

  Review the current rules to identify and merge those that overlap or convey similar information. For example:

  - **Rule 1** and **Rule 5** both discuss chain length and amino/hydroxyl groups affecting yield.
  - **Rule 4** and **Rule 15** both mention carbonyl groups adjacent to carboxylic acids yielding low.

  Consolidating these rules reduces complexity and prevents confusion, making it easier to generate a structured feature matrix.

- **Advice 3**: **Incorporate Calculable Physicochemical Properties**

  Introduce rules based on physicochemical properties that can be numerically calculated from the molecular structure, such as:

  - Molecular weight
  - LogP (octanol-water partition coefficient)
  - Topological polar surface area (TPSA)
  - Number of hydrogen bond donors (HBD) and acceptors (HBA)
  - Rotatable bond count
  - Aromatic ring count

  These descriptors can be computed using cheminformatics software and can be directly used in numerical models.

- **Advice 4**: **Use Numeric Thresholds and Ranges in Rules**

  Where applicable, define numeric thresholds or ranges within the rules. For example:

  - Modifiers with a chain length of **4–6 carbons** yield high; those with more than **6 carbons** yield low.
  - Modifiers with TPSA values between **50–100 Å²** yield high; outside this range yield low.

  Numeric thresholds make rules precise and facilitate the generation of binary or continuous features.

- **Advice 5**: **Implement SMARTS Patterns for Key Substructures**

  Utilize SMARTS (SMILES Arbitrary Target Specification) patterns to identify and encode key substructures associated with high or low yield. This method allows for automated screening of modifiers based on substructural features, such as:

  - Presence of specific functional groups (e.g., `[NH2][C@@H](C(=O)O)C`, an amino acid backbone)
  - Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position

- **Advice 6**: **Express Rules in Terms of Structural Counts**

  Rephrase rules to focus on counts of specific structural features:

  - Number of amino groups: Modifiers with **1 amino group** yield high; more than **1 amino group** yield low.
  - Number of hydroxyl groups: Modifiers with **2 or more hydroxyl groups** on a chain of **≤6 carbons** yield high.

  Counting features provide straightforward numeric data for modeling.

- **Advice 7**: **Develop a Feature Scoring System**

  Assign numerical scores to modifiers based on the presence of beneficial or detrimental features:

  - +1 point for each nitrogen-containing heterocycle
  - +1 point for each electron-withdrawing group in the para position
  - –1 point for each electron-donating group
  - –1 point for bulky non-coordinating substituents

  Calculate a total score for each modifier to predict yield, which can be directly used in predictive models.

- **Advice 8**: **Adjust or Remove Inconsistent or Low-Support Rules**

  Review and revise rules that have exceptions or are supported by minimal data:

  - If certain modifiers consistently do not follow a rule, investigate and adjust the rule accordingly.
  - Remove rules that apply to only one or two modifiers unless they represent a significant trend.

  This refinement enhances the reliability of the rules.

- **Advice 9**: **Ensure Rules Are Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive**

  Structure the rules so that each modifier fits into one category without overlap, and all possible modifiers are covered:

  - Define clear boundaries between high-yield and low-yield categories.
  - Avoid conflicting rules by prioritizing rules based on their predictive power or statistical significance.

  A well-organized rule set simplifies feature extraction and model development.

- **Advice 10**: **Incorporate QSAR Modeling to Guide Rule Refinement**

  Utilize Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) analysis to statistically correlate molecular descriptors with yield outcomes:

  - Use the dataset to perform regression or classification analysis.
  - Identify which descriptors have the strongest correlation with high yield.
  - Refine rules based on statistical evidence from QSAR results.

  QSAR modeling provides an objective basis for rule optimization.

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Short-Chain Aliphatic Amino Acids with Carboxylic Groups Yield High; Long-Chain Amino Acids Yield Low**

  Modifiers that are short-chain aliphatic amino acids (with 4 or 5 carbons) containing amino groups at the α-position and carboxylic acid groups yield high. These structures allow optimal coordination with the metal catalyst and minimize steric hindrance. In contrast, long-chain amino acids with terminal amino groups yield low, possibly due to ineffective coordination and increased steric hindrance.

  *Examples:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)
    - 5-aminopentanoic acid
  - **Low Yield:**
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid

---

- **Rule 2**: **Benzoic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing Para Substituents Yield High; Electron-Donating Substituents Yield Low**

  Modifiers that are benzoic acid derivatives with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl) yield high. These substituents enhance metal coordination by increasing the electrophilicity of the carboxylate oxygen. Electron-donating groups at the para position (e.g., methyl, methoxy) yield low, as they decrease the effectiveness of coordination with the metal center.

  *Examples:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - 4-aminobenzoic acid
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
    - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - **Low Yield:**
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

---

- **Rule 3**: **Nitrogen-Containing Heterocyclic Carboxylic Acids Yield High**

  Modifiers that are carboxylic acids directly attached to nitrogen-containing heterocycles (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole) result in high yield. The lone pair on the heterocyclic nitrogen can coordinate with the metal catalyst, enhancing catalytic activity. If the nitrogen heterocycle is not directly attached to the carboxyl group, the yield is generally low due to reduced coordination efficiency.

  *Examples:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Niacin)
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - **Low Yield:**
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid

---

- **Rule 4**: **Aliphatic Thiol Carboxylic Acids Yield High; Aromatic Thiol Carboxylic Acids Yield Low**

  Modifiers with thiol (–SH) groups on aliphatic chains yield high due to the thiol's ability to coordinate with the metal catalyst. Aromatic thiol carboxylic acids yield low, potentially because the aromatic system reduces the thiol's availability for coordination or causes catalyst deactivation through strong binding.

  *Examples:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - **Low Yield:**
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

---

- **Rule 5**: **Straight-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Yield High; Terminal Polar Groups Lower Yield**

  Modifiers that are unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups yield high due to favorable interaction with the hydrophobic regions of the catalyst. Introducing polar groups like hydroxyl or amino at the terminal position decreases the yield, possibly by altering solubility or interfering with catalyst binding.

  *Examples:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - Octanoic acid
  - **Low Yield:**
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups on Short Chains Yield High**

  Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups on short aliphatic chains enhance solubility and facilitate multiple hydrogen-bonding interactions with the catalyst, leading to high yield. These interactions can stabilize the modifier-catalyst complex and improve catalytic efficiency.

  *Example:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with Carbonyl Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acids Yield Low**

  Modifiers possessing aldehyde or ketone groups directly adjacent to carboxylic acids tend to yield low. These carbonyl groups may compete with the carboxylate for coordination sites on the metal catalyst or participate in side reactions, decreasing catalytic efficiency.

  *Examples:*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
    - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with Polyether Chains Yield Low**

  Modifiers featuring polyether chains, such as methoxyethoxy units, result in low yield. The flexibility and steric bulk of polyether chains may hinder effective interaction with the catalyst or alter the solvation dynamics unfavorably.

  *Example:*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with Highly Fluorinated Aliphatic Chains Yield Low**

  Modifiers with multiple fluorine atoms in aliphatic chains yield low. The strong electronegativity and hydrophobicity of fluorinated chains can reduce interactions with the catalyst and decrease solubility in the reaction medium.

  *Example:*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid

---

- **Rule 10**: **Hydroxyphenyl Aliphatic Acids with Medium-Length Chains Yield High; Short Chains Yield Low**

  Modifiers with hydroxyphenyl groups connected to carboxylic acids via medium-length aliphatic chains (e.g., five carbons) yield high. The chain length provides optimal flexibility for the hydroxyphenyl group to interact with the catalyst. Shorter chains may not allow effective positioning, resulting in low yield.

  *Examples:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
  - **Low Yield:**
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with Fused Aromatic Systems Yield High**

  Modifiers containing fused aromatic systems with heteroatoms (e.g., oxygen or nitrogen) can delocalize electrons and coordinate effectively with the metal catalyst, leading to high yield. These structures may enhance π–metal interactions.

  *Examples:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid
    - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with Bulky Non-Coordinating Substituents Yield Low**

  Modifiers with bulky substituents that cannot effectively coordinate with the metal catalyst cause steric hindrance, leading to low yield. These groups may prevent proper access of the catalyst to the reactive sites of the modifier.

  *Examples:*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with Methoxy Groups Lacking Additional Coordinating Groups Yield Low**

  Modifiers featuring methoxy groups attached to aromatic rings yield low if they lack other coordinating functionalities. Methoxy groups are electron-donating and may reduce the electrophilicity needed for effective metal coordination.

  *Examples:*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
    - 4-methoxybenzoic acid (if present)

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with Aldehyde or Ketone Groups Adjacent to Aromatic Rings Yield Low**

  Modifiers where an aldehyde or ketone group is directly attached to an aromatic ring adjacent to a carboxylic acid tend to yield low. These carbonyl groups may compete with the carboxylate for metal coordination or deactivate the catalyst.

  *Examples:*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with Dimethoxyphenyl Groups Attached via Medium-Length Chains Yield High**

  Modifiers containing dimethoxyphenyl groups connected by medium-length aliphatic chains (e.g., four carbons) yield high. The combination of electron-donating methoxy groups and optimal chain length may facilitate effective interaction with the catalyst.

  *Example:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid

However, with only one supporting data point (2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid yielding low), the coverage is limited.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** states that modifiers with highly fluorinated aliphatic chains yield low. The rule is clear, with property insight into the effects of fluorination on electronegativity and hydrophobicity impacting catalyst interaction. It involves a specific sub-structure, fulfilling complexity. Coverage is minimal, supported mainly by 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid yielding low, so additional data would be beneficial.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** indicates that hydroxyphenyl aliphatic acids with medium-length chains yield high, while those with short chains yield low. The clarity of the rule is good, and it provides insight into the importance of chain length for effective catalyst interaction. It considers combinations of functional groups and chain length, satisfying complexity. Supported by 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid yielding high and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid yielding low, the rule has limited but acceptable coverage.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** clearly states that modifiers with fused aromatic systems yield high. The property insight regarding enhanced π–metal interactions is sound.

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** mentions that modifiers with bulky non-coordinating substituents yield low. The rule is clear, providing property insight into steric hindrance. It involves combinations of bulky groups and their lack of coordination ability, fulfilling complexity. Supported by data points like 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid yielding low, the coverage is sufficient.

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13** states that modifiers with methoxy groups lacking additional coordinating groups yield low. While clear, the rule overlaps with aspects of Rule 2 regarding electron-donating groups. The property insight into reduced electrophilicity is valid. However, coverage is limited, with few supporting examples (e.g., 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid yielding low).

- **Comment 14**: **Rule 14** indicates that modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to aromatic rings yield low. This rule is clear and offers property insight similar to Rule 7. It meets complexity criteria by combining functional groups. Supported by data points like 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid yielding low, the coverage is acceptable but overlaps with Rule 7.

- **Comment 15**: **Rule 15** mentions that modifiers with dimethoxyphenyl groups attached via medium-length chains yield high. While clear, the rule is narrowly focused. The property insight into the role of methoxy groups and optimal chain length is reasonable. However, it is primarily supported by a single data point (4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid yielding high), limiting its coverage.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Short-Chain Aliphatic Amino Acids with Carboxylic Groups Yield High; Long-Chain Amino Acids Yield Low**

  Modifiers that are short-chain aliphatic amino acids (with 4 or 5 carbons) containing amino groups at the α-position and carboxylic acid groups yield high. These structures allow optimal coordination with the metal catalyst and minimize steric hindrance. In contrast, long-chain amino acids with terminal amino groups yield low, possibly due to ineffective coordination and increased steric hindrance.

  *Examples:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)
    - 5-aminopentanoic acid
  - **Low Yield:**
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid

---

- **Rule 2**: **Benzoic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing Para Substituents Yield High; Electron-Donating Substituents Yield Low**

  Modifiers that are benzoic acid derivatives with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl) yield high. These substituents enhance metal coordination by increasing the electrophilicity of the carboxylate oxygen. Electron-donating groups at the para position (e.g., methyl, methoxy) yield low, as they decrease the effectiveness of coordination with the metal center.

  *Examples:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - 4-aminobenzoic acid
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
    - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - **Low Yield:**
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

---

- **Rule 3**: **Nitrogen-Containing Heterocyclic Carboxylic Acids Yield High**

  Modifiers that are carboxylic acids directly attached to nitrogen-containing heterocycles (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole) result in high yield. The lone pair on the heterocyclic nitrogen can coordinate with the metal catalyst, enhancing catalytic activity. If the nitrogen heterocycle is not directly attached to the carboxyl group, the yield is generally low due to reduced coordination efficiency.

  *Examples:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Niacin)
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - **Low Yield:**
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid

---

- **Rule 4**: **Aliphatic Thiol Carboxylic Acids Yield High; Aromatic Thiol Carboxylic Acids Yield Low**

  Modifiers with thiol (–SH) groups on aliphatic chains yield high due to the thiol's ability to coordinate with the metal catalyst. Aromatic thiol carboxylic acids yield low, potentially because the aromatic system reduces the thiol's availability for coordination or causes catalyst deactivation through strong binding.

  *Examples:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - **Low Yield:**
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

---

- **Rule 5**: **Straight-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Yield High; Terminal Polar Groups Lower Yield**

  Modifiers that are unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups yield high due to favorable interaction with the hydrophobic regions of the catalyst. Introducing polar groups like hydroxyl or amino at the terminal position decreases the yield, possibly by altering solubility or interfering with catalyst binding.

  *Examples:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - Octanoic acid
  - **Low Yield:**
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups on Short Chains Yield High**

  Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups on short aliphatic chains enhance solubility and facilitate multiple hydrogen-bonding interactions with the catalyst, leading to high yield. These interactions can stabilize the modifier-catalyst complex and improve catalytic efficiency.

  *Example:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with Carbonyl Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acids Yield Low**

  Modifiers possessing aldehyde or ketone groups directly adjacent to carboxylic acids tend to yield low. These carbonyl groups may compete with the carboxylate for coordination sites on the metal catalyst or participate in side reactions, decreasing catalytic efficiency.

  *Examples:*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
    - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with Polyether Chains Yield Low**

  Modifiers featuring polyether chains, such as methoxyethoxy units, result in low yield. The flexibility and steric bulk of polyether chains may hinder effective interaction with the catalyst or alter the solvation dynamics unfavorably.

  *Example:*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with Highly Fluorinated Aliphatic Chains Yield Low**

  Modifiers with multiple fluorine atoms in aliphatic chains yield low. The strong electronegativity and hydrophobicity of fluorinated chains can reduce interactions with the catalyst and decrease solubility in the reaction medium.

  *Example:*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid

---

- **Rule 10**: **Hydroxyphenyl Aliphatic Acids with Medium-Length Chains Yield High; Short Chains Yield Low**

  Modifiers with hydroxyphenyl groups connected to carboxylic acids via medium-length aliphatic chains (e.g., five carbons) yield high. The chain length provides optimal flexibility for the hydroxyphenyl group to interact with the catalyst. Shorter chains may not allow effective positioning, resulting in low yield.

  *Examples:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
  - **Low Yield:**
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with Fused Aromatic Systems Yield High**

  Modifiers containing fused aromatic systems with heteroatoms (e.g., oxygen or nitrogen) can delocalize electrons and coordinate effectively with the metal catalyst, leading to high yield. These structures may enhance π–metal interactions.

  *Examples:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid
    - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with Bulky Non-Coordinating Substituents Yield Low**

  Modifiers with bulky substituents that cannot effectively coordinate with the metal catalyst cause steric hindrance, leading to low yield. These groups may prevent proper access of the catalyst to the reactive sites of the modifier.

  *Examples:*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with Methoxy Groups Lacking Additional Coordinating Groups Yield Low**

  Modifiers featuring methoxy groups attached to aromatic rings yield low if they lack other coordinating functionalities. Methoxy groups are electron-donating and may reduce the electrophilicity needed for effective metal coordination.

  *Examples:*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
    - 4-methoxybenzoic acid (if present)

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with Aldehyde or Ketone Groups Adjacent to Aromatic Rings Yield Low**

  Modifiers where an aldehyde or ketone group is directly attached to an aromatic ring adjacent to a carboxylic acid tend to yield low. These carbonyl groups may compete with the carboxylate for metal coordination or deactivate the catalyst.

  *Examples:*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with Dimethoxyphenyl Groups Attached via Medium-Length Chains Yield High**

  Modifiers containing dimethoxyphenyl groups connected by medium-length aliphatic chains (e.g., four carbons) yield high. The combination of electron-donating methoxy groups and optimal chain length may facilitate effective interaction with the catalyst.

  *Example:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: In **Rule 1**, the SMARTS pattern `'[NX3H2][CX4H]([#6])[#6][CX3](=O)[OX1H]'` may be too restrictive and not accurately capturing short-chain aliphatic amino acids. This pattern requires the alpha carbon to have exactly two carbon attachments, which may not always be the case (e.g., in 5-aminopentanoic acid). Revise the pattern to `'[NX3H2][CX4H]([#6])[#6][#6]*[CX3](=O)[OX1H]'` to allow for varying chain lengths and ensure the amino group is at the alpha position relative to the carboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 2**: Implement a more accurate method for chain length calculation in **Rule 1**. The current approach may not correctly count the number of carbons in the main chain. Use cheminformatics functions like `Chem.rdmolops.GetShortestPath` to calculate the distance (number of bonds) between the alpha carbon and the carboxylic acid carbon, ensuring it matches the desired chain lengths (4 or 5 carbons).

- **Suggestion 3**: For **Rule 2**, the SMARTS pattern `'[O][C](=O)[c]1[c][c][c]([$(N),$(N(=O)=O),$(CBr)])[c][c]1'` may not capture all electron-withdrawing groups at the para position. Expand the pattern to include other electron-withdrawing substituents like cyano, trifluoromethyl, etc. Also, ensure the substituent is specifically at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid by specifying atom indices or using recursive SMARTS patterns.

- **Suggestion 4**: In **Rule 3**, the patterns `'[n][c][c][c][c][CX3](=O)[OX1H]'` and `'[n][n][c][c][CX3](=O)[OX1H]'` may not match all nitrogen-containing heterocycles with carboxylic acids directly attached. Generalize the patterns to `'[n][aromatic][CX3](=O)[OX1H]'` to include various nitrogen heterocycles like pyridine, pyrazole, pyrimidine, etc., directly bonded to a carboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 5**: For **Rule 4**, the exclusion pattern `'[a]'` excludes any molecule containing aromatic atoms, which may unintentionally exclude valid aliphatic thiol carboxylic acids if the molecule contains any aromatic ring elsewhere. Modify the exclusion to specifically target aromatic thiol carboxylic acids by adjusting the pattern to `'[SX2H][a]'` and ensure that only thiol groups attached to aromatic carbons are excluded.

- **Suggestion 6**: In **Rule 5**, the pattern `'[#6]-[#6]-[#6]-[#6]-[#6]-[#6]-[#6]-[#6]-[#6](=O)[OX1H]'` is too specific (e.g., it matches only nonane-based carboxylic acids). Generalize the pattern to match straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids of varying lengths without functional groups: `'C(=O)[OX1H][CH2]n[CH3]', where n ≥ 3`. Also, use exclusion patterns to exclude molecules with terminal polar groups more effectively.

- **Suggestion 7**: Add validation steps in the code to test the SMARTS patterns against the example molecules provided in the rules. For each rule, ensure that the patterns match all the high-yield examples and do not match the low-yield examples, adjusting the patterns accordingly.

- **Suggestion 8**: Implement logging or debugging outputs to identify why certain SMILES strings are not matching any rules. This can help pinpoint issues with the patterns or the matching process, allowing for targeted improvements.

- **Suggestion 9**: Consider using additional cheminformatics tools or descriptors for complex rules where SMARTS patterns are insufficient. For example, use molecular fingerprints or calculate properties like chain length, presence of functional groups, or ring systems to enhance rule matching.

- **Suggestion 10**: Review and test the code for any logical errors or exceptions that might prevent rules from matching. Ensure that exceptions are properly handled and do not skip valid matches due to minor errors in pattern compilation or matching.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

Upon reviewing the current rule metrics in comparison to the reference metrics, several observations can be made regarding the performance of the current set of rules.

---

**1. Support**

- **Previous Train Support**: Approximately **16.67%** to **18.45%**
- **Current Train Support**: **1.71%**

**Observation**: There is a significant decrease in the train support from previous iterations to the current iteration. The support has dropped by roughly **90%**, indicating that the current rules apply to a much smaller portion of the training data. This suggests that the rules have become more specific and may be overfitting to a narrow subset of the data.

---

**2. Confidence**

- **Previous Train Confidence**: Approximately **53.96%** to **63.52%**
- **Current Train Confidence**: **60.00%**

**Observation**: The confidence level has remained relatively stable and is within the range of previous metrics. This indicates that when the rule conditions are met, the prediction is correct **60%** of the time, which is consistent with earlier iterations. However, since the support is low, this high confidence applies to a smaller number of cases.

---

**3. Lift**

- **Previous Train Lift**: Approximately **1.06** to **1.20**
- **Current Train Lift**: **1.19**

**Observation**: The lift remains comparable to previous values, suggesting that the rules are still providing valuable predictive power over the baseline. A lift greater than 1 indicates that the rule is better at predicting the outcome than random chance.

---

**4. Leverage**

- **Previous Train Leverage**: Approximately **-0.0041** to **0.0289**
- **Current Train Leverage**: **0.0083**

**Observation**: The leverage has decreased from its previous maximum value but remains positive. This indicates that the rule still has some predictive advantage over chance. However, the decrease, along with low support, suggests a diminished overall impact.

---

**Performance Summary**

- The **confidence** and **lift** metrics are stable and within acceptable ranges, indicating that the rules maintain their predictive accuracy for the cases they cover.
- The drastic reduction in **support** implies that the rules are becoming too specialized, applying to fewer instances.
- The decrease in **leverage** suggests that the rules are contributing less additional predictive value beyond what would be expected by chance.

---

**Assessment of Current Iteration and Local Minimum**

Given the metrics, it appears that the current iteration may have reached a local minimum. The low support coupled with stable confidence and lift suggests that further iterations focusing on the current rule structure may not yield significant improvements. The rules may be overfitting specific instances in the training data, limiting their generalizability and usefulness in broader contexts.

---

**Recommendations for Improving the Current Rules**

1. **Increase Rule Generalization**

   - **Broaden Rule Conditions**: Review and adjust the rule conditions to be less restrictive. This can involve combining similar rules or relaxing certain criteria to encompass a larger subset of data.
   - **Simplify Rules**: Simplify overly complex rules that may be capturing noise rather than meaningful patterns. Focus on fundamental chemical properties that are more universally applicable.

2. **Enhance Support Without Sacrificing Confidence**

   - **Balance Precision and Coverage**: Aim to find a balance where increasing support does not significantly reduce confidence and lift. Slight reductions in confidence may be acceptable if they result in rules that apply to more data points.
   - **Identify Common Features**: Look for common features among high-yield examples that can be included in the rules to increase their applicability.

3. **Reevaluate Low-Yield Examples**

   - **Analyze Exceptions**: Investigate instances where the rules predict high yield but the actual yield is low, and vice versa. Understanding these exceptions can provide insights into missing factors or nuances in the current rules.
   - **Incorporate Missing Variables**: Consider whether there are additional variables or descriptors that can be included to improve the rules' predictive power.

4. **Avoid Overfitting**

   - **Cross-Validation**: Implement cross-validation techniques to ensure that the rules generalize well to unseen data.
   - **Penalize Complexity**: Introduce a penalty for overly complex rules to encourage simpler, more generalizable rules.

5. **Focus on Significant Chemical Insights**

   - **Chemical Relevance**: Ensure that the rules are based on sound chemical principles rather than purely statistical correlations. Collaborate with domain experts to validate the chemical plausibility of the rules.
   - **Functional Group Analysis**: Reassess the importance of various functional groups and their interactions with the catalyst. Prioritize features that have a significant impact on yield.

---

**Conclusion**

The current set of rules demonstrates consistent confidence and lift but suffers from low support, limiting their practical utility. To enhance performance, it is crucial to generalize the rules to cover a larger portion of the data without substantially compromising their predictive accuracy. By adopting the recommendations above, the rules can be refined to achieve a better balance between specificity and generalization, ultimately improving their effectiveness in predicting catalytic outcomes.

It may be beneficial to halt further iterations that focus solely on refining existing rules and instead shift attention to revising the rule generation approach. This strategic pivot can help move out of the local minimum and lead to the development of more robust and broadly applicable rules.

ML Commenter Message:
**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

**1. Evaluation of Model Performance**

The current 5-fold validation accuracy is **0.5714**, which represents a decline compared to the previous validation accuracies, which were consistently around **0.76**. Previous test accuracies ranged from **0.625** to **0.75**. The decrease in validation accuracy suggests that the current set of rules is less effective in predicting the loading of modifiers on the catalyst compared to previous iterations.

**2. Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment**

The reduction in validation accuracy indicates that the model may be **underfitting**. This underfitting suggests that the current rules are not capturing the underlying patterns necessary to differentiate between high and low modifier loadings effectively. The model's simplicity or potential omission of critical features might be contributing to its inability to generalize well to the validation set.

**3. Analysis of SHAP Values and Rule Effectiveness**

The SHAP analysis focuses exclusively on **Rule 2**, with SHAP values provided only for this rule across all molecules. This indicates that **Rule 2** is the primary contributor to the model's predictions, while the other rules are either not being activated or have negligible impact on the outcome. This reliance on a single rule may be a contributing factor to the model's poor performance.

**Discrepancies Identified:**

- **Underestimated Loadings (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**
  - Molecules such as:
    - **C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N**
    - **C([C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](C(=O)O)O)O)O)O)O**
    - **C(CCN)CC(=O)O**
    - **C1=CC(=CN=C1)C(=O)O**

  - These molecules have negative SHAP values for **Rule 2**, indicating that Rule 2 is contributing to the prediction of low loading when the experimental value is high. This suggests that **Rule 2** may not be appropriately capturing the features of these molecules that lead to high loading experimentally.

- **Overestimated Loadings (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**
  - Molecules such as:
    - **C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O**
    - **C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)N**

  - These molecules have positive SHAP values for **Rule 2**, leading to a prediction of high loading when the experimental value is low. This implies that **Rule 2** is overestimating the contribution of certain features to high loading.

**4. Interpretation of Accuracy Metrics**

The decrease in validation accuracy from approximately **0.76** to **0.5714** suggests that the modifications to the rules have not improved the model and may have reduced its predictive capability. The model's heavy reliance on **Rule 2** without meaningful contributions from other rules indicates a lack of feature diversity, which can hinder the model's ability to generalize.

**5. Insights from SHAP Analysis**

- The SHAP analysis highlights that **Rule 2** is the dominant factor influencing predictions, but it is not sufficient to distinguish accurately between high and low loading modifiers.
- The absence of SHAP values for other rules suggests they are either not being applied correctly or their conditions are not met by the molecules in the dataset.
- The inconsistent SHAP values for **Rule 2** across different molecules indicate that the rule may be too broad or not specific enough to capture the nuances of the modifiers' chemical structures.

---

**Recommendations for Improvement**

**1. Refine Rule 2**

- **Issue Identified:** **Rule 2** is contributing to both overestimations and underestimations of modifier loading, indicating that it lacks specificity and may not accurately represent the relationship between substituent effects and loading outcomes.

- **Suggested Improvements:**
  - **Include Additional Substituent Positions:** Expand the rule to consider substituents at ortho and meta positions, as these can also significantly influence electron density and coordination behavior.
  - **Quantify Electronic Effects:** Incorporate parameters like Hammett sigma values to quantitatively assess the electron-withdrawing or electron-donating nature of substituents.
  - **Differentiate Substituent Types:** Modify the rule to distinguish between different electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, cyano, halogens) and their relative strengths.

- **Revised Rule 2:**
  - **Modifiers that are benzoic acid derivatives with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position yield high loading. However, the influence of substituents at the ortho and meta positions should also be considered, as they can affect coordination. A quantitative assessment of substituent electronic effects can improve the rule's accuracy.**

**2. Activate and Validate Other Rules**

- **Issue Identified:** The other rules are not contributing to the predictions, which may be due to incorrect implementation or overly narrow conditions.

- **Suggested Improvements:**
  - **Verify Rule Implementation:** Check the feature extraction process for each rule to ensure that the conditions are correctly identified in the dataset.
  - **Broaden Rule Conditions:** Consider generalizing some rules to apply to a wider range of molecules. For example, expand rules to include similar functional groups or molecular scaffolds.
  - **Incorporate Additional Descriptors:** Enhance rules by integrating molecular descriptors such as hydrophobicity (log P), molecular weight, or topological indices.

**3. Address Overfitting/Underfitting**

- **Issue Identified:** The model may be underfitting due to reliance on a single rule and lack of complexity.

- **Suggested Improvements:**
  - **Increase Model Complexity:** Incorporate additional relevant features derived from the existing rules or new rules based on observed discrepancies.
  - **Use Advanced Modeling Techniques:** Consider employing machine learning models that can capture nonlinear relationships, such as decision trees or support vector machines, to complement rule-based approaches.

**4. Extract Insights from Underutilized Rules**

- **Issue Identified:** Some rules may not be contributing due to their specificity or lack of alignment with the dataset.

- **Suggested Improvements:**
  - **Reassess Rule Relevance:** Evaluate whether each rule is applicable to the dataset. If a rule does not match any molecules, it may need to be adjusted or replaced.
  - **Merge Similar Rules:** Combine rules that address similar chemical features to increase their applicability.
  - **Identify New Patterns:** Analyze misclassified molecules to identify new structural features that could form the basis of additional rules.

**5. Utilize SHAP Analysis to Guide Rule Modification**

- **Issue Identified:** The SHAP analysis indicates areas where rules may be misaligned with the data.

- **Suggested Improvements:**
  - **Negative SHAP Values in Underestimated Loadings:** For molecules where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, and **Rule 2** has a strong negative SHAP value, investigate whether the rule's conditions are too restrictive or misapplied.
  - **Positive SHAP Values in Overestimated Loadings:** For molecules where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low, and **Rule 2** has a strong positive SHAP value, consider adding exceptions or modifying the rule to prevent overestimation.

**6. Incorporate Additional Chemical Knowledge**

- **Suggested Improvements:**
  - **Functional Group Interactions:** Consider how combinations of functional groups may influence modifier loading. For example, the presence of both amino and carboxylic groups in certain positions might enhance coordination.
  - **Steric Effects:** Integrate steric hindrance considerations into the rules, as bulky substituents might prevent effective coordination despite electronic factors.
  - **Solubility Factors:** Include rules that account for the solubility of modifiers in the reaction medium, as this can impact loading.

**7. Validate and Iterate**

- **Suggested Improvements:**
  - **Retrain the Model:** Update the feature matrix with the refined rules and retrain the model.
  - **Cross-Validation:** Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to assess model performance comprehensively.
  - **Monitor Performance Metrics:** Track changes in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate improvements.

---

**Conclusion**

The current model's performance indicates a need for refinement in the existing rules and the feature extraction process. By focusing on improving **Rule 2**, activating contributions from other rules, and incorporating additional chemical insights, the model's accuracy is likely to improve. Iterative testing and validation will help in fine-tuning the rules and enhancing the model's ability to predict modifier loading accurately.

---

**Next Steps**

- **Review and Revise Rules:** Collaborate with the team to discuss the proposed changes to **Rule 2** and other rules.
- **Update Feature Matrix:** Implement the refined rules in the feature extraction process and ensure all rules are correctly applied to the dataset.
- **Retrain Model:** With the updated feature matrix, retrain the classification model and evaluate performance.
- **Analyze Results:** Use SHAP analysis on the new model to verify that the rules are contributing as expected and to identify any new discrepancies.
- **Continue Iteration:** Repeat the process of refinement and validation until the model achieves satisfactory performance metrics.

By systematically addressing the issues identified through the SHAP analysis and validation metrics, we can improve the model's predictive capability and gain deeper insights into the factors influencing modifier loading on catalysts.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimization**

The current set of rules aimed at predicting the yield of the δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction shows several areas needing improvement. The analysis of performance metrics and SHAP values has highlighted the following key points:

1. **Low Train Support and Potential Overfitting**

   - **Train Support Decrease**: The train support has decreased significantly from approximately 16-18% in previous iterations to around 1.7% currently. This suggests that the rules are now too specific, applying to a minimal portion of the data.
   - **Stable Confidence and Lift**: While confidence and lift remain within acceptable ranges, their applicability is limited due to the low support.
   - **Overfitting Risk**: The specificity of the rules may indicate overfitting to a narrow subset of the data, reducing their generalizability.

2. **Reduced Validation Accuracy**

   - **Validation Accuracy Decline**: The 5-fold validation accuracy has dropped from around 76% to approximately 57%. This decline indicates that the model's predictive capability has diminished in the current iteration.
   - **Underfitting Indication**: The decrease in accuracy suggests underfitting, where the model fails to capture the underlying data patterns effectively.

3. **Reliance on a Single Rule (Rule 2)**

   - **SHAP Analysis**: The SHAP values reveal that only Rule 2 is significantly contributing to the model's predictions, while other rules are either not activating or have minimal impact.
   - **Prediction Discrepancies**: There are instances where Rule 2 incorrectly predicts the modifier loading, either overestimating or underestimating, indicating that the rule lacks sufficient specificity and accuracy.

**Suggestions to Improve Current Rules**

1. **Revise and Generalize SMARTS Patterns**

   - **Rule 1 (Short-Chain Amino Acids)**:
     - **Issue**: The current SMARTS pattern may be too restrictive, missing relevant molecules.
     - **Improvement**: Modify the pattern to `'[NX3H2][CX4H][#6]*[CX3](=O)[OX1H]'` and use cheminformatics functions like `GetShortestPath` to accurately calculate chain lengths, ensuring amino groups are at the α-position relative to the carboxylic acid.
   
   - **Rule 2 (Benzoic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing Groups)**:
     - **Issue**: The pattern may not capture all relevant electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position.
     - **Improvement**: Expand the SMARTS pattern to include additional substituents like cyano, trifluoromethyl, and ensure precise positioning using recursive patterns or atom indexing.

   - **Rule 3 (Nitrogen-Containing Heterocycles)**:
     - **Issue**: The current patterns may not encompass all relevant heterocycles.
     - **Improvement**: Generalize the patterns to `'[n][ar][CX3](=O)[OX1H]'` to include various nitrogen heterocycles directly bonded to carboxylic acids.

   - **Rule 4 (Aliphatic Thiol Carboxylic Acids)**:
     - **Issue**: The exclusion of aromatic atoms may unintentionally omit valid compounds.
     - **Improvement**: Adjust the exclusion pattern to `'[SX2H][a]'` to specifically target aromatic thiols and not exclude aliphatic thiols incorrectly.

   - **Rule 5 (Straight-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids)**:
     - **Issue**: The pattern is too specific, matching only certain chain lengths.
     - **Improvement**: Generalize the pattern to match aliphatic chains of varying lengths, e.g., `'C(=O)[OX1H][CH2]n[CH3]'` where n ≥ 3, and incorporate exclusions for terminal polar groups.

2. **Increase Rule Support and Balance Specificity**

   - **Broaden Rules**: Relax overly restrictive conditions to encompass a larger portion of the data without significantly reducing confidence and lift.
   - **Combine Similar Rules**: Merge rules that address similar chemical features to enhance their applicability.
   - **Incorporate Additional Functional Groups**: Expand rules to include more functional groups that may influence yield, based on the analysis of misclassified molecules.

3. **Validate and Activate All Rules**

   - **Ensure Correct Implementation**: Verify that all rules are correctly coded and applied to the dataset, with no logical errors or exceptions causing them to be skipped.
   - **Test Against Examples**: Validate each rule using the provided high-yield and low-yield examples to ensure they match appropriately.
   - **Adjust Patterns Accordingly**: Modify rules that are not performing as expected based on the validation results.

4. **Incorporate Additional Chemical Descriptors**

   - **Use Molecular Fingerprints**: Employ cheminformatics tools to capture complex molecular features that SMARTS patterns may miss.
   - **Calculate Molecular Properties**: Include descriptors like hydrophobicity (log P), molecular weight, and topological indices to enhance rule-based predictions.
   - **Consider Steric and Electronic Effects**: Factor in steric hindrance and electronic properties, such as Hammett sigma values, to refine the rules.

5. **Enhance Model Complexity Appropriately**

   - **Avoid Overfitting**: Balance the complexity of rules with the need for generalizability. Penalize overly complex rules and encourage simplicity.
   - **Cross-Validation**: Implement robust cross-validation techniques to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data.
   - **Iterative Refinement**: Continuously test and refine rules based on performance metrics and domain expertise.

6. **Leverage SHAP Analysis Effectively**

   - **Investigate Misclassifications**: Use SHAP values to understand why certain molecules are misclassified and adjust rules accordingly.
   - **Ensure Diverse Rule Contribution**: Modify the model so that multiple rules contribute meaningfully to predictions, reducing dependency on any single rule.

7. **Incorporate Domain Expertise**

   - **Consult Chemists**: Engage with domain experts to validate the chemical plausibility of the rules and gain insights into additional factors affecting yield.
   - **Stay Grounded in Chemical Principles**: Ensure that rules are based on sound chemical knowledge rather than solely on statistical correlations.

**Judgment on Further Optimization**

Given the significant decrease in train support and validation accuracy, coupled with over-reliance on a single rule, there is substantial room for further optimization of the current rules. By refining SMARTS patterns, generalizing conditions, activating all rules, and incorporating additional chemical descriptors, we can enhance the model's predictive power without overfitting.

**Please Optimize Rules**

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Short-Chain Aliphatic Amino Acids with Carboxylic Groups Yield High; Long-Chain Amino Acids Yield Low**

  Modifiers that are short-chain aliphatic amino acids (with 4 or 5 carbons) containing amino groups at the α-position and carboxylic acid groups yield high. These structures allow optimal coordination with the metal catalyst and minimize steric hindrance. In contrast, long-chain amino acids with terminal amino groups yield low, possibly due to ineffective coordination and increased steric hindrance.

  *Examples:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)
    - 5-aminopentanoic acid
  - **Low Yield:**
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid

---

- **Rule 2**: **Benzoic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing Para Substituents Yield High; Electron-Donating Substituents Yield Low**

  Modifiers that are benzoic acid derivatives with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl) yield high. These substituents enhance metal coordination by increasing the electrophilicity of the carboxylate oxygen. Electron-donating groups at the para position (e.g., methyl, methoxy) yield low, as they decrease the effectiveness of coordination with the metal center.

  *Examples:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - 4-aminobenzoic acid
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
    - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - **Low Yield:**
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

---

- **Rule 3**: **Nitrogen-Containing Heterocyclic Carboxylic Acids Yield High**

  Modifiers that are carboxylic acids directly attached to nitrogen-containing heterocycles (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole) result in high yield. The lone pair on the heterocyclic nitrogen can coordinate with the metal catalyst, enhancing catalytic activity. If the nitrogen heterocycle is not directly attached to the carboxyl group, the yield is generally low due to reduced coordination efficiency.

  *Examples:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Niacin)
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - **Low Yield:**
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid

---

- **Rule 4**: **Aliphatic Thiol Carboxylic Acids Yield High; Aromatic Thiol Carboxylic Acids Yield Low**

  Modifiers with thiol (–SH) groups on aliphatic chains yield high due to the thiol's ability to coordinate with the metal catalyst. Aromatic thiol carboxylic acids yield low, potentially because the aromatic system reduces the thiol's availability for coordination or causes catalyst deactivation through strong binding.

  *Examples:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - **Low Yield:**
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

---

- **Rule 5**: **Straight-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Yield High; Terminal Polar Groups Lower Yield**

  Modifiers that are unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups yield high due to favorable interaction with the hydrophobic regions of the catalyst. Introducing polar groups like hydroxyl or amino at the terminal position decreases the yield, possibly by altering solubility or interfering with catalyst binding.

  *Examples:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - Octanoic acid
  - **Low Yield:**
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups on Short Chains Yield High**

  Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups on short aliphatic chains enhance solubility and facilitate multiple hydrogen-bonding interactions with the catalyst, leading to high yield. These interactions can stabilize the modifier-catalyst complex and improve catalytic efficiency.

  *Example:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with Carbonyl Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acids Yield Low**

  Modifiers possessing aldehyde or ketone groups directly adjacent to carboxylic acids tend to yield low. These carbonyl groups may compete with the carboxylate for coordination sites on the metal catalyst or participate in side reactions, decreasing catalytic efficiency.

  *Examples:*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
    - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with Polyether Chains Yield Low**

  Modifiers featuring polyether chains, such as methoxyethoxy units, result in low yield. The flexibility and steric bulk of polyether chains may hinder effective interaction with the catalyst or alter the solvation dynamics unfavorably.

  *Example:*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with Highly Fluorinated Aliphatic Chains Yield Low**

  Modifiers with multiple fluorine atoms in aliphatic chains yield low. The strong electronegativity and hydrophobicity of fluorinated chains can reduce interactions with the catalyst and decrease solubility in the reaction medium.

  *Example:*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid

---

- **Rule 10**: **Hydroxyphenyl Aliphatic Acids with Medium-Length Chains Yield High; Short Chains Yield Low**

  Modifiers with hydroxyphenyl groups connected to carboxylic acids via medium-length aliphatic chains (e.g., five carbons) yield high. The chain length provides optimal flexibility for the hydroxyphenyl group to interact with the catalyst. Shorter chains may not allow effective positioning, resulting in low yield.

  *Examples:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
  - **Low Yield:**
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with Fused Aromatic Systems Yield High**

  Modifiers containing fused aromatic systems with heteroatoms (e.g., oxygen or nitrogen) can delocalize electrons and coordinate effectively with the metal catalyst, leading to high yield. These structures may enhance π–metal interactions.

  *Examples:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid
    - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with Bulky Non-Coordinating Substituents Yield Low**

  Modifiers with bulky substituents that cannot effectively coordinate with the metal catalyst cause steric hindrance, leading to low yield. These groups may prevent proper access of the catalyst to the reactive sites of the modifier.

  *Examples:*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with Methoxy Groups Lacking Additional Coordinating Groups Yield Low**

  Modifiers featuring methoxy groups attached to aromatic rings yield low if they lack other coordinating functionalities. Methoxy groups are electron-donating and may reduce the electrophilicity needed for effective metal coordination.

  *Examples:*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
    - 4-methoxybenzoic acid (if present)

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with Aldehyde or Ketone Groups Adjacent to Aromatic Rings Yield Low**

  Modifiers where an aldehyde or ketone group is directly attached to an aromatic ring adjacent to a carboxylic acid tend to yield low. These carbonyl groups may compete with the carboxylate for metal coordination or deactivate the catalyst.

  *Examples:*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with Dimethoxyphenyl Groups Attached via Medium-Length Chains Yield High**

  Modifiers containing dimethoxyphenyl groups connected by medium-length aliphatic chains (e.g., four carbons) yield high. The combination of electron-donating methoxy groups and optimal chain length may facilitate effective interaction with the catalyst.

  *Example:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Revise Rule 1 to Generalize the SMARTS Pattern for Short-Chain Aliphatic Amino Acids**

  - **Issue**: The current SMARTS pattern for Rule 1 may be too restrictive, missing relevant modifiers.
  - **Improvement**: Modify the SMARTS pattern to include amino groups at the α-position relative to the carboxylic acid and to generalize chain lengths.
  - **Suggested SMARTS Pattern**: `[NX3H2]-[CX4H]-[CH2]-{0,2}-[CX3](=O)-[OX1H]`
    - **Explanation**: This pattern captures amino acids where the amino group is attached to the α-carbon next to the carboxyl group, allowing for varying chain lengths (4 to 5 carbons).
  - **Action**: Update Rule 1 with the new SMARTS pattern and validate it against the dataset to ensure it correctly identifies high-yielding modifiers like aspartic acid and glutamic acid.

---

- **Advice 2**: **Expand Rule 2 to Include Additional Electron-Withdrawing Groups**

  - **Issue**: Rule 2 may not capture all benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing para substituents affecting the yield.
  - **Improvement**: Revise the SMARTS pattern to include a broader range of electron-withdrawing groups at the para position.
  - **Suggested SMARTS Pattern**: `[$(c1cc([NX3H2,S(=O)(=O)[OX1H],N+([O-])=O,Br,C#N,C(F)(F)F])ccc1)-[C](=O)-[OX1H]]`
    - **Explanation**: This pattern includes nitro, amino, sulfonic acid, bromine, cyano, and trifluoromethyl groups at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid.
  - **Action**: Replace the existing pattern in Rule 2 with the expanded pattern and test it against known high-yield and low-yield modifiers.

---

- **Advice 3**: **Generalize Rule 3 for Nitrogen-Containing Heterocycles**

  - **Issue**: The current pattern may not encompass all relevant nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to carboxylic acids.
  - **Improvement**: Broaden the SMARTS pattern to include various nitrogen heterocycles.
  - **Suggested SMARTS Pattern**: `[nX2][cH1]-[c]-[C](=O)-[OX1H]`
    - **Explanation**: This pattern captures heterocycles like pyridine, pyrazole, and others with the nitrogen atom adjacent to the carboxyl group.
  - **Action**: Update Rule 3 with the generalized pattern and validate it with examples like nicotinic acid and pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid.

---

- **Advice 4**: **Refine Rule 4 to Correctly Exclude Aromatic Thiols**

  - **Issue**: The exclusion pattern may unintentionally exclude aliphatic thiols.
  - **Improvement**: Adjust the SMARTS pattern to specifically exclude aromatic thiols without affecting aliphatic thiols.
  - **Suggested Exclusion Pattern**: `[SX2H]-[a]`
    - **Explanation**: This pattern excludes thiols where the sulfur is directly attached to an aromatic ring.
  - **Action**: Modify Rule 4 to use the new exclusion pattern, ensuring that aliphatic thiols like 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid are included as high-yield modifiers.

---

- **Advice 5**: **Generalize Rule 5 for Straight-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids**

  - **Issue**: The existing pattern may be too specific regarding chain length and terminal groups.
  - **Improvement**: Create a SMARTS pattern that matches straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids of varying lengths while excluding terminal polar groups.
  - **Suggested SMARTS Pattern**: `[C](=O)-[OX1H]-[CH2]{4,}[CH3]`
    - **Explanation**: This pattern matches carboxylic acids with straight chains of at least five carbons and no polar groups at the terminal position.
  - **Action**: Update Rule 5 with the new pattern and test it against modifiers like octanoic acid (high yield) and exclude those with terminal hydroxyl or amino groups.

---

- **Advice 6**: **Validate and Activate All Rules Using the Dataset**

  - **Issue**: Some rules may not be activating or contributing significantly to predictions.
  - **Improvement**: Test each rule against the dataset to ensure they correctly identify high-yield and low-yield modifiers.
  - **Action**:
    - **Step 1**: Apply each rule individually to the dataset and record which modifiers they match.
    - **Step 2**: Compare the matches with the actual yield outcomes to assess accuracy.
    - **Step 3**: Adjust any rules that are not performing as expected, refining their SMARTS patterns or conditions.
    - **Step 4**: Ensure that all rules are correctly implemented in the model without logical errors.

---

- **Advice 7**: **Incorporate Additional Molecular Descriptors**

  - **Issue**: SMARTS patterns alone may not capture all factors influencing yield.
  - **Improvement**: Include additional descriptors like molecular weight, log P, topological polar surface area (TPSA), and molecular fingerprints.
  - **Action**:
    - **Step 1**: Calculate these descriptors for all modifiers in the dataset.
    - **Step 2**: Analyze correlations between these properties and the yield to identify significant predictors.
    - **Step 3**: Incorporate thresholds or conditions based on these descriptors into existing or new rules.
    - **Step 4**: Use cheminformatics tools to compute and integrate these properties into the rule-based model.

---

- **Advice 8**: **Leverage SHAP Analysis to Refine Rules**

  - **Issue**: Current predictions rely heavily on a single rule, leading to potential inaccuracies.
  - **Improvement**: Use SHAP values to understand the contribution of each rule and adjust them to achieve a more balanced model.
  - **Action**:
    - **Step 1**: Perform SHAP analysis on the updated model to identify how each rule influences predictions.
    - **Step 2**: Investigate cases where rules lead to misclassifications and understand the underlying reasons.
    - **Step 3**: Refine rules to reduce over-reliance on any single rule and ensure more uniform contribution across rules.
    - **Step 4**: Reassess the model performance after adjustments.

---

- **Advice 9**: **Balance Rule Complexity to Avoid Overfitting**

  - **Issue**: Overly complex rules may fit the training data well but perform poorly on new data.
  - **Improvement**: Simplify rules where possible and ensure they capture generalizable patterns rather than anomalies.
  - **Action**:
    - **Step 1**: Review each rule for unnecessary complexity or overly specific conditions.
    - **Step 2**: Remove or revise conditions that do not significantly contribute to prediction accuracy.
    - **Step 3**: Implement cross-validation techniques to assess how well the model generalizes to unseen data.
    - **Step 4**: Set constraints or penalties in the rule generation process to discourage over-complexity.

---

- **Advice 10**: **Engage Domain Experts to Validate and Extend Rules**

  - **Issue**: Certain chemical nuances may be overlooked without expert input.
  - **Improvement**: Consult with chemists or researchers experienced in organometallic catalysis and reaction mechanisms.
  - **Action**:
    - **Step 1**: Present the current set of rules and findings to domain experts for feedback.
    - **Step 2**: Incorporate their insights into rule revisions, particularly regarding steric and electronic effects.
    - **Step 3**: Discuss potential new rules based on chemical principles that may not be evident from the data alone.
    - **Step 4**: Iterate the rule optimization process with continued expert collaboration.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Short-Chain α-Amino Dicarboxylic Acids Yield High**

  Modifiers that are short-chain (4 to 5 carbons) α-amino dicarboxylic acids yield high. The presence of an amino group at the α-position and two carboxylic acid groups facilitates effective coordination with the metal catalyst, enhancing catalytic activity.

  *Examples:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)

  - **Low Yield:**
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (longer chain with additional functional groups)

---

- **Rule 2**: **Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing Groups Yield High; Electron-Donating Groups Yield Low**

  Modifiers that are benzoic acid derivatives with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position result in high yield. Electron-withdrawing substituents increase the electrophilicity of the carboxylate oxygen, enhancing metal coordination. Electron-donating groups at the para position reduce this effect, leading to low yield.

  *Examples:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - 4-aminobenzoic acid
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
    - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid

  - **Low Yield:**
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers with Nitrogen Heterocycles Directly Attached to Carboxylic Acid Yield High**

  Modifiers featuring carboxylic acids directly attached to nitrogen-containing heterocycles (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole) yield high. The lone pair on the heterocyclic nitrogen coordinates with the metal catalyst, enhancing catalytic efficiency. If the carboxylic acid is not directly attached to the heterocycle, the yield is generally low due to reduced coordination.

  *Examples:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Niacin)
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

  - **Low Yield:**
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (heterocycle not directly attached to the carboxylic acid)

---

- **Rule 4**: **Aliphatic Thiol Carboxylic Acids Yield High; Aromatic Thiol Carboxylic Acids Yield Low**

  Modifiers with thiol (–SH) groups on aliphatic chains yield high due to the thiol's ability to coordinate with the metal catalyst. In contrast, aromatic thiol carboxylic acids yield low, possibly because the aromatic system delocalizes the thiol's lone pair, reducing its availability for coordination or causing catalyst deactivation.

  *Examples:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid

  - **Low Yield:**
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

---

- **Rule 5**: **Unsubstituted Medium-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Yield High; Terminal Polar Groups Decrease Yield**

  Modifiers that are medium-chain (6 to 8 carbons) aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups yield high. Introducing polar groups like hydroxyl or amino at terminal positions decreases the yield, likely due to altered solubility and interference with catalyst binding.

  *Examples:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - Octanoic acid

  - **Low Yield:**
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups on Short Aliphatic Chains Yield High**

  Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups on short aliphatic chains enhance solubility and enable multiple hydrogen-bonding interactions with the catalyst, leading to high yield. These interactions stabilize the modifier-catalyst complex and improve catalytic efficiency.

  *Example:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with Carbonyl Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acids Yield Low**

  Modifiers possessing aldehyde or ketone groups directly adjacent to carboxylic acids tend to yield low. These carbonyl groups may compete with the carboxylate for coordination sites on the metal catalyst or engage in side reactions, decreasing catalytic efficiency.

  *Examples:*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
    - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with Polyether Chains Yield Low**

  Modifiers featuring polyether chains, such as methoxyethoxy units, result in low yield. The flexibility and steric bulk of polyether chains may hinder effective interaction with the catalyst or unfavorably alter solvation dynamics.

  *Example:*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with Perfluorinated Chains Yield Low**

  Modifiers containing perfluorinated aliphatic chains yield low. The strong electronegativity and hydrophobicity of fluorinated chains can reduce interactions with the catalyst and decrease solubility in the reaction medium.

  *Example:*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid

---

- **Rule 10**: **Hydroxyphenylalkanoic Acids with Medium-Length Chains Yield High; Short Chains Yield Low**

  Modifiers with hydroxyphenyl groups connected via medium-length aliphatic chains (4 to 5 carbons) yield high. The optimal chain length allows effective positioning of the hydroxyphenyl group for interaction with the catalyst. Shorter chains may not provide sufficient flexibility, resulting in low yield.

  *Examples:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid

  - **Low Yield:**
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with Fused Aromatic Systems Containing Heteroatoms Yield High**

  Modifiers containing fused aromatic systems with heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen) yield high. These structures can facilitate delocalized π-electron interactions and coordinate effectively with the metal catalyst, enhancing catalytic performance.

  *Examples:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid
    - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with Bulky Non-Coordinating Substituents Yield Low**

  Modifiers with bulky substituents that cannot effectively coordinate with the metal catalyst cause steric hindrance, leading to low yield. These groups may obstruct the catalyst's access to reactive sites.

  *Examples:*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with Methoxy Groups on Aromatic Rings Without Additional Coordinating Groups Yield Low**

  Modifiers featuring methoxy groups attached to aromatic rings yield low if they lack other coordinating functionalities. Methoxy groups are electron-donating and may reduce the electrophilicity needed for effective metal coordination.

  *Example:*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with Aldehyde or Ketone Groups Adjacent to Aromatic Rings Yield Low**

  Modifiers where an aldehyde or ketone group is directly attached to an aromatic ring adjacent to a carboxylic acid tend to yield low. These carbonyl groups may compete with the carboxylate for metal coordination or deactivate the catalyst through side reactions.

  *Examples:*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with Dimethoxyphenyl Groups Connected via Ketone-Containing Chains Yield High**

  Modifiers containing dimethoxyphenyl groups connected by ketone-containing aliphatic chains yield high. The combination of electron-donating methoxy groups and ketone functionalities may facilitate favorable interactions with the catalyst.

  *Example:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid

---

**End of Rules**
---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows for unambiguous determination of high-yield modifiers based on the presence of short-chain (4 to 5 carbons) α-amino dicarboxylic acids. It provides adequate physical-chemical insight by explaining how the amino group at the α-position and two carboxylic acid groups facilitate metal coordination. The rule considers combinations of substructures (chain length, amino group, dicarboxylic acids), adding appropriate complexity. It is well-supported by multiple data points—specifically, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid and (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid yielding high, and (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid yielding low—thus ensuring good coverage.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear in distinguishing between high and low yield based on the electronic nature of para-substituents on benzoic acids. The rule offers physical-chemical insight by explaining how electron-withdrawing groups enhance electrophilicity and metal coordination, while electron-donating groups decrease it. It considers both the aromatic ring and substituent electronics, adding complexity. Supported by multiple data points—4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid, and 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid yielding high, and 4-methylbenzoic acid yielding low—the rule demonstrates strong coverage.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear, specifying that modifiers with carboxylic acids directly attached to nitrogen heterocycles yield high, while those without direct attachment yield low. It provides physical-chemical insight into the coordination role of heterocyclic nitrogen lone pairs. The rule's complexity arises from considering the direct attachment to heterocycles. Supported by data points like pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, and 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid yielding high, and 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid yielding low, it has good coverage.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 clearly differentiates between aliphatic thiol carboxylic acids yielding high and aromatic thiol carboxylic acids yielding low. It offers physical-chemical insight into how thiol groups coordinate differently in aliphatic versus aromatic contexts. The rule adds complexity by considering both the thiol group and the nature of the carbon chain (aliphatic vs. aromatic). With data points like 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid yielding high and 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid yielding low, it meets the minimal coverage requirement.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear in stating that unsubstituted medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids yield high, whereas introducing terminal polar groups decreases yield. It provides physical-chemical insight by explaining the impact of polar groups on solubility and catalyst binding. The rule considers chain length and functional groups, adding complexity. Supported by octanoic acid yielding high and 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, and 8-aminooctanoic acid yielding low, it demonstrates strong coverage.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 specifies that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on short aliphatic chains yield high. It offers physical-chemical insight into enhanced solubility and multiple hydrogen-bonding interactions stabilizing the catalyst complex. The rule adds complexity by considering both the number of hydroxyl groups and chain length. However, it is supported by only one clear data point—(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid—so its coverage is limited.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 clearly states that modifiers with carbonyl groups adjacent to carboxylic acids yield low. It provides physical-chemical insight into how these carbonyl groups may compete for coordination or cause side reactions. The rule considers specific structural combinations, adding complexity. With multiple supporting data points—4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid, and 4-oxoheptanedioic acid yielding low—it has strong coverage.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 indicates that modifiers with polyether chains yield low due to steric hindrance and altered solvation dynamics. While the rule is clear and offers physical-chemical insight, it is supported by only one data point—2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid—limiting its coverage and strength.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 states that modifiers with perfluorinated chains yield low because of reduced interactions with the catalyst and decreased solubility. The rule is clear and provides physical-chemical insight. However, it is supported by only one data point—2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid—resulting in limited coverage.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear in explaining that hydroxyphenylalkanoic acids with medium-length chains yield high, while shorter chains yield low due to insufficient flexibility for effective catalyst interaction. It provides physical-chemical insight into chain length effects and considers combinations of substructures. Supported by 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid yielding high and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid yielding low, it meets minimal coverage requirements.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 specifies that modifiers with fused aromatic systems containing heteroatoms yield high, attributing this to enhanced π-electron interactions and metal coordination. While the rule adds complexity by considering intricate ring systems, it is supported by only two data points—1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid and (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid—thus limiting its coverage.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 addresses that bulky non-coordinating substituents lead to low yield due to steric hindrance obstructing catalyst access. It provides physical-chemical insight into steric effects but could improve in clarity, as "bulky" and "non-coordinating" are somewhat subjective terms. Supported by 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid and 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid yielding low, it meets minimal coverage.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 asserts that modifiers with methoxy groups on aromatic rings without additional coordinating groups yield low. However, this rule lacks clarity as the example provided—2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid—does not contain methoxy groups, and there are data points like 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid yielding high, which contradict the rule. The rule lacks sufficient data support and clarity.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14, stating that modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to aromatic rings yield low, is clear and provides physical-chemical insight. However, it is redundant with Rule 7, which covers modifiers with carbonyl groups adjacent to carboxylic acids yielding low. Combining these rules would improve conciseness and avoid redundancy.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 is highly specific, focusing on modifiers with dimethoxyphenyl groups connected via ketone-containing chains yielding high. It provides physical-chemical insight into favorable interactions due to methoxy and ketone functionalities. However, it is supported by only one data point—4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid—limiting its coverage.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Short-Chain α-Amino Dicarboxylic Acids Yield High**

  Modifiers that are short-chain (4 to 5 carbons) α-amino dicarboxylic acids yield high. The presence of an amino group at the α-position and two carboxylic acid groups facilitates effective coordination with the metal catalyst, enhancing catalytic activity.

  *Examples:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)

  - **Low Yield:**
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (longer chain with additional functional groups)

---

- **Rule 2**: **Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing Groups Yield High; Electron-Donating Groups Yield Low**

  Modifiers that are benzoic acid derivatives with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position result in high yield. Electron-withdrawing substituents increase the electrophilicity of the carboxylate oxygen, enhancing metal coordination. Electron-donating groups at the para position reduce this effect, leading to low yield.

  *Examples:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - 4-aminobenzoic acid
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
    - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid

  - **Low Yield:**
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers with Nitrogen Heterocycles Directly Attached to Carboxylic Acid Yield High**

  Modifiers featuring carboxylic acids directly attached to nitrogen-containing heterocycles (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole) yield high. The lone pair on the heterocyclic nitrogen coordinates with the metal catalyst, enhancing catalytic efficiency. If the carboxylic acid is not directly attached to the heterocycle, the yield is generally low due to reduced coordination.

  *Examples:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Niacin)
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

  - **Low Yield:**
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (heterocycle not directly attached to the carboxylic acid)

---

- **Rule 4**: **Aliphatic Thiol Carboxylic Acids Yield High; Aromatic Thiol Carboxylic Acids Yield Low**

  Modifiers with thiol (–SH) groups on aliphatic chains yield high due to the thiol's ability to coordinate with the metal catalyst. In contrast, aromatic thiol carboxylic acids yield low, possibly because the aromatic system delocalizes the thiol's lone pair, reducing its availability for coordination or causing catalyst deactivation.

  *Examples:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid

  - **Low Yield:**
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

---

- **Rule 5**: **Unsubstituted Medium-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Yield High; Terminal Polar Groups Decrease Yield**

  Modifiers that are medium-chain (6 to 8 carbons) aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups yield high. Introducing polar groups like hydroxyl or amino at terminal positions decreases the yield, likely due to altered solubility and interference with catalyst binding.

  *Examples:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - Octanoic acid

  - **Low Yield:**
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups on Short Aliphatic Chains Yield High**

  Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups on short aliphatic chains enhance solubility and enable multiple hydrogen-bonding interactions with the catalyst, leading to high yield. These interactions stabilize the modifier-catalyst complex and improve catalytic efficiency.

  *Example:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with Carbonyl Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acids Yield Low**

  Modifiers possessing aldehyde or ketone groups directly adjacent to carboxylic acids tend to yield low. These carbonyl groups may compete with the carboxylate for coordination sites on the metal catalyst or engage in side reactions, decreasing catalytic efficiency.

  *Examples:*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
    - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with Polyether Chains Yield Low**

  Modifiers featuring polyether chains, such as methoxyethoxy units, result in low yield. The flexibility and steric bulk of polyether chains may hinder effective interaction with the catalyst or unfavorably alter solvation dynamics.

  *Example:*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with Perfluorinated Chains Yield Low**

  Modifiers containing perfluorinated aliphatic chains yield low. The strong electronegativity and hydrophobicity of fluorinated chains can reduce interactions with the catalyst and decrease solubility in the reaction medium.

  *Example:*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid

---

- **Rule 10**: **Hydroxyphenylalkanoic Acids with Medium-Length Chains Yield High; Short Chains Yield Low**

  Modifiers with hydroxyphenyl groups connected via medium-length aliphatic chains (4 to 5 carbons) yield high. The optimal chain length allows effective positioning of the hydroxyphenyl group for interaction with the catalyst. Shorter chains may not provide sufficient flexibility, resulting in low yield.

  *Examples:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid

  - **Low Yield:**
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with Fused Aromatic Systems Containing Heteroatoms Yield High**

  Modifiers containing fused aromatic systems with heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen) yield high. These structures can facilitate delocalized π-electron interactions and coordinate effectively with the metal catalyst, enhancing catalytic performance.

  *Examples:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid
    - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with Bulky Non-Coordinating Substituents Yield Low**

  Modifiers with bulky substituents that cannot effectively coordinate with the metal catalyst cause steric hindrance, leading to low yield. These groups may obstruct the catalyst's access to reactive sites.

  *Examples:*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with Methoxy Groups on Aromatic Rings Without Additional Coordinating Groups Yield Low**

  Modifiers featuring methoxy groups attached to aromatic rings yield low if they lack other coordinating functionalities. Methoxy groups are electron-donating and may reduce the electrophilicity needed for effective metal coordination.

  *Example:*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with Aldehyde or Ketone Groups Adjacent to Aromatic Rings Yield Low**

  Modifiers where an aldehyde or ketone group is directly attached to an aromatic ring adjacent to a carboxylic acid tend to yield low. These carbonyl groups may compete with the carboxylate for metal coordination or deactivate the catalyst through side reactions.

  *Examples:*

  - **Low Yield:**
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with Dimethoxyphenyl Groups Connected via Ketone-Containing Chains Yield High**

  Modifiers containing dimethoxyphenyl groups connected by ketone-containing aliphatic chains yield high. The combination of electron-donating methoxy groups and ketone functionalities may facilitate favorable interactions with the catalyst.

  *Example:*

  - **High Yield:**
    - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid

Matrix Checker Message:
After reviewing the feature matrix generated from the code and comparing it with the natural language rules and the SMILES set provided, it appears that the transformation from language rules to numeric feature matrix is **not effective**. Below is a detailed analysis for each rule and suggestions for improvement.

---

**Rule-by-Rule Analysis:**

---

### **Rule 1**: Short-Chain α-Amino Dicarboxylic Acids Yield High

**Expected Molecules to Match:**

- **C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N** (SMILES #1)
- **C([C@@H](C(=O)O)N)C(=O)O** (SMILES #3)

These SMILES correspond to glutamic acid and aspartic acid, respectively, which should match Rule 1 and have a feature value of **1**.

**Feature Matrix Observation:**

- Both SMILES have a **0** under Rule 1.

**Issue:**

- The SMARTS patterns in the code are not matching the SMILES correctly.

**Code Review:**

- The SMARTS patterns for Rule 1 are:

  ```python
  rule1_pattern = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[NX3][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX1H])[CH2][CH2][CX3](=O)[OX1H]')
  rule1_pattern_alt = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[NX3][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX1H])[CH2][CH2][CH2][CX3](=O)[OX1H]')
  ```

- These patterns may be too specific and not flexible enough to match the variations in the SMILES.

**Suggestion:**

- Use a more general SMARTS pattern that captures any α-amino dicarboxylic acid with a chain length of 4 to 5 carbons.

---

### **Rule 2**: Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids with EWGs Yield High; EDGs Yield Low

**Expected Molecules to Match (High Yield):**

- **C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)[N+](=O)[O-]** (SMILES #22)
- **C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O** (SMILES #2)

**Expected Molecules to Match (Low Yield):**

- **CC1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=O)O** (SMILES #24)

**Feature Matrix Observation:**

- SMILES #2, #5, #11, #13, #21, #22, #23, #24, and #27 have a **1** under Rule 2.

- SMILES #24 should be assigned **-1** but has **1**.

**Issue:**

- The code doesn't distinguish between electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) and electron-donating groups (EDGs) correctly.

**Code Review:**

- The SMARTS patterns used are:

  ```python
  benzoic_acid = Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1ccc(cc1)C(=O)[O;H,-]')
  ewg_para = Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1cc([NX3](=O)=O)cc([C](=O)[O;H,-])c1')
  edg_para = Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1cc([OX2H])cc([C](=O)[O;H,-])c1')
  ```

- The patterns are too specific and may not match all possible EWGs and EDGs.

**Suggestion:**

- Define SMARTS patterns for common EWGs and EDGs and match them at the para position.

---

### **Rule 3**: Nitrogen Heterocycles Directly Attached to Carboxylic Acid Yield High

**Expected Molecules to Match:**

- **C1=CN=CC=C1C(=O)O** (SMILES #23)
- **C1=CNC(=O)C=C1C(=O)O** (SMILES #9)
- **C1=C(C=NN1)C(=O)O** (SMILES #17)

**Feature Matrix Observation:**

- All entries under Rule 3 are **0**.

**Issue:**

- The SMARTS pattern may not be correctly identifying nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to carboxylic acids.

**Code Review:**

- The SMARTS pattern used is:

  ```python
  heterocycle_carboxylic_acid = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[n][c,C](C(=O)[O;H,-])')
  ```

- This pattern might miss certain heterocycles due to its specificity.

**Suggestion:**

- Broaden the SMARTS pattern to include various nitrogen heterocycles like pyridine, pyrrole, pyrazole, etc.

---

### **Rule 4**: Aliphatic Thiol Carboxylic Acids Yield High; Aromatic Thiol Carboxylic Acids Yield Low

**Expected Molecules to Match (High Yield):**

- **C(CS)C(=O)O** (SMILES #19)

**Expected Molecules to Match (Low Yield):**

- **C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)S** (SMILES #11)

**Feature Matrix Observation:**

- SMILES #19 has a **1** under Rule 2 instead of Rule 4.

- SMILES #11 has a **1** under Rule 2 and **0** under Rule 4.

**Issue:**

- Rule 4 is not correctly matching the aliphatic and aromatic thiol carboxylic acids.

**Code Review:**

- The SMARTS patterns are:

  ```python
  aliphatic_thiol_carboxylic_acid = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[#6][SX2H][#6][CX3](=O)[OX1H]')
  aromatic_thiol_carboxylic_acid = Chem.MolFromSmarts('c[SX2H][CX3](=O)[OX1H]')
  ```

- These patterns may not be matching due to incorrect placement of the thiol group.

**Suggestion:**

- Correct the SMARTS patterns to accurately capture aliphatic and aromatic thiol carboxylic acids.

---

### **Rule 5**: Unsubstituted Medium-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Yield High; Terminal Polar Groups Decrease Yield

**Expected Molecules to Match (High Yield):**

- **CCCCCCCC(=O)O** (SMILES #6)

**Expected Molecules to Match (Low Yield):**

- **C(CCCO)CCC(=O)O** (SMILES #30)
- **C(CCCN)CCC(=O)O** (SMILES #32)
- **C(CCCC(=O)O)CCCN** (SMILES #35)

**Feature Matrix Observation:**

- All entries under Rule 5 are **0**.

**Issue:**

- The SMARTS patterns may not be matching the medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids and their polar derivatives.

**Code Review:**

- The SMARTS patterns are:

  ```python
  medium_chain_carboxylic_acid = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CX3](=O)[OX1H][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH3]')
  terminal_polar_group = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CX3](=O)[OX1H][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][NX3,HX2]')
  ```

- The chain length and the terminal polar groups may not be accurately captured.

**Suggestion:**

- Use a more general pattern to match chain lengths of 6-8 carbons and identify terminal polar groups like hydroxyl and amino.

---

### **Rule 6**: Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups on Short Aliphatic Chains Yield High

**Expected Molecule to Match:**

- **C([C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](C(=O)O)O)O)O)O)O** (SMILES #10)

**Feature Matrix Observation:**

- All entries under Rule 6 are **0**.

**Issue:**

- The code is not matching the molecule with multiple hydroxyl groups.

**Code Review:**

- The SMARTS pattern is:

  ```python
  multiple_hydroxyls_short_chain = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CX3](=O)[OX1H][CH2][CH(OH)][CH(OH)][CH(OH)][CH2][OH]')
  ```

- This pattern is too specific to gluconic acid and may not match due to stereochemistry or chain length.

**Suggestion:**

- Generalize the pattern to match any short aliphatic chain with multiple hydroxyl groups.

---

### **Rule 7**: Modifiers with Carbonyl Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acids Yield Low

**Expected Molecules to Match:**

- **C1=CC(=CC=C1C=O)C(=O)O** (SMILES #21)
- **C1=CC(=C(C=C1C=O)C(=O)O)O** (SMILES #20)
- **C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O** (SMILES #29)

**Feature Matrix Observation:**

- All entries under Rule 7 are **0**.

**Issue:**

- The SMARTS pattern may not be matching the molecules with carbonyl groups adjacent to carboxylic acids.

**Code Review:**

- The SMARTS pattern is:

  ```python
  carbonyl_adjacent_carboxylic_acid = Chem.MolFromSmarts('C(=O)[CX3](=O)[OX1H]')
  ```

- This pattern may be too simplistic and miss aromatic aldehydes or ketones adjacent to carboxylic acids.

**Suggestion:**

- Modify the pattern to include carbonyl groups (aldehyde or ketone) adjacent to carboxylic acids, including aromatic systems.

---

### **Rule 8**: Modifiers with Polyether Chains Yield Low

**Expected Molecules to Match:**

- **COCCOCCOCC(=O)O** (SMILES #12)
- **C(COCCOCCN)C(=O)O** (SMILES #33)

**Feature Matrix Observation:**

- All entries under Rule 8 are **0**.

**Issue:**

- The SMARTS pattern may not be matching polyether chains correctly.

**Code Review:**

- The SMARTS pattern is:

  ```python
  polyether_chain = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[OX2][CH2][CH2][OX2][CH2][CH2][OX2][CH2][CH2][OX2]')
  ```

- This pattern is too specific and may not match variations in polyether chain lengths.

**Suggestion:**

- Generalize the pattern to match polyether chains of varying lengths.

---

### **Further Observations:**

- **Rule 9**: Only SMILES #15 has a **-1**, which is appropriate as it contains perfluorinated chains.

- **Rules 10-15**: All entries are **0**, indicating that the rules are not matching any SMILES, suggesting issues with the SMARTS patterns.

---

**Overall Issues:**

- The SMARTS patterns are often too specific, focusing on exact substructures without accounting for variations.

- There is a lack of generalization in the patterns to match different molecules that fit the same rule.

- Some SMARTS patterns may have syntax errors or misplacements, causing them to fail in matching.

---

** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Use More General SMARTS Patterns**

  - **Issue**: The SMARTS patterns are too specific and miss valid matches.
  - **Solution**: Generalize patterns to include variable chain lengths and allow for different substituents. For example, for Rule 1, use:

    ```python
    rule1_pattern = Chem.MolFromSmarts('N[C;R0][C;R0](=O)O[C;R0][C;R0][C;R0](=O)O')
    ```

    This pattern captures α-amino dicarboxylic acids with variable chain lengths.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Incorporate Functional Group Lists for EWGs and EDGs**

  - **Issue**: The code does not correctly differentiate between EWGs and EDGs.
  - **Solution**: Define lists of common EWGs and EDGs and create SMARTS patterns that check for their presence at the para position. For Rule 2, consider:

    ```python
    EWG_patterns = [Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1ccc(cc1)[CX3](=O)[O;H,-]'), Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1ccc(cc1)[N+](=O)[O-]')]
    EDG_patterns = [Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1ccc(cc1)[CH3]'), Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1ccc(cc1)O')]
    ```

- **Suggestion 3**: **Account for Tautomeric Forms and Stereochemistry**

  - **Issue**: Molecules may not match due to stereochemistry or tautomeric forms.
  - **Solution**: Use SMARTS patterns that are stereochemistry-agnostic and consider tautomeric forms. For example, omit chirality markers like '@' unless necessary.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Use Recursive SMARTS or Logical Operators**

  - **Issue**: Some functional groups are complex and vary in structure.
  - **Solution**: Use recursive SMARTS or logical operators to create more flexible patterns. For Rule 3, you could use:

    ```python
    heterocycle_patterns = [Chem.MolFromSmarts('[nH]'), Chem.MolFromSmarts('[n]')]
    ```

    Then check if the heterocycle is directly attached to the carboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Test SMARTS Patterns Individually**

  - **Issue**: Patterns may have syntax errors or not perform as intended.
  - **Solution**: Validate each SMARTS pattern against known molecules to ensure they match correctly before integrating them into the code.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Update the Matching Logic**

  - **Issue**: The current code may skip checking other patterns once a match is found.
  - **Solution**: Ensure that for rules with both high and low predictions, both patterns are checked, and the correct prediction is assigned based on the first match.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Utilize RDKit Functional Group Filters**

  - **Issue**: Manually writing SMARTS patterns for complex groups is error-prone.
  - **Solution**: Leverage RDKit's built-in functional group definitions and matching functions to identify groups like thiols, ethers, etc.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Include Substructure Match Counts**

  - **Issue**: Some molecules may contain multiple relevant functional groups.
  - **Solution**: Count the number of matches and assign predictions based on thresholds, if applicable.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Improve Documentation in Code**

  - **Issue**: The code lacks comments explaining complex patterns.
  - **Solution**: Add comments and explanations for each SMARTS pattern to make the code more maintainable and understandable.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Quantify Structural Features in Rules**

  Revise the rules to include specific, quantifiable molecular features that can be directly derived from SMILES representations. For example, instead of stating "short-chain (4 to 5 carbons) α-amino dicarboxylic acids yield high," specify the exact carbon chain length range (e.g., "modifiers with aliphatic chains of 4–5 carbons, containing an α-amino group and two carboxylic acid groups, yield high"). This quantification facilitates the generation of a numeric feature matrix.

- **Advice 2**: **Standardize Functional Group Descriptors**

  Use standardized functional group descriptors and molecular substructures that can be easily identified in SMILES. Implement SMARTS patterns to define functional groups like amino acids, benzoic acids with para-substituents, or nitrogen heterocycles. This standardization enables automated parsing and feature extraction from SMILES strings.

- **Advice 3**: **Define Electronic Effects Numerically**

  Replace qualitative terms like "electron-withdrawing" or "electron-donating" with quantifiable electronic parameters such as Hammett sigma constants or calculated partial charges. For instance, assign numeric values to substituents based on their electronic properties to create continuous variables in the feature matrix.

- **Advice 4**: **Specify Molecular Property Thresholds**

  Introduce thresholds for molecular properties that influence yield, such as logP (lipophilicity), molecular weight, or polar surface area. For example, "modifiers with a logP between X and Y or a polar surface area greater than Z yield high." These properties are computable from SMILES and provide quantitative features.

- **Advice 5**: **Consolidate Similar Rules**

  Merge overlapping rules to reduce complexity and redundancy. For example, combine Rules 2, 13, and 14 concerning substituents on aromatic rings into a single rule that accounts for substituent effects using quantifiable parameters. This streamlining simplifies the feature extraction process.

- **Advice 6**: **Include Structural Alerts for Low Yield**

  Develop a list of structural motifs or functional groups that are known to decrease yield, such as aldehyde groups adjacent to carboxylic acids or polyether chains. Encode these as binary features (presence or absence) to assist in identifying unfavorable modifiers.

- **Advice 7**: **Utilize Molecular Fingerprints**

  Apply molecular fingerprinting techniques (e.g., Morgan fingerprints) to capture molecular substructures systematically. Incorporate these fingerprints into the feature matrix to represent the presence of specific rings, chains, or functional groups numerically.

- **Advice 8**: **Implement Binary Encoding for Functional Groups**

  Create binary variables for the presence or absence of key functional groups identified in the rules (e.g., amino groups, thiol groups, hydroxyl groups). This encoding enables straightforward incorporation into a numeric feature matrix.

- **Advice 9**: **Refine Chain Length Definitions**

  Provide exact definitions for terms like "medium-chain" or "short-chain" by specifying the number of carbons. For example, redefine "medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids" as "aliphatic carboxylic acids with carbon chain lengths between 6 and 8."

- **Advice 10**: **Leverage Cheminformatics Tools**

  Utilize cheminformatics libraries (such as RDKit) to automate the extraction of molecular descriptors and features from SMILES strings based on the revised rules. This approach ensures accuracy and efficiency in generating the numeric feature matrix.

- **Advice 11**: **Incorporate Topological Descriptors**

  Add topological indices (e.g., Wiener index, Balaban index) to capture the molecule's connectivity and shape, which may correlate with yield. These indices can be calculated from SMILES and included as quantitative features.

- **Advice 12**: **Account for Steric Factors Quantitatively**

  Introduce steric parameters, such as molar refractivity or Verloop steric parameters, to quantify the impact of bulky substituents mentioned in the rules. These numerical values can help in assessing steric hindrance effects.

- **Advice 13**: **Use Multivariate Analysis to Refine Rules**

  Apply statistical methods and machine learning models to the existing dataset to identify the most significant features influencing yield. Use these insights to refine the rules, making them more data-driven and quantitatively robust.

- **Advice 14**: **Document Exceptions and Anomalies**

  Keep track of any modifiers that do not fit the established rules and investigate the reasons. Understanding anomalies can lead to the discovery of new features or the adjustment of existing rules to improve their predictive power.

- **Advice 15**: **Ensure Consistent Terminology**

  Standardize the terminology used in the rules for clarity and consistency. Clearly define all terms and ensure they are used uniformly throughout the rules to avoid ambiguity during feature extraction.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Correct Rule 1 SMARTS Pattern**
  
  In **Rule 1**, the SMARTS pattern is `'[N;H2][C;D3]([C](=O)[O])[C](=O)[O]'`. The `[C;D3]` specifies a carbon with a degree of 3, which is incorrect for an α-carbon bearing four substituents (amino group, hydrogen, and two carboxylic acids). **Change the SMARTS pattern to `'[N;H2][C;D4]([C](=O)[O])[C](=O)[O]'`** to correctly represent the tetrahedral α-carbon in short-chain α-amino dicarboxylic acids.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Revise Rule 2 SMARTS Pattern for Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids**

  In **Rule 2**, the SMARTS pattern `'[cH]1ccc([CX3](=O)[OX1H])c([*!H])[cH]1'` may not correctly identify para-substituted benzoic acids with polar groups. **Update the SMARTS to `'[cH]1ccc([CX3](=O)[OX1H])c([!H])[cH]1'`** to match any para-substituent and then **define a separate SMARTS pattern for polar groups**, such as `'[!#6;!H]'` (non-carbon, non-hydrogen atoms) attached at the para position.

  Additionally, **modify the `exclude_smarts` to specifically exclude non-polar groups** like methyl (`'[cH]1ccc(C)[cH]c1[CX3](=O)[OX1H]'`) to prevent false positives.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Expand Rule 3 SMARTS Pattern for Nitrogen Heterocycles**

  The current **Rule 3** SMARTS pattern `'[n][c]([CX3](=O)[OX1H])[c]'` may be too restrictive and miss some heterocycles. **Update the SMARTS to `'[n][c]:c:[c][CX3](=O)[OX1H]'`** to match carboxylic acids directly attached to various nitrogen heterocycles. This modification accounts for different ring sizes and substitution patterns.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Generalize Rule 5 for Medium-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids**

  **Rule 5** currently uses the SMARTS `'[CH3][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CX3](=O)[OX1H]'`, which only matches octanoic acid. **Generalize the pattern to `'[CH3][CH2]{4,6}[CX3](=O)[OX1H]'`** to match aliphatic chains with 5 to 7 carbons before the carboxylic acid group.

  Also, **refine the `exclude_smarts` pattern to better exclude terminal polar groups**, such as using `'*[CH2][OH]'` or `'*[CH2][NH2]'`, ensuring only modifiers with terminal polar groups are excluded.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Enhance Rule 7 to Capture Adjacent Carbonyl Groups**

  In **Rule 7**, the pattern `'[C](=O)[C](=O)[OX1H]'` may not capture all modifiers with carbonyl groups adjacent to carboxylic acids or aromatic rings. **Expand the SMARTS to include aldehyde and ketone groups adjacent to aromatic systems**, such as `'*[CX3](=O)[CX3](=O)[O][H]'` and `'[c][CX3](=O)[#6]'` to cover more structures as per the rule description.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Verify and Adjust Other SMARTS Patterns**

  **Review the SMARTS patterns for other rules** to ensure they match the natural language descriptions:

  - **Rule 6**: Confirm that the pattern `'[C;D4H]([OH])([OH])[OH]'` correctly identifies modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on short chains.
  - **Rule 8**: Ensure the pattern for polyether chains accurately matches modifiers with such structures.
  - **Rule 9**: The pattern `'[CX4]([F])([F])[F]'` might be too general. **Refine it to match perfluorinated chains more specifically**, perhaps by specifying chain length.
  - **Rule 10**: Adjust the patterns to distinguish between medium and short chains in hydroxyphenylalkanoic acids.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Test and Validate the Updated Patterns**

  After updating the SMARTS patterns, **run the code on the SMILES list again**. **Check the feature matrix to ensure that matches correspond to the correct rules and expected yields**. Verify that:

  - Modifiers expected to match certain rules now have the correct values (1 or -1).
  - The number of zeros decreases where matches are expected.
  - The matrix reflects the dataset accurately.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Improve Exclusion Patterns to Prevent False Positives**

  **Add or refine `exclude_smarts` patterns where necessary** to prevent the SMARTS from matching unintended structures. For example:

  - In **Rule 4**, ensure that aromatic thiols are effectively excluded by adjusting the pattern to `'*[c][SX2H]'`.
  - In **Rule 14**, clarify the exclusion of polyfunctional groups by specifying functional groups that interfere with coordination.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Include Comments and Examples in Code**

  **Enhance the code with comments and examples** for each rule's SMARTS pattern. **Add example SMILES strings that should match or not match each rule**, aiding in understanding and future maintenance.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Implement Unit Tests for Each Rule**

  **Develop unit tests for each SMARTS pattern** to automatically verify that:

  - The pattern matches all intended modifiers.
  - The pattern does not match unintended structures.
  - Changes to the code do not break existing functionality.

  This will ensure the robustness of the transformation and facilitate future updates.

---

**Analysis of Metrics**

1. **Support Decrease:**

   - **Trend:** The train support has significantly decreased from approximately 16-18% in the reference metrics to just 0.41% in the latest iteration.
   - **Implication:** A lower support indicates that the rules cover a smaller portion of the dataset. While specific rules can have high precision, overly narrow rules may not be practical for broader predictions.

2. **Confidence Stability:**

   - **Trend:** Train confidence has remained relatively stable, hovering around 57-60% in the current iterations compared to 54-64% in the reference metrics.
   - **Implication:** The consistency in confidence suggests that when the rule conditions are met, the likelihood of correctly predicting a high yield remains relatively unchanged. However, the slight decrease in confidence in the latest iteration might indicate overfitting.

3. **Lift Consistency:**

   - **Trend:** Train lift values have remained slightly above 1 in both the reference and current metrics.
   - **Implication:** A lift greater than 1 indicates that the rule is better at predicting the outcome than random chance. The stability in lift suggests that the rules maintain their predictive advantage, but the marginal decrease might point to diminishing returns in predictive power.

4. **Leverage Decrease:**

   - **Trend:** There is a noticeable decrease in train leverage from around 0.0289 in the reference metrics to 0.0020 in the latest iteration.
   - **Implication:** Leverage measures the difference between observed and expected support. A decrease implies that the additional predictive power contributed by the rule over chance is diminishing.

---

**Assessment of Local Minimum and Iterations**

- **Local Minimum Indication:**
  - The decreasing support and leverage, combined with relatively stable confidence and lift, suggest that the current set of rules may have reached a local minimum in terms of performance improvement.
  - **Overfitting Concern:** The rules are becoming increasingly specific, capturing fewer cases (lower support) without substantial gains in confidence or lift. This trend indicates potential overfitting to specific instances in the training data.

- **Sufficiency of Iterations:**
  - Given the diminishing returns observed in the metrics, additional iterations following the same refinement strategy may not yield significant improvements.
  - It may be time to reevaluate the approach rather than continue with further iterations that focus on increasing rule specificity.

---

**Recommendations for Improving the Current Rules**

1. **Increase Rule Generality:**

   - **Action:** Broaden the conditions of some overly specific rules to cover a larger portion of the dataset.
   - **Rationale:** Increasing support will enhance the practical applicability of the rules, ensuring they are useful for predicting new cases.

2. **Balance Between Confidence and Support:**

   - **Action:** Aim for a balance where both confidence and support are optimized.
   - **Rationale:** High confidence with extremely low support limits the usefulness of a rule. Slightly reducing confidence may be acceptable if it significantly increases support.

3. **Merge Similar Rules:**

   - **Action:** Identify and combine rules that have overlapping conditions or similar implications.
   - **Rationale:** Merging can increase support and simplify the rule set, making it more robust and easier to apply.

4. **Re-examine the Data Set:**

   - **Action:** Analyze instances where the rules fail to predict correctly and identify any patterns or features that were previously overlooked.
   - **Rationale:** There may be hidden variables or relationships affecting yields that, once identified, can be incorporated into the rules.

5. **Incorporate New Features:**

   - **Action:** Consider additional molecular descriptors or physicochemical properties such as polarity, molecular weight, or steric factors.
   - **Rationale:** Including new relevant features can improve the predictive capability of the rules by capturing aspects not previously considered.

6. **Avoid Overfitting:**

   - **Action:** Ensure that the rules are not too tailored to the training data by validating them against an independent test set.
   - **Rationale:** Overfitting reduces the generalizability of the rules to new data, limiting their usefulness in practical applications.

7. **Statistical Validation:**

   - **Action:** Use statistical methods to test the significance of each rule, possibly employing techniques like cross-validation.
   - **Rationale:** This will help in assessing the reliability of the rules and their predictive power beyond the training data.

8. **Iterative Refinement with Feedback:**

   - **Action:** Implement a feedback mechanism where the performance of rules is continually monitored and adjusted based on new data.
   - **Rationale:** Real-time adjustments can help maintain the relevance and accuracy of the rule set over time.

9. **Engage Domain Expertise:**

   - **Action:** Consult with chemists or materials scientists to validate the logical consistency and practical applicability of the rules.
   - **Rationale:** Expert insights can highlight real-world constraints or confirm theoretical predictions, enhancing the quality of the rules.

---

**Conclusion**

While the current rules exhibit acceptable confidence and lift values, the significant decrease in support and leverage indicates that they have become too specialized. This over-specialization limits their predictive utility across the broader dataset. To improve the current rules:

- **Prioritize Increasing Support:** Adjust rules to apply to a wider range of data without severely compromising confidence.
- **Optimize Rule Complexity:** Simplify overly complex rules to prevent overfitting and improve generalizability.
- **Incorporate Additional Data Insights:** Seek new patterns or features in the data that can enhance the predictive performance of the rules.

By implementing these recommendations, we can develop a more robust and effective set of rules that better balance confidence, lift, support, and leverage, ultimately improving the predictive performance for the catalytic problem at hand.

ML Commenter Message:
**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

After reviewing the latest training results and comparing them with previous iterations, several observations can be made regarding the performance of the current rules.

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**

   - **Decrease in Validation Accuracy:** The validation accuracy has significantly decreased from approximately **0.76** in previous iterations to **0.4857** in the latest iteration. This indicates that the current rules are not as effective in capturing the underlying patterns of the data.

   - **SHAP Analysis Indicating Overreliance on a Single Rule:** The SHAP values from the latest iteration show that **only Rule 9** is contributing to the model's predictions, with other rules having zero or negligible SHAP values. This suggests that the model is heavily reliant on Rule 9, which may not be sufficient to accurately predict the outcomes.

2. **Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting:**

   - **Underfitting Indicated by Low Accuracy:** The drop in validation accuracy suggests that the model is underfitting. It is not capturing the complexity of the data, possibly due to an oversimplified feature representation or inadequate rule coverage.

3. **Discrepancies in Predictions:**

   - **Overestimated Loadings:** For several molecules where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low (e.g., *C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N*), Rule 9 has a positive SHAP value. This indicates that Rule 9 is contributing to the overestimation.

   - **Underestimated Loadings:** For molecules where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high (e.g., *C([C@@H](C(=O)O)N)C(=O)O*), the SHAP value for Rule 9 is zero. This lack of contribution suggests that the rule is not accounting for these cases.

4. **Interpretation of Accuracy Metrics:**

   - **Lack of Improvement:** The model's accuracy has not improved over iterations; instead, it has worsened. This suggests that the current set of rules may have reached a local minimum and are insufficient for better performance.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**

   - **Rule 9 Dominance:** The SHAP analysis highlights that Rule 9 is the only significant contributor in the current model. Other rules are either not implemented correctly or are not influencing the predictions.

   - **Potential Misalignment of Rules with Data:** The reliance on Rule 9 indicates a possible misalignment between the rule set and the dataset's characteristics.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

1. **Refine Rule Implementation:**

   - **Ensure Comprehensive Feature Encoding:** Verify that all current rules (Rules 1-14) are properly encoded into the feature matrix. The lack of SHAP values for other rules suggests they may not be effectively incorporated.

2. **Adjust Rule 9:**

   - **Reevaluate Rule 9's Definition:** Since Rule 9 is contributing to incorrect predictions, consider refining its criteria. Assess whether modifiers with perfluorinated chains are appropriately classified and if exceptions need to be accounted for.

3. **Enhance Underrepresented Rules:**

   - **Incorporate Additional Features:** For molecules where the experimental value is high but the prediction is low, identify which rules should apply and ensure they are influencing the model.

4. **Improve Generalization:**

   - **Address Underfitting:** Introduce additional relevant rules or refine existing ones to capture more variability in the data. This will help the model learn more complex patterns and improve accuracy.

5. **Review Feature Generation Process:**

   - **Audit the Feature Matrix Creation:** Ensure that the process translating rules into features is functioning correctly. All relevant molecular features should be represented, and any issues causing only one rule to dominate should be resolved.

6. **Balance Rule Contributions:**

   - **Prevent Overreliance on a Single Rule:** Adjust the model or feature weights to prevent overemphasis on Rule 9. Encourage a more balanced contribution from multiple rules to improve prediction accuracy.

7. **Iterative Refinement and Evaluation:**

   - **Use SHAP Analysis for Rule Adjustment:** While we cannot directly modify rules based on SHAP values, we can use the insights to identify which rules may need refinement. Focus on rules associated with high positive SHAP values for overestimations and high negative SHAP values for underestimations.

8. **Incorporate Domain Expertise:**

   - **Consult Chemical Knowledge:** Reassess the rules based on chemical properties and interactions. Ensure that the rules make sense chemically and are likely to influence catalyst loading.

**Conclusion**

The current model's performance indicates that the rules require refinement and better implementation. By addressing the overreliance on Rule 9, ensuring all rules are effectively contributing, and improving the feature generation process, we can enhance the model's accuracy. Continuous iterative evaluation, guided by SHAP analysis and domain expertise, will help in developing more predictive and generalizable rules for the catalytic problem at hand.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

The current set of rules aims to predict and optimize the yield of a radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction by analyzing the structures of molecular modifiers using SMILES representations. Recent evaluations have highlighted several issues with the performance and applicability of these rules. Below is a summary of the key points from the discussions and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Analysis of Current Rules Against Dataset:**

   - The existing rules were scrutinized against the provided dataset of modifiers categorized by their yield outcomes (high or low).
   - Certain rules were found to be valid and aligned with the dataset, while others required revisions due to inconsistencies or inaccuracies.
   - Modifications to rules were proposed to better reflect the observed experimental results, leading to an updated list of 14 refined rules.

2. **Observations from Rule Metrics and Performance Analysis:**

   - **Decreasing Support and Leverage:** There was a significant decrease in train support and leverage across iterations, indicating that the rules are becoming too specific and covering a smaller portion of the dataset.
   - **Stable Confidence and Lift:** Train confidence and lift remained relatively stable, suggesting that when rules applied, they were somewhat effective, but the overall predictive power didn't improve substantially.
   - **Validation Accuracy Decline:** The validation accuracy dropped from approximately 76% in earlier iterations to around 48% in the latest one, indicating diminished model performance.
   - **Overreliance on Single Rule:** SHAP analysis revealed that only one rule (Rule 9) significantly contributed to the model's predictions, leading to potential overfitting and underrepresentation of other relevant rules.

3. **Concerns About Overfitting and Underfitting:**

   - The model is potentially overfitting to specific instances due to overly narrow rules, reducing its generalizability.
   - Conversely, the decline in overall accuracy suggests underfitting, as the model fails to capture the complexity of the data adequately.

**Suggestions to Improve Current Rules**

1. **Refine SMARTS Patterns for Accurate Representation:**

   - **Rule 1 Adjustment:** Correct the SMARTS pattern to `'[N;H2][C;D4]([C](=O)[O])[C](=O)[O]'` to accurately represent the tetrahedral α-carbon in short-chain α-amino dicarboxylic acids.
   - **Rule 2 Revision:** Update the SMARTS pattern to capture para-substituted benzoic acids with polar groups more effectively. Use a pattern like `'[cH]1ccc([CX3](=O)[OX1H])c([!#1])[cH]1'` and ensure that polar groups are accurately identified.
   - **Rule 3 Expansion:** Broaden the SMARTS to include various nitrogen heterocycles. For example, use `'[n][c]([CX3](=O)[OX1H])[c]'` to capture different ring sizes and substitution patterns.
   - **Rule 5 Generalization:** Modify the SMARTS pattern to `'[CH3][CH2]{4,6}[CX3](=O)[OX1H]'` to encompass medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with chains of 5 to 7 carbons.
   - **Rule 7 Enhancement:** Expand the pattern to include aldehyde and ketone groups adjacent to both carboxylic acids and aromatic rings. For instance, use `'[c][CX3](=O)[C](=O)[OX1H]'`.

2. **Improve Exclusion Patterns:**

   - Refine `exclude_smarts` patterns to prevent false positives and ensure that only intended structures are matched.
   - For example, in Rule 4, adjust the exclusion to `'*[c][SX2H]'` to effectively exclude aromatic thiols.

3. **Verify and Adjust Other Rules:**

   - **Rule 6 Verification:** Ensure that the SMARTS pattern accurately captures modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on short chains.
   - **Rule 9 Refinement:** Narrow down the pattern to more specifically match perfluorinated chains, considering chain length and full fluorination.
   - **Rule 10 Adjustment:** Differentiate patterns to distinguish between medium and short chains in hydroxyphenylalkanoic acids.

4. **Balance Rule Specificity and Generality:**

   - Avoid overly specific rules that capture only a few instances, which leads to low support and practical inefficiency.
   - Strive for a balance where rules are general enough to cover a broader dataset while maintaining adequate confidence levels.

5. **Enhance Feature Representation:**

   - Ensure all relevant rules are properly encoded into the feature matrix, and their contributions are reflected in the model predictions.
   - Incorporate additional molecular descriptors or physicochemical properties, such as polarity, steric hindrance, and electronic effects, to improve model accuracy.

6. **Implement Unit Tests and Validation:**

   - Develop unit tests for each SMARTS pattern to verify that they match intended structures and exclude unintended ones.
   - Use cross-validation techniques to assess the statistical significance of each rule and avoid overfitting.

7. **Engage Domain Experts:**

   - Collaborate with chemists or materials scientists to validate the logical consistency and practical applicability of the rules.
   - Leverage expert insights to adjust rules based on chemical knowledge and reaction mechanisms.

8. **Iterative Refinement with Feedback:**

   - Continuously monitor the performance of rules and adjust them based on new data and feedback from SHAP analysis.
   - Prevent overreliance on a single rule by balancing contributions from all relevant rules.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

There is a clear possibility for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. By:

- **Broadening Rule Applicability:** Adjusting rules to cover more data points increases support and reduces the risk of overfitting to specific cases.
- **Enhancing Rule Quality:** Refining SMARTS patterns and exclusion criteria improves the precision of rules, enhancing model performance.
- **Improving Model Complexity Appropriately:** Incorporating additional relevant features can help the model capture complex patterns without overfitting, provided that model complexity aligns with the dataset size and diversity.
- **Validating Changes Thoroughly:** Using robust validation techniques ensures that improvements are genuine and not artifacts of overfitting.

**Conclusion**

By implementing the above suggestions and carefully refining the current rules, we can enhance the predictive performance of the model. The focus should be on increasing the generality of the rules, ensuring accurate feature representation, and preventing overreliance on any single rule.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Refine SMARTS Patterns for Accurate Representation**

  - **Rule 1 Adjustment**: **Correct the SMARTS pattern to accurately represent short-chain α-amino dicarboxylic acids.** Use the SMARTS pattern `'N[C@@H](C(=O)O)C(=O)O'` to capture the α-amino acid structure with a tetrahedral α-carbon. This pattern ensures that both carboxylic acid groups and the primary amine are correctly identified.

  - **Rule 2 Revision**: **Update the SMARTS pattern to effectively capture para-substituted benzoic acids with polar groups.** Use a pattern like `'c1ccc(cc1)[CX3](=O)[OX1H]'` to identify benzoic acid derivatives, and include an additional requirement for polar para-substituents using `'c1cc([NX3;H2,H1;!$(NC=O)], [OX2H], [SX2H], [F,Cl,Br,I])ccc1C(=O)O'`. This pattern captures para-substituted benzoic acids with polar groups such as amino, hydroxyl, thiol, or halogens.

  - **Rule 3 Expansion**: **Broaden the SMARTS to include various nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to carboxylic acids.** Use a pattern such as `'[$([nH]1cccc1),$([n]1ccccc1)]C(=O)O'` to capture heterocyclic compounds like pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid. This pattern ensures that the carboxylic acid is directly attached to the nitrogen-containing ring.

  - **Rule 5 Generalization**: **Modify the SMARTS pattern to cover medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids.** Use a pattern like `'CCCCC[CX3](=O)[OX1H]'` to include aliphatic carboxylic acids with chains of 5 carbons or adjust to `'C{4,6}[CX3](=O)[OX1H]'` for chains of 5 to 7 carbons. This generalization increases the rule's applicability to similar compounds.

  - **Rule 7 Enhancement**: **Expand the pattern to include aldehyde and ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acids or aromatic rings.** Use SMARTS like `'[CX3](=O)[CX3H1](=O)'` to identify carboxylic acids with adjacent carbonyl groups and `'c[CX3](=O)[CX3H1](=O)'` for aromatic rings with adjacent carbonyls. This enhancement captures modifiers that may engage in side reactions or reduce yield due to competing functionalities.

- **Advice 2**: **Improve Exclusion Patterns**

  - **Refine `exclude_smarts` patterns to prevent false positives and ensure accurate matching.** For example, in **Rule 4** (Aliphatic Thiol Carboxylic Acids Yield High), adjust the exclusion pattern to `'c[S][H]'` to effectively exclude aromatic thiols while allowing aliphatic thiols. This ensures that only modifiers with thiol groups on aliphatic chains are captured.

- **Advice 3**: **Verify and Adjust Other Rules**

  - **Rule 6 Verification**: **Ensure the SMARTS pattern accurately captures modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on short chains.** Use a pattern like `'C(C(C(C(C(=O)O)O)O)O)O'` to represent pentahydroxyhexanoic acid. Alternatively, generalize with `'C(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)C(=O)O'` to include other polyhydroxylated short-chain carboxylic acids.

  - **Rule 9 Refinement**: **Narrow the SMARTS pattern to specifically match perfluorinated chains.** Use a pattern like `'C(F)(F)C(F)(F)C(F)(F)C(F)(F)C(=O)O'` to capture modifiers like nonafluoropentanoic acid. Ensure that the chain length and degree of fluorination are accurately specified to avoid matching partially fluorinated compounds.

  - **Rule 10 Adjustment**: **Differentiate patterns to distinguish between medium and short chains in hydroxyphenylalkanoic acids.** For medium-length chains yielding high, use `'c1ccc(cc1)CCCC[CX3](=O)[OX1H]'`. For short chains yielding low, use `'c1ccc(cc1)CC[CX3](=O)[OX1H]'`. This adjustment helps in correctly categorizing the modifiers based on chain length.

- **Advice 4**: **Balance Rule Specificity and Generality**

  - **Avoid overly specific SMARTS patterns that reduce rule support.** Ensure that each rule covers a sufficient portion of the dataset by generalizing patterns where appropriate. For instance, instead of specifying exact chain lengths or substituents, use ranges or groups of similar functional groups to broaden applicability without sacrificing accuracy.

- **Advice 5**: **Enhance Feature Representation**

  - **Incorporate additional molecular descriptors or physicochemical properties into the rules.** Include features like hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, molecular polarity, or steric factors. For example, consider the presence of hydrogen bond donors using `'[$([NH2]),$([OH]),$([SH])]'` in SMARTS patterns. This can improve the predictive power of the rules by accounting for interactions affecting yield.

  - **Ensure all relevant rules are correctly encoded into the feature matrix.** Verify that each rule's presence or absence is properly reflected in the dataset used for modeling. This may involve updating the feature extraction script or method to capture the refined SMARTS patterns.

- **Advice 6**: **Implement Unit Tests and Validation**

  - **Develop unit tests for each SMARTS pattern to verify correct matching.** Create a suite of test molecules, both positive and negative examples, for each rule. Use cheminformatics tools like RDKit to test whether the SMARTS patterns correctly identify the intended structures.

  - **Use cross-validation techniques to assess rule performance.** Apply k-fold cross-validation on the dataset to evaluate the statistical significance of each rule. This helps in understanding the robustness of the rules and prevents overfitting by ensuring they generalize well to unseen data.

- **Advice 7**: **Engage Domain Experts**

  - **Consult with chemists or materials scientists to validate and refine the rules.** Their expertise can provide insights into reaction mechanisms, steric and electronic effects, and other chemical factors influencing yield. Incorporate their feedback to adjust the SMARTS patterns and rules accordingly.

- **Advice 8**: **Iterative Refinement with Feedback**

  - **Continuously monitor and adjust the rules based on performance metrics and feedback.** Use model interpretability tools like SHAP values to identify the contribution of each rule to the model's predictions. Adjust rule weights or thresholds if necessary to balance their influence.

  - **Prevent overreliance on a single rule by ensuring a balanced contribution from all rules.** This may involve revisiting rules that have low support or confidence and either refining them or, if necessary, removing them in favor of more impactful rules.

*Examples:*

- **Low Yield:**
  - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid

---

### **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with Perfluorinated Chains Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers with perfluorinated (highly fluorinated) aliphatic chains yield low, likely due to poor solubility and weak interactions with the catalyst.

*Examples:*

- **Low Yield:**
  - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid

---

### **Rule 10**: **Hydroxyphenylalkanoic Acids with Medium-Length Chains Yield High; Short Chains Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers with hydroxyphenyl groups connected via medium-length aliphatic chains (around 5 carbons) yield high due to balanced hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions. Shorter chains decrease yield.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
- **Low Yield:**
  - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

---

### **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with Fused Aromatic Systems Containing Heteroatoms Yield High**

**Description:** Modifiers with fused aromatic systems that contain heteroatoms (e.g., oxygen, nitrogen) yield high due to strong π-π stacking and coordination interactions.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid
  - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid

---

### **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with Bulky Non-Coordinating Substituents Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers with bulky substituents that are unable to coordinate with the catalyst result in low yield due to steric hindrance impeding effective interaction.

*Examples:*

- **Low Yield:**
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
  - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

---

### **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with Methoxy-Substituted Aromatic Rings Connected via Ketone Chains Yield High**

**Description:** Modifiers featuring methoxy-substituted aromatic rings connected through ketone-containing aliphatic chains yield high. The combination enhances electronic interactions and coordination.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid
- **Low Yield:**
  - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid (lacks ketone linkage)

---

### **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with Polyfunctional Groups That Interfere with Coordination Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers possessing multiple functional groups that may compete for coordination sites or affect solubility negatively impact the yield.

*Examples:*

- **Low Yield:**
  - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid
  - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: For **Rule 1**, the code currently counts the total number of carbon atoms in the molecule to determine chain length, which is inaccurate for identifying short-chain α-amino dicarboxylic acids. The code should be modified to specifically locate the α-amino dicarboxylic acid moiety and count the carbons in that chain. This can be achieved by using a SMARTS pattern that captures α-amino dicarboxylic acids and then analyzing the chain length of the matched substructure.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: For **Rule 2**, the SMARTS patterns for para-substituted benzoic acids with polar groups are too specific and limited to the examples provided. The code should use a more general pattern for para-substitution with any polar group. For instance, using wildcard atoms or a list of polar groups in the SMARTS pattern to match any polar substituent at the para position of benzoic acid.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For **Rule 5**, the pattern for medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids is too restrictive, as it requires a specific chain length and structure. Instead, the code should detect aliphatic carboxylic acids with carbon chains of 7 to 8 carbons more flexibly. This can be done by creating a SMARTS pattern with a variable-length carbon chain (e.g., using repetition operators) and ensuring there are no additional substituents or branches.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: The code for **Rule 6** uses a SMARTS pattern that matches a very specific structure with exactly three carbon atoms between two hydroxyl groups. To accurately capture modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on short chains, the code should use patterns that match any short aliphatic chain with multiple hydroxyl groups, regardless of their exact positions.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: For **Rule 9**, the SMARTS pattern only matches a specific perfluorinated chain and may miss other perfluorinated compounds. The code should be updated to identify any perfluorinated aliphatic chains by checking for carbon atoms fully substituted with fluorines over a chain, using recursive SMARTS or by counting the number of fluorine atoms attached to the carbon chain.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: In **Rule 14**, the SMARTS pattern may not capture all modifiers with polyfunctional groups that interfere with coordination. The code should be adjusted to search for multiple functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, carbonyl) that are present in the same molecule and could compete for coordination, using more general patterns or additional substructure searches.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: For all rules, ensure that the SMARTS patterns are general enough to capture all relevant cases described in the natural language rules. Avoid overly specific patterns that match only the examples provided. Incorporate wildcard atoms, variable chain lengths, and lists of functional groups where appropriate.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Incorporate additional logic in the code to accurately represent structural features. For instance, when positional isomerism is important (e.g., para-substitution in aromatic rings), use SMARTS patterns that specify atom connectivity and relative positions within rings to distinguish between ortho, meta, and para substitutions.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: Utilize recursive SMARTS patterns or cheminformatics tools to analyze substructures more effectively. This can help in identifying complex structural motifs, such as fused rings with heteroatoms or specific substitution patterns, that are not easily captured with simple SMARTS patterns.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Include validation steps in the code to confirm that the SMARTS patterns match the intended structures. Testing the patterns against a diverse set of molecules (including both positive and negative examples for each rule) can help ensure that the patterns are both sensitive and specific.

** End of Suggestions **
---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify and Standardize Rule Descriptions Using Molecular Descriptors**

  Simplify the rules by expressing them in terms of standard molecular descriptors that can be easily quantified, such as the number of hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, molecular weight, polar surface area, or specific functional group counts. This will facilitate the generation of a numeric feature matrix and make the rules more universally applicable.

  *Example Improvement:*

  - Original Rule 1: "Short-Chain α-Amino Dicarboxylic Acids Yield High"
  - Revised Rule 1: "Modifiers with 4–5 carbon chains containing both amino and two carboxylic acid groups yield high due to increased coordination sites (e.g., compounds with molecular weight between X and Y, H-bond donors ≥ 3)."

- **Advice 2**: **Use Structural Alerts and SMARTS Patterns for Functional Groups**

  Define the rules using SMARTS (SMILES Arbitrary Target Specification) patterns for specific functional groups or substructures. This allows for automated identification of these features in molecular structures and aids in numerical encoding.

  *Example Improvement:*

  - For sulfur-containing groups: Define a SMARTS pattern for aliphatic thiols and aromatic thiols to distinguish between high and low yield modifiers.

- **Advice 3**: **Consolidate Similar Rules to Reduce Redundancy**

  Identify rules that have overlapping features or outcomes and merge them to create more general rules. This reduces complexity and makes the rule set more manageable.

  *Example Improvement:*

  - Merge Rules 2 and 10, as both involve aromatic acids with substituents affecting yield, and express the influence of electron-withdrawing/donating groups on aromatic rings.

- **Advice 4**: **Incorporate Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) Parameters**

  Integrate QSAR parameters such as logP (octanol-water partition coefficient), topological polar surface area (TPSA), or molecular refractivity into the rules. These parameters are quantifiable and correlate with solubility, permeability, and interaction with the catalyst.

  *Example Improvement:*

  - A rule stating that modifiers with logP values between X and Y yield high due to optimal hydrophobic interactions.

- **Advice 5**: **Highlight Key Functional Groups Influencing Yield**

  Focus on the presence or absence of specific functional groups that have a significant impact on yield. Create rules that directly associate these groups with high or low yields.

  *Example Improvement:*

  - Rule: "Modifiers containing free amino groups adjacent to carboxylic acid groups yield high (e.g., α-amino acids)."

- **Advice 6**: **Express Rules in Terms of Electronic and Steric Effects**

  Articulate how electronic factors (e.g., electron-donating or -withdrawing groups) and steric hindrance affect the interaction with the catalyst. This approach allows for numerical representation using Hammett constants or steric parameters.

  *Example Improvement:*

  - Rule: "Modifiers with para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups on aromatic rings yield high due to enhanced catalyst coordination (quantified using σ constants)."

- **Advice 7**: **Create a Feature Matrix Template Based on the Revised Rules**

  Develop a template for a feature matrix where each column represents a quantifiable aspect of the modifiers based on the revised rules. Ensure all features can be numerically encoded (e.g., binary indicators for functional groups, counts, or physicochemical properties).

  *Example Features:*

  - Number of carboxylic acid groups
  - Presence of amino groups (Yes=1, No=0)
  - Chain length (number of carbons)
  - Aromatic ring substitution patterns
  - Calculated logP values

- **Advice 8**: **Prioritize Modifiers with Single Variable Changes**

  To better understand the impact of specific structural features, focus on modifiers that differ by one functional group or substituent. This helps isolate the effect of individual features and improves the robustness of the rules.

  *Example Improvement:*

  - Compare modifiers differing only by chain length or the presence of a hydroxyl group to assess their direct impact on yield.

- **Advice 9**: **Consider Solubility and Catalyst Interaction Parameters**

  Include descriptors related to solubility (e.g., aqueous solubility predictions) and specific interactions with the catalyst (e.g., coordination number, binding affinities if available). These can be important factors influencing yield.

- **Advice 10**: **Validate and Refine Rules Using Statistical Analysis**

  Use statistical methods, such as regression analysis or machine learning classifiers, to validate the revised rules against the dataset. This will help identify the most significant features and further refine the rules based on quantitative evidence.

- **Advice 11**: **Annotate Exceptions and Boundary Cases**

  Clearly identify any modifiers that do not fit the general patterns (exceptions) and analyze why they deviate. Adjust the rules to account for these cases or explicitly note them as exceptions.

- **Advice 12**: **Ensure Consistent Terminology and Units**

  Use consistent chemical terminology and units across all rules to avoid confusion and improve clarity. Define all terms and ensure they are used uniformly.

- **Advice 13**: **Facilitate Computational Implementation**

  Design the rules with computational implementation in mind. Use language and descriptors that can be directly translated into algorithms or data processing workflows.

- **Advice 14**: **Engage in Interdisciplinary Collaboration**

  Work with computational chemists or cheminformatics experts to translate chemical intuition into computationally tractable rules and features.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Quantify Structural Features for Numerical Encoding**

  Reframe the rules to focus on quantifiable structural features that can be directly extracted from SMILES strings. For instance, specify the exact number of carbon atoms in aliphatic chains, counts of specific functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino, carboxyl), and ring sizes. This will enable the creation of a numerical feature matrix where each feature corresponds to a count or binary indicator.

- **Advice 2**: **Use Molecular Descriptors and Fingerprints**

  Utilize cheminformatics tools (e.g., RDKit) to compute molecular descriptors and fingerprints for each modifier. Descriptors such as molecular weight, LogP (octanol-water partition coefficient), topological polar surface area (TPSA), number of rotatable bonds, and aromatic ring count can provide quantitative data that correlates with the reaction yield.

- **Advice 3**: **Standardize Definitions with Numerical Thresholds**

  Provide clear numerical thresholds for terms like "short-chain," "medium-chain," and "long-chain." For example, define "short-chain" as aliphatic chains with 1–4 carbons, "medium-chain" as 5–8 carbons, and "long-chain" as more than 8 carbons. This standardization allows for consistent numerical encoding across the dataset.

- **Advice 4**: **Simplify Complex Structural Rules**

  Break down complex structural descriptors into simpler, quantifiable features. For example, instead of "Modifiers with fused aromatic systems containing heteroatoms yield high," identify and count specific features like the number of fused rings or heteroatoms within the ring system.

- **Advice 5**: **Binary Encoding of Functional Groups**

  Encode the presence or absence of key functional groups as binary features. For each modifier, include binary variables indicating the presence of groups like amino, hydroxyl, carboxylic acid, thiol, and halogens. This approach simplifies the dataset and facilitates machine learning model training.

- **Advice 6**: **Quantify Electronic and Steric Effects**

  Where possible, calculate quantitative measures of electronic properties (e.g., Hammett sigma constants for substituents) and steric parameters (e.g., Taft steric factors). These can help in numerically capturing the effects of substituents on the catalyst interaction and reaction yield.

- **Advice 7**: **Create a Feature Matrix Aligned with the Rules**

  Develop a feature matrix where each column corresponds to a specific feature derived from the rules. For example, include features like "number of carboxylic acid groups," "presence of nitrogen heterocycles," "chain length," "degree of fluorination," and "number of hydroxyl groups." Populate the matrix with numerical values or binary indicators accordingly.

- **Advice 8**: **Map Rules to Computationally Accessible Features**

  Align each rule with features that can be directly computed from SMILES strings. For instance, Rule 2 can be associated with "para-substituted benzoic acids with polar substituents," which can be identified by detecting para-substitution patterns and calculating the polarity of substituents using molecular descriptors.

- **Advice 9**: **Incorporate Substructure Searches**

  Utilize substructure search algorithms to identify specific structural motifs mentioned in the rules (e.g., α-amino dicarboxylic acids, pyridine carboxylic acids). Tag each modifier with flags indicating the presence of these motifs, enabling numerical analysis based on rule-defined categories.

- **Advice 10**: **Validate and Refine Rules with Statistical Analysis**

  Perform statistical correlation analyses between the numerical features and the reaction yield. Use methods like Pearson correlation, chi-squared tests, or logistic regression to identify the most significant features. Refine the rules based on statistical significance and predictive power.

- **Advice 11**: **Automate Feature Extraction**

  Develop scripts or use existing cheminformatics software to automate the extraction of numerical features from SMILES strings. Automation reduces manual errors and ensures consistency in feature generation across the dataset.

- **Advice 12**: **Provide Detailed Examples with Numerical Values**

  Enhance the rules by including detailed examples where numerical values of features are explicitly stated. For instance, in Rule 5, specify that modifiers like octanoic acid (8 carbons, no additional polar groups) yield high, while 7-aminoheptanoic acid (7 carbons with terminal amino group) yields low.

- **Advice 13**: **Consider Cluster Analysis for Grouping Modifiers**

  Use unsupervised learning techniques like cluster analysis to group modifiers based on their numerical features. This can reveal natural groupings within the data and might suggest revisions or additions to the current rules.

- **Advice 14**: **Document Assumptions and Limitations**

  Clearly document any assumptions made during feature extraction and rule formulation. Acknowledge limitations due to data size or diversity, and highlight areas where additional data could improve rule accuracy.

- **Advice 15**: **Iteratively Update Rules Based on New Data**

  Treat the rule set as dynamic. As more data becomes available, iteratively update the rules and numerical models to improve predictive accuracy. Encourage feedback loops between experimental results and rule refinement.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Improve Coverage of Rules with Limited Data Support**

  For rules that currently have limited coverage due to minimal supporting data points (e.g., Rules 5, 6, 9, 11, 13), consider merging similar rules or broadening them to enhance their applicability:

  - **Combine Rules with Similar Functional Groups**:
    - **Rules 5 and 6** both deal with modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups. Merge these into a single rule focusing on *Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups on Short Aliphatic Chains Yield High*. This increases coverage by uniting data points supporting high yield due to enhanced hydrogen bonding and catalyst coordination.
    - **Rules 9 and 8** address modifiers with functionalities that reduce effective catalyst interaction (perfluorinated chains and polyether chains). Combine them into a broader rule: *Modifiers with Highly Electronegative or Flexible Chains Yield Low*, emphasizing how such features impede catalyst binding.
  
  - **Expand Scope of Specific Rules**:
    - **Rule 11** could be broadened to include all **Modifiers with Terminal Sulfur-Containing Groups on Aliphatic Chains**, discussing both thiols and possibly thioethers, to increase data support and coverage.
    - **Rule 13** might be extended to encompass **Modifiers with Electron-Donating Substituents on Aromatic Rings Connected via Coordinating Linkages Yield High**, thereby including more examples and enhancing coverage.

- **Advice 2**: **Enhance Clarity by Specifying Structural Features More Precisely**

  Rules that are currently vague or lack specificity (e.g., Rules 12 and 14) should be revised to clearly define the structural features affecting yield:

  - **Specify Functional Groups in Rule 12**:
    - Instead of stating "Modifiers with Multiple Functional Groups Capable of Strong Chelation Yield Low," specify which functional groups (e.g., di-amines, multi-dentate ligands) cause strong chelation and how they lead to catalyst deactivation.
    - Provide clear structural criteria and examples to improve predictive power and user understanding.

  - **Clarify Structural Similarities in Rule 14**:
    - Replace "Modifiers Resembling Phenylalanine Yield Low" with a more precise rule, such as *Modifiers That Are Aromatic Amino Acids Without Additional Coordinating Heteroatoms Yield Low*. This specifies that the lack of additional coordination sites contributes to the low yield.

- **Advice 3**: **Reassess and Validate Rules Against the Dataset**

  Ensure that each rule is consistently supported by the data:

  - **Cross-Check Examples**:
    - Verify that all high and low yield examples provided in each rule accurately reflect the data. Adjust or remove any rules where the examples do not align with the dataset outcomes.
  
  - **Identify Contradictions**:
    - If any modifiers in the dataset contradict the proposed rules, investigate and refine the rules to account for these exceptions or clarify the conditions under which the rule applies.

- **Advice 4**: **Integrate Physicochemical Rationales into Rule Descriptions**

  Enhance each rule by incorporating the underlying physicochemical principles that influence the reaction yield:

  - **Discuss Electronic Effects**:
    - Explain how electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups affect catalyst coordination and reactivity in the rule descriptions.
  
  - **Address Steric Factors**:
    - Include insights on how steric hindrance from bulky substituents can impede catalyst access and lower the yield.

  - **Consider Solubility and Hydrophobicity**:
    - For rules involving chain length and terminal groups, describe how these features impact solubility and the interaction with the catalyst environment.

- **Advice 5**: **Balance Complexity and Generality Across All Rules**

  Aim for rules that are neither too narrow nor overly broad, achieving a balance that maximizes predictive utility:

  - **Simplify Overly Complex Rules**:
    - Avoid combining too many structural factors into a single rule if it applies to very few modifiers. Instead, focus on the most impactful features.

  - **Avoid Overgeneralization**:
    - Ensure that rules are not so broad that they lose specificity and predictive accuracy. Maintain key structural details that are critical for determining yield outcomes.

- **Advice 6**: **Incorporate Additional Data or Seek Experimental Confirmation**

  If certain rules still lack sufficient coverage after adjustments:

  - **Collect More Data**:
    - Consider obtaining additional experimental data for modifiers that fit the structural criteria but are currently underrepresented in the dataset.

  - **Validate Through Experiments**:
    - Perform targeted experiments to confirm the predictions of the refined rules, thereby strengthening their validity.

  - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (longer chain, additional acetamido group)

---

### **Rule 2: Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing Groups Yield High**

**Description:** Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl) yield high. These substituents enhance electronic interactions and coordination with the catalyst.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - 4-aminobenzoic acid
  - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
  - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
- **Low Yield:**
  - 4-methylbenzoic acid (electron-donating methyl group reduces coordination ability)
  - 4-formylbenzoic acid (aldehyde group may interfere with catalyst interactions)

---

### **Rule 3: Modifiers with Carboxylic Acids Directly Attached to Nitrogen Heterocycles Yield High**

**Description:** Modifiers featuring a carboxylic acid group directly attached to a nitrogen-containing heterocycle (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole) yield high. The heterocyclic nitrogen enhances coordination with the metal catalyst, facilitating effective catalysis.

---

### **Rule 4: Long-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Without Polar Terminal Groups Yield High**

**Description:** Modifiers that are long-chain (7 to 8 carbons) aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar terminal groups yield high. The hydrophobic aliphatic chain facilitates favorable interactions with the catalyst environment.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - Octanoic acid
- **Low Yield:**
  - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid (terminal hydroxy group disrupts hydrophobic interaction)
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid (terminal amino group alters coordination dynamics)
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid

---

### **Rule 5: Polyhydroxylated Short-Chain Carboxylic Acids Yield High**

**Description:** Modifiers with short aliphatic chains bearing multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups yield high. The multiple hydroxyl groups enhance solubility and facilitate hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid
- **Low Yield:**
  - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid (additional groups may cause steric hindrance)

---

### **Rule 6: Hydroxyphenylalkanoic Acids with Medium-Length Chains Yield High**

**Description:** Modifiers containing a hydroxyphenyl group connected via a medium-length (4 to 5 carbons) aliphatic chain to a carboxylic acid yield high. This structure balances hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, enhancing catalyst binding.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
- **Low Yield:**
  - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (shorter chain length reduces hydrophobic interactions)

---

### **Rule 7: Modifiers with Aldehyde Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acids Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers possessing aldehyde groups (–CHO) adjacent to carboxylic acid groups yield low. The aldehyde group can engage in side reactions or interfere with catalyst coordination.

*Examples:*

  - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

---

### **Rule 8: Modifiers with Polyether Chains Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers featuring polyether chains (multiple ether linkages) result in low yield. The flexible polyether chain may cause steric hindrance and reduce effective coordination with the catalyst.

*Examples:*

- **Low Yield:**
  - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
  - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

---

### **Rule 9: Modifiers with Perfluorinated Chains Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers with perfluorinated aliphatic chains yield low due to poor solubility and weak interactions with the catalyst environment. The highly electronegative fluorine atoms reduce the compound's ability to coordinate effectively.

*Examples:*

- **Low Yield:**
  - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid

---

### **Rule 10: Modifiers with Fused Aromatic Heterocycles Yield High**

---

### **Rule 11: Modifiers with Terminal Thiol Groups on Aliphatic Chains Yield High**

**Description:** Modifiers with thiol (–SH) groups on short aliphatic chains yield high due to strong coordination through sulfur atoms. The thiol group effectively interacts with the metal catalyst.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
- **Low Yield:**
  - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid (aromatic ring may delocalize electron density, reducing thiol effectiveness)

---

### **Rule 12: Modifiers with Multiple Functional Groups Capable of Strong Chelation Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers possessing multiple functional groups (e.g., amino, acetamido, hydroxyl) that can chelate the metal catalyst too strongly may lead to catalyst deactivation, resulting in low yield.

*Examples:*

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid
- **Low Yield:**
  - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid (lacks ketone linkage and methoxy groups)

---

### **Rule 14: Modifiers Resembling Phenylalanine Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers structurally similar to phenylalanine yield low, possibly due to unfavorable steric interactions with the catalyst or lack of sufficient coordination sites.

*Examples:*

- **Low Yield:**
  - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid
- **High Yield:**
  - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (additional heteroatoms in indole ring enhance interactions)

---

### **Rule 15: Aromatic Thiol Carboxylic Acids Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers with thiol groups attached to aromatic rings yield low. The aromatic system may delocalize the thiol electron density, reducing its ability to coordinate effectively with the catalyst.

*Examples:*

- **Low Yield:**
  - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
- **High Yield:**
  - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid (aliphatic thiol group coordinates well)

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules illustrate how specific combinations of substructures and functional groups within the molecular modifiers influence the reaction yield. By considering underlying physicochemical properties such as coordination ability, electron distribution, steric effects, and solubility, the rules provide clear predictions for whether a modifier will result in a high or low yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

Each rule is crafted to balance coverage and specificity, aiming to encompass a broad range of the dataset while providing detailed insights into the structural factors impacting the reaction outcome. These rules combine multiple functional groups and prioritize modifiers that exhibit consistent patterns, offering valuable guidance for optimizing and controlling the reaction yield.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: *Revise the Matching Logic to Use Logical OR for Substructure Patterns Within Each Rule*

  In the current code, for a rule to match, **all** its SMARTS patterns must be found in the molecule (`logical AND`). However, for most rules, the patterns represent alternative substructures that individually satisfy the rule (`logical OR`). Modify the code so that if a molecule matches **any** of the compiled patterns for a rule, it is considered a match. Update the matching logic as follows:

  ```python
  match = False
  for pat in rule['compiled_patterns']:
      if mol.HasSubstructMatch(pat):
          match = True
          break
  ```

- **Suggestion 2**: *Adjust SMARTS Patterns in Rule 1 to Accurately Match Short-Chain α-Amino Dicarboxylic Acids*

  The SMARTS patterns for Rule 1 are too specific and fail to match molecules like aspartic acid and glutamic acid. Simplify and generalize the patterns to capture α-amino dicarboxylic acids with 4 to 5 carbons. A revised pattern could be:

  ```python
  '[NX3;H2][CX4;H]([CX3](=O)[OX1H])[CX4;H2][CX3](=O)[OX1H]'
  ```

  This pattern represents a primary amine connected to an α-carbon bearing a carboxylic acid and connected to a chain (2 carbons for aspartic acid). Adjust hydrogen counts and consider implicit hydrogens to ensure the pattern matches molecules regardless of hydrogen representation.

- **Suggestion 3**: *Refine SMARTS Pattern in Rule 2 to Specify Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing Groups*

  The current pattern in Rule 2 does not enforce substitution at the para position. Update the pattern to specifically target para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs). Use the following SMARTS pattern with position variation:

  ```python
  'c1cc([NX3H2,NX3H1,NX3H0,OX1,OX2,Cl,Br,F])ccc1C(=O)[OX2H1]'
  ```

  This pattern ensures that the EWG is at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid group.

- **Suggestion 4**: *Include All Relevant Rules from the Natural Language Descriptions in the Code*

  Only five out of the fifteen rules are currently implemented. To generate a comprehensive feature matrix, add the missing rules (Rules 3 to 15) to the code. Implement accurate SMARTS patterns for each based on their descriptions to fully capture the modifiers' properties.

- **Suggestion 5**: *Ensure Hydrogen Counts in SMARTS Patterns Align with Molecule Representations*

  The SMARTS patterns specify explicit hydrogen counts (e.g., `[NX3;H2]`), but molecules in SMILES may have implicit hydrogens. Normalize molecules by adding hydrogens before substructure matching:

  ```python
  mol = Chem.AddHs(mol)
  ```

  Alternatively, adjust patterns to be less dependent on explicit hydrogens, using `[NX3]` instead of `[NX3;H2]` if appropriate.

- **Suggestion 6**: *Test and Validate Each SMARTS Pattern Against Known Examples*

  For each rule, test the SMARTS patterns against molecules that are known to satisfy or not satisfy the rule. Use RDKit or a similar toolkit to verify that patterns correctly match high-yield modifiers and do not match low-yield ones. Adjust patterns based on test results to improve accuracy.

- **Suggestion 7**: *Refine SMARTS Patterns in Rule 15 to Differentiate Between Aromatic and Aliphatic Thiol Carboxylic Acids*

  The SMARTS patterns for Rule 15 may unintentionally match aliphatic thiols or incorrectly exclude aromatic thiols. Update the patterns to specifically target aromatic thiol carboxylic acids:

  ```python
  '[c][SX2H]',       # Thiol attached to aromatic ring
  '[c]C(=O)[OX2H1]'  # Carboxylic acid attached to aromatic ring
  ```

  Ensure that both substructures are present in the molecule by adjusting the matching logic if needed.

- **Suggestion 8**: *Handle Stereochemistry Appropriately in SMARTS Patterns*

  If stereochemistry is not critical for the rules, consider using SMARTS patterns that are stereochemistry-agnostic. If stereochemistry is important, include it explicitly in the patterns or ensure that the matching process acknowledges stereochemical differences.

- **Suggestion 9**: *Consider Electron-Withdrawing and Donating Effects in SMARTS Patterns*

  For rules involving electronic effects (e.g., Rule 2), use SMARTS that represent electron-withdrawing groups explicitly. For instance, define a pattern for EWGs:

  ```python
  '[NX3H2,NX3H1,NX3H0,OX1,OX2,=N,O,N+]'
  ```

  Incorporate this into the rule's SMARTS to accurately capture the intended electronic properties.

- **Suggestion 10**: *Improve Comments and Documentation in Code for Clarity*

  Add comments explaining the purpose and structure of each SMARTS pattern. Document any assumptions made in the pattern design. This will aid in future maintenance and updates to the code.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

---

**Summary of Findings:**

- **Support** has decreased significantly in the current iteration compared to the reference metrics.
- **Confidence** remains relatively stable and comparable to previous iterations.
- **Lift** shows a slight improvement but is still within a similar range as before.
- **Leverage** has diminished, indicating reduced practical significance of the rules.

---

### **Detailed Analysis:**

#### **1. Support**

- **Reference Train Support:** ~0.17 - 0.18
- **Current Train Support:** Decreasing from 0.0705 to 0.0057 over iterations

**Commentary:**

The **train support** has dropped markedly in the current rules compared to the reference metrics. The initial support was already lower than the reference (0.0705 vs. ~0.17), and it has continued to decline with each iteration:

- **Iteration 1:** 0.0705
- **Iteration 2:** 0.0171
- **Iteration 3:** 0.0041
- **Iteration 4:** 0.0057

This trend indicates that the rules are becoming increasingly **specific**, covering a smaller proportion of the dataset. While specificity can be beneficial for certain applications, excessively low support suggests that the rules might not be practically useful, as they apply to very few cases.

#### **2. Confidence**

- **Reference Train Confidence:** ~0.54 - 0.64
- **Current Train Confidence:** Approximately stable around 0.57 - 0.60

**Commentary:**

The **train confidence** of the current rules remains relatively stable and is within the range of the reference metrics:

- **Iteration 1:** 0.5919
- **Iteration 2:** 0.6000
- **Iteration 3:** 0.5714
- **Iteration 4:** 0.6000

This consistency indicates that when the conditions of the rules are met, the prediction of a **high yield** is correct about 57-60% of the time. This level of confidence is acceptable and comparable to previous models.

#### **3. Lift**

- **Reference Train Lift:** ~1.06 - 1.20
- **Current Train Lift:** Slightly higher, ranging from 1.14 to 1.21

**Commentary:**

The **lift** measures how much better the rule is at predicting the outcome compared to random chance. The current rules show a lift slightly above the reference metrics:

- **Iteration 1:** 1.1850
- **Iteration 2:** 1.1889
- **Iteration 3:** 1.1431
- **Iteration 4:** 1.2118

An increase in lift suggests that the rules are slightly more effective at identifying high-yield cases than previous iterations. However, the magnitude of improvement is marginal and may not offset the concerns raised by the low support.

#### **4. Leverage**

- **Reference Train Leverage:** ~0.029 to -0.004
- **Current Train Leverage:** Decreasing from 0.0095 to 0.0029

**Commentary:**

Leverage indicates the difference between the observed frequency of the rule and what would be expected if the antecedent and consequent were independent. The decline in leverage suggests that the current rules contribute less additional information than previous rules:

- **Iteration 1:** 0.0095
- **Iteration 2:** 0.0083
- **Iteration 3:** 0.0020
- **Iteration 4:** 0.0029

Low leverage values close to zero imply that the rules are only slightly better than random chance, aligning with the modest lift values observed.

---

### **Assessment of Local Minimum and Iterations**

The observed metrics indicate that:

- **Support** is decreasing, suggesting that the rules are overfitting by becoming too specific.
- **Confidence** and **lift** have plateaued, showing minimal improvement across iterations.
- **Leverage** is diminishing, highlighting a reduction in the rules' practical significance.

These patterns suggest that the current process may have reached a **local minimum**. Further iterations using the same approach are unlikely to yield significant improvements. The diminishing returns in support and leverage, coupled with stable confidence and lift, indicate that the current methodology has exhausted its potential under the existing parameters.

---

### **Recommendations for Improving the Current Rules**

1. **Broaden the Rule Conditions:**
   - **Issue:** The decreasing support indicates that the rules are too narrow.
   - **Action:** Generalize some of the rule conditions to cover a wider range of modifiers. This can be done by identifying common functional groups or structural motifs that are present in high-yield cases but not overly restrictive.

2. **Balance Specificity and Generality:**
   - **Issue:** Overly specific rules capture fewer cases, while overly general rules may lack predictive power.
   - **Action:** Find a middle ground by combining key structural features that are significant but not exclusive to a tiny subset of the data.

3. **Incorporate Additional Data Patterns:**
   - **Issue:** Current rules may not fully capture all relevant patterns.
   - **Action:** Re-examine the dataset for overlooked patterns or interactions between features that could enhance rule effectiveness.

4. **Apply Statistical Feature Selection:**
   - **Issue:** Manually crafted rules may miss statistically significant features.
   - **Action:** Use statistical methods (e.g., chi-square tests, information gain) to identify features that strongly correlate with high yield and incorporate them into the rules.

5. **Utilize Machine Learning Models:**
   - **Issue:** Rule-based approaches might not capture complex relationships.
   - **Action:** Complement the rule-based approach with machine learning models (e.g., decision trees, random forests) to uncover non-linear patterns and interactions.

6. **Review and Revise Low-Yield Rules:**
   - **Issue:** Some rules predict low yield but may be based on weak evidence.
   - **Action:** Reassess the rules leading to low yield predictions to ensure they are not overly penalizing certain modifiers without sufficient justification.

7. **Conduct Cross-Validation:**
   - **Issue:** Current metrics are based only on training data.
   - **Action:** Evaluate the rules using cross-validation to assess their generalizability and adjust them based on validation results.

8. **Consider External Chemical Knowledge:**
   - **Issue:** Some chemical principles may not be fully integrated.
   - **Action:** Incorporate expert chemical knowledge about reaction mechanisms, steric effects, and electronic factors to refine the rules.

9. **Increase Sample Size (if possible):**
   - **Issue:** Low support may be due to insufficient data.
   - **Action:** If more data can be collected, especially for underrepresented modifiers, it could improve the reliability of the rules.

10. **Monitor Overfitting:**
    - **Issue:** The trend suggests possible overfitting to the training data.
    - **Action:** Implement regularization techniques and monitor performance on unseen data to prevent overfitting.

---

**Conclusion**

The current rules exhibit acceptable confidence and lift but suffer from low support and diminishing leverage, indicating over-specialization and limited practical applicability. To enhance the performance of the rules:

- Broaden the scope to increase support without significantly sacrificing confidence.
- Rebalance the specificity to avoid overfitting and improve generalizability.
- Incorporate additional data-driven insights and chemical expertise.

By implementing these recommendations, the rules can be refined to achieve a more optimal balance between coverage and predictive accuracy, ultimately leading to more effective guidance in the catalytic problem under investigation.

**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

**1. Comments on Accuracies of the Validation Set and Train Set:**

- **Previous Iterations:**
  - **Validation Accuracies:** Consistently high, ranging from 0.68 to 0.76.
  - **Test Accuracies:** Varied between 0.75 and 0.625.

- **Current Iteration:**
  - **Validation Accuracy:** 0.514 (average across 5-fold cross-validation).
  - **Observation:** There is a noticeable decrease in validation accuracy compared to previous iterations.

**Interpretation:**

- The drop in validation accuracy suggests that the current set of rules may not be capturing the underlying patterns in the data as effectively as before.
- The consistent decrease across folds indicates that the model's predictive power has diminished, possibly due to overfitting or underfitting.

**2. Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting:**

- **Overfitting:** The previous high validation accuracies paired with lower test accuracies imply that the model may have been overfitting to the training data, capturing noise rather than the true signal.
- **Underfitting:** The current lower validation accuracy suggests that the model may now be underfitting, failing to capture essential patterns needed for accurate predictions.
- **Conclusion:** There is a need to balance the model to improve generalization without overfitting.

**3. Analysis Based on SHAP Values:**

The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis provides insight into how each rule contributes to the model's predictions for individual molecules.

**Key Observations:**

- **Rule with Positive SHAP Values Leading to Overestimation:**
  - **Rule 5** consistently shows positive SHAP values for molecules where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low.
  - **Example Molecules:**
    - *C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N*: Predicted high, experimental low. Rule 5 SHAP value: **0.0185**.
    - *C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)NCC(=O)O)O*: Predicted high, experimental low. Rule 5 SHAP value: **0.0185**.

- **Rule with Negative SHAP Values Leading to Underestimation:**
  - In the current iteration, negative SHAP values are not significantly impacting the underestimated predictions, indicating that the key issue lies with overestimations.

**Interpretation:**

- **Rule 5 ("Polyhydroxylated Short-Chain Carboxylic Acids Yield High")** appears to be contributing to false positive predictions, indicating that the rule may be too general or not accounting for certain structural nuances.

**4. Identifying Problematic Rules:**

- **Overestimated Loadings (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**
  - Rule 5 is the primary contributor to overestimated loadings due to its positive SHAP values in these cases.

- **Underestimated Loadings (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**
  - Not prominently observed in the current SHAP analysis, suggesting fewer issues with underestimated loadings or that the relevant rules are not significantly affecting predictions.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

**1. Refine Rule 5 to Improve Specificity:**

- **Issue with Rule 5:** The rule may be too broad, capturing molecules that do not actually result in high loading experimentally.
- **Action Steps:**
  - **Analyze Misclassified Molecules:** Examine the structural features of molecules incorrectly predicted as high loading due to Rule 5.
  - **Adjust Rule Criteria:**
    - Introduce additional constraints to Rule 5 to exclude molecules that do not meet certain structural requirements.
    - Consider the position and context of hydroxyl groups and whether they are in a configuration that truly enhances catalyst interaction.
  - **Example Adjustments:**
    - Specify that the hydroxyl groups should not be hindered by steric factors.
    - Exclude molecules where additional functional groups interfere with catalyst coordination.

**2. Introduce New Rules or Modify Existing Ones:**

- **Gap in Current Rules:** Some molecules may not be accurately predicted because their key structural features are not adequately captured.
- **Action Steps:**
  - **Investigate Underrepresented Patterns:** Identify common features in mispredicted molecules not addressed by current rules.
  - **Develop New Rules:**
    - Create rules that account for steric hindrance, electronic effects, or specific functional group interactions not currently covered.
  - **Modify Existing Rules:**
    - Refine rules with overlapping criteria to reduce redundancy and improve clarity.

**3. Improve Model Generalization:**

- **Address Overfitting:**
  - Simplify overly complex rules that may be fitting to noise rather than signal.
  - Ensure that rules are based on chemically justifiable principles and not solely on observed data patterns.
- **Address Underfitting:**
  - Ensure that the rules are comprehensive enough to capture the essential features influencing catalyst loading.
  - Avoid oversimplification that omits critical molecular interactions.

**4. Utilize SHAP Analysis for Iterative Refinement:**

- **Leverage SHAP Insights:**
  - Continuously monitor SHAP values for each rule to identify their impact on predictions.
  - Focus on rules with consistently high positive or negative SHAP values in mispredicted cases.
- **Iterative Process:**
  - After adjusting rules, retrain the model and reassess performance.
  - Repeat SHAP analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of rule modifications.

**5. Consider Additional Molecular Descriptors:**

- **Incorporate Descriptors Beyond Current Rules:**
  - Molecular weight, polar surface area, electronic properties, and 3D conformations may provide additional predictive power.
- **Action Steps:**
  - Augment the feature matrix with relevant descriptors.
  - Analyze their impact on model performance and adjust as necessary.

**6. Validate and Test Adjustments Thoroughly:**

- **Cross-Validation:**
  - Continue using cross-validation to assess model performance and avoid overfitting.
- **External Validation:**
  - Test the refined rules on an independent test set to evaluate generalization.
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Monitor not only accuracy but also precision, recall, and F1-score to gain a comprehensive understanding of model performance.

**Conclusion**

By focusing on refining Rule 5 and any other identified problematic rules, we can enhance the model's predictive accuracy. It is crucial to strike a balance between specificity and generality in the rules to improve generalization and avoid overfitting or underfitting. Utilizing SHAP analysis as a diagnostic tool enables targeted adjustments, leading to more effective and reliable predictive rules for catalyst loading.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimization**

The analysis of the current rules for predicting the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction has revealed several key findings:

1. **Decreased Support**: The support for the current rules has significantly decreased over iterations, indicating that the rules are becoming too specific and covering a smaller portion of the dataset. This decrease reduces the practical applicability of the rules.

2. **Stable Confidence and Lift**: While confidence and lift remain relatively stable and acceptable, they have not improved significantly across iterations. This suggests that the predictive power of the rules is not enhancing despite increased specificity.

3. **Diminished Leverage**: The leverage values have decreased, implying that the rules contribute less additional information than expected. Low leverage indicates that the rules are only slightly better than random chance.

4. **Validation Accuracy Drop**: The validation accuracy has decreased from previous iterations (from ~0.76 to ~0.51), suggesting that the model may be underfitting and failing to capture essential patterns in the data.

5. **SHAP Analysis Insights**:
   - **Rule 5 Overestimation**: Rule 5 is contributing to overestimations in predicted high yields, leading to false positives.
   - **Underrepresented Patterns**: Some mispredicted molecules may not be adequately captured by current rules.

**Suggestions to Improve Current Rules**

To optimize the current rules without overfitting, the following suggestions are proposed:

1. **Revise Matching Logic**:
   - **Use Logical OR for Substructure Patterns**: Modify the code so that a molecule is considered a match if it satisfies **any** of the SMARTS patterns within a rule, rather than requiring all patterns to be matched simultaneously.
     ```python
     match = False
     for pat in rule['compiled_patterns']:
         if mol.HasSubstructMatch(pat):
             match = True
             break
     ```

2. **Adjust SMARTS Patterns for Accuracy**:
   - **Rule 1**: Simplify and generalize patterns to accurately match short-chain α-amino dicarboxylic acids (e.g., aspartic acid and glutamic acid).
     ```python
     '[NX3][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX1H])[CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H]'
     ```
   - **Rule 2**: Modify patterns to specifically target para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs).
     ```python
     'c1cc([F,Cl,Br,I,N+](=O)[O-],C(=O)O,CO)[ccc]1C(=O)[OH]'
     ```
   - Ensure patterns accurately represent the structural features described in the rules.

3. **Include All Relevant Rules**:
   - **Implement Rules 3 to 15**: Currently, only a subset of the rules is implemented. Incorporate the remaining rules to capture a comprehensive range of molecular features influencing yield.

4. **Balance Specificity and Generality**:
   - **Broaden Rule Conditions**: Adjust overly specific rules to cover more cases without losing predictive power.
   - **Combine Key Structural Features**: Focus on significant features common to high-yield cases to increase support while maintaining confidence.

5. **Refine Problematic Rules**:
   - **Rule 5**: Address the overestimation issue by introducing additional constraints. For example, specify the position and context of hydroxyl groups and exclude molecules where steric hindrance or additional functional groups interfere with catalyst coordination.
   - **Test and Validate Adjustments**: Use known examples to ensure that the refined rule accurately predicts high yield where appropriate.

6. **Ensure Hydrogen Counts and Stereochemistry are Appropriately Considered**:
   - **Hydrogen Counts**: Adjust SMARTS patterns to be less dependent on explicit hydrogens or normalize molecules by adding hydrogens before matching.
   - **Stereochemistry**: Use stereochemistry-agnostic patterns if stereochemistry is not critical, or include it explicitly if it is important.

7. **Test and Validate SMARTS Patterns**:
   - **Verify Pattern Matching**: Test each pattern against molecules known to satisfy or not satisfy the rule, adjusting as necessary to improve accuracy.
   - **Use RDKit or Similar Toolkit**: Employ cheminformatics tools to validate and refine SMARTS patterns.

8. **Incorporate Additional Data Patterns and Statistical Methods**:
   - **Feature Selection**: Use statistical methods to identify features strongly correlated with high yield.
   - **Complement Rule-Based Approach**: Integrate machine learning models to uncover complex patterns and interactions not captured by rules alone.

9. **Improve Comments and Documentation**:
   - **Code Clarity**: Add detailed comments explaining the purpose and structure of each SMARTS pattern for easier maintenance and future updates.

10. **Monitor Overfitting and Underfitting**:
    - **Regularization Techniques**: Implement methods to prevent overfitting, such as cross-validation and simplification of overly complex rules.
    - **Performance Metrics**: Use a combination of metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) to evaluate model performance comprehensively.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

Yes, there is substantial room for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. By implementing the above suggestions:

- **Increasing Support**: Broadening rule conditions and refining patterns will increase the support, ensuring that the rules apply to a larger portion of the dataset.

- **Enhancing Generalization**: Balancing specificity and generality will improve the model's ability to generalize to unseen data, reducing underfitting.

- **Improving Predictive Accuracy**: Addressing issues identified in the SHAP analysis, such as refining Rule 5, will enhance the model's accuracy and reduce false predictions.

- **Comprehensive Rule Set**: Including all relevant rules and accurately capturing molecular features will improve the model's ability to predict outcomes based on a holistic understanding of the data.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Revise the matching logic to use a logical OR for substructure patterns within each rule.** Modify the code so that a molecule is considered a match if it satisfies **any** of the SMARTS patterns in a rule rather than requiring all patterns to match. This change will increase the support for each rule by allowing molecules that meet at least one criterion to be included. For example:

  ```python
  match = False
  for pat in rule['compiled_patterns']:
      if mol.HasSubstructMatch(pat):
          match = True
          break
  ```

- **Advice 2**: **Adjust and validate SMARTS patterns to accurately represent the intended chemical features for each rule.**

  - **Rule 1**: Simplify and generalize the SMARTS pattern to accurately match short-chain α-amino dicarboxylic acids. Use a pattern that captures an α-amino group adjacent to two carboxylic acid groups. For example:

    ```python
    # SMARTS pattern for short-chain α-amino dicarboxylic acids
    '[NX3][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX1H])[CX4H2][CX3](=O)[OX1H]'
    ```
    This pattern matches molecules like aspartic acid and glutamic acid.

  - **Rule 2**: Modify the SMARTS patterns to specifically target para-substituted benzoic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs). For example:

    ```python
    # Core structure of para-substituted benzoic acid
    'c1ccc(cc1)C(=O)O'

    # Substituents patterns for EWGs at the para position
    'c1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc1'  # Nitro group
    'c1ccc(Br)cc1'            # Bromine
    'c1ccc([NH2])cc1'         # Amino group
    ```

    Implement a logical OR so that if any of the EWG patterns are present at the para position, the molecule matches the rule.

- **Advice 3**: **Implement all remaining rules (Rules 3 to 15) with accurate SMARTS patterns.** Go through each rule and develop SMARTS patterns that capture the key structural features described. Ensure that each pattern is tested and validated against known high-yield and low-yield examples.

- **Advice 4**: **Refine problematic rules by introducing additional constraints to reduce false positives.**

  - **Rule 5**: Address the overestimation issue by specifying the position and number of hydroxyl groups in polyhydroxylated short-chain carboxylic acids. Exclude molecules with bulky groups or those that may cause steric hindrance. For example:

    ```python
    # SMARTS pattern for polyhydroxylated carboxylic acids without steric hindrance
    '[CX3](=O)[OX1H][CX4][OX2H][CX4][OX2H][CX4][OX2H]'
    ```

- **Advice 5**: **Ensure hydrogen counts and stereochemistry are appropriately considered in SMARTS patterns.**

  - **Hydrogen Counts**: Normalize molecules by adding hydrogens before matching:

    ```python
    mol = Chem.AddHs(mol)
    ```

  - **Stereochemistry**: If stereochemistry is not critical for the rule, use patterns that are agnostic to stereochemistry. If stereochemistry is important, include it in the SMARTS patterns.

- **Advice 6**: **Test and validate each SMARTS pattern using cheminformatics tools like RDKit.**

  - **Pattern Matching**: Test patterns on known molecules to ensure they match correctly. For example:

    ```python
    from rdkit import Chem
    mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles('OC(=O)C[C@H](N)C(=O)O')  # Example molecule
    patt = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[NX3][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX1H])[CX4H2][CX3](=O)[OX1H]')
    match = mol.HasSubstructMatch(patt)
    ```

  - **Adjust Patterns**: If the pattern does not match expected molecules, refine it accordingly.

- **Advice 7**: **Balance specificity and generality to improve rule support while maintaining confidence.**

  - **Broaden Rule Conditions**: For rules with very specific patterns, consider generalizing them slightly to include more molecules without capturing false positives.

  - **Combine Structural Features**: Identify common features among high-yield modifiers and create patterns that encompass these features.

- **Advice 8**: **Improve code comments and documentation for better maintainability.**

  - **Detailed Comments**: Add comments explaining the purpose of each SMARTS pattern and any nuances in its construction.

  - **Example Molecules**: Include examples of molecules that should match or not match each pattern.

- **Advice 9**: **Monitor model performance to prevent overfitting or underfitting.**

  - **Performance Metrics**: Use multiple metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and support to evaluate the rules.

  - **Cross-Validation**: Perform cross-validation to assess how well the rules generalize to unseen data.

- **Advice 10**: **Consider integrating statistical methods or machine learning models to complement the rule-based approach.**

  - **Feature Selection**: Use statistical techniques to identify molecular descriptors that correlate strongly with high yield.

  - **Machine Learning Models**: Apply models like decision trees or random forests to capture complex patterns beyond the scope of rule-based methods.

  - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid (terminal hydroxy group disrupts hydrophobic interaction)
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid (terminal amino group alters coordination dynamics)
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid

---

### **Rule 5: Hydroxyphenylalkanoic Acids with Medium-Length Chains Yield High**

**Description:** Modifiers containing a hydroxyphenyl group connected via a medium-length (4 to 5 carbons) aliphatic chain to a carboxylic acid yield high. This structure balances hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, enhancing catalyst binding.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
- **Low Yield:**
  - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (shorter chain length reduces hydrophobic interactions)

---

### **Rule 6: Modifiers with Aldehyde Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acids Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers possessing aldehyde groups (–CHO) adjacent to carboxylic acid groups yield low. The aldehyde group can engage in side reactions or interfere with catalyst coordination.

*Examples:*

- **Low Yield:**
  - 4-formylbenzoic acid
  - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

---

### **Rule 7: Modifiers with Polyether Chains Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers featuring polyether chains (alkyl chains with multiple ether linkages) result in low yield. The flexible polyether chain may cause steric hindrance and reduce effective coordination with the catalyst.

*Examples:*

- **Low Yield:**
  - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
  - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

---

### **Rule 8: Modifiers with Perfluorinated Chains Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers with perfluorinated aliphatic chains yield low due to poor solubility and weak interactions within the catalyst environment. The highly electronegative fluorine atoms reduce the compound's ability to coordinate effectively.

*Examples:*

- **Low Yield:**
  - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid

---

### **Rule 9: Modifiers with Fused Aromatic Heterocycles Yield High**

**Description:** Modifiers containing fused aromatic rings with heteroatoms (e.g., indole, benzofuran) yield high. These structures facilitate strong π-π interactions and coordinate effectively with the catalyst.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid
  - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid
- **Low Yield:**
  - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (lacks fused heterocycle)

---

### **Rule 10: Modifiers with Terminal Thiol Groups on Short Aliphatic Chains Yield High**

**Description:** Modifiers with thiol (–SH) groups on short aliphatic chains yield high due to strong coordination through sulfur atoms. The thiol group effectively interacts with the metal catalyst.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
- **Low Yield:**
  - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid (aromatic ring may delocalize electron density, reducing thiol effectiveness)

---

### **Rule 11: Modifiers with Multiple Strong Chelating Groups Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers possessing multiple functional groups (e.g., amino, acetamido, hydroxyl) that can chelate the metal catalyst too strongly may lead to catalyst deactivation, resulting in low yield.

*Examples:*

- **Low Yield:**
  - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
  - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

---

### **Rule 12: Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids with Electron-Donating Groups Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl) yield low. Electron-donating substituents reduce the ability of the molecule to coordinate effectively with the catalyst.

*Examples:*

- **Low Yield:**
  - 4-methylbenzoic acid

---

### **Rule 13: Polyhydroxylated Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Yield High**

**Description:** Modifiers with aliphatic chains bearing multiple hydroxyl (–OH) groups yield high. The multiple hydroxyl groups enhance solubility and facilitate hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid

---

### **Rule 14: Modifiers Resembling Phenylalanine Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers structurally similar to phenylalanine yield low, possibly due to unfavorable steric interactions with the catalyst or lack of sufficient coordination sites.

*Examples:*

- **Low Yield:**
  - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid
- **High Yield:**
  - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (additional heteroatoms in indole ring enhance interactions)

---

### **Rule 15: Modifiers with Flexible Polyether Amino Acids Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers that are amino acids with flexible polyether chains yield low. The flexibility and steric bulk of polyether chains interfere with effective coordination to the catalyst.

*Examples:*

- **Low Yield:**
  - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

These rules illustrate how specific combinations of substructures and functional groups within the molecular modifiers influence the reaction yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization. By considering underlying physicochemical properties such as coordination ability, electron distribution, steric effects, and solubility, the rules provide clear predictions for whether a modifier will result in a high or low yield.

Each rule combines multiple substructures to maximize coverage while maintaining clarity and specificity. The rules balance simple rules with higher coverage and more complex rules with lower coverage, providing valuable guidance for optimizing and controlling the reaction yield.

**Summary of Key Insights:**

- **Coordination Enhancement:** Functional groups such as amino, carboxylate, and thiol enhance coordination with the metal catalyst, leading to higher yields.
- **Electronic Effects:** Electron-withdrawing groups on aromatic rings improve catalyst interactions, while electron-donating groups diminish them.
- **Steric Considerations:** Bulky or flexible substituents can hinder effective catalyst coordination, resulting in lower yields.
- **Hydrophobic/Hydrophilic Balance:** Appropriate chain lengths and functional group positioning balance hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, optimizing catalyst binding.
- **Structural Features:** Fused heterocycles and polyhydroxylated aliphatic chains offer unique coordination properties that enhance reaction outcomes.

By applying these rules, researchers can predict the effectiveness of potential modifiers and design new compounds to optimize the reaction yield.

### **Rule 1: Short-Chain α-Amino Dicarboxylic Acids Yield High**

**Description:** Modifiers that are short-chain (4 to 5 carbons) α-amino dicarboxylic acids yield high. The presence of an amino group at the α-position and two carboxylic acid groups enhances coordination with the metal catalyst, improving catalyst stability and activity.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid
  - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid
- **Low Yield:**
  - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (longer chain, additional acetamido group)
  - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (contains aromatic ring, lacks a second carboxylate group)

---

### **Rule 2: Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing Groups Yield High**

**Description:** Modifiers that are benzoic acids substituted at the para position with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl) yield high. These substituents enhance electronic interactions and coordination with the catalyst.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - 4-aminobenzoic acid
  - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
  - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
- **Low Yield:**
  - 4-methylbenzoic acid (electron-donating methyl group reduces coordination ability)
  - 4-formylbenzoic acid (aldehyde group may interfere with catalyst interactions)

### **Rule 3: Modifiers with Carboxylic Acid Directly Attached to Nitrogen Heterocycles Yield High**

**Description:** Modifiers featuring a carboxylic acid group directly attached to a nitrogen-containing heterocycle (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole) yield high. The heterocyclic nitrogen enhances coordination with the metal catalyst, facilitating effective catalysis.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid
  - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
  - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
- **Low Yield:**
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (carboxylic acid attached to benzene ring, not directly to heterocycle)

---

### **Rule 4: Long-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Without Polar Terminal Groups Yield High**

**Description:** Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 7 to 8 carbons and no additional polar terminal groups yield high. The hydrophobic aliphatic chain facilitates favorable interactions within the catalyst environment.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - Octanoic acid
- **Low Yield:**
  - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid (terminal hydroxy group disrupts hydrophobic interaction)
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid (terminal amino group alters coordination dynamics)
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid

---

### **Rule 5: Hydroxyphenylalkanoic Acids with Medium-Length Chains Yield High**

**Description:** Modifiers containing a hydroxyphenyl group connected via a medium-length (4 to 5 carbons) aliphatic chain to a carboxylic acid yield high. This structure balances hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, enhancing catalyst binding.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
- **Low Yield:**
  - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (shorter chain length reduces hydrophobic interactions)

---

### **Rule 6: Modifiers with Aldehyde Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acids Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers possessing aldehyde groups (–CHO) adjacent to carboxylic acid groups yield low. The aldehyde group can engage in side reactions or interfere with catalyst coordination.

*Examples:*

- **Low Yield:**
  - 4-formylbenzoic acid
  - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

---

### **Rule 7: Modifiers with Polyether Chains Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers featuring polyether chains (alkyl chains with multiple ether linkages) result in low yield. The flexible polyether chain may cause steric hindrance and reduce effective coordination with the catalyst.

*Examples:*

- **Low Yield:**
  - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
  - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

---

### **Rule 8: Modifiers with Perfluorinated Chains Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers with perfluorinated aliphatic chains yield low due to poor solubility and weak interactions within the catalyst environment. The highly electronegative fluorine atoms reduce the compound's ability to coordinate effectively.

*Examples:*

- **Low Yield:**
  - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid

---

### **Rule 9: Modifiers with Fused Aromatic Heterocycles Yield High**

**Description:** Modifiers containing fused aromatic rings with heteroatoms (e.g., indole, benzofuran) yield high. These structures facilitate strong π-π interactions and coordinate effectively with the catalyst.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid
  - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid
- **Low Yield:**
  - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (lacks fused heterocycle)

---

### **Rule 10: Modifiers with Terminal Thiol Groups on Short Aliphatic Chains Yield High**

**Description:** Modifiers with thiol (–SH) groups on short aliphatic chains yield high due to strong coordination through sulfur atoms. The thiol group effectively interacts with the metal catalyst.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
- **Low Yield:**
  - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid (aromatic ring may delocalize electron density, reducing thiol effectiveness)

---

### **Rule 11: Modifiers with Multiple Strong Chelating Groups Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers possessing multiple functional groups (e.g., amino, acetamido, hydroxyl) that can chelate the metal catalyst too strongly may lead to catalyst deactivation, resulting in low yield.

*Examples:*

- **Low Yield:**
  - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
  - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

---

### **Rule 12: Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids with Electron-Donating Groups Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl) yield low. Electron-donating substituents reduce the ability of the molecule to coordinate effectively with the catalyst.

*Examples:*

- **Low Yield:**
  - 4-methylbenzoic acid

---

### **Rule 13: Polyhydroxylated Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Yield High**

**Description:** Modifiers with aliphatic chains bearing multiple hydroxyl (–OH) groups yield high. The multiple hydroxyl groups enhance solubility and facilitate hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid

---

### **Rule 14: Modifiers Resembling Phenylalanine Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers structurally similar to phenylalanine yield low, possibly due to unfavorable steric interactions with the catalyst or lack of sufficient coordination sites.

*Examples:*

- **Low Yield:**
  - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid
- **High Yield:**
  - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (additional heteroatoms in indole ring enhance interactions)

---

### **Rule 15: Modifiers with Flexible Polyether Amino Acids Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers that are amino acids with flexible polyether chains yield low. The flexibility and steric bulk of polyether chains interfere with effective coordination to the catalyst.

*Examples:*

- **Low Yield:**
  - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules illustrate how specific combinations of substructures and functional groups within the molecular modifiers influence the reaction yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization. By considering underlying physicochemical properties such as coordination ability, electron distribution, steric effects, and solubility, the rules provide clear predictions for whether a modifier will result in a high or low yield.

Each rule combines multiple substructures to maximize coverage while maintaining clarity and specificity. The rules balance simple rules with higher coverage and more complex rules with lower coverage, providing valuable guidance for optimizing and controlling the reaction yield.

**Summary of Key Insights:**

- **Coordination Enhancement:** Functional groups such as amino, carboxylate, and thiol enhance coordination with the metal catalyst, leading to higher yields.
- **Electronic Effects:** Electron-withdrawing groups on aromatic rings improve catalyst interactions, while electron-donating groups diminish them.
- **Steric Considerations:** Bulky or flexible substituents can hinder effective catalyst coordination, resulting in lower yields.
- **Hydrophobic/Hydrophilic Balance:** Appropriate chain lengths and functional group positioning balance hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, optimizing catalyst binding.
- **Structural Features:** Fused heterocycles and polyhydroxylated aliphatic chains offer unique coordination properties that enhance reaction outcomes.

By applying these rules, researchers can predict the effectiveness of potential modifiers and design new compounds to optimize the reaction yield.---------------------------------------------------------------

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: Review and adjust the SMARTS patterns for Rule 2. The current pattern for `para_substituted_benzoic_acid = '[cH]1ccc([*])cc1C(=O)[O;H,-]'` may not accurately capture para-substituted benzoic acids. The wildcard `[*]` matches any substituent, but doesn't specify the position relative to the carboxylic acid. Use SMARTS patterns that explicitly define the para position, such as `'c1ccc(cc1C(=O)[O;H,-])[*]'` where `[*]` is at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Modify Rule 2 to include positional specificity in the sub-patterns. Ensure that electron-withdrawing groups (EWG) are correctly identified at the para position. For example, use `'c1cc([NX3;H2,H1])ccc1C(=O)[O;H,-]'` for para-amino benzoic acid, and similarly adjust patterns for nitro and bromomethyl groups.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For Rule 3, expand and correct the SMARTS patterns to accurately represent carboxylic acids directly attached to nitrogen heterocycles. The current patterns may miss certain heterocycles. Use more general patterns like `'[nH0]1cccc1C(=O)[O;H,-]'` and include additional patterns to cover different heterocycles such as pyridine, pyrazole, and pyrimidine.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Ensure that the code correctly handles sub-patterns in Rule 2. Currently, the code may not be applying the sub-patterns only when the main pattern matches. Adjust the logic so that after confirming a match with the main pattern (para-substituted benzoic acid), the code then checks for the presence of one of the specified EWG sub-patterns at the correct position.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: Improve position-specific matching for aromatic substitutions. Use the `ipso` position and ring numbering in SMARTS to specify positions on the benzene ring. For example, use `'c1ccc(cc1C(=O)[O;H,-])[*]'` where the substituent `[*]` is at the para position (position 4) relative to the carboxylic acid group (position 1).

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Adjust the code to properly match molecules like nicotinic acid (SMILES 23) in Rule 3. Update the SMARTS patterns to include pyridine derivatives where the carboxylic acid is directly attached to the ring at different positions, such as `'[n][c]c[c]c[c]C(=O)[O;H,-]'` to capture various isomers.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: In Rule 1, ensure that the code correctly counts the number of carbons in the main chain (excluding side chains) and accurately identifies α-amino dicarboxylic acids. Adjust the `num_carbons_range` condition to count only the backbone carbons, and ensure that both carboxylic acid groups and the α-amino group are attached appropriately.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Add validation tests for each rule using the provided example compounds. Before applying the rules to the full SMILES list, check that the rules correctly classify the examples given for high and low yields.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: Utilize RDKit's advanced features for more precise pattern matching. For position-specific matching, consider using the `@` symbol to define ring connectivity and atom indexing to specify exact positions in rings.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Re-express count conditions to ensure they're evaluated correctly. For instance, when checking if `num_strong_chelating_groups > 2`, write a function that accurately sums all relevant functional groups in the molecule and compares them appropriately.

  - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid
  - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid
- **Low Yield:**
  - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (longer chain, additional acetamido group)
  - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (contains aromatic ring, lacks a second carboxylate group)

---

### **Rule 2: Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing Groups Yield High**

**Description:** Modifiers that are benzoic acids substituted at the para position with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl) yield high. These substituents enhance electronic interactions and coordination with the catalyst.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - 4-aminobenzoic acid
  - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
  - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
- **Low Yield:**
  - 4-methylbenzoic acid (electron-donating methyl group reduces coordination ability)
  - 4-formylbenzoic acid (aldehyde group may interfere with catalyst interactions)

---

### **Rule 3: Modifiers with Carboxylic Acid Directly Attached to Nitrogen Heterocycles Yield High**

**Description:** Modifiers featuring a carboxylic acid group directly attached to a nitrogen-containing heterocycle (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole) yield high. The heterocyclic nitrogen enhances coordination with the metal catalyst, facilitating effective catalysis.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid
  - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
  - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
- **Low Yield:**
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (carboxylic acid attached to benzene ring, not directly to heterocycle)

---

### **Rule 4: Long-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Without Polar Terminal Groups Yield High**

**Description:** Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 7 to 8 carbons and no additional polar terminal groups yield high. The hydrophobic aliphatic chain facilitates favorable interactions within the catalyst environment.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - Octanoic acid
- **Low Yield:**
  - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid (terminal hydroxy group disrupts hydrophobic interaction)
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid (terminal amino group alters coordination dynamics)
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid

---

### **Rule 5: Hydroxyphenylalkanoic Acids with Medium-Length Chains Yield High**

**Description:** Modifiers containing a hydroxyphenyl group connected via a medium-length (4 to 5 carbons) aliphatic chain to a carboxylic acid yield high. This structure balances hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, enhancing catalyst binding.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
- **Low Yield:**
  - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (shorter chain length reduces hydrophobic interactions)

---

### **Rule 6: Modifiers with Aldehyde Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acids Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers possessing aldehyde groups (–CHO) adjacent to carboxylic acid groups yield low. The aldehyde group can engage in side reactions or interfere with catalyst coordination.

*Examples:*

- **Low Yield:**
  - 4-formylbenzoic acid
  - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

---

### **Rule 7: Modifiers with Polyether Chains Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers featuring polyether chains (alkyl chains with multiple ether linkages) result in low yield. The flexible polyether chain may cause steric hindrance and reduce effective coordination with the catalyst.

*Examples:*

- **Low Yield:**
  - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
  - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

---

### **Rule 8: Modifiers with Perfluorinated Chains Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers with perfluorinated aliphatic chains yield low due to poor solubility and weak interactions within the catalyst environment. The highly electronegative fluorine atoms reduce the compound's ability to coordinate effectively.

*Examples:*

- **Low Yield:**
  - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid

---

### **Rule 9: Modifiers with Fused Aromatic Heterocycles Yield High**

**Description:** Modifiers containing fused aromatic rings with heteroatoms (e.g., indole, benzofuran) yield high. These structures facilitate strong π-π interactions and coordinate effectively with the catalyst.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid
  - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid
- **Low Yield:**
  - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (lacks fused heterocycle)

---

### **Rule 10: Modifiers with Terminal Thiol Groups on Short Aliphatic Chains Yield High**

**Description:** Modifiers with thiol (–SH) groups on short aliphatic chains yield high due to strong coordination through sulfur atoms. The thiol group effectively interacts with the metal catalyst.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
- **Low Yield:**
  - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid (aromatic ring may delocalize electron density, reducing thiol effectiveness)

---

### **Rule 11: Modifiers with Multiple Strong Chelating Groups Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers possessing multiple functional groups (e.g., amino, acetamido, hydroxyl) that can chelate the metal catalyst too strongly may lead to catalyst deactivation, resulting in low yield.

*Examples:*

- **Low Yield:**
  - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
  - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

---

### **Rule 12: Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids with Electron-Donating Groups Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl) yield low. Electron-donating substituents reduce the ability of the molecule to coordinate effectively with the catalyst.

*Examples:*

- **Low Yield:**
  - 4-methylbenzoic acid

---

### **Rule 13: Polyhydroxylated Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Yield High**

**Description:** Modifiers with aliphatic chains bearing multiple hydroxyl (–OH) groups yield high. The multiple hydroxyl groups enhance solubility and facilitate hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid

---

### **Rule 14: Modifiers Resembling Phenylalanine Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers structurally similar to phenylalanine yield low, possibly due to unfavorable steric interactions with the catalyst or lack of sufficient coordination sites.

*Examples:*

- **Low Yield:**
  - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid
- **High Yield:**
  - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (additional heteroatoms in indole ring enhance interactions)

---

### **Rule 15: Modifiers with Flexible Polyether Amino Acids Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers that are amino acids with flexible polyether chains yield low. The flexibility and steric bulk of polyether chains interfere with effective coordination to the catalyst.

*Examples:*

- **Low Yield:**
  - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

---

**End of Rules**

These rules illustrate how specific combinations of substructures and functional groups within the molecular modifiers influence the reaction yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization. By considering underlying physicochemical properties such as coordination ability, electron distribution, steric effects, and solubility, the rules provide clear predictions for whether a modifier will result in a high or low yield.

Each rule combines multiple substructures to maximize coverage while maintaining clarity and specificity. The rules balance simple rules with higher coverage and more complex rules with lower coverage, providing valuable guidance for optimizing and controlling the reaction yield.

**Summary of Key Insights:**

- **Coordination Enhancement:** Functional groups such as amino, carboxylate, and thiol enhance coordination with the metal catalyst, leading to higher yields.
- **Electronic Effects:** Electron-withdrawing groups on aromatic rings improve catalyst interactions, while electron-donating groups diminish them.
- **Steric Considerations:** Bulky or flexible substituents can hinder effective catalyst coordination, resulting in lower yields.
- **Hydrophobic/Hydrophilic Balance:** Appropriate chain lengths and functional group positioning balance hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, optimizing catalyst binding.
- **Structural Features:** Fused heterocycles and polyhydroxylated aliphatic chains offer unique coordination properties that enhance reaction outcomes.

By applying these rules, researchers can predict the effectiveness of potential modifiers and design new compounds to optimize the reaction yield.---------------------------------------------------------------

Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: **Revise the code for Rule 2 and Rule 12 to accurately identify para-substituted benzoic acids with specific substituents.** The current code may not correctly identify substituents at the para position due to incorrect atom indexing and reliance on neighbor positions, which can vary depending on the molecule's atom ordering. Instead, use SMARTS patterns that directly capture para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups. For example, for Rule 2 (electron-withdrawing groups), you could use:
  ```python
  para_ewg_benzoic_acid = 'c1ccc(cc1)[C](=O)[O;H]>>c1ccc([NX3](=O)=O)cc1[C](=O)[O;H]'
  ```
  And for Rule 12 (electron-donating groups):
  ```python
  para_edg_benzoic_acid = 'c1ccc(cc1)[C](=O)[O;H]>>c1ccc([CH3,O,NH2])cc1[C](=O)[O;H]'
  ```
  Then, use `mol.GetSubstructMatches` with these SMARTS to directly find matches without complex neighbor indexing.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Ensure accurate carbon atom counting for chain length-dependent rules (e.g., Rule 1 and Rule 4).** The current method may include carbons from functional groups or rings that shouldn't be counted. Modify the code to count only the carbons in the main chain or specific segments relevant to the rule. For example, for aliphatic chains, use a method to identify the longest carbon chain excluding side chains and functional groups.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Review and correct the SMARTS patterns for each rule to match the described substructures accurately.** Some SMARTS patterns might be too general or miss key features. For instance, for Rule 1, the SMARTS for an α-amino acid may not ensure two carboxylic acid groups are present. Update the pattern to specifically look for α-amino dicarboxylic acids:
  ```python
  alpha_amino_dicarboxylic_acid = '[NX3;H2][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[O;H,-])[CX2H1][CX3](=O)[O;H,-]'
  ```
  This pattern ensures the amino group is at the α-position and two carboxylic acid groups are present.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Implement explicit checks for functional group counts and chain lengths within the code.** For conditions like "num_ethers > 1" or "chain lengths of 7 to 8 carbons," write code that calculates these values accurately. Use RDKit functions to traverse the molecule's graph and count specific atom types or substructures. For example:
  ```python
  # Count number of ether linkages
  num_ethers = len(mol.GetSubstructMatches(Chem.MolFromSmarts('[C!H0][OX2][C!H0]')))
  ```
  This pattern avoids matching ethers with adjacent heteroatoms.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Add error handling and validation for substructure searches to prevent incorrect matches.** Use RDKit's `Mol.HasSubstructMatch` and `GetSubstructMatches` functions with appropriate parameters like `exactMatchesOnly=True` or `useChirality=True` when necessary to improve the specificity of matches.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Simplify the code by removing unnecessary complexities and focusing on direct substructure patterns.** For example, instead of attempting to programmatically find the para position on a ring, define SMARTS that directly represent the entire substructure needed for the rule, including the substituent positions.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Test each SMARTS pattern individually with known examples to ensure they match the intended structures.** Before applying the patterns to the dataset, verify their accuracy using molecules from the examples provided in the rules. This step will help catch any mismatches or errors in the SMARTS definitions.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Consider using recursive SMARTS or combining multiple SMARTS patterns for complex rules.** For rules that involve multiple features (e.g., Rule 11: multiple strong chelating groups), you might need to create more sophisticated SMARTS that can capture these combinations accurately.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Update the code to handle tautomers and resonance structures if necessary.** Some modifiers might exist in different tautomeric forms, which could affect substructure matching. Use RDKit's tautomer enumeration tools to ensure all relevant forms are considered.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Enhance documentation and comments within the code for clarity.** Provide clear explanations for each SMARTS pattern and code block to facilitate future revisions and collaborations.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify and Generalize Substructure Definitions**

  Revise the current rules to focus on specific, easily identifiable substructures and functional groups that can be directly extracted from SMILES strings. Use general descriptors like the presence of amino groups, carboxylic acids, hydroxyl groups, chain length, and ring systems. By simplifying substructures, you make it easier to generate a numeric feature matrix.

  *For example:*
  
  - Instead of specifying "short-chain (4 to 5 carbons) α-amino dicarboxylic acids," generalize to "molecules with an amino group and two carboxylic acids within a 5-carbon chain."

- **Advice 2**: **Utilize SMARTS Patterns for Feature Extraction**

  Convert the rules into SMARTS (SMILES Arbitrary Target Specification) patterns, which allow for the identification of specific substructures within molecules programmatically. This approach enables the automatic detection of functional groups and substructures in SMILES strings, facilitating the creation of a numeric feature matrix.

  *For example:*
  
  - Define a SMARTS pattern for α-amino dicarboxylic acids: `N[C;R0][C;R0](=O)O`

- **Advice 3**: **Incorporate Physicochemical Descriptors**

  Include quantitative physicochemical properties that can be calculated directly from SMILES, such as:

  - **Molecular Weight**
  - **LogP (Octanol-Water Partition Coefficient)**
  - **Topological Polar Surface Area (TPSA)**
  - **Number of Hydrogen Bond Donors and Acceptors**
  - **Rotatable Bond Count**

  Incorporating these descriptors provides numeric data that can be used in modeling and correlates with the underlying reasons for high or low yields.

- **Advice 4**: **Consolidate and Streamline the Rules**

  Review the current rules for overlap and redundancy. Merge similar rules to reduce complexity and make them more amenable to numeric encoding.

  *For example:*

  - Combine Rules 2 and 12 into a single rule focusing on the effect of substituents on aromatic rings, using electron-withdrawing or electron-donating parameters.

- **Advice 5**: **Quantify Electronic Effects Using Descriptor Values**

  Use established electronic descriptors, such as Hammett sigma constants, to numerically represent the electronic nature of substituents on aromatic systems. Assign these values based on the substituents present, allowing for quantitative analysis.

  *For example:*

  - Assign sigma values to para-substituents on benzoic acids to quantify their electron-withdrawing or donating effects.

- **Advice 6**: **Automate Feature Extraction with Cheminformatics Tools**

  Employ cheminformatics libraries like **RDKit** to automate the extraction of features from SMILES strings. These tools can calculate a wide array of molecular descriptors and identify substructures based on SMARTS patterns, streamlining the creation of a numeric feature matrix.

- **Advice 7**: **Focus on Easily Quantifiable Structural Features**

  Avoid rules that rely on complex or vague structural motifs that are hard to quantify, such as "modifiers structurally similar to phenylalanine." Instead, specify features like "aromatic amino acids with a specific side chain length," which can be quantified by counting atoms or bonds.

- **Advice 8**: **Encode Steric and Hydrophobic Parameters Numerically**

  Include steric descriptors like molar refractivity or Verloop steric parameters, and hydrophobic descriptors like the AlogP. These parameters can help quantify the steric bulk and hydrophobicity of modifiers, aligning with the rules concerning chain length and substituent size.

- **Advice 9**: **Create Binary Indicators for Functional Groups**

  For each functional group mentioned in the rules (e.g., amino, carboxyl, hydroxyl, thiol), create a binary feature indicating its presence or absence in the molecule. This approach simplifies the feature matrix and directly corresponds to the rules.

- **Advice 10**: **Validate and Refine Rules Against the Dataset**

  Test the revised rules and descriptors against the provided dataset to evaluate their effectiveness in predicting the yield. Adjust the rules based on statistical analysis to improve their predictiveness and ensure they are suitable for numerical modeling.

- **Advice 11**: **Incorporate Multivariate Analysis**

  Recognize that yield is likely influenced by multiple interacting features. Use multivariate statistical methods or machine learning algorithms to model the relationships between features and yield, rather than relying on univariate rules.

- **Advice 12**: **Document Feature Generation Process**

  Clearly document how each feature is generated from the SMILES strings, including any computational methods or descriptor calculations used. This transparency ensures reproducibility and facilitates collaboration among team members.

- **Advice 13**: **Align Rules with Chemical Intuition and Mechanism**

  Ensure that the rules and features reflect the underlying chemical mechanisms influencing the reaction yield. For example, if catalyst coordination is crucial, focus on features that quantify coordination ability, such as the number of coordination sites or donor atom types.

- **Advice 14**: **Use Standardized Descriptor Sets**

  Utilize standardized sets of molecular descriptors, such as those from the Dragon software or MOE descriptors, which are widely used in QSAR/QSPR studies. This standardization aids in comparing results with existing literature and leveraging established methodologies.

- **Advice 15**: **Engage in Iterative Refinement**

  Treat the rule development as an iterative process. Use initial models to identify which features are most predictive, refine the rules accordingly, and repeat the process to improve model performance continually.

### **Rule 1: α-Amino Dicarboxylic Acids Yield High**

**Description:** Modifiers that are α-amino acids with two carboxylic acid groups (i.e., α-amino dicarboxylic acids) yield high. The presence of an amino group at the α-position and two carboxylate groups enhances coordination with the metal catalyst, improving catalyst stability and activity.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid)
  - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (glutamic acid)
- **Low Yield:**
  - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (longer chain, additional acetamido group)
  - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (lacks a second carboxylate group and contains an aromatic ring)

---

### **Rule 2: Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids Yield High with Electron-Withdrawing Groups; Yield Low with Electron-Donating Groups**

**Description:** Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids yield high when the substituent is a strong electron-withdrawing group (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl). These groups enhance electronic interactions and coordination with the catalyst. Conversely, modifiers with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, hydroxy) yield low due to reduced coordination ability.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - 4-aminobenzoic acid
  - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
  - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
- **Low Yield:**
  - 4-methylbenzoic acid
  - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

---

### **Rule 3: Modifiers with Carboxylic Acid Directly Attached to Nitrogen Heterocycles Yield High**

**Description:** Modifiers featuring a carboxylic acid group directly attached to a nitrogen-containing heterocycle (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole) yield high. The heterocyclic nitrogen enhances coordination with the metal catalyst, facilitating effective catalysis.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid
  - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
  - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
- **Low Yield:**
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (carboxylic acid attached to benzene ring, not directly to heterocycle)

---

### **Rule 4: Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids without Terminal Polar Groups Yield High; Those with Terminal Polar Groups Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 7 or more carbons and no additional terminal polar groups (e.g., hydroxy, amino) yield high. The hydrophobic aliphatic chain facilitates favorable interactions within the catalyst environment. Modifiers with terminal polar groups yield low due to altered coordination dynamics.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - Octanoic acid
- **Low Yield:**
  - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid

---

### **Rule 5: Modifiers with Polyhydroxylated Aliphatic Chains Yield High**

**Description:** Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups on the chain yield high. The multiple hydroxyl groups enhance solubility and facilitate hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid)

---

### **Rule 6: Modifiers Containing Fused Aromatic Heterocycles Yield High; Simple Aromatic Compounds Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers that contain fused aromatic heterocycles with heteroatoms (e.g., indole, benzofuran) yield high due to strong π-π interactions and enhanced coordination with the catalyst. Simple aromatic compounds lacking heterocycles yield low.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan)
  - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid
- **Low Yield:**
  - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine)

---

### **Rule 7: Modifiers with Polyether Chains Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers featuring polyether chains (alkyl chains with multiple ether linkages) result in low yield. The flexibility and steric bulk of the polyether chain may cause steric hindrance and reduce effective coordination with the catalyst.

*Examples:*

- **Low Yield:**
  - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
  - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

---

### **Rule 8: Modifiers with Terminal Thiol Groups Yield High When on Aliphatic Chains; Yield Low When on Aromatic Rings**

**Description:** Modifiers with thiol (–SH) groups on aliphatic chains yield high due to strong coordination through sulfur atoms. When the thiol group is attached to an aromatic ring, the yield is low, possibly due to delocalization of electron density reducing thiol effectiveness.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
- **Low Yield:**
  - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

---

### **Rule 9: Modifiers with Perfluorinated Chains Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers with perfluorinated aliphatic chains yield low due to poor solubility and weak interactions within the catalyst environment. The highly electronegative fluorine atoms reduce the compound's ability to coordinate effectively.

*Examples:*

- **Low Yield:**
  - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid

---

### **Rule 10: Modifiers with Aldehyde Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acids Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers possessing aldehyde groups (–CHO) adjacent to carboxylic acid groups yield low. The aldehyde group can engage in side reactions or interfere with catalyst coordination.

*Examples:*

- **Low Yield:**
  - 4-formylbenzoic acid
  - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

---

### **Rule 11: Modifiers with Multiple Strong Chelating Groups Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers possessing multiple functional groups (e.g., amino, acetamido, hydroxyl) that can chelate the metal catalyst too strongly may lead to catalyst deactivation, resulting in low yield.

*Examples:*

- **Low Yield:**
  - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
  - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

---

### **Rule 12: Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Electron-Donating Groups Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxy) yield low. Electron-donating groups reduce the molecule’s ability to coordinate effectively with the catalyst.

*Examples:*

- **Low Yield:**
  - 4-methylbenzoic acid
  - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
  - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid (despite medium chain, methoxy groups donate electrons)

---

### **Rule 13: Modifiers with Medium-Length Alkyl Chains Linked to Polar Groups Yield High**

**Description:** Modifiers that have medium-length alkyl chains (4–5 carbons) linking a carboxylic acid to a polar group (e.g., hydroxyphenyl group) yield high. This structure balances hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, enhancing catalyst binding.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
- **Low Yield:**
  - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (shorter chain length reduces hydrophobic interactions)

---

### **Rule 14: Modifiers Resembling Phenylalanine Yield Low; Those Resembling Tryptophan Yield High**

**Description:** Modifiers structurally similar to phenylalanine yield low, possibly due to unfavorable steric interactions with the catalyst or lack of sufficient coordination sites. Modifiers similar to tryptophan yield high due to additional heteroatoms enhancing interactions.

*Examples:*

- **Low Yield:**
  - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine)
- **High Yield:**
  - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan)

---

### **Rule 15: Modifiers with Flexible Polyether Amino Acids Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers that are amino acids with flexible polyether chains yield low. The flexibility and steric bulk of polyether chains interfere with effective coordination to the catalyst.

*Examples:*

- **Low Yield:**
  - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

---

These rules illustrate how specific combinations of substructures and functional groups within the molecular modifiers influence the reaction yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization. By considering underlying physicochemical properties such as coordination ability, electron distribution, steric effects, and solubility, the rules provide clear predictions for whether a modifier will result in a high or low yield.

**Summary of Key Insights:**

- **Coordination Enhancement:** Functional groups such as amino, carboxylate, nitrogen heterocycles, and thiol groups enhance coordination with the metal catalyst, leading to higher yields.
- **Electronic Effects:** Electron-withdrawing groups on aromatic rings improve catalyst interactions, while electron-donating groups diminish them.
- **Steric Considerations:** Bulky or flexible substituents, such as polyether chains or multiple chelating groups, can hinder effective catalyst coordination, resulting in lower yields.
- **Hydrophobic/Hydrophilic Balance:** Appropriate chain lengths and functional group positioning balance hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, optimizing catalyst binding.
- **Structural Features:** Fused heterocycles and polyhydroxylated aliphatic chains offer unique coordination properties that enhance reaction outcomes.

By applying these rules, researchers can predict the effectiveness of potential modifiers and design new compounds to optimize and control the reaction yield.

Current rules:
---

### **Rule 1: α-Amino Dicarboxylic Acids Yield High**

**Description:** Modifiers that are α-amino acids with two carboxylic acid groups (i.e., α-amino dicarboxylic acids) yield high. The presence of an amino group at the α-position and two carboxylate groups enhances coordination with the metal catalyst, improving catalyst stability and activity.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid)
  - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (glutamic acid)
- **Low Yield:**
  - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (longer chain, additional acetamido group)
  - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (lacks a second carboxylate group and contains an aromatic ring)

---

### **Rule 2: Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids Yield High with Electron-Withdrawing Groups; Yield Low with Electron-Donating Groups**

**Description:** Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids yield high when the substituent is a strong electron-withdrawing group (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl). These groups enhance electronic interactions and coordination with the catalyst. Conversely, modifiers with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, hydroxy) yield low due to reduced coordination ability.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - 4-aminobenzoic acid
  - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
  - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
- **Low Yield:**
  - 4-methylbenzoic acid
  - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

---

### **Rule 3: Modifiers with Carboxylic Acid Directly Attached to Nitrogen Heterocycles Yield High**

**Description:** Modifiers featuring a carboxylic acid group directly attached to a nitrogen-containing heterocycle (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole) yield high. The heterocyclic nitrogen enhances coordination with the metal catalyst, facilitating effective catalysis.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid
  - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
  - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
- **Low Yield:**
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (carboxylic acid attached to benzene ring, not directly to heterocycle)

---

### **Rule 4: Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids without Terminal Polar Groups Yield High; Those with Terminal Polar Groups Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 7 or more carbons and no additional terminal polar groups (e.g., hydroxy, amino) yield high. The hydrophobic aliphatic chain facilitates favorable interactions within the catalyst environment. Modifiers with terminal polar groups yield low due to altered coordination dynamics.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - Octanoic acid
- **Low Yield:**
  - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid

---

### **Rule 5: Modifiers with Polyhydroxylated Aliphatic Chains Yield High**

**Description:** Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups on the chain yield high. The multiple hydroxyl groups enhance solubility and facilitate hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid)

---

### **Rule 6: Modifiers Containing Fused Aromatic Heterocycles Yield High; Simple Aromatic Compounds Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers that contain fused aromatic heterocycles with heteroatoms (e.g., indole, benzofuran) yield high due to strong π-π interactions and enhanced coordination with the catalyst. Simple aromatic compounds lacking heterocycles yield low.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan)
  - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid
- **Low Yield:**
  - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine)

---

### **Rule 7: Modifiers with Polyether Chains Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers featuring polyether chains (alkyl chains with multiple ether linkages) result in low yield. The flexibility and steric bulk of the polyether chain may cause steric hindrance and reduce effective coordination with the catalyst.

*Examples:*

- **Low Yield:**
  - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
  - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

---

### **Rule 8: Modifiers with Terminal Thiol Groups Yield High When on Aliphatic Chains; Yield Low When on Aromatic Rings**

**Description:** Modifiers with thiol (–SH) groups on aliphatic chains yield high due to strong coordination through sulfur atoms. When the thiol group is attached to an aromatic ring, the yield is low, possibly due to delocalization of electron density reducing thiol effectiveness.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
- **Low Yield:**
  - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

---

### **Rule 9: Modifiers with Perfluorinated Chains Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers with perfluorinated aliphatic chains yield low due to poor solubility and weak interactions within the catalyst environment. The highly electronegative fluorine atoms reduce the compound's ability to coordinate effectively.

*Examples:*

- **Low Yield:**
  - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid

---

### **Rule 10: Modifiers with Aldehyde Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acids Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers possessing aldehyde groups (–CHO) adjacent to carboxylic acid groups yield low. The aldehyde group can engage in side reactions or interfere with catalyst coordination.

*Examples:*

- **Low Yield:**
  - 4-formylbenzoic acid
  - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

---

### **Rule 11: Modifiers with Multiple Strong Chelating Groups Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers possessing multiple functional groups (e.g., amino, acetamido, hydroxyl) that can chelate the metal catalyst too strongly may lead to catalyst deactivation, resulting in low yield.

*Examples:*

- **Low Yield:**
  - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
  - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

---

### **Rule 12: Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Electron-Donating Groups Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxy) yield low. Electron-donating groups reduce the molecule’s ability to coordinate effectively with the catalyst.

*Examples:*

- **Low Yield:**
  - 4-methylbenzoic acid
  - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
  - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid (despite medium chain, methoxy groups donate electrons)

---

### **Rule 13: Modifiers with Medium-Length Alkyl Chains Linked to Polar Groups Yield High**

**Description:** Modifiers that have medium-length alkyl chains (4–5 carbons) linking a carboxylic acid to a polar group (e.g., hydroxyphenyl group) yield high. This structure balances hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, enhancing catalyst binding.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
- **Low Yield:**
  - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (shorter chain length reduces hydrophobic interactions)

---

### **Rule 14: Modifiers Resembling Phenylalanine Yield Low; Those Resembling Tryptophan Yield High**

**Description:** Modifiers structurally similar to phenylalanine yield low, possibly due to unfavorable steric interactions with the catalyst or lack of sufficient coordination sites. Modifiers similar to tryptophan yield high due to additional heteroatoms enhancing interactions.

*Examples:*

- **Low Yield:**
  - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine)
- **High Yield:**
  - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan)

---

### **Rule 15: Modifiers with Flexible Polyether Amino Acids Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers that are amino acids with flexible polyether chains yield low. The flexibility and steric bulk of polyether chains interfere with effective coordination to the catalyst.

*Examples:*

- **Low Yield:**
  - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules illustrate how specific combinations of substructures and functional groups within the molecular modifiers influence the reaction yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization. By considering underlying physicochemical properties such as coordination ability, electron distribution, steric effects, and solubility, the rules provide clear predictions for whether a modifier will result in a high or low yield.

**Summary of Key Insights:**

- **Coordination Enhancement:** Functional groups such as amino, carboxylate, nitrogen heterocycles, and thiol groups enhance coordination with the metal catalyst, leading to higher yields.
- **Electronic Effects:** Electron-withdrawing groups on aromatic rings improve catalyst interactions, while electron-donating groups diminish them.
- **Steric Considerations:** Bulky or flexible substituents, such as polyether chains or multiple chelating groups, can hinder effective catalyst coordination, resulting in lower yields.
- **Hydrophobic/Hydrophilic Balance:** Appropriate chain lengths and functional group positioning balance hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, optimizing catalyst binding.
- **Structural Features:** Fused heterocycles and polyhydroxylated aliphatic chains offer unique coordination properties that enhance reaction outcomes.

By applying these rules, researchers can predict the effectiveness of potential modifiers and design new compounds to optimize and control the reaction yield.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: Review and correct the definitions of electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) and electron-donating groups (EDGs) in the code. Currently, the code defines amino groups (`[NH2]`) as electron-donating groups, which is chemically accurate. However, in Rule 2, amino groups are treated as electron-withdrawing groups. To resolve this inconsistency, clarify in the rule description whether amino groups are considered EWGs or EDGs in this specific context. If amino groups are to be treated as EWGs for Rule 2, update the `EWG` list in the code to include `[NH2]`.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: In the code for Rule 2, ensure that the SMARTS patterns for electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups accurately reflect the functional groups as intended in the rules. For example, if amino groups are to be considered electron-withdrawing in the context of Rule 2, move `[NH2]` from the `EDG` list to the `EWG` list. This will align the code with the rule's examples and expected outcomes.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For Rule 12, which assigns a low yield to aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups, verify that the `EDG` patterns used in the code match the intended functional groups. Ensure that groups like methyl (`[CH3]`), methoxy (`[OCH3]`), and hydroxy (`[OH]`) are included, and that amino groups are correctly categorized based on the context provided in the rules.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Resolve conflicting rule assignments where a molecule matches multiple rules with opposite predictions due to inconsistencies in group definitions. Modify the code to prioritize rules or to handle exceptions where a functional group may behave differently in different chemical contexts.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: Refine the SMARTS patterns for identifying fused aromatic heterocycles in Rule 6. The current patterns may not capture all relevant structures or may incorrectly match simple aromatic compounds. Ensure that the SMARTS patterns accurately distinguish fused heterocycles like indole and benzofuran from simple aromatic rings like phenyl groups.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Enhance the code by adding comments or documentation that explain the reasoning behind the categorization of functional groups within the `EWG` and `EDG` lists. This will help maintain clarity and consistency, especially when the chemical behavior of certain groups may differ from general conventions due to specific reaction mechanisms or coordination chemistry considerations.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: Implement unit tests using the example molecules provided in each rule to verify that the code assigns the correct predictions. This will help identify discrepancies between the code's logic and the intended application of the rules, allowing for targeted debugging and validation.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Consider restructuring the code to allow for more flexible and context-dependent definitions of functional groups. For example, create separate lists or flags for groups that may act as EWGs or EDGs in different rules or chemical environments. This will enable the code to more accurately model the nuanced behavior of certain functional groups.

**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

---

**Summary of Current Metrics:**

- **Train Support:** 0.0305
- **Train Confidence:** 0.5652
- **Train Lift:** 1.1292
- **Train Leverage:** 0.0029

**Reference Metrics for Comparison:**

- **Train Support (Previous):** [0.1667, 0.1845]
- **Train Confidence (Previous):** [0.6352, 0.5396]
- **Train Lift (Previous):** [1.2048, 1.0559]
- **Train Leverage (Previous):** [0.0289, -0.0041]

---

### **Performance Commentary:**

**1. Support Analysis:**

- The **current train support** of **0.0305** is **significantly lower** than the reference supports of **approximately 0.17 to 0.18**.
- **Implication:** The current rules apply to a smaller fraction of the dataset, indicating that they are **covering fewer instances**. This suggests that the rules may be **too specific** or **overly restrictive**.

**2. Confidence Analysis:**

- The **current train confidence** is **0.5652**, which lies between the previous confidences of **0.5396** and **0.6352**.
- **Implication:** The confidence level is **moderate** and **consistent** with previous iterations. It suggests that when the rule conditions are met, there is a **56.52% chance** that the prediction is correct.
- The confidence has **not improved** over previous iterations, indicating a **plateau** in this metric.

**3. Lift Analysis:**

- The **current train lift** is **1.1292**, compared to previous lifts of **1.2048** and **1.0559**.
- **Implication:** A lift greater than **1** indicates that the rule is **better than random chance** at predicting outcomes. However, the current lift is **slightly lower** than the highest previous lift (**1.2048**), suggesting a **marginal decrease** in the rule's effectiveness at improving prediction over the baseline.
- The lift has **not significantly increased**, indicating that we've possibly reached a **local maximum** in terms of this metric.

**4. Leverage Analysis:**

- The **current train leverage** is **0.0029**, which is **significantly lower** than the previous positive leverage (**0.0289**) and slightly higher than the negative leverage (**-0.0041**).
- **Implication:** Positive leverage indicates that the rule predicts better than chance, but the low value suggests that the **additional predictive power** is minimal.

---

### **Determination of Local Minimum and Iterations:**

- The metrics, particularly **confidence** and **lift**, have **stabilized** over the last few iterations, showing **no significant improvement**.
- The **support** has **decreased**, implying that the rules are becoming **more specific** but not necessarily **more effective**.
- **Conclusion:** It appears that a **local minimum** has been reached. Continuing iterations under the current approach may yield **diminishing returns**.

---

### **Recommendations for Improving Current Rules:**

**1. Increase Rule Generalization:**

- **Broaden the Rules:** Modify the rules to be **less restrictive**, thereby increasing the **support** without drastically affecting confidence and lift.
- **Combine Similar Rules:** Identify and **merge rules** that have overlapping conditions or similar outcomes to increase their applicability.

**2. Focus on High-Impact Features:**

- **Analyze Key Contributors:** Re-evaluate the molecular features that have the **most significant impact** on yield, focusing on those that consistently appear in high-confidence rules.
- **Eliminate Redundant Conditions:** Remove conditions that **do not contribute significantly** to the predictive power but reduce the rule's support.

**3. Balance Specificity and Coverage:**

- **Avoid Overfitting:** Ensure that the rules are **not too tailored** to the training data, which may reduce their generalizability to new data.

ML Commenter Message:
**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

Based on the latest training results, the performance of the current rules shows a decline compared to previous iterations. The 5-fold validation accuracy in the current iteration is **54.29%**, whereas previous validation accuracies were higher, generally around **75%**. This suggests that the current rules may not be effectively capturing the necessary patterns to accurately predict the loading of modifiers on catalysts.

**Comparison with Previous Metrics:**

- **Previous Validation Accuracies:**
  - Validation Accuracy: [0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]; Test Accuracy: 0.75
  - Validation Accuracy: [0.76, 0.68, 0.72, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]; Test Accuracy: 0.75
  - Validation Accuracy: [0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]; Test Accuracy: 0.625

- **Current Validation Accuracy:**
  - Validation Accuracy: **0.5428571428571428**

The decrease in validation accuracy indicates that the model's predictive power has diminished, suggesting potential issues with the current set of rules.

**Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting:**

- **Underfitting:** The overall low validation accuracy suggests that the model may be underfitting, meaning it's too simplistic and not capturing the underlying relationships in the data.
- **Overfitting:** There is no strong indication of overfitting, as overfitting would typically result in a high training accuracy but low validation accuracy. Since both accuracies are low, underfitting is more likely.

**Analysis of SHAP Values and Discrepancies**

The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis provides insights into how each rule contributes to the model's predictions. By examining molecules where predictions do not match the experimental values, we can identify problematic rules.

**Molecules with Underestimated Loadings (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**

- **Molecules:**
  - **C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O**
  - **C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)N**
  - **C([C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](C(=O)O)O)O)O)O)O**
  - **C(CCN)CC(=O)O**
  - **C1=CC2=C(C=C1C(=O)O)C(=O)OC2=O**
  - **C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)[N+](=O)[O-]**
  - **COC1=C(C=C(C=C1)C(=O)CCC(=O)O)OC**

- **Observations:**
  - These molecules are predicted to have low loading, but experimentally they show high loading.
  - **Rule1** contributes negatively to the prediction (SHAP values around **-0.0185** to **-0.0385**), suggesting it might not be adequately accounting for these cases.

**Molecules with Overestimated Loadings (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**

- **Molecules:**
  - **C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N**
  - **C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)NCC(=O)O)O**
  - **C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O**
  - **C1=CC(=CC=C1CCC(=O)O)O**
  - **C(CCN)CC(=O)O**

- **Observations:**
  - These molecules are predicted to have high loading, but experimentally they exhibit low loading.
  - **Rule1** shows a positive SHAP value for high loading in these cases, indicating an overestimation due to this rule.

**Interpretation:**

- **Rule1** (α-Amino Dicarboxylic Acids Yield High) is significantly influencing predictions.
  - For molecules where **Rule1** contributes negatively but the experimental loading is high, the rule may be too restrictive or not encompassing all relevant structural features.
  - For molecules where **Rule1** contributes positively but the experimental loading is low, the rule may be too broad, leading to overestimation.

**Conclusion on Current Rule Effectiveness:**

- The current rules, particularly **Rule1**, are not adequately capturing the nuanced structural features that determine the loading outcomes.
- The decrease in validation accuracy suggests that the model is not effectively generalizing and may require refinement to avoid underfitting.

---

**Recommendations for Improvement**

To enhance the performance of the model and improve the prediction accuracy, consider the following recommendations:

1. **Refine Rule1 to Improve Specificity:**

   - **Issue:** **Rule1** may be too broad, causing overestimation in some cases and underestimation in others.
   - **Action:**
     - **Expand the Definition:** Include variations of α-amino dicarboxylic acids that might display different behaviors due to substitutions or stereochemistry.
     - **Add Sub-Classes:** Consider creating sub-rules under Rule1 to distinguish between different types of α-amino dicarboxylic acids based on side chains or additional functional groups.
     - **Incorporate Stereochemistry:** Account for stereoisomers, as the spatial arrangement can significantly impact loading.

2. **Adjust Rules with High Negative SHAP Values for Underestimated Loadings:**

   - **Issue:** Negative SHAP values for underestimated loadings indicate that certain rules are penalizing molecules incorrectly.
   - **Action:**
     - **Review and Modify Rules:** Examine rules that consistently contribute negative SHAP values to molecules with high experimental loadings, and adjust their conditions to reduce misclassifications.
     - **Example:** If **Rule1** excludes certain aromatic amino acids that actually yield high loading, modify the rule to include these exceptions.

3. **Incorporate Additional Structural Features into Existing Rules:**

   - **Issue:** Some molecules with high experimental loading are not adequately described by current rules.
   - **Action:**
     - **Enhance Rule2:** For molecules like **C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O**, which is a para-substituted benzoic acid with a bromomethyl group, ensure that **Rule2** (Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids) accurately accounts for halogen substituents.
     - **Update Other Relevant Rules:** Modify rules to include additional electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups that may affect loading.

4. **Develop New Rules Based on SHAP Analysis Insights:**

   - **Issue:** The SHAP analysis highlights molecules not adequately captured by existing rules.
   - **Action:**
     - **Identify Common Patterns:** Analyze the misclassified molecules to identify common structural motifs or functional groups.
     - **Create New Rules:** Develop new rules to address these patterns. For example, if several underestimated molecules contain specific heterocycles or functional groups, a new rule should be formulated to capture this.

5. **Improve Generalization to Address Underfitting:**

   - **Issue:** The model's low accuracy suggests it is underfitting and not capturing complex relationships.
   - **Action:**
     - **Increase Rule Complexity:** Where appropriate, allow rules to include combinations of features (e.g., both electronic and steric factors).
     - **Avoid Over-Simplification:** Ensure that rules are not overly generalized, which can prevent the model from distinguishing between molecules effectively.

6. **Validate and Iterate on Rule Adjustments:**

   - **Issue:** Without validation, changes may not lead to improvement.
   - **Action:**
     - **Iterative Testing:** After adjusting rules, retrain the model and assess performance to determine if changes have a positive impact.
     - **Cross-Validation:** Use cross-validation techniques to ensure that improvements are consistent across different subsets of the data.

7. **Consider External Chemical Knowledge:**

   - **Issue:** Some discrepancies may arise from factors not currently considered.
   - **Action:**
     - **Consult Literature:** Investigate if there are known exceptions or additional factors affecting loading, such as solvent effects or catalyst modifiers.
     - **Integrate Chemical Insights:** Incorporate this knowledge into the rules to enhance their accuracy.

**Example of Rule Refinement:**

- **Refining Rule1 (α-Amino Dicarboxylic Acids Yield High):**

  - **Original Rule:** Modifiers that are α-amino acids with two carboxylic acid groups yield high.
  - **Issues Identified:**
    - Does not account for substituted α-amino dicarboxylic acids.
    - May exclude molecules with additional functional groups that still perform well.
  - **Refined Rule1:**
    - **Description:** Modifiers that are α-amino acids with two carboxylic acid groups, including those with certain substituents (e.g., halogens, hydroxyl groups) on the side chain, yield high.
    - **Inclusion Criteria:** 
      - α-Amino dicarboxylic acids with side chains containing electron-withdrawing groups.
      - Stereoisomers that maintain the α-amino dicarboxylic structure.

**Conclusion**

By refining and augmenting the current rules based on the SHAP analysis and discrepancies observed, the model's predictive accuracy can be improved. This involves making existing rules more specific, adding new rules to capture overlooked structural features, and ensuring that the model balances generalization with specificity to avoid underfitting.

**Next Steps:**

- **Implement Adjustments:** Apply the recommended changes to the rules.
- **Retrain the Model:** Update the feature matrix and retrain the classification model with the refined rules.
- **Evaluate Performance:** Analyze the new validation accuracy and SHAP values to assess improvements.
- **Iterate as Needed:** Continue refining the rules through iterative cycles until satisfactory performance is achieved.

By systematically addressing the issues identified and leveraging insights from the SHAP analysis, the model can be enhanced to provide more accurate predictions of modifier loading on catalysts.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

---

The recent analysis has highlighted several issues with the current set of rules used to predict the loading of modifiers on the catalyst Hf-TPY-MOL(Fe) and, consequently, the reaction yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization.

**Key Points from the Discussions:**

1. **Mismatch in Functional Group Definitions:**
   - There is an inconsistency in the categorization of electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) and electron-donating groups (EDGs), particularly concerning amino groups.
   - Amino groups are chemically electron-donating; however, in Rule 2, they are treated as electron-withdrawing, leading to confusion and incorrect predictions.

2. **Low Support and Confidence Metrics:**
   - The current rules exhibit low support (0.0305) and moderate confidence (0.5652), indicating that they apply to a small subset of the dataset and are not highly reliable.
   - The validation accuracy has decreased to approximately 54%, down from previous accuracies around 75%, suggesting that the model's predictive power has diminished.

3. **Underfitting Indications:**
   - The model may be underfitting, as it fails to capture the complexity of the data, resulting in low training and validation accuracies.
   - Overly restrictive or overly generalized rules are not effectively distinguishing between molecules with high and low yields.

4. **SHAP Analysis Insights:**
   - The SHAP analysis reveals that some molecules are incorrectly predicted due to rules contributing negative SHAP values.
   - For example, molecules with high experimental loading are predicted as low due to the misapplication of Rule 1.

**Suggestions to Improve Current Rules:**

1. **Reevaluate Functional Group Classifications:**
   - **Correct the Definitions of EWGs and EDGs:**
     - Update the EWG and EDG lists to accurately reflect the chemical nature of functional groups.
     - Clarify whether amino groups should be considered electron-donating or electron-withdrawing within each rule's context.
   - **Ensure Consistency Across Rules:**
     - Align the functional group definitions used in different rules to prevent conflicting predictions.

2. **Refine and Expand Existing Rules:**
   - **Rule 1 (α-Amino Dicarboxylic Acids):**
     - Modify the rule to include relevant variations, such as substituted α-amino dicarboxylic acids and stereoisomers.
     - Consider side chains with electron-withdrawing substituents that may influence the loading.
   - **Rule 2 (Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids):**
     - Update the rule to accurately classify amino groups and include halogen substituents, such as bromine, which are electron-withdrawing.
     - Adjust SMARTS patterns to match the intended substituents.
   - **Rule 12 (Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with EDGs):**
     - Verify that the EDG patterns include all relevant groups like methyl, methoxy, and hydroxy.
     - Ensure amino groups are categorized appropriately based on their effect in the specific chemical context.

3. **Resolve Conflicting Rule Assignments:**
   - **Prioritize Rules:**
     - Establish a hierarchy or weighting system for rules to manage cases where a molecule matches multiple rules with conflicting predictions.
   - **Handle Exceptions:**
     - Identify and document exceptions where functional groups may behave differently and adjust the rules accordingly.

4. **Enhance Rule Specificity and Coverage:**
   - **Increase Support Without Sacrificing Confidence:**
     - Broaden the rules to cover more molecules while maintaining or improving predictive accuracy.
   - **Merge Similar Rules:**
     - Combine overlapping rules to simplify the rule set and improve applicability.
   - **Include Additional Structural Features:**
     - Incorporate other influential molecular features, such as steric effects, hydrogen bonding capability, or the presence of specific functional groups.

5. **Improve the SMARTS Patterns:**
   - **Refine Patterns for Fused Aromatic Heterocycles (Rule 6):**
     - Ensure that the SMARTS patterns accurately identify fused heterocycles and do not incorrectly match simple aromatic compounds.
   - **Add Comments and Documentation:**
     - Annotate the code with explanations of the reasoning behind functional group categorizations to improve clarity.

6. **Conduct Targeted Testing and Validation:**
   - **Implement Unit Tests:**
     - Use the example molecules provided in each rule to test whether the code assigns correct predictions.
   - **Use Cross-Validation Techniques:**
     - Perform cross-validation to assess the model's generalizability and adjust rules based on the results.

7. **Incorporate Machine Learning Insights:**
   - **Feature Importance Analysis:**
     - Utilize statistical techniques to identify which features contribute most to predictive performance.
   - **Integrate with Machine Learning Models:**
     - Use models capable of capturing complex interactions to inform rule adjustments.

8. **Iterative Refinement Process:**
   - **Review and Adjust Rules Based on SHAP Analysis:**
     - Modify rules that frequently contribute to incorrect predictions, as indicated by SHAP values.
   - **Balance Generalization and Specificity:**
     - Ensure that rules are neither too broad nor too narrow to prevent underfitting or overfitting.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

There is significant potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. By addressing the inconsistencies in functional group definitions and refining the rules to better reflect the chemical behavior of the modifiers, the predictive accuracy can be improved. Implementing the suggestions above will enhance the model's ability to generalize from the training data to new, unseen data.

In particular:

- **Adjusting Functional Group Classifications** will resolve inconsistencies and improve the accuracy of predictions related to electronic effects.

- **Refining Rules Based on SHAP Insights** will correct specific misclassifications and improve the model's performance on molecules that were previously problematic.

- **Incorporating Additional Features** and **Expanding Rules** will increase the support of the rules, covering a larger portion of the dataset without compromising confidence.

By iteratively refining the rules and validating them against the data, it is possible to enhance the model's performance while avoiding overfitting.

**Please Optimize Rules**

    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    ---

### **Rule 1: α-Amino Dicarboxylic Acids Yield High**

**Description:** Modifiers that are α-amino acids with two carboxylic acid groups (i.e., α-amino dicarboxylic acids) yield high. The presence of an amino group at the α-position and two carboxylate groups enhances coordination with the metal catalyst, improving catalyst stability and activity.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid)
  - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (glutamic acid)
- **Low Yield:**
  - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (longer chain, additional acetamido group)
  - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (lacks a second carboxylate group and contains an aromatic ring)

---

### **Rule 2: Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids Yield High with Electron-Withdrawing Groups; Yield Low with Electron-Donating Groups**

**Description:** Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids yield high when the substituent is a strong electron-withdrawing group (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl). These groups enhance electronic interactions and coordination with the catalyst. Conversely, modifiers with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, hydroxy) yield low due to reduced coordination ability.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - 4-aminobenzoic acid
  - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
  - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
- **Low Yield:**
  - 4-methylbenzoic acid
  - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

---

### **Rule 3: Modifiers with Carboxylic Acid Directly Attached to Nitrogen Heterocycles Yield High**

**Description:** Modifiers featuring a carboxylic acid group directly attached to a nitrogen-containing heterocycle (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole) yield high. The heterocyclic nitrogen enhances coordination with the metal catalyst, facilitating effective catalysis.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid
  - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
  - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
- **Low Yield:**
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (carboxylic acid attached to benzene ring, not directly to heterocycle)

---

### **Rule 4: Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids without Terminal Polar Groups Yield High; Those with Terminal Polar Groups Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 7 or more carbons and no additional terminal polar groups (e.g., hydroxy, amino) yield high. The hydrophobic aliphatic chain facilitates favorable interactions within the catalyst environment. Modifiers with terminal polar groups yield low due to altered coordination dynamics.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - Octanoic acid
- **Low Yield:**
  - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid

---

### **Rule 5: Modifiers with Polyhydroxylated Aliphatic Chains Yield High**

**Description:** Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups on the chain yield high. The multiple hydroxyl groups enhance solubility and facilitate hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid)

---

### **Rule 6: Modifiers Containing Fused Aromatic Heterocycles Yield High; Simple Aromatic Compounds Yield Low**

**Description:** Modifiers that contain fused aromatic heterocycles with heteroatoms (e.g., indole, benzofuran) yield high due to strong π-π interactions and enhanced coordination with the catalyst. Simple aromatic compounds lacking heterocycles yield low.

*Examples:*

- **High Yield:**
  - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan)
  - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid
- **Low Yield:**

  - **Issue**: Amino groups are mistakenly classified as electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) in Rule 2.
  - **Action**: Update the definitions of EWGs and electron-donating groups (EDGs) across all relevant rules.
    - **EWGs**: Include nitro (`-NO2`), cyano (`-CN`), halogens (`-F`, `-Cl`, `-Br`, `-I`), carbonyls (`-C(=O)R`), and trifluoromethyl (`-CF3`).
    - **EDGs**: Include amino (`-NH2`), alkyl groups (`-CH3`, `-C2H5`), methoxy (`-OCH3`), and hydroxy (`-OH`).
  - **Impact**: Ensures accurate predictions based on the correct electronic effects of substituents.

- **Advice 2**: **Revise Rule 2 for Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids**
  - **Issue**: Rule 2 incorrectly categorizes amino groups as EWGs, leading to misclassifications.
  - **Action**:
    - Modify Rule 2 to state: "Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids yield high when the substituent is a strong electron-withdrawing group (e.g., nitro, cyano, halogens). They yield low when the substituent is an electron-donating group (e.g., amino, methyl, methoxy, hydroxy)."
    - Update the SMARTS patterns to reflect this change:
      - High yield pattern: `c1ccc(cc1)C(=O)O` with a para EWG substituent.
      - Low yield pattern: `c1ccc(cc1)C(=O)O` with a para EDG substituent.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify and Quantify the Rules for Computational Use**

  Break down the current qualitative rules into quantifiable features that can be directly extracted from SMILES strings. For example, instead of stating "Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids yield high," define specific structural features such as:

  - Presence of an α-amino group (`[C@@H](N)C(=O)O`)
  - Two carboxylic acid groups (`C(=O)O`)
  
  By creating SMARTS patterns for these features, you can generate a numerical feature matrix indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of each feature.

- **Advice 2**: **Use Molecular Descriptors and Fingerprints**

  Compute molecular descriptors (e.g., molecular weight, LogP, topological polar surface area) and molecular fingerprints (e.g., MACCS keys, Morgan fingerprints) from the SMILES strings. These quantitative descriptors can capture the underlying physicochemical properties influencing yield and are suitable for machine learning models.

- **Advice 3**: **Define Clear Structural Parameters**

  Quantify structural features such as:

  - **Chain Length**: Number of carbon atoms in aliphatic chains.
  - **Degree of Saturation**: Count of double bonds or aromatic rings.
  - **Functional Group Counts**: Number of specific functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, carboxyl).

  This numerical data can be directly included in a feature matrix.

- **Advice 4**: **Develop SMARTS Patterns for Key Functional Groups**

  Create SMARTS patterns to identify and count key functional groups and substructures mentioned in the rules:

  - Nitrogen-containing heterocycles: `[n]`
  - Perfluorinated alkyl chains: `[*][C](F)(F)[C](F)(F)[C](F)(F)F`
  - Polyether chains: `[*]OCCOCC[*]`

  Automating the detection of these patterns will streamline feature extraction.

- **Advice 5**: **Quantify Electronic and Steric Effects**

  Assign numerical values to electronic properties (e.g., Hammett sigma constants) and steric parameters (e.g., Taft steric factors) of substituents. This approach allows modeling of how electronic donation or withdrawal and steric hindrance affect yield.

- **Advice 6**: **Categorize Modifiers Based on Donor Atom Counts**

  Count the number of donor atoms capable of coordinating with the metal catalyst (e.g., N, O, S atoms). Create features such as:

  - Total number of donor atoms.
  - Donor atoms per molecule weight ratio.
  - Donor atom positions relative to functional groups.

- **Advice 7**: **Incorporate 3D Structural Information**

  Where possible, use computational tools to estimate 3D structural descriptors like:

  - Molecular volume.
  - Surface area.
  - Flexibility (number of rotatable bonds).

  These parameters can influence how modifiers interact with the catalyst.

- **Advice 8**: **Standardize Functional Group Position Notation**

  Use consistent nomenclature to specify the positions of functional groups (e.g., para-, meta-, ortho- positions in aromatic rings). This consistency aids in automated parsing and feature generation.

- **Advice 9**: **Eliminate Redundancies and Merge Similar Rules**

  Review the current rules to identify and merge overlapping or similar rules. For instance, combine rules about the coordination enhancement of certain functional groups into a generalized rule about donor atoms enhancing yield.

- **Advice 10**: **Link Modifier Features to Quantitative Reaction Parameters**

  Develop formulas or models that relate the quantifiable features of modifiers to the key reaction parameters (modifier/SBU, Fe/Hf, Fe_loading). This will help in predicting yields more accurately and understanding the modifiers' effects on the reaction.

- **Advice 11**: **Use Machine Learning for Feature Selection**

  Apply machine learning techniques to identify which features most significantly impact yield. Techniques like recursive feature elimination can help refine the feature set to the most predictive descriptors.

- **Advice 12**: **Create a Comprehensive Modifier Database**

  Compile all modifiers with their computed features and observed yields into a structured database. This resource will facilitate data analysis and model building.

- **Advice 13**: **Provide Examples with SMILES Annotations**

  Include annotated SMILES strings showing how features are extracted from modifiers. This will serve as a reference for correct feature extraction and assist in training any automated systems.

- **Advice 14**: **Consider Software Tools for Feature Extraction**

  Utilize cheminformatics software (e.g., RDKit, Open Babel) to automate the extraction of molecular features from SMILES strings. These tools can handle large datasets efficiently.

- **Advice 15**: **Validate and Update the Rules Iteratively**

  As new data becomes available, validate the effectiveness of the updated rules and descriptors. Refine the rules iteratively to improve predictive accuracy.

  - **Low Yield:**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 4: Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing or Coordinating Groups Yield High**

  **Description:** Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids yield high when the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group or capable of coordination (e.g., nitro, bromo, amino groups). These groups enhance electronic interactions and coordination with the catalyst.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Methyl group does not enhance coordination)
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Aldehyde group may interfere with coordination)

---

- **Rule 5: Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups on Aliphatic Chains Yield High**

  **Description:** Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups yield high. The hydroxyl groups improve solubility and provide additional coordination sites with the metal catalyst.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

---

- **Rule 6: Modifiers with Thiol Groups on Aliphatic Chains Yield High; Thiol Groups on Aromatic Rings Yield Low**

  **Description:** Modifiers featuring thiol (–SH) groups on aliphatic chains yield high due to strong coordination via sulfur atoms. When the thiol group is attached to an aromatic ring, the yield is low, possibly due to reduced availability of the sulfur atom for coordination.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 7: Modifiers with Polyether Chains Yield Low**

  **Description:** Modifiers containing polyether chains (alkyl chains with multiple ether linkages) result in low yield. The flexibility and steric bulk of the polyether chain may hinder effective coordination with the catalyst.

  **Description:** Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains yield low due to poor solubility and weak interactions within the catalyst environment. The high electronegativity of fluorine atoms reduces the compound's ability to coordinate effectively.

  **Examples:**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 11: Modifiers with Indole Rings Yield High**

  **Description:** Modifiers containing an indole ring yield high. The indole nitrogen and aromatic system enhance coordination and interaction with the metal catalyst.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

---

- **Rule 12: Modifiers with Rigid Aromatic Structures Containing Oxygen Yield High**

  **Description:** Modifiers with rigid aromatic structures that include oxygen atoms (e.g., benzofuran derivatives) yield high. The oxygen atoms in the fused rings provide additional coordination sites and stabilize the catalyst.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

---

- **Rule 13: Modifiers with Functional Groups That Interfere with Coordination Yield Low**

  **Examples:**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

---

- **Rule 14: Modifiers with Side Chains Capable of Chelation Yield High**

  **Description:** Modifiers whose side chains contain functional groups that can chelate the metal center (e.g., amino group positioned to coordinate alongside the carboxylate) yield high, enhancing catalyst stability and activity.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 15: Modifiers with Bulky or Sterically Hindered Groups Yield Low**

  **Description:** Modifiers with bulky substituents or groups that introduce steric hindrance near the coordination site yield low. Such groups can prevent effective interaction between the modifier and the catalyst.

  **Examples:**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1: Modifiers That Are α-Amino Dicarboxylic Acids Yield High**

  **Description:** Modifiers that are α-amino acids containing two carboxylic acid groups yield high. The combination of the α-amino group and two carboxylate groups enhances coordination with the metal catalyst, improving its stability and activity.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

---

- **Rule 2: Modifiers with Nitrogen-Containing Aromatic Heterocycles Directly Attached to Carboxylic Acids Yield High**

  **Description:** Modifiers featuring a carboxylic acid group directly attached to a nitrogen-containing aromatic heterocycle yield high. The nitrogen atom in the heterocycle enhances coordination with the metal catalyst.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Niacin)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Carboxylic acid not directly attached to the heterocycle)

---

- **Rule 3: Straight-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids with Long Chains Yield High; Terminal Polar Groups Decrease Yield**

  **Description:** Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with chains of six or more carbons yield high. The presence of terminal polar groups (e.g., amino, hydroxy) on the chain decreases the yield due to altered coordination dynamics.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **Octanoic acid**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 4: Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing or Coordinating Groups Yield High**

  **Description:** Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids yield high when the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group or capable of coordination (e.g., nitro, bromo, amino groups). These groups enhance electronic interactions and coordination with the catalyst.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Methyl group does not enhance coordination)
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Aldehyde group may interfere with coordination)

---

- **Rule 5: Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups on Aliphatic Chains Yield High**

  **Description:** Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups yield high. The hydroxyl groups improve solubility and provide additional coordination sites with the metal catalyst.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**

---

- **Rule 6: Modifiers with Thiol Groups on Aliphatic Chains Yield High; Thiol Groups on Aromatic Rings Yield Low**

  **Description:** Modifiers featuring thiol (–SH) groups on aliphatic chains yield high due to strong coordination via sulfur atoms. When the thiol group is attached to an aromatic ring, the yield is low, possibly due to reduced availability of the sulfur atom for coordination.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 7: Modifiers with Polyether Chains Yield Low**

  **Description:** Modifiers containing polyether chains (alkyl chains with multiple ether linkages) result in low yield. The flexibility and steric bulk of the polyether chain may hinder effective coordination with the catalyst.

  **Examples:**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 8: Modifiers with Aldehyde Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acids Yield Low**

  **Description:** Modifiers possessing aldehyde groups (–CHO) adjacent to carboxylic acid groups yield low. The aldehyde group may engage in side reactions or interfere with catalyst coordination.

  **Examples:**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 9: Modifiers with Hydroxy-Substituted Aromatic Rings Connected by Medium-Length Chains Yield High**

  **Description:** Modifiers that have a hydroxy-substituted aromatic ring connected to a carboxylic acid via a medium-length aliphatic chain (four or more carbons) yield high. This structure balances hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, enhancing catalyst binding.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Shorter chain length reduces favorable interactions)

---

- **Rule 10: Modifiers Containing Perfluorinated Alkyl Chains Yield Low**

  **Description:** Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains yield low due to poor solubility and weak interactions within the catalyst environment. The high electronegativity of fluorine atoms reduces the compound's ability to coordinate effectively.

  **Examples:**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 11: Modifiers with Indole Rings Yield High**

  **Description:** Modifiers containing an indole ring yield high. The indole nitrogen and aromatic system enhance coordination and interaction with the metal catalyst.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

---

- **Rule 12: Modifiers with Rigid Aromatic Structures Containing Oxygen Yield High**

  **Description:** Modifiers with rigid aromatic structures that include oxygen atoms (e.g., benzofuran derivatives) yield high. The oxygen atoms in the fused rings provide additional coordination sites and stabilize the catalyst.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

---

- **Rule 13: Modifiers with Functional Groups That Interfere with Coordination Yield Low**

  **Description:** Modifiers possessing functional groups that can interfere with catalyst coordination (e.g., bulky acetamido groups, ketones adjacent to carboxylic acids) yield low due to steric hindrance or electronic effects that disrupt effective binding.

  **Examples:**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

---

- **Rule 14: Modifiers with Side Chains Capable of Chelation Yield High**

  **Description:** Modifiers whose side chains contain functional groups that can chelate the metal center (e.g., amino group positioned to coordinate alongside the carboxylate) yield high, enhancing catalyst stability and activity.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 15: Modifiers with Bulky or Sterically Hindered Groups Yield Low**

  **Description:** Modifiers with bulky substituents or groups that introduce steric hindrance near the coordination site yield low. Such groups can prevent effective interaction between the modifier and the catalyst.

  **Examples:**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**
- **Suggestion 1**: **Rule 1** - The SMARTS patterns for α-amino dicarboxylic acids do not account for side chain carboxylic acids. The current patterns only match α-amino acids with one carboxylic acid. To fix this, modify the pattern to include side chains with additional carboxylic acid groups. For example:
  - Replace the second pattern with `{'smarts': '[#6][CX3](=O)[OX1H1]', 'name': 'side_chain_carboxylic_acid', 'count': 2}` to match two carboxylic acids anywhere in the molecule.
  - Ensure the `count` parameter correctly counts multiple matches by summing over all matches in the molecule.
  
- **Suggestion 2**: **Rule 2** - The SMARTS pattern `[n][cX3](=O)[OX1H1]` is too restrictive and misses many nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly attached to carboxylic acids. Broaden the pattern to include various heterocycles:
  - Use a more general pattern like `{'smarts': '[nX2H0;r5,r6][c;r5,r6][cX3](=O)[OX1H1]', 'name': 'n_heterocycle_carboxylic_acid'}` to match different nitrogen heterocycles.
  
- **Suggestion 3**: **Rule 3** - The exclude patterns for terminal polar groups may not be effectively excluding modifiers with terminal hydroxy or amino groups. Modify the exclude patterns to ensure they match terminal positions:
  - Use `{'smarts': '[CH2][CH2][OH]', 'name': 'terminal_hydroxy'}` and `{'smarts': '[CH2][CH2][NH2]', 'name': 'terminal_amino'}` to target terminal polar groups.
  
- **Suggestion 4**: **Rule 9** - The SMARTS pattern for hydroxy-substituted aromatic rings connected by medium-length chains is too specific. Generalize it to allow flexibility in chain length:
  - Modify the pattern to `{'smarts': 'c1ccc(cc1O)[CX4][CH2]{3,}[CX3](=O)[OX1H1]', 'name': 'hydroxy_aromatic_medium_chain'}` to match chains of four or more carbons.
  
- **Suggestion 5**: **Rule 14** - The SMARTS pattern only matches side chains with exactly three methylene units before the amino group. Expand the pattern to allow variable chain lengths:
  - Use `{'smarts': '[CX4][CH2]{2,5}[NX3H2]', 'name': 'chelating_side_chain'}` to match side chains capable of chelation with varying lengths.
  
- **Suggestion 6**: **Rule 2** - The code does not account for tautomers where the nitrogen may not be explicitly bonded as in the SMARTS pattern. Include aromatic tautomeric forms:
  - Use Kekulé patterns or adjust aromaticity recognition in RDKit to ensure tautomers are matched.
  
- **Suggestion 7**: **General** - Ensure that the `exclude_patterns` logic correctly overrides `patterns` when an exclusion is matched. Currently, if an exclusion pattern is not properly matched, it may not prevent the rule from being applied.
  - Review the code logic to prioritize `exclude_patterns` before applying `patterns`.
  
- **Suggestion 8**: **Pattern Matching** - The `count` parameter in patterns may not be implemented correctly. It should sum all occurrences of the pattern in the molecule.
  - Update the code to sum over all matches using `len(matches)` and compare with the required `count`.
  
- **Suggestion 9**: **Rule 13** - The SMARTS patterns for functional groups interfering with coordination may not capture all relevant functional groups.
  - Expand the patterns to include other interfering groups mentioned in the description, such as ketones adjacent to carboxylic acids.
  
- **Suggestion 10**: **Testing and Validation** - Introduce unit tests using known compounds where the expected outcome is clear. This will help validate that the SMARTS patterns correctly match the intended structures.
  - For each rule, test the patterns against both positive and negative examples provided in the rules.
  
- **Suggestion 11**: **SMARTS Syntax** - Ensure that the SMARTS patterns use correct syntax and account for atom and bond properties accurately.
  - Review each SMARTS pattern for syntax errors and test them individually using RDKit to confirm they match intended substructures.
  
- **Suggestion 12**: **Documentation** - Add comments in the code explaining the logic behind each SMARTS pattern and how it corresponds to the natural language rule.
  - This will make it easier to understand and modify the patterns if needed.
  
- **Suggestion 13**: **Rule 6** - Clarify the exclusion of thiol groups on aromatic rings by adjusting the exclude pattern.
  - Use `{'smarts': '[c][SX2H]', 'name': 'thiol_on_aromatic'}` to ensure it correctly matches thiol groups on aromatic carbons.
  
- **Suggestion 14**: **Rule 10** - The SMARTS pattern `[CX4]([F])(F)F` may only match trifluoromethyl groups but not longer perfluorinated chains.
  - Modify the pattern to `{'smarts': '[CX4][CX2](F)(F)[CX2](F)(F)[CX3](F)(F)F', 'name': 'perfluoro_alkyl_chain'}` or use recursive SMARTS to match perfluorinated chains of variable length.
  
- **Suggestion 15**: **Performance Optimization** - Compile the SMARTS patterns outside of loops and reuse them to improve performance.
  - Move `Chem.MolFromSmarts` calls for each pattern to a separate initialization step before processing SMILES.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rules Based on Metrics**

**1. Comparison with Reference Metrics**

Upon reviewing the current and reference metrics, we observe the following:

- **Reference Metrics Averages** (Previous Iterations):
  - **Train Support**: ~0.1756
  - **Train Confidence**: ~0.5874
  - **Train Lift**: ~1.1304
  - **Train Leverage**: ~0.0124

- **Current Metrics Averages** (Current Iteration):
  - **Train Support**: ~0.0226
  - **Train Confidence**: ~0.5862
  - **Train Lift**: ~1.1719
  - **Train Leverage**: ~0.0046

**2. Observations**

- **Support**:
  - **Decrease in Train Support**: The average train support has significantly decreased from ~0.1756 to ~0.0226. This indicates that the current rules apply to a much smaller portion of the training data compared to previous iterations.
  
- **Confidence**:
  - **Consistency in Train Confidence**: The average train confidence remains relatively stable (~0.5862 current vs. ~0.5874 reference). This suggests that the likelihood of the rule predictions being correct, given the rule conditions, has not substantially changed.
  
- **Lift**:
  - **Increase in Train Lift**: The average train lift has increased from ~1.1304 to ~1.1719. A lift greater than 1 indicates that the rule is better at predicting the outcome than random chance. The improvement suggests a stronger association between the rule conditions and predictions in the current rules.
  
- **Leverage**:
  - **Decrease in Train Leverage**: The average train leverage has decreased from ~0.0124 to ~0.0046. Lower leverage values indicate that the additional support the rule receives over what would be expected by chance has diminished.

**3. Interpretation**

- **Specialization of Rules**: The decrease in support accompanied by a stable confidence and increased lift suggests that the current rules have become more specialized. They are accurately predicting outcomes but for a smaller subset of data.
  
- **Trade-off Between Support and Lift**: While lift has improved, indicating more significant predictive power where the rules apply, the low support means these rules are not widely applicable across the dataset.
  
- **Leverage Considerations**: The reduction in leverage implies that despite higher lift, the overall impact of the rules on the dataset is less pronounced due to their limited applicability.

**4. Local Minimum and Iteration Sufficiency**

- **Approaching a Local Minimum**: The current pattern indicates that further iterations may yield diminishing returns. The rules are honing in on very specific cases with high precision but low coverage.
  
- **Sufficiency of Iterations**: Given the minimal changes in confidence and the decreasing trend in support and leverage, it appears that the algorithm is approaching a point where additional iterations are unlikely to produce substantial improvements.

---

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

To enhance the performance and applicability of the current rules, consider the following strategies:

**1. Increase Rule Support by Generalizing Conditions**

- **Broaden Rule Parameters**: Re-evaluate the specificity of rule conditions. Generalize overly stringent conditions to encompass a wider range of data without significantly compromising confidence.
  
  - *Example*: For **Rule 1**, instead of focusing solely on α-amino dicarboxylic acids, consider including other amino acids with similar coordination properties.
  
- **Combine Similar Rules**: Merge rules that have overlapping features or outcomes to create more robust rules with higher support.

**2. Balance Between Confidence and Lift**

- **Optimize for Practical Significance**: Aim for a balance where rules have acceptable levels of confidence and lift while covering a meaningful portion of the dataset.
  
- **Accept Slightly Lower Lift for Higher Support**: A slight reduction in lift may be acceptable if it leads to a significant increase in support, thereby enhancing the rule's overall impact.

**3. Re-examine Low-Support Rules**

- **Prioritize High-Impact Rules**: Focus on rules that offer the best combination of support, confidence, and lift.
  
- **Eliminate or Revise Low-Support Rules**: Assess whether low-support rules can be modified to increase their applicability or consider removing them if they contribute minimally.

**4. Incorporate Additional Features**

- **Feature Engineering**: Introduce new descriptors or properties that may capture broader patterns in the data.
  
  - *Example*: Utilize molecular descriptors such as hydrophobicity, electronic properties, or steric factors that could influence catalytic activity.
  
- **Data Augmentation**: Expand the dataset with additional relevant examples to provide more instances where the rules can apply.

**5. Adjust Rule Generation Thresholds**

- **Modify Support and Confidence Thresholds**: Lowering the minimum thresholds during rule mining may allow the discovery of rules with higher support.
  
- **Experiment with Different Metrics**: Consider incorporating alternative metrics like conviction or interestingness measures to identify valuable rules that might be overlooked.

**6. Analyze Overfitting**

- **Cross-Validation**: Perform cross-validation to assess whether the current rules generalize well to unseen data or if they are overfitted to the training set.
  
- **Simplify Complex Rules**: Overly complex rules may fit the training data well but fail to generalize. Simplifying these rules may improve their performance on new data.

**7. Utilize Ensemble Methods**

- **Combine Multiple Models**: Employ ensemble techniques to aggregate the predictions of multiple rule sets, potentially capturing a broader range of patterns.
  
- **Benefit from Diverse Perspectives**: Different algorithms may detect different patterns; combining them can improve overall predictive performance.

**8. Incorporate Domain Knowledge**

- **Leverage Chemical Expertise**: Consult with chemists or domain experts to validate the rules and provide insights that may not be captured purely by data-driven methods.
  
- **Identify Key Functional Groups**: Emphasize functional groups or molecular features known to influence catalytic activity based on prior research.

---

**Conclusion**

The current rules exhibit high precision in predicting outcomes but lack broad applicability due to low support. By focusing on generalizing rule conditions, balancing confidence and support, and incorporating additional features and domain knowledge, we can improve the rules' performance. Adjusting thresholds and exploring alternative methods may also yield a more effective rule set. It appears that the current iteration has approached a local minimum, and strategic changes are necessary to achieve further significant improvements.

ML Commenter Message:
**Comments on Accuracies of the Validation and Training Sets:**

Upon analyzing the latest training results, we observe that the current 5-fold cross-validation accuracy has decreased to **45.71%**, which is significantly lower than the previous validation accuracies, which were consistently around **76%**. The test accuracies in previous iterations were **75%** and **62.5%**, indicating relatively stable performance. The substantial drop in validation accuracy suggests that the current set of rules may not be effectively capturing the underlying patterns in the data, leading to underfitting.

**Comparison with Previous Metrics:**

- **Previous Validation Accuracies:** ~76%
- **Previous Test Accuracies:** 62.5% - 75%
- **Current Validation Accuracy:** 45.71%

This decline in performance indicates that the modifications made to the rules in the current iteration have reduced the model's ability to generalize from the training data to unseen data. It suggests that the current rules may not be adequately representing the features that determine the catalyst's loading behavior.

---

**Analysis Based on SHAP Values Calculated on the Validation Set:**

The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values provide insights into how each feature (rule) contributes to the model's predictions for each molecule. Analyzing the SHAP values helps identify rules that may be contributing to incorrect predictions.

**Key Observations:**

1. **Incorrect Predictions with High SHAP Values:**

   - **Underestimated Loadings (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**
     - **Molecules:**
       - *C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N*
       - *C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O*
       - *C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)N*
       - *C([C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](C(=O)O)O)O)O)O)O*

     - **Rules with Most Negative SHAP Values:**
       - **Rule 6:** Negative contribution to high loading prediction.
       - **Rule 11:** Negative contribution to high loading prediction.

   - **Overestimated Loadings (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**

     - **Molecules:**
       - *C1=CC(=CC=C1C=O)C(=O)O*
       - *C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O*
       - *C1=CC(=CC=C1CCC(=O)O)O*

     - **Rules with Most Positive SHAP Values:**
       - **Rule 10:** Positive contribution to high loading prediction.
       - **Rule 14:** Positive contribution to high loading prediction.

2. **Consistent Misclassifications:**

   - Several molecules are consistently misclassified across the validation set, suggesting that certain rules are systematically contributing to incorrect predictions.

**Identification of Potentially Problematic Rules:**

- **Rule 6:** Modifiers with thiol groups on aliphatic chains yield high; thiol groups on aromatic rings yield low.

  - **Issue:** Negative SHAP values for molecules that are underpredicted (predicted low when actual is high).
  - **Implication:** Rule 6 may be too restrictive or not capturing the necessary structural nuances.

- **Rule 10:** Modifiers containing perfluorinated alkyl chains yield low.

  - **Issue:** Positive SHAP values in cases of overprediction (predicted high when actual is low).
  - **Implication:** Rule 10 may be overgeneralizing or misapplied to certain structures lacking perfluorinated chains.

- **Rule 11:** Modifiers with indole rings yield high.

  - **Issue:** Negative SHAP values contributing to underprediction.
  - **Implication:** Rule 11 may need refinement to better capture the influence of indole rings.

- **Rule 14:** Modifiers with side chains capable of chelation yield high.

  - **Issue:** Positive SHAP values in overpredicted loadings.
  - **Implication:** Rule 14 may be too broadly defined, capturing modifiers that do not effectively chelate in practice.

---

**Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting:**

The decreased validation accuracy suggests **underfitting**. The model, based on the current rules, is unable to capture the complexity of the data, leading to poor performance on both the training and validation sets.

**Indicators of Underfitting:**

- Low accuracy on validation data.
- No significant difference between training and validation accuracies (although training accuracy is not provided, the low validation accuracy hints at underfitting).
- Simplistic rules that may not capture the intricate relationships in the data.

---

**Interpretation of Accuracy Improvements and SHAP Analysis:**

Given the decline in accuracy, the current set of rules does not improve the model's predictive capability. The SHAP analysis indicates that certain rules are contributing negatively to the correct prediction of high or low catalyst loadings.

**Opportunities for Improvement:**

- **Refine Problematic Rules:** Adjust or redefine rules that consistently contribute to incorrect predictions as indicated by the SHAP values.

- **Enhance Rule Specificity:** Increase the specificity of rules to capture subtle structural features that influence catalyst loading.

- **Incorporate Additional Features:** Consider additional chemical descriptors or structural features that may improve the model's ability to differentiate between high and low loadings.

---

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are proposed to improve the current rules:

1. **Refinement of Rule 6:**

   - **Issue:** Rule 6 contributes negatively to the prediction of molecules that are experimentally high but predicted as low.
   - **Action:**
     - **Separate Thiol Groups:** Distinguish between thiol groups in different positions or contexts.
     - **Adjust Scope:** Modify the rule to account for thiol groups that may not significantly impact coordination due to steric hindrance or electronic effects.
     - **Example Refinement:**
       - **Original:** Thiol groups on aliphatic chains yield high.
       - **Refined:** Aliphatic thiol groups adjacent to or near the carboxylic acid enhance coordination and yield high, except when steric hindrance is present.

2. **Modification of Rule 10:**

   - **Issue:** Rule 10 is contributing to overprediction of high loading in molecules without perfluorinated chains.
   - **Action:**
     - **Clarify Applicability:** Ensure that Rule 10 is only applied to compounds with perfluorinated alkyl chains.
     - **Implement Conditional Application:** Add conditions to prevent the rule from affecting molecules without perfluorinated groups.

3. **Reevaluation of Rule 11:**

   - **Issue:** Rule 11's negative SHAP values in cases of underprediction suggest it may not be capturing the intended effect.
   - **Action:**
     - **Expand Scope:** Consider other heteroaromatic systems similar to indole that may impact catalyst loading.
     - **Incorporate Substituent Effects:** Account for substituents on the indole ring that may influence coordination.

4. **Adjustment of Rule 14:**

   - **Issue:** Rule 14 contributes to overprediction when experimental values are low.
   - **Action:**
     - **Define Chelation Capacity:** Specify the functional groups and their positions that are most effective for chelation.
     - **Exclude Detrimental Groups:** Identify side chains that, despite having potential chelating groups, do not contribute to high yield due to steric or electronic factors.

5. **Introduce New Rules or Modify Existing Ones:**

   - **Consider Electronic Effects:**
     - **Observation:** Electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups significantly impact coordination.
     - **Action:** Develop rules that account for the electronic nature of substituents on aromatic rings related to catalyst interactions.

   - **Inclusion of Steric Factors:**
     - **Observation:** Bulky groups near coordination sites may hinder catalyst binding.
     - **Action:** Add rules that penalize modifiers with steric hindrance near key functional groups.

6. **Improve Rule Generalization:**

   - **Prevent Overfitting to Specific Molecules:**
     - **Observation:** Some rules may be too narrowly defined, capturing only specific examples.
     - **Action:** Ensure that rules are general enough to apply to a broader range of molecules while maintaining specificity.

7. **Incorporate Additional Data and Validation:**

   - **Enhance Dataset Diversity:**
     - **Observation:** A limited dataset may hinder the model's ability to learn complex patterns.
     - **Action:** Incorporate more molecule examples to improve the model's learning capacity.

   - **Cross-Validation Techniques:**
     - **Observation:** Use more robust validation methods to assess model performance.
     - **Action:** Apply techniques like k-fold cross-validation with different splits to ensure consistent performance.

---

**Conclusion:**

The current set of rules, as evidenced by the decreased validation accuracy and SHAP analysis, is not effectively capturing the necessary features to predict catalyst loading accurately. By refining problematic rules, adjusting their scope and applicability, and incorporating additional features and considerations, we can improve the model's performance.

Implementing these recommendations should lead to:

- **Improved Model Accuracy:** By addressing underfitting and capturing more relevant features.
- **Enhanced Rule Effectiveness:** Through the refinement of existing rules and introduction of new ones.
- **Better Generalization:** Reducing overfitting and underfitting will allow the model to perform better on unseen data.

Continuous iteration and validation will be essential in refining the rules and improving the model's predictive capabilities. Collaboration and integration of domain expertise in chemistry will further aid in the development of more accurate and reliable rules.

**Summary of Discussions and Suggestions for Optimizing Current Rules**

Based on the analysis of the current rules, metrics, and performance, several key points have emerged that highlight areas for improvement:

1. **Decrease in Rule Support with Stable Confidence**:
   - The current rules exhibit high precision (confidence remains stable), but they apply to a smaller portion of the dataset (support has decreased).
   - The increased lift indicates strong associations where the rules apply, but the low support limits their overall impact.

2. **Underfitting Indicated by Declined Validation Accuracy**:
   - The validation accuracy has significantly dropped to **45.71%**, suggesting that the current rules are not capturing the complexity of the data.
   - The SHAP analysis highlights that certain rules are contributing negatively to prediction accuracy, indicating a need for refinement.

3. **Identification of Problematic Rules**:
   - **Rule 6** (Modifiers with thiol groups): Contributing to underprediction of high-yield modifiers.
   - **Rule 10** (Modifiers with perfluorinated chains): Misapplied to molecules without perfluorinated groups, leading to overprediction.
   - **Rule 11** (Modifiers with indole rings): Not effectively capturing the influence of indole rings.
   - **Rule 14** (Modifiers capable of chelation): Overgeneralized, contributing to overprediction in some cases.

**Directions to Optimize Current Rules**

To enhance the performance and applicability of the rules without overfitting, the following suggestions are proposed:

1. **Refine and Generalize Rule Conditions**:
   - **Rule 1**: Modify the SMARTS patterns to include side chains with additional carboxylic acid groups, ensuring that α-amino dicarboxylic acids are correctly identified.
     - **Action**: Adjust the pattern to account for multiple carboxylic acids, potentially using `{'smarts': '[#6][CX3](=O)[OX1H1]', 'name': 'carboxylic_acid', 'count': 2}`.

   - **Rule 2**: Broaden the SMARTS pattern to include various nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly attached to carboxylic acids.
     - **Action**: Use a more general pattern such as `{'smarts': '[nX2H0;r5,r6][c;r5,r6][CX3](=O)[OX1H1]', 'name': 'n_heterocycle_carboxylic_acid'}` to match different heterocycles.

2. **Enhance Exclusion Patterns and Logic**:
   - **Rule 3**: Improve the exclude patterns to effectively eliminate modifiers with terminal hydroxy or amino groups.
     - **Action**: Adjust the patterns to `{'smarts': '[CH2][CH2][OH]', 'name': 'terminal_hydroxy'}` and `{'smarts': '[CH2][CH2][NH2]', 'name': 'terminal_amino'}`.
   - **Exclude Patterns Priority**: Ensure that the code logic prioritizes `exclude_patterns` before applying `patterns`, so that exclusions correctly override inclusions.

3. **Adjust Rule Specificity and Scope**:
   - **Rule 9**: Generalize the pattern for hydroxy-substituted aromatic rings connected by medium-length chains to allow for variable chain lengths.
     - **Action**: Use `{'smarts': 'c1ccc(cc1O)[CX4][CH2]{3,}[CX3](=O)[OX1H1]', 'name': 'hydroxy_aromatic_medium_chain'}`.

   - **Rule 14**: Expand the SMARTS pattern to include side chains of varying lengths capable of chelation.
     - **Action**: Modify the pattern to `{'smarts': '[CX4][CH2]{2,5}[NX3H2]', 'name': 'chelating_side_chain'}`.

4. **Refine Problematic Rules Identified by SHAP Analysis**:
   - **Rule 6**:
     - **Issue**: Contributing to underprediction of high-yield modifiers.
     - **Action**: Clarify the exclusion of thiol groups on aromatic rings by refining the exclude pattern, e.g., `{'smarts': '[c][SX2H]', 'name': 'thiol_on_aromatic'}`.
   - **Rule 10**:
     - **Issue**: Misapplied to molecules without perfluorinated chains.
     - **Action**: Adjust the pattern to accurately match perfluorinated chains of varying lengths, possibly using recursive SMARTS.
   - **Rule 11**:
     - **Issue**: Not effectively capturing indole influence.
     - **Action**: Expand the pattern to capture indole rings with various substitutions, ensuring that electronic effects are considered.
   - **Rule 14**:
     - **Issue**: Overgeneralized, leading to overprediction.
     - **Action**: Specify functional groups and positions that are most effective for chelation, and exclude side chains that do not contribute positively.

5. **Ensure Correct Implementation of Patterns**:
   - Verify that the `count` parameter correctly sums all occurrences of a pattern in a molecule.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Refine Rule 1** by adjusting the SMARTS pattern to account for multiple carboxylic acid groups in α-amino dicarboxylic acids. Use the pattern `[#6][CX3](=O)[OX1H1]` with a `count` parameter of **2** to ensure the modifier contains at least two carboxylic acid groups. This will correctly identify modifiers like aspartic acid and glutamic acid.

- **Advice 2**: **Broaden Rule 2** by using a more general SMARTS pattern to include various nitrogen-containing aromatic heterocycles directly attached to carboxylic acids. Implement the pattern `[nX2H0;r5,r6][c;r5,r6][CX3](=O)[OX1H1]` to match modifiers like niacin, 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, and others with nitrogen heterocycles directly bonded to a carboxylic acid group.

- **Advice 3**: **Enhance Rule 3** by adding precise exclude patterns to eliminate modifiers with terminal polar groups. Use exclude patterns such as `{'smarts': '[CH2][CH2][OH]', 'name': 'terminal_hydroxy'}` for hydroxy groups and `{'smarts': '[CH2][CH2][NH2]', 'name': 'terminal_amino'}` for amino groups. Ensure the code prioritizes these exclude patterns before inclusion patterns to prevent modifiers like 7-aminoheptanoic acid from being incorrectly classified.

- **Advice 4**: **Generalize Rule 9** to allow variable chain lengths in hydroxy-substituted aromatic rings connected by aliphatic chains. Update the SMARTS pattern to `c1ccc(cc1O)[CX4][CH2]{3,}[CX3](=O)[OX1H1]` to match modifiers with hydroxyphenyl groups linked by chains of four or more carbons, such as 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Advice 5**: **Expand Rule 14** by modifying the SMARTS pattern to capture side chains capable of chelation over a range of lengths. Use the pattern `[CX4][CH2]{2,5}[NX3H2]` to include modifiers where an amino group is positioned appropriately to chelate the metal center, covering compounds like 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Advice 6**: **Refine Rule 6** to clarify the exclusion of thiol groups on aromatic rings. Adjust the exclude pattern to `{'smarts': '[c][SX2H]', 'name': 'thiol_on_aromatic'}` to specifically target thiol groups attached to aromatic carbons, ensuring that aliphatic thiol-containing modifiers like 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid are correctly identified as high-yield.

- **Advice 7**: **Correct Rule 10** by refining the SMARTS pattern to accurately match perfluorinated alkyl chains. Use a pattern like `[*][C](F)(F)F` to detect trifluoromethyl groups, and consider recursive patterns for longer perfluorinated chains. This prevents the misclassification of compounds without perfluorinated groups.

- **Advice 8**: **Enhance Rule 11** by expanding the SMARTS pattern to effectively capture indole rings, including substituted indoles. Use the pattern `c1c[nH]c2c1cccc2` to match the indole core structure, ensuring modifiers like tryptophan are correctly identified as high-yield.

- **Advice 9**: **Specify Rule 14** further to prevent overprediction. Focus on functional groups and positions most effective for chelation by updating the SMARTS pattern to include specific chelating motifs, such as `O=C[CX4][CH2][CH2][NX3H2]`, and add exclude patterns for side chains that do not enhance chelation.

- **Advice 10**: **Verify SMARTS Patterns Implementation** by individually testing each pattern with known compounds. Ensure that each SMARTS pattern matches the intended substructures accurately and the `count` parameter sums all occurrences correctly within a molecule.

- **Advice 11**: **Implement Unit Tests** using molecules from the dataset to validate that the SMARTS patterns correctly classify modifiers according to their yield. This will help identify any misclassifications and refine the patterns accordingly.

- **Advice 12**: **Optimize Code Performance** by compiling all SMARTS patterns outside of any loops. This avoids redundant compilations and improves the efficiency of the code during pattern matching.

- **Advice 13**: **Document Patterns and Logic** by adding comments and explanations in the code for each SMARTS pattern. Clearly describe the purpose and the chemical features each pattern is intended to match, aiding future maintenance and understanding.

- **Advice 14**: **Incorporate Domain Expertise** by collaborating with chemists to review and validate the rules. Utilize their insights to identify key functional groups and molecular features that influence reaction yield, ensuring the rules are grounded in solid chemical knowledge.

- **Advice 15**: **Enhance Feature Engineering** by considering additional molecular descriptors such as hydrophobicity (e.g., LogP), electronic properties (e.g., Hammett constants), and steric factors. Including these descriptors can help capture the complexity of the dataset and improve prediction accuracy without overfitting.

The **complexity** lies in considering the number and position of hydroxyl groups. **Coverage** is strong with high-yield examples like gluconic acid (index 9) and low-yield examples like 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid (index 29). The rule effectively balances complexity and data support.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** clearly states that modifiers with aldehyde groups adjacent to carboxylic acids yield low. The **property insight** about potential side reactions and coordination interference is plausible. **Complexity** is appropriate, focusing on specific functional group adjacency. **Coverage** is adequate with examples like 4-formylbenzoic acid (index 20) and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (index 19). The rule is well-supported and justified.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** is **clear** in stating that modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains yield low due to poor solubility and weak interactions. The **property insight** is reasonable. However, **coverage** is limited to a single data point (index 14). While the rule is valid, the low coverage slightly reduces its robustness.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** clearly indicates that modifiers with long polyether chains yield low. The **property insight** about steric hindrance affecting coordination is sound. The **complexity** considers chain length and functional group presence. **Coverage** includes low-yield examples like 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid (index 11) and 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid (index 32). The rule has a good balance between complexity and data support.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** is **clear** in defining modifiers with aromatic rings connected via medium-length aliphatic chains yielding high. The **property insight** about balancing hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions is logical. The **complexity** involves chain length and aromatic presence. **Coverage** is adequate with high-yield examples like 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid (index 7) and low-yield examples like 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (index 30). The rule is well-balanced.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** suggests that modifiers with functional groups interfering with coordination yield low. While **clarity** is acceptable, the rule is somewhat broad. The **property insight** regarding steric and electronic interference is valid. **Complexity** involves multiple functional groups. **Coverage** includes low-yield examples like (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (index 33). The rule is supported but could benefit from more specificity.

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** overlaps with Rule 4, stating that modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups on aromatic rings yield high. The **clarity** and **property insight** are sound. **Coverage** includes examples like 4-nitrobenzoic acid (index 21). However, the redundancy with Rule 4 suggests consolidation could improve overall rule efficiency.

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13** reiterates aspects of Rule 3, focusing on nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to carboxylic acids yielding high. The **clarity** and **property insight** remain strong, but redundancy indicates that combining this rule with Rule 3 might enhance conciseness.

- **Comment 14**: **Rule 14** is **clear** in stating that modifiers with oxygen-containing fused aromatic rings yield high. The **property insight** about additional coordination sites is valid. However, **coverage** is limited to a single data point (index 17), reducing the rule's robustness. More data points would strengthen this rule.

- **Comment 15**: **Rule 15** is **clear**, indicating that α-amino monocarboxylic acids with hydrophobic side chains yield low, except for indole rings. The **property insight** about steric hindrance and exceptional coordination ability of indole rings is logical. The **complexity** involves both the amino acid backbone and side-chain variations. **Coverage** is adequate with examples like phenylalanine yielding low (index 13) and tryptophan yielding high (index 15). The rule balances complexity with supportive data.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1: Modifiers That Are α-Amino Dicarboxylic Acids Yield High**

  **Description:** Modifiers that are α-amino acids containing two carboxylic acid groups (dicarboxylic acids) yield high. The presence of both an amino group and two carboxylate groups facilitates strong coordination with the metal catalyst, enhancing its stability and activity.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine) *(Single carboxylic acid group)*

---

- **Rule 2: Straight-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Without Terminal Polar Groups Yield High; Terminal Polar Groups Decrease Yield**

  **Description:** Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids yield high when they have medium-length chains (typically 6–8 carbons) without additional polar functional groups. The introduction of terminal polar groups (e.g., amino, hydroxy) on the chain decreases the yield due to altered solubility and coordination dynamics.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **Octanoic acid**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 3: Modifiers with Carboxylic Acid Directly Attached to Nitrogen-Containing Heterocycles Yield High**

  **Description:** Modifiers where a carboxylic acid group is directly attached to a nitrogen-containing aromatic heterocycle yield high. The nitrogen atom enhances coordination with the metal catalyst, improving catalytic activity.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Niacin)
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(Pyridine ring not directly bonded to carboxyl group)*

---

- **Rule 4: Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing or Coordinating Groups Yield High**

  **Description:** Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids yield high when the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group or capable of coordinating with the metal catalyst (e.g., nitro, amino, bromomethyl groups). These groups enhance electronic interactions and coordination.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(Methyl group does not enhance coordination)*
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(Aldehyde group may interfere with coordination)*

---

- **Rule 5: Modifiers with Thiol Groups on Aliphatic Chains Yield High; Thiol Groups on Aromatic Rings Yield Low**

  **Description:** Modifiers featuring thiol (–SH) groups on aliphatic chains yield high due to strong coordination via sulfur atoms. When the thiol group is attached to an aromatic ring, the yield is low, possibly due to reduced availability of the sulfur atom for effective coordination.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 6: Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups on Aliphatic Chains Yield High**

  **Description:** Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups yield high. The hydroxyl groups improve solubility and provide additional coordination sites with the metal catalyst, enhancing reactivity.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(Single hydroxyl group at terminal position)*

---

- **Rule 7: Modifiers with Aldehyde Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acids Yield Low**

  **Description:** Modifiers possessing aldehyde groups (–CHO) adjacent to carboxylic acid groups yield low. The aldehyde group may engage in side reactions or interfere with metal coordination, reducing catalytic efficiency.

  **Examples:**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 8: Modifiers Containing Perfluorinated Alkyl Chains Yield Low**

  **Description:** Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains yield low due to poor solubility in the reaction medium and weak interactions within the catalyst environment. The high electronegativity of fluorine atoms reduces the compound's ability to coordinate effectively.

  **Examples:**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 9: Modifiers with Long Polyether Chains Yield Low**

  **Description:** Modifiers containing long polyether chains (alkyl chains with multiple ether linkages) result in low yield. The flexibility and steric bulk of the polyether chain may hinder effective coordination with the metal catalyst, reducing its activity.

  **Examples:**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 10: Modifiers with Aromatic Rings Connected via Medium-Length Aliphatic Chains Yield High**

  **Description:** Modifiers that have an aromatic ring connected to a carboxylic acid via a medium-length aliphatic chain (four or more carbons) yield high. This structure balances hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, enhancing binding with the catalyst.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** *(Shorter chain length reduces favorable interactions)*

---

- **Rule 11: Modifiers with Functional Groups That Can Interfere with Coordination Yield Low**

  **Description:** Modifiers possessing functional groups that may interfere with catalyst coordination (e.g., bulky acetamido groups, amide linkages) yield low due to steric hindrance or electronic effects that disrupt effective binding.

  **Examples:**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

---

- **Rule 12: Modifiers with Electron-Withdrawing Groups on Aromatic Rings Yield High**

  **Description:** Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, keto) on aromatic rings yield high. These groups enhance the electron-deficient nature of the aromatic ring, improving coordination with the metal catalyst.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

---

- **Rule 13: Modifiers Containing Nitrogen Heterocycles Directly Attached to Carboxylic Acids Yield High**

  **Description:** Modifiers featuring nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly attached to carboxylic acids yield high due to the ability of the nitrogen atom to coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(Carboxylic acid not directly attached to heterocycle)*

---

- **Rule 14: Modifiers with Oxygen-Containing Fused Aromatic Rings Yield High**

  **Description:** Modifiers with oxygen-containing fused aromatic rings, such as benzofurans, yield high. The oxygen atoms in the fused rings provide additional coordination sites and stabilize the metal catalyst.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

---

- **Rule 15: Modifiers That Are α-Amino Monocarboxylic Acids with Hydrophobic Side Chains Yield Low; Exception for Indole Rings**

  **Description:** Modifiers that are α-amino monocarboxylic acids with large hydrophobic side chains yield low due to steric hindrance and reduced solubility. An exception exists for side chains capable of additional coordination, such as indole rings.

  **Examples:**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)
  - **High Yield:**
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan) *(Indole ring enhances coordination)*

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: *Correct the SMARTS pattern for Rule 1 to specifically match α-amino dicarboxylic acids.*
  
  - **Issue**: The current SMARTS patterns for Rule 1 are too broad and match any molecule containing an amino group and any carboxylic acid group, leading to all molecules being marked as matches for Rule 1.
  
  - **Improvement**: Refine the SMARTS pattern to ensure that it captures molecules where an amino group is attached to the α-carbon, which is bound to a carboxylic acid group, and there is a second carboxylic acid group elsewhere in the molecule.

    - **Suggested SMARTS**: Use a pattern that specifies an α-amino acid with a side-chain carboxylic acid group. For example:
      ```
      [NX3;H2][CH;X4](C(=O)[OX1H])[CH2][CX3](=O)[OX1H]
      ```
      This pattern represents an amino group connected to a carbon (α-carbon) bearing a carboxylic acid, followed by a chain leading to a second carboxylic acid group.

- **Suggestion 2**: *Review and refine the SMARTS patterns for other rules to ensure they accurately represent the natural language descriptions.*
  
  - **Issue**: Some SMARTS patterns may not fully capture the nuances of the rules, leading to incorrect or missed matches in the feature matrix.
  
  - **Improvement**: For each rule:

  - **Rule 2**:
    - **Issue**: The pattern `[CX4]([CX4H2]){4,6}[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` does not correctly specify medium-length straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without terminal polar groups.
    - **Improvement**: Adjust the SMARTS to match alkyl chains of 6–8 carbons without polar terminal groups.
      - **Suggested SMARTS**:
        ```
        CCCCCCC(=O)[OX1H]
        ```
        Modify the pattern to match chains of specific lengths and ensure no terminal polar groups are present.

  - **Rule 3**:
    - **Issue**: The pattern `[n][c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` may not match all nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly attached to carboxylic acids.
    - **Improvement**: Generalize the pattern to include various nitrogen heterocycles.
      - **Suggested SMARTS**:
        ```
        [nH0;R][c;R][CX3](=O)[OX1H]
        ```
        This pattern ensures the carboxylic acid is directly attached to the heterocycle ring.

  - **Rule 4**:
    - **Issue**: The current patterns for electron-withdrawing and coordinating groups may not encompass all relevant substituents.
    - **Improvement**: Expand the patterns to include additional electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., cyano) and coordinating groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino).
      - **Suggested SMARTS**:
        ```
        c1ccc(cc1)[CX3](=O)[OX1H]
        ```
        For para-substitution:
        ```
        c1cc([*])ccc1C(=O)O
        ```
        Where `[*]` represents electron-withdrawing or coordinating groups.

- **Suggestion 3**: *Ensure that overlapping rules are distinctly coded to prevent conflicting assignments.*
  
  - **Issue**: Some molecules may match multiple rules with conflicting predictions (e.g., a molecule matching both a high-yield and a low-yield rule).
  
  - **Improvement**: Introduce a hierarchy or priority system in the code to resolve conflicts, or adjust the rules to minimize overlaps.

- **Suggestion 4**: *Validate the feature matrix by cross-referencing with known examples.*
  
  - **Issue**: The current feature matrix may not accurately reflect the expected outcomes based on documented examples.
  
  - **Improvement**: For each example provided in the rules (both high and low yield), confirm that the SMARTS patterns correctly identify them, and adjust the patterns if discrepancies are found.

- **Suggestion 5**: *Include error handling for molecules that cannot be parsed or produce unexpected results.*
  
  - **Issue**: Molecules that fail to parse or match incorrectly could skew the feature matrix.
  
  - **Improvement**: Implement checks to flag problematic SMILES strings and exclude or correct them as necessary.

- **Suggestion 6**: *Provide detailed documentation for each SMARTS pattern used.*
  
  - **Issue**: Without clear documentation, it's challenging to verify that the SMARTS patterns align with the intended chemical features.
  
  - **Improvement**: Comment the code with explanations of each SMARTS pattern, including the chemical features they are intended to match.

- **Suggestion 7**: *Test the SMARTS patterns individually using a chemical informatics tool.*
  
  - **Issue**: Without testing, it's uncertain whether the patterns function as intended.
  
  - **Improvement**: Use software like RDKit to test each SMARTS pattern against known molecules to ensure accurate matching.

- **Suggestion 8**: *Consider the stereochemistry in the SMARTS patterns when relevant.*
  
  - **Issue**: Stereochemistry can affect the activity and yield, and the current patterns may not account for it.
  
  - **Improvement**: Include stereochemical specifications in the SMARTS patterns if stereochemistry is a factor in the rule.

- **Suggestion 9**: *Adjust the pattern for Rule 15 to accurately capture the exception for indole rings.*
  
  - **Issue**: The current pattern for the indole side chain may be too restrictive or incorrect.
  
  - **Improvement**: Update the SMARTS to correctly identify tryptophan-like structures.
    - **Suggested SMARTS**:
      ```
      [NX3;H2][CH;X4]([CX3](=O)[OX1H])[CH2][c]1c[nH]c2ccccc12
      ```
      This pattern represents an α-amino acid with an indole side chain.

- **Suggestion 10**: *Reassess the predictions assigned to each rule for consistency with the natural language descriptions.*
  
  - **Issue**: Some rules may have incorrect prediction values assigned (e.g., Rule 13 appears twice with different names).
  
  - **Improvement**: Ensure that each rule is uniquely identified and that the prediction values (1 or -1) align with the intended outcomes.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1: Modifiers That Are α-Amino Dicarboxylic Acids Yield High**

  **Description:** Modifiers that are α-amino acids containing two carboxylic acid groups (dicarboxylic acids) yield high. The presence of both an amino group and two carboxylate groups facilitates strong coordination with the metal catalyst, enhancing its stability and activity.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine) *(Single carboxylic acid group)*

---

- **Rule 2: Straight-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Without Terminal Polar Groups Yield High; Terminal Polar Groups Decrease Yield**

  **Description:** Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids yield high when they have medium-length chains (typically 6–8 carbons) without additional polar functional groups. The introduction of terminal polar groups (e.g., amino, hydroxy) on the chain decreases the yield due to altered solubility and coordination dynamics.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **Octanoic acid**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 3: Modifiers with Carboxylic Acid Directly Attached to Nitrogen-Containing Heterocycles Yield High**

  **Description:** Modifiers where a carboxylic acid group is directly attached to a nitrogen-containing aromatic heterocycle yield high. The nitrogen atom enhances coordination with the metal catalyst, improving catalytic activity.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Niacin)
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(Pyridine ring not directly bonded to carboxyl group)*

---

- **Rule 4: Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing or Coordinating Groups Yield High**

  **Description:** Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids yield high when the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group or capable of coordinating with the metal catalyst (e.g., nitro, amino, bromomethyl groups). These groups enhance electronic interactions and coordination.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(Methyl group does not enhance coordination)*
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(Aldehyde group may interfere with coordination)*

---

- **Rule 5: Modifiers with Thiol Groups on Aliphatic Chains Yield High; Thiol Groups on Aromatic Rings Yield Low**

  **Description:** Modifiers featuring thiol (–SH) groups on aliphatic chains yield high due to strong coordination via sulfur atoms. When the thiol group is attached to an aromatic ring, the yield is low, possibly due to reduced availability of the sulfur atom for effective coordination.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 6: Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups on Aliphatic Chains Yield High**

  **Description:** Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups yield high. The hydroxyl groups improve solubility and provide additional coordination sites with the metal catalyst, enhancing reactivity.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(Single hydroxyl group at terminal position)*

---

- **Rule 7: Modifiers with Aldehyde Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acids Yield Low**

  **Description:** Modifiers possessing aldehyde groups (–CHO) adjacent to carboxylic acid groups yield low. The aldehyde group may engage in side reactions or interfere with metal coordination, reducing catalytic efficiency.

  **Examples:**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 8: Modifiers Containing Perfluorinated Alkyl Chains Yield Low**

  **Description:** Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains yield low due to poor solubility in the reaction medium and weak interactions within the catalyst environment. The high electronegativity of fluorine atoms reduces the compound's ability to coordinate effectively.

  **Examples:**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 9: Modifiers with Long Polyether Chains Yield Low**

  **Description:** Modifiers containing long polyether chains (alkyl chains with multiple ether linkages) result in low yield. The flexibility and steric bulk of the polyether chain may hinder effective coordination with the metal catalyst, reducing its activity.

  **Examples:**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 10: Modifiers with Aromatic Rings Connected via Medium-Length Aliphatic Chains Yield High**

  **Description:** Modifiers that have an aromatic ring connected to a carboxylic acid via a medium-length aliphatic chain (four or more carbons) yield high. This structure balances hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, enhancing binding with the catalyst.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** *(Shorter chain length reduces favorable interactions)*

---

- **Rule 11: Modifiers with Functional Groups That Can Interfere with Coordination Yield Low**

  **Description:** Modifiers possessing functional groups that may interfere with catalyst coordination (e.g., bulky acetamido groups, amide linkages) yield low due to steric hindrance or electronic effects that disrupt effective binding.

  **Examples:**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

---

- **Rule 12: Modifiers with Electron-Withdrawing Groups on Aromatic Rings Yield High**

  **Description:** Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, keto) on aromatic rings yield high. These groups enhance the electron-deficient nature of the aromatic ring, improving coordination with the metal catalyst.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

---

- **Rule 13: Modifiers Containing Nitrogen Heterocycles Directly Attached to Carboxylic Acids Yield High**

  **Description:** Modifiers featuring nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly attached to carboxylic acids yield high due to the ability of the nitrogen atom to coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(Carboxylic acid not directly attached to heterocycle)*

---

- **Rule 14: Modifiers with Oxygen-Containing Fused Aromatic Rings Yield High**

  **Description:** Modifiers with oxygen-containing fused aromatic rings, such as benzofurans, yield high. The oxygen atoms in the fused rings provide additional coordination sites and stabilize the metal catalyst.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

---

- **Rule 15: Modifiers That Are α-Amino Monocarboxylic Acids with Hydrophobic Side Chains Yield Low; Exception for Indole Rings**

  **Description:** Modifiers that are α-amino monocarboxylic acids with large hydrophobic side chains yield low due to steric hindrance and reduced solubility. An exception exists for side chains capable of additional coordination, such as indole rings.

  **Examples:**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)
  - **High Yield:**
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan) *(Indole ring enhances coordination)*

- **Suggestion 1**: *Rule 1 - α-Amino Dicarboxylic Acids Yield High*

  The current SMARTS pattern for Rule 1 is too specific and only matches α-amino acids with exactly one CH₂ unit between the α-carbon and the side chain carboxylic acid, such as aspartic acid. This excludes glutamic acid, which has two CH₂ units. To correctly match all α-amino dicarboxylic acids (e.g., aspartic acid and glutamic acid), modify the SMARTS pattern to allow for one or more CH₂ units in the side chain:

  ```python
  alpha_amino_dicarboxylic_acid = '[NX3;H2][CHX4](C(=O)[OX1H])[CH2]{1,2}[CX3](=O)[OX1H]'
  ```

  This pattern allows for 1 or 2 CH₂ units between the α-carbon and the side-chain carboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 2**: *Rule 2 - Straight-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Without Terminal Polar Groups Yield High; Terminal Polar Groups Decrease Yield*

  The current SMARTS patterns for Rule 2 High and Rule 2 Low incorrectly represent the molecules described in the rule. Specifically:

  - For **Rule 2 High**:

    The pattern `[CH3][CH2]{4,6}[CX3](=O)[OX1H]` matches aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 6 to 8 carbons, which is appropriate. However, it doesn't exclude molecules with terminal polar groups at the opposite end from the carboxylic acid.

  - For **Rule 2 Low**:

    The pattern `[CH3][CH2]{4,6}[CX3](=O)[OX1H][CX4][OX2H1,NX3;H2,H1]` incorrectly places the terminal polar group after the carboxylic acid carbon, which doesn't match the described structures.

  *Suggestions to improve the patterns*:

  - **Rule 2 High**:

    Ensure that molecules without terminal polar groups are matched by excluding compounds with functional groups like amino or hydroxy at the end opposite to the carboxylic acid. One way is to check that there are no polar substituents on the alkyl chain:

    ```python
    aliphatic_carboxylic_acid = '[CH3][CH2]{4,6}[CX3](=O)[OX1H]'  # As is
    ```

    To ensure that terminal polar groups are not present, we need to verify that the chain does not contain nitrogen or oxygen atoms other than in the carboxylic acid:

    ```python
    aliphatic_no_polar = '[CH3][CH2]{4,6}[CX3](=O)[OX1H]'  
    ```

    Additionally, use an exclusion pattern to ensure no heteroatoms on the chain:

    ```python
    aliphatic_no_polar = '[CH3][CH2]{4,6}[CX3](=O)[OX1H]'  # As above, but ensure no heteroatoms in the chain
    ```

  - **Rule 2 Low**:

    Adjust the pattern to match molecules with terminal polar groups (amino or hydroxy) at the end opposite the carboxylic acid:

    ```python
    terminal_polar_groups = '[NX3;H2,H1][CH2]{4,6}[CH2][CX3](=O)[OX1H]'  # For amino group at terminal position
    terminal_polar_groups += '[OX2H1][CH2]{4,6}[CH2][CX3](=O)[OX1H]'    # For hydroxy group at terminal position
    ```

    Alternatively, use a recursive SMARTS to ensure the polar group is at the terminal position:

    ```python
    terminal_polar_groups = '[OX2H1,NX3;H2,H1][CH2]{4,6}[CH2][CX3](=O)[OX1H]'
    ```

- **Suggestion 3**: *Rule 3 - Carboxylic Acid Directly Attached to Nitrogen-Containing Heterocycles Yield High*

  The current SMARTS pattern for Rule 3 may not match all nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly attached to a carboxylic acid:

  ```python
  nitrogen_heterocycle_carboxylic_acid = '[nH0;r5,r6][c;r5,r6][CX3](=O)[OX1H]'
  ```

  *Issues and improvements*:

  - The pattern assumes the heterocycle is five or six-membered, which may exclude valid heterocycles.
  - It may not match heterocycles where the nitrogen atom is at different positions relative to the carboxylic acid.

  *Suggested improvement*:

  ```python
  nitrogen_heterocycle_carboxylic_acid = '[n;r][c][CX3](=O)[OX1H]'
  ```

  This pattern matches any nitrogen-containing aromatic heterocycle directly attached to a carboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 4**: *Rule 4 - Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing or Coordinating Groups Yield High*

  The patterns for electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) may not cover all groups described in the rule. The current patterns include ketones and nitro groups but may exclude others like amino and bromomethyl groups.

  *Suggested improvement*:

  Expand the list of EWGs to include groups like amino (`[NH2]`), bromomethyl (`[CH2Br]`), and other halogens:

  ```python
  ewg_groups = ['[N+](=O)[O-]', 'C#N', 'F', 'Cl', 'Br', 'I', 'NH2', 'CH2Br']
  para_electron_withdrawing = ['c1ccc(cc1)[CX3](=O)[OX1H]',] + ['c1cc([%s])ccc1C(=O)O' % ewg for ewg in ewg_groups]
  ```

- **Suggestion 5**: *Rule 5 - Thiol Groups on Aliphatic Chains Yield High; Thiol Groups on Aromatic Rings Yield Low*

  The current SMARTS patterns for aliphatic and aromatic thiol groups may not accurately differentiate between them.

  *Issues and improvements*:

  - The aliphatic thiol pattern `'[CX4][CX4][SX2H]'` may only match thiol groups two carbons away from the alkyl chain start, which is too specific.
  - The aromatic thiol pattern `'[c][SX2H]'` may not match all cases where the thiol is directly attached to an aromatic ring.

  *Suggested improvement*:

  - For **aliphatic thiols** (thiol on any aliphatic carbon chain):

    ```python
    aliphatic_thiol = '[CX4]~[SX2H]'
    ```

    This matches any aliphatic carbon single-bonded to a thiol group.

  - For **aromatic thiols** (thiol directly attached to an aromatic ring):

    ```python
    aromatic_thiol = '[c][SX2H]'
    ```

    As is, but ensure it captures all aromatic attachments.

- **Suggestion 6**: *Rule 6 - Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups on Aliphatic Chains Yield High*

  The current SMARTS pattern is very specific and may only match gluconic acid:

  ```python
  multiple_hydroxyls_on_aliphatic = '[CX4H][CX4H]([OX2H])[CX4H]([OX2H])[CX4H]([OX2H])[CX4H]([OX2H])[CX3](=O)[OX1H]'
  ```

  *Suggested improvement*:

  Generalize the pattern to match aliphatic chains with multiple (two or more) hydroxyl groups:

  ```python
  multiple_hydroxyls_on_aliphatic = '[CX4H2][CX4H]([OX2H])[CX4H]([OX2H])[CX4H2][CX3](=O)[OX1H]'
  ```

  Alternatively, use recursive SMARTS to find aliphatic chains with multiple hydroxyl groups:

  ```python
  multiple_hydroxyls_on_aliphatic = '[CX4H2][CH2][CH2][OX2H]'
  ```

  Or, to match any aliphatic chain with two or more hydroxyl groups:

  ```python
  multiple_hydroxyls_on_aliphatic = '[CX4;!$(C(O)(O))][CX4;!$(C(O)(O))][CX4H1,H2][OX2H]'
  ```

- **Suggestion 7**: *Rule 7 - Modifiers with Aldehyde Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acids Yield Low*

  The current SMARTS pattern may not specifically match aldehyde groups adjacent to carboxylic acids:

  ```python
  aldehyde_adjacent_to_carboxylic_acid = '[CX3](=O)[CX3H](=O)'
  ```

  *Issues and improvements*:

  - This pattern may match diketones instead of an aldehyde next to a carboxylic acid.
  - It does not ensure that one carbon is part of a carboxylic acid group.

  *Suggested improvement*:

  ```python
  aldehyde_adjacent_to_carboxylic_acid = '[CX3](=O)[CX3H](=O)[OX1H]'
  ```

  Ensure that one of the carbonyl groups is part of a carboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 8**: *Rule 8 - Modifiers Containing Perfluorinated Alkyl Chains Yield Low*

  The current SMARTS pattern only matches trifluoromethyl groups:

  ```python
  perfluorinated_alkyl_chain = '[CX4](F)(F)(F)'
  ```

  *Issues and improvements*:

  - This pattern misses longer perfluorinated chains.

  *Suggested improvement*:

  Use a pattern that matches perfluoroalkyl chains of any length:

  ```python
  perfluorinated_alkyl_chain = '[CX4]([F])([F])[CX2]([F])[CX2]([F])[CX3](=O)[OX1H]'
  ```

  Or more generally:

  ```python
  perfluorinated_alkyl_chain = '[CX4][CX2](F)(F)[CX2](F)(F)[CX3](=O)[OX1H]'
  ```

  Alternatively, detect any carbon chain where all hydrogens are replaced by fluorines:

  ```python
  perfluorinated_alkyl_chain = '[CX4](F)(F)(F)[CX2](F)(F)[CX3](=O)[OX1H]'
  ```

- **Suggestion 9**: *Rule 9 - Modifiers with Long Polyether Chains Yield Low*

  The current SMARTS pattern `'([#6][OX2][#6]){3,}'` may not correctly match long polyether chains.

  *Issues and improvements*:

  - The pattern may match any occurrence of three ether linkages, even in small rings or unintended structures.
  - Does not restrict to linear chains or specify the length.

  *Suggested improvement*:

  Ensure the pattern matches linear polyether chains with three or more ether linkages:

  ```python
  long_polyether_chain = '[OX2][CX4][OX2][CX4][OX2][CX4][OX2]'
  ```

  Or use recursive SMARTS to match longer chains:

  ```python
  long_polyether_chain = '[#6]-([OX2][#6]){$([OX2][#6]),$([OX2][#6][OX2][#6])}'
  ```

  Alternatively, use a wildcard to match any chain with three or more consecutive ether bonds:

  ```python
  long_polyether_chain = '([#6][OX2][#6]){3,}'
  ```

  But verify this pattern matches the intended molecules.

- **Suggestion 10**: *Rule 10 - Aromatic Rings Connected via Medium-Length Aliphatic Chains Yield High*

  The current patterns may not ensure that the aromatic ring is connected via a medium-length aliphatic chain (four or more carbons) to the carboxylic acid.

  ```python
  aromatic_ring = 'c1ccccc1'
  aliphatic_linker = '[CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H2][CX3](=O)[OX1H]'
  ```

  *Issues and improvements*:

  - The patterns are separate and not linked, so the code may not ensure the aromatic ring is connected to the carboxylic acid via the aliphatic chain.
  
  *Suggested improvement*:

  Combine the patterns to ensure connectivity:

  ```python
  aromatic_with_aliphatic_chain = 'c1ccccc1[CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H2][CX3](=O)[OX1H]'
  ```

  This pattern ensures that the aromatic ring is connected via a chain of four CH₂ units to a carboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 11**: *Rule 11 - Modifiers with Functional Groups That Can Interfere with Coordination Yield Low*

  The current patterns for interfering groups may not capture all functional groups that interfere with coordination.

  ```python
  interfering_groups = ['[NX3][CX3](=O)[#6]', '[#6][CX3](=O)[NX3]']  # Amide groups
  ```

  *Issues and improvements*:

  - The patterns only match amides but exclude other interfering groups like bulky acetamido groups or other amide linkages.

  *Suggested improvement*:

  Expand patterns to include other functional groups that can interfere, such as acetamido groups and bulky substituents:

  ```python
  interfering_groups = [
      '[CX3](=O)[NX3]',  # General amide
      '[NX3][CX3](=O)',  # Inverse amide
      '[NX3][CX3](=O)[CX4]',  # N-substituted amide
      '[CX3](=O)[NX3][CX3](=O)',  # Imide groups
  ]
  ```

- **Suggestion 12**: *Rule 12 - Modifiers with Electron-Withdrawing Groups on Aromatic Rings Yield High*

  The current patterns may be too limited:

  ```python
  ewg_on_aromatic = ['[c][CX3](=O)[OX1H]', '[c][N+](=O)[O-]']  # Ketone, nitro group
  ```

  *Issues and improvements*:

  - The patterns may not match all electron-withdrawing groups on aromatic rings.

  *Suggested improvement*:

  Expand the EWG list to include groups like cyano, sulfonyl, and halogens:

  ```python
  ewg_groups = ['[CX3](=O)[OX1H]', '[N+](=O)[O-]', 'C#N', 'S(=O)(=O)[OX1H]', 'F', 'Cl', 'Br', 'I']
  ewg_on_aromatic = ['[c][%s]' % ewg for ewg in ewg_groups]
  ```

- **Suggestion 13**: *Rule 13 - Modifiers Containing Nitrogen Heterocycles Directly Attached to Carboxylic Acids Yield High*

  The pattern appears to duplicate Rule 3. Ensure that the pattern accurately matches this rule.

  *Suggested improvement*:

  Verify that the pattern captures all nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to carboxylic acids, as in Suggestion 3.

- **Suggestion 14**: *Rule 14 - Modifiers with Oxygen-Containing Fused Aromatic Rings Yield High*

  The current SMARTS pattern may not match the intended fused aromatic systems.

  ```python
  oxygen_fused_aromatic_ring = '[o][c]1[c][c][c][c][c]1'
  ```

  *Issues and improvements*:

  - The pattern may be too specific and not capture all oxygen-containing fused aromatic rings.

  *Suggested improvement*:

  Generalize the pattern to match oxygen-containing fused rings:

  ```python
  oxygen_fused_aromatic_ring = '[c]1occc[c]1'  # Simple benzofuran
  ```

  Or, to match any oxygen-containing fused aromatic system:

  ```python
  oxygen_fused_aromatic_ring = '[o;r][c;r]:[c;r]'  # Oxygen in ring fused to aromatic carbons
  ```

- **Suggestion 15**: *Rule 15 - α-Amino Monocarboxylic Acids with Hydrophobic Side Chains Yield Low; Exception for Indole Rings*

  The current patterns may not accurately capture the molecules described.

  ```python
  hydrophobic_side_chain = '[NX3;H2][CHX4][CH2][c]'  # Aromatic side chain
  indole_side_chain = '[NX3;H2][CHX4][CX2H][c]1c[nH]c2ccccc12'  # Indole ring
  ```

  *Issues and improvements*:

  - The hydrophobic side chain pattern may not match all α-amino acids with hydrophobic side chains.
  - The indole side chain pattern is too specific to tryptophan's exact structure.

  *Suggested improvement*:

  - For **hydrophobic side chains**:

    ```python
    hydrophobic_side_chain = '[NX3;H2][CHX4][CH2][CH2][c]'  # Allow for variable chain length
    ```

  - For the **indole exception**:

    Simplify the pattern to match any amino acid with an indole ring in the side chain:

    ```python
    indole_side_chain = '[NX3;H2][CHX4][CH2][c]1c[nH]c2cccc[c]12'
    ```

    Or more generally:

    ```python
    indole_side_chain = '[NX3;H2][CHX4][CH2][c]1c[nH]c2c1cccc2'
    ```

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Translate Qualitative Rules into Quantifiable Molecular Features**

  Convert the current qualitative rules into quantifiable molecular descriptors that can be directly extracted from SMILES strings. Focus on features such as the count of specific functional groups (e.g., number of carboxylic acid groups, amino groups, hydroxyl groups), presence of particular ring systems (e.g., pyridine rings), lengths of aliphatic chains, and position of functional groups. This translation enables the generation of a numeric feature matrix suitable for statistical analysis and machine learning models.

- **Advice 2**: **Standardize Functional Group Definitions with Clear Numerical Parameters**

  Provide clear numerical definitions for terms used in the rules to eliminate ambiguity. For instance, specify "medium-length aliphatic chains" as "aliphatic chains containing 6–8 carbon atoms." Define "multiple hydroxyl groups" by the exact number of hydroxyl groups required (e.g., three or more). This clarity allows for precise feature extraction from molecular structures.

- **Advice 3**: **Utilize Cheminformatics Tools to Compute Molecular Descriptors**

  Employ cheminformatics software (e.g., RDKit, ChemAxon) to automatically compute a standardized set of molecular descriptors from SMILES strings. Descriptors might include molecular weight, logP (hydrophobicity), topological polar surface area (TPSA), hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, rotatable bonds, and counts of specific functional groups. This approach streamlines the generation of a comprehensive numeric feature matrix.

- **Advice 4**: **Consolidate Overlapping and Redundant Rules**

  Review and merge overlapping or redundant rules to simplify the rule set. For example, combine rules that pertain to electron-withdrawing groups on aromatic rings (Rules 4 and 12) into a single, more generalized rule. This consolidation reduces complexity and enhances the efficiency of feature extraction.

- **Advice 5**: **Prioritize Features Based on Statistical Significance**

  Analyze the dataset to identify which molecular features have the most significant impact on yield. Use statistical methods (e.g., correlation analysis, regression models) to determine the importance of each descriptor. Prioritize these features in the rule set to focus on the most influential factors affecting the reaction yield.

- **Advice 6**: **Implement Binary and Numerical Feature Encoding**

  Encode the presence or absence of specific features as binary variables (e.g., "Contains pyridine ring: Yes [1], No [0]") and use numerical values for count-based features (e.g., "Number of carboxylic acid groups: 0, 1, 2, etc."). This encoding facilitates the creation of a machine-readable feature matrix suitable for modeling and predictive analytics.

- **Advice 7**: **Incorporate Hierarchical Structuring of Rules**

  Organize the rules hierarchically, starting from general structural features and moving toward more specific characteristics. For example, begin with "Presence of aromatic ring" and drill down to "Aromatic ring directly attached to carboxylic acid" and further to "Aromatic ring with electron-withdrawing substituents." This structure aids in systematic feature extraction and highlights relationships between features.

- **Advice 8**: **Include Additional Relevant Molecular Descriptors**

  Incorporate descriptors related to steric effects, electronic properties, and solubility, such as steric hindrance parameters, electron density measures, and solubility predictions. Features like molar refractivity, partial charges, and solvation free energy can provide deeper insights into the modifiers' behavior in the reaction environment.

- **Advice 9**: **Ensure All Rules Correspond to Extractable SMILES Features**

  Verify that each rule corresponds to features that can be directly extracted from SMILES notation without requiring complex interpretation. Avoid subjective language and focus on objective, measurable properties to facilitate automated processing and minimize errors in feature extraction.

- **Advice 10**: **Create a Comprehensive Feature Extraction Protocol**

  Develop a standardized protocol for extracting features from SMILES strings based on the refined rules. This protocol should include detailed steps and algorithms for computing each descriptor, ensuring consistency and reproducibility in the generation of the numeric feature matrix.

    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(Single hydroxyl group at terminal position)*

---

- **Rule 7: Modifiers with Functional Groups That Interfere with Coordination Yield Low**

  **Description:** Modifiers possessing functional groups that may interfere with catalyst coordination (e.g., aldehydes adjacent to carboxylic acids, perfluorinated alkyl chains, long polyether chains, bulky acetamido groups) yield low due to steric hindrance or electronic effects that disrupt effective binding.

  **Examples:**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(Aldehyde adjacent to carboxylic acid)*
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(Perfluorinated chain)*
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(Long polyether chain)*

---

- **Rule 8: Modifiers That Are α-Amino Monocarboxylic Acids with Hydrophobic Side Chains Yield Low; Exception for Indole Rings**

  **Description:** Modifiers that are α-amino monocarboxylic acids with large hydrophobic side chains yield low due to steric hindrance and reduced solubility. An exception exists for side chains capable of additional coordination, such as indole rings, which yield high.

  **Examples:**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)
  - **High Yield:**
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan) *(Indole ring enhances coordination)*

---

- **Rule 9: Modifiers with Aromatic Rings Connected via Medium-Length Aliphatic Chains Yield High**

  **Description:** Modifiers that have an aromatic ring connected to a carboxylic acid via a medium-length aliphatic chain (four or more carbons) yield high. This structure balances hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, enhancing binding with the catalyst.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** *(Shorter chain length reduces favorable interactions)*

---

- **Rule 10: Modifiers with Electron-Withdrawing Groups on Fused Aromatic Rings Yield High**

  **Description:** Modifiers containing fused aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., keto groups) yield high. These groups enhance the electron-deficient nature of the aromatic system, improving coordination with the metal catalyst.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

---

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1: Modifiers That Are α-Amino Dicarboxylic Acids Yield High**

  **Description:** Modifiers that are α-amino acids containing two carboxylic acid groups (dicarboxylic acids) yield high. The presence of both an amino group and two carboxylate groups enhances coordination with the metal catalyst, improving its stability and activity.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine) *(Monocarboxylic acid with hydrophobic side chain)*

---

- **Rule 2: Modifiers with Nitrogen-Containing Heterocycles Directly Attached to Carboxylic Acids Yield High**

  **Description:** Modifiers where a carboxylic acid group is directly attached to a nitrogen-containing aromatic heterocycle yield high. Nitrogen atoms enhance coordination with the metal catalyst, increasing catalytic activity.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Niacin)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(Pyridine ring not directly bonded to carboxyl group)*

---

- **Rule 3: Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing or Coordinating Groups Yield High**

  **Description:** Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids yield high when the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group or capable of coordinating with the metal catalyst (e.g., nitro, amino, bromomethyl groups). These groups enhance electronic interactions and coordination with the catalyst.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(Methyl group does not improve coordination)*
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(Aldehyde group may interfere with coordination)*

---

- **Rule 4: Straight-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Without Terminal Polar Groups Yield High; Terminal Polar Groups Decrease Yield**

  **Description:** Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids yield high when they have medium-length chains (typically 6–8 carbons) without additional terminal polar functional groups. Introduction of terminal polar groups (e.g., amino, hydroxy) decreases the yield due to altered solubility and coordination dynamics.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **Octanoic acid**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 5: Modifiers with Thiol Groups on Aliphatic Chains Yield High; Thiol Groups on Aromatic Rings Yield Low**

  **Description:** Modifiers featuring thiol (–SH) groups on aliphatic chains yield high due to strong coordination via sulfur atoms. When the thiol group is attached to an aromatic ring, the yield is low, possibly due to reduced availability of the sulfur atom for effective coordination.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 6: Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups on Aliphatic Chains Yield High**

  **Description:** Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups yield high. The hydroxyl groups enhance solubility and provide additional coordination sites with the metal catalyst, improving reactivity.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(Single hydroxyl group at terminal position)*

---

- **Rule 7: Modifiers with Functional Groups That Interfere with Coordination Yield Low**

  **Description:** Modifiers possessing functional groups that may interfere with catalyst coordination (e.g., aldehydes adjacent to carboxylic acids, perfluorinated alkyl chains, long polyether chains, bulky acetamido groups) yield low due to steric hindrance or electronic effects that disrupt effective binding.

  **Examples:**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(Aldehyde adjacent to carboxylic acid)*
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(Perfluorinated chain)*
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(Long polyether chain)*
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(Bulky acetamido group)*

---

- **Rule 8: Modifiers That Are α-Amino Monocarboxylic Acids with Hydrophobic Side Chains Yield Low; Exception for Indole Rings**

  **Description:** Modifiers that are α-amino monocarboxylic acids with large hydrophobic side chains yield low due to steric hindrance and reduced solubility. An exception exists for side chains capable of additional coordination, such as indole rings, which yield high.

  **Examples:**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)
  - **High Yield:**
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan) *(Indole ring enhances coordination)*

---

- **Rule 9: Modifiers with Aromatic Rings Connected via Medium-Length Aliphatic Chains Yield High**

  **Description:** Modifiers that have an aromatic ring connected to a carboxylic acid via a medium-length aliphatic chain (four or more carbons) yield high. This structure balances hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, enhancing binding with the catalyst.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** *(Shorter chain length reduces favorable interactions)*

---

- **Rule 10: Modifiers with Electron-Withdrawing Groups on Fused Aromatic Rings Yield High**

  **Description:** Modifiers containing fused aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., keto groups) yield high. These groups enhance the electron-deficient nature of the aromatic system, improving coordination with the metal catalyst.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: **Rule 1**: The SMARTS pattern for identifying α-amino dicarboxylic acids (`dicarboxylic_acid = '[C;!R][CH](N)([C](=O)[O])[C](=O)[O]'`) is too specific and may not match actual α-amino dicarboxylic acids like aspartic acid and glutamic acid. The SMARTS pattern should be revised to broadly capture any α-amino acid with two carboxylic acid groups. Consider using a more general pattern like `[NX3][CHX4]([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])[CX2][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]` to ensure that both amino and two carboxylic acid groups are present.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: **Rule 2**: The SMARTS pattern (`nitrogen_heterocycle_carboxylic_acid = '[#1]c1ncccc1C(=O)O'`) is too specific to pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and may not match other nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly attached to carboxylic acids. It should be generalized to match any nitrogen-containing heterocycle directly attached to a carboxylic acid group. For example, consider using `n1[cH,c,n][cH,c,n][cH,c,n][cH,c,n]1C(=O)O` to capture such structures.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: **Rule 3**: The implementation for para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing or coordinating groups uses patterns for the substituents (`ewgs_or_coordinating_groups`), but these may not be correctly applied to match the substituents at the para position. Additionally, the main pattern `para_substituted_benzoic_acid` should ensure the substituent is at the para position. Modify the SMARTS to specify para substitution, such as `c1ccc(cc1[!H])[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]` where the para position is substituted, and properly combine it with the EWG patterns, ensuring they are correctly matched to the para substituent.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: **Rule 4**: The SMARTS pattern for straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (`straight_chain_aliphatic_carboxylic_acid`) may not adequately capture medium-length chains (6–8 carbons) and may include chains with terminal polar groups inadvertently. It's necessary to specify chain length and ensure exclusion of terminal polar groups effectively. Consider using a pattern like `[CH3][CH2]{4,6}[CH2]C(=O)O` and ensure that terminal atoms do not have polar groups by excluding `[!#6]` at terminal positions.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: **Rule 5**: Separate the patterns for thiol groups on aliphatic chains and aromatic rings effectively. The pattern for thiol on aliphatic chain (`thiol_on_aliphatic_chain = '[CX4][CH2][SX2H]'`) should be generalized to include varying chain lengths and positions. Also, ensure the pattern for thiol on aromatic rings (`thiol_on_aromatic_ring = '[c][SX2H]'`) correctly identifies thiol groups attached to aromatic carbons.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: **Rule 6**: The pattern for multiple hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains (`aliphatic_chain_with_multiple_hydroxyls`) is too specific to one structure. It should be generalized to detect any aliphatic carboxylic acid with multiple hydroxyl groups. Consider using a pattern like `[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CH2][CH](O)[CH](O)[CH2][OH]` or even more generally `[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CH2][CH](O)[CH2]O` to match various chain lengths and configurations.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: **Rule 7**: The patterns under `interfering_groups` are limited and may not cover all functional groups that interfere with coordination. Ensure that the patterns include all functional groups described, such as aldehydes adjacent to carboxylic acids, perfluorinated alkyl chains, long polyether chains, and bulky acetamido groups. Include patterns like `[CX3](=O)[CH](=O)`, `[CX4][CF3]`, `[OX2][CX2][CX2][OX2]`, `[CX3](=O)[NX3][CX3](=O)[CX4]`, and test them to confirm accurate matching.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: **Rule 8**: For Rule 8, ensure that the pattern for hydrophobic α-amino monocarboxylic acids (`alpha_amino_mono_carboxylic_acid_hydrophobic`) excludes amino acids with side chains capable of additional coordination, like indole rings. Modify the pattern to match hydrophobic side chains without such exceptions and use the correct pattern for indole rings (`indole_ring = 'c1c[cH,n][cH,c][cH,c][cH,c]1'`) to ensure accurate identification.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: **Rule 9**: The pattern for aromatic rings connected via medium-length aliphatic chains (`aromatic_ring_with_aliphatic_chain`) should be adjusted to match chains of four or more carbons. Consider using a pattern like `[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CH2]{4,}[c]` to specify the chain length and ensure accurate matching.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: **Rule 10**: The pattern for fused aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups (`fused_aromatic_with_ewg`) is too specific. Generalize it to match any fused aromatic system with an electron-withdrawing group attached. Use a pattern like `c1ccc2c(c1)cc(=O)cc2C(=O)O` or `[cH]1[cH][cH][cH][cH][c]1[cX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]` incorporating variable positions for the EWG.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: Test all SMARTS patterns against the example compounds provided under each rule to verify they match correctly. Modify the patterns based on the test results to improve accuracy.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: Review the code's logic for applying `exclude_patterns` and `sub_patterns`. Ensure that when `exclude_patterns` are defined, the code properly excludes molecules matching these patterns even if they match the main patterns. Similarly, confirm that `sub_patterns` in Rule 3 are applied correctly, matching substituents at the correct positions.

  - A lift of **1.413** suggests that the rule predicts the outcome **41.3%** better than random chance, indicating a strong association.

- **Decreased Support:**
  - The support has decreased significantly in the current rules. The latest support value of **0.0143** means that the rule applies to approximately **1.43%** of the training data.
  - Lower support implies that while the rule is more accurate when it applies, it covers fewer instances.

---

**Evaluation of Current Rules:**

- **Strengths:**
  - **Higher Precision:** The increased confidence and lift indicate that the rules are more precise in predicting the desired outcome when they are applicable.
  - **Strong Associations:** Higher lift values signify that the rules identify strong associations that are not due to chance.

- **Weaknesses:**
  - **Limited Applicability:** The low support suggests that the rules have become too specialized, applying to a narrow subset of data.
  - **Overfitting Risk:** There's a potential risk of overfitting, where the rules are tailored too closely to the training data and may not generalize well to new data.

---

**Assessment of Iteration Progress:**

- **Approaching a Local Minimum:**
  - Given that further iterations have led to higher confidence and lift but at the cost of reduced support, it's possible that we are approaching a local minimum. The incremental improvements in confidence and lift are accompanied by a significant drop in support.

- **Sufficiency of Iterations:**
  - The diminishing returns in metric improvements suggest that additional iterations may not yield substantial benefits. The balance between rule precision and coverage appears to have reached an optimal point under the current approach.

---

**Recommendations for Rule Improvement:**

1. **Balance Precision and Coverage:**
   - **Increase Support Without Sacrificing Confidence:**
     - **Generalize Rules Slightly:** Modify the rules to be less restrictive, thereby increasing the number of instances they apply to while aiming to maintain high confidence.
     - **Combine Similar Rules:** Merge rules with similar conditions to create broader rules that cover more data points.

2. **Review Rule Conditions:**
   - **Identify Common Factors:**
     - Look for common features among high-yield examples that are currently excluded due to overly specific conditions.
   - **Simplify Complex Conditions:**
     - Simplify rule conditions that may be unnecessarily complex, which could be limiting their applicability.

3. **Evaluate Rule Redundancy:**
   - **Remove Redundant Rules:**
     - Assess if any rules are overlapping significantly with others, contributing to low support for each. Consolidating these can improve overall support.

4. **Incorporate Additional Data:**
   - **Expand Dataset:**
     - If possible, include more data to provide a wider base for the rules, potentially increasing support without compromising confidence.
   - **Feature Engineering:**
     - Introduce new features that capture relevant chemical properties, which might help create rules with both high confidence and support.

5. **Regularization Techniques:**
   - **Prevent Overfitting:**
     - Apply regularization methods to penalize overly complex rules, encouraging the development of rules that generalize better.

6. **Cross-Validation:**
   - **Assess Generalizability:**
     - Use cross-validation techniques to evaluate how well the current rules perform on unseen data, ensuring that high confidence and lift are not artifacts of the training data alone.

---

**Conclusion:**

The current rules exhibit strong predictive power when they apply, as indicated by the increased confidence and lift. However, the low support indicates that they are applicable to only a small portion of the data. To enhance their performance, it is crucial to find a balance between precision and applicability. By slightly generalizing the rules and ensuring they are not overly restrictive, it is possible to increase support while maintaining high confidence and lift. This approach should help in developing more robust rules that are both accurate and widely applicable to the dataset.

ML Commenter Message:
**Comments on the Accuracies of the Validation Set and Training Set:**

The performance metrics from the previous iterations and the current iteration indicate a decline in accuracy:

- **Previous Validation Accuracies:**
  - Validation Accuracies ranged from **0.68 to 0.76**.
  - Test Accuracies were **0.75** and **0.625**.

- **Current Iteration Accuracies:**
  - Validation Accuracies over multiple iterations fluctuated between **0.4571** and **0.5714**.
  - The final validation accuracy in the current iteration is **0.5143**.

**Interpretation:**

- The **decrease in validation accuracy** from approximately **0.76** to **0.51** suggests that the current set of rules may not be as effective in predicting the catalyst loading as previous sets.
- The fluctuations in accuracy across iterations indicate potential issues with **model stability** and **generalization performance**.

---

**Analysis Based on SHAP Values Calculated on the Validation Set:**

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values offer insight into how each feature (rule) contributes to the model's predictions. Analyzing the SHAP values helps identify which rules are most influential, especially in cases where predictions deviate from experimental results.

**Key Observations from SHAP Analysis:**

1. **Underestimated Loadings (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**

   - **Molecules Affected:**
     - *C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N*
     - *C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)N*
     - *C([C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](C(=O)O)O)O)O)O)O*
     - *C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O*
     - *Other similar molecules*

   - **Common Contributing Rules with High Negative SHAP Values:**
     - **Rule 3:** *Modifiers That Are α-Amino Monocarboxylic Acids with Hydrophobic Side Chains Yield Low; Exception for Indole Rings.*
       - Negative SHAP values suggest this rule heavily penalizes the high-loading prediction.
     - **Rule 5:** *Modifiers with Thiol Groups on Aliphatic Chains Yield High; Thiol Groups on Aromatic Rings Yield Low.*
       - Negative SHAP values indicate this rule contributes to lowering the predicted loading.
     - **Rule 10:** *Modifiers with Electron-Withdrawing Groups on Fused Aromatic Rings Yield High.*
       - Negative SHAP values imply this rule is not supporting the high-loading prediction for these molecules.

2. **Overestimated Loadings (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**

   - **Molecules Affected:**
     - *C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N*
     - *C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)NCC(=O)O)O*
     - *C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O*
     - *Other similar molecules*

   - **Common Contributing Rules with High Positive SHAP Values:**
     - **Rule 6:** *Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups on Aliphatic Chains Yield High.*

**Evaluation of the Performance of Current Rules:**

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**

   - The decline in validation accuracy suggests that the **current rules are not as effective** as previous ones.
   - The rules may not be capturing essential features that distinguish between high and low catalyst loadings.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment:**

   - **Underfitting:** The model's poor performance on the validation set indicates it may not be capturing the underlying patterns in the data, pointing towards underfitting.
   - **Overfitting:** If some rules are too specifically tailored to certain molecules, they may not generalize well, causing overfitting to the training data.

3. **Discrepancies Analysis:**

   - **Underestimations:** Rules with high negative SHAP values for molecules with underestimated loadings (e.g., Rule 3 and Rule 5) may need adjustment.
   - **Overestimations:** Rules with high positive SHAP values for molecules with overestimated loadings (e.g., Rule 6 and Rule 9) might be overly influential and require refinement.

4. **Interpretation of Accuracy Improvements:**

   - The modest improvements and fluctuations in accuracy between iterations indicate that the current approach may have reached a local minimum.
   - Without significant changes to the rules, further improvements may be limited.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**

   - **Rule Contribution Visualization:** SHAP analysis highlights which rules contribute most to decision-making.
   - **Rule Effectiveness:** Rules consistently contributing to incorrect predictions can be identified and targeted for refinement.
   - **Interaction Effects:** Possible interactions between rules may not be adequately captured, suggesting a need for rules that account for such interactions.

---

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

1. **Refine Problematic Rules:**

   - **Rule 3 (α-Amino Monocarboxylic Acids):**

     - **Issue:** Negative SHAP values for high-loading molecules indicate this rule penalizes them incorrectly.
     - **Action:** Re-evaluate the scope of this rule. Consider splitting it to differentiate between modifiers with hydrophobic side chains that impair coordination and those that may still yield high due to other functional groups.

   - **Rule 5 (Thiol Groups):**

     - **Issue:** Negative SHAP values for high-loading molecules suggest the rule may be too restrictive.
     - **Action:** Modify the rule to account for exceptions where thiol groups on aromatic rings may not always lead to low loading, or consider the influence of adjacent functional groups.

2. **Adjust Overly Influential Rules:**

   - **Rule 6 (Multiple Hydroxyl Groups):**

     - **Issue:** High positive SHAP values leading to overestimations.
     - **Action:** Refine the rule to specify the position and context of hydroxyl groups, ensuring it doesn't overemphasize their presence without considering other molecular features.

   - **Rule 9 (Aromatic Rings with Aliphatic Chains):**

     - **Issue:** May contribute to overestimations for certain molecules.
     - **Action:** Introduce additional criteria to the rule, such as chain length thresholds or substituent effects on the aromatic ring, to improve specificity.

3. **Improve Generalization:**

   - **Simplify Overly Complex Rules:**

     - Complex rules may not generalize well. Simplification can reduce overfitting and enhance model performance on unseen data.

   - **Incorporate Additional Data:**

     - Use more training data, if available, to help the model learn a wider variety of molecular features and improve generalization.

4. **Leverage SHAP Insights for Rule Refinement:**

   - **Identify Key Features:**

     - Use SHAP values to pinpoint molecular features that consistently contribute to accurate predictions and consider incorporating these into new or existing rules.

   - **Rule Iteration:**

     - Iteratively test and validate changes to rules, monitoring their impact on SHAP values and overall model accuracy.

5. **Consider Rule Interactions:**

   - Some molecules may be influenced by multiple rules interacting in complex ways.

   - **Action:** Develop rules that account for combinations of features, or implement a hierarchical rule system where more specific rules override general ones.

6. **Validate Adjusted Rules:**

   - After modifying rules, re-run the model and compare validation accuracies.

   - Use SHAP analysis to verify that the changes have positively impacted the model's predictions.

---

**Conclusion:**

The current set of rules shows limitations in accurately predicting the catalyst loading, as evidenced by decreased validation accuracies and insights from SHAP analysis. By refining rules that contribute to mispredictions and improving the specificity and generalization of the rules, it's possible to enhance the model's performance. Iterative testing and validation are crucial to ensure that adjustments lead to tangible improvements.

---

**Next Steps:**

- **Revise Rules:** Implement the recommended changes to the problematic rules.
- **Re-Evaluate Model:** After adjustments, retrain the model and perform validation to assess improvements.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Use subsequent SHAP analyses to monitor the impact of changes and identify further areas for enhancement.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Rule Optimization:**

**Overview:**

The task focuses on optimizing the catalytic yield of a radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction by extracting molecular rules from SMILES representations. The reaction involves various molecular modifiers that influence the catalyst's activity, and the goal is to improve current rules that predict high or low yields based on modifier structures.

**Current Rule Performance:**

- **Metrics Analysis:**
  - **Increased Confidence and Lift:** The current rules exhibit higher confidence (up to 70.8%) and lift (up to 1.413) compared to previous iterations, indicating stronger predictive power when the rules apply.
  - **Decreased Support:** The support has significantly decreased (as low as 1.43%), meaning the rules apply to a smaller portion of the dataset.
  - **Validation Accuracy Decline:** Validation accuracies have decreased from approximately 76% to around 51%, suggesting reduced generalizability of the rules.

- **SHAP Analysis Findings:**
  - **Underestimation of High Yield Modifiers:** Some high-yield modifiers are incorrectly predicted as low yield due to overly restrictive or misapplied rules.
  - **Overestimation of Low Yield Modifiers:** Certain rules contribute to overestimating the yield for modifiers that actually produce low yields.

**Suggestions for Improving Current Rules:**

1. **Generalize SMARTS Patterns to Increase Support:**
   - **Rule 1 (α-Amino Dicarboxylic Acids):**
     - **Issue:** The SMARTS pattern is too specific and may not capture all α-amino dicarboxylic acids.
     - **Suggestion:** Broaden the pattern to `[NX3][CHX4]([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])[CX2][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]` to include various configurations of amino acids with two carboxyl groups.

2. **Ensure Correct Positioning in Patterns:**
   - **Rule 2 (Nitrogen Heterocycles with Carboxylic Acids):**
     - **Issue:** The pattern is too specific to pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.
     - **Suggestion:** Use a more general pattern like `n1[c,n][c,n][c,n][c,n][c,n]1C(=O)O` to match any nitrogen-containing heterocycle directly attached to a carboxylic acid.

   - **Rule 3 (Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids):**
     - **Issue:** The current patterns may not correctly identify para substitutions.
     - **Suggestion:** Modify the SMARTS pattern to specify para substitution explicitly, such as `c1ccc(cc1)[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]` with appropriate substituent patterns.

3. **Avoid Over-Specificity to Improve Generalization:**
   - **Rule 4 (Straight-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids):**
     - **Issue:** The pattern may inadvertently include chains with terminal polar groups.
     - **Suggestion:** Refine the pattern to `[CH3][CH2]{4,6}[CH2]C(=O)O` and ensure exclusion of terminal polar groups by specifying `[!#6]` (non-carbon atoms) at terminal positions.

   - **Rule 6 (Multiple Hydroxyl Groups on Aliphatic Chains):**
     - **Issue:** The pattern is too specific to certain structures.
     - **Suggestion:** Generalize the pattern to `[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CH2][CH](O)[CH2]O` to include a range of aliphatic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups.

4. **Separate and Clarify Overlapping Patterns:**
   - **Rule 5 (Thiol Groups):**
     - **Issue:** Patterns may not effectively distinguish between thiol groups on aliphatic chains and aromatic rings.
     - **Suggestion:** Use separate patterns for each case:
       - Aliphatic thiol: `[CX4][CH2][SX2H]`
       - Aromatic thiol: `[c][SX2H]`

5. **Expand Interfering Functional Groups:**
   - **Rule 7 (Functional Groups That Interfere with Coordination):**
     - **Issue:** The list of interfering groups is limited.
     - **Suggestion:** Include additional patterns to capture a wider range of interfering functional groups, such as aldehydes adjacent to carboxylic acids (`[CX3](=O)[CH]=O`), perfluorinated chains (`[CX4][CF3]`), long polyether chains (`[OX2][CX2][CX2][OX2]`), and bulky groups.

6. **Refine Exceptions and Special Cases:**
   - **Rule 8 (α-Amino Monocarboxylic Acids with Hydrophobic Side Chains):**
     - **Issue:** The pattern may incorrectly exclude amino acids capable of coordination.
     - **Suggestion:** Adjust the pattern to exclude molecules with side chains like indole rings by using specific patterns for hydrophobic side chains and exceptions for coordinating groups.

7. **Adjust Chain Length Specifications:**
   - **Rule 9 (Aromatic Rings Connected via Aliphatic Chains):**
     - **Issue:** Chain length in the pattern may not accurately reflect medium-length chains.
     - **Suggestion:** Use `[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CH2]{4,}[c]` to specify chains of four or more carbons connected to an aromatic ring.

8. **Test and Validate All SMARTS Patterns:**
   - **Overall Suggestion:** Systematically test each SMARTS pattern against known examples and adjust them to ensure accurate matching and exclusion where appropriate.

9. **Review Code Logic for Pattern Application:**
   - **Exclude and Sub-Patterns:**
     - **Issue:** The application of `exclude_patterns` and `sub_patterns` might not be functioning as intended.
     - **Suggestion:** Verify and correct the code logic to ensure that molecules matching exclude patterns are properly excluded, and sub-patterns are applied correctly.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting:**

- **Yes, Further Optimization is Possible:**
  - **Balancing Precision and Coverage:** By generalizing overly specific patterns, we can increase support without significantly sacrificing confidence, improving the model's applicability.
  - **Avoiding Overfitting:** Simplifying complex patterns and avoiding unnecessary specificity can reduce overfitting risks, enhancing the model's ability to generalize to new data.
  - **Incorporating SHAP Insights:** Using SHAP analysis to identify and adjust rules that negatively impact predictions will help improve overall model accuracy.

**Conclusion:**

The current rules have room for improvement. By implementing the suggested changes, we can enhance the rules' effectiveness, increasing their support while maintaining or improving confidence and lift. This optimization will lead to a more robust model capable of accurately predicting catalytic yields across a broader range of modifiers.

    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(Single hydroxyl group at terminal position)*

---

- **Rule 7: Modifiers with Functional Groups That Interfere with Coordination Yield Low**

  **Description:** Modifiers possessing functional groups that may interfere with catalyst coordination (e.g., aldehydes adjacent to carboxylic acids, perfluorinated alkyl chains, long polyether chains, bulky acetamido groups) yield low due to steric hindrance or electronic effects that disrupt effective binding.

  **Examples:**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(Aldehyde adjacent to carboxylic acid)*
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(Perfluorinated chain)*
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(Long polyether chain)*

---

- **Rule 8: Modifiers That Are α-Amino Monocarboxylic Acids with Hydrophobic Side Chains Yield Low; Exception for Indole Rings**

  **Description:** Modifiers that are α-amino monocarboxylic acids with large hydrophobic side chains yield low due to steric hindrance and reduced solubility. An exception exists for side chains capable of additional coordination, such as indole rings, which yield high.

  **Examples:**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)
  - **High Yield:**
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan) *(Indole ring enhances coordination)*

---

- **Rule 9: Modifiers with Aromatic Rings Connected via Medium-Length Aliphatic Chains Yield High**

  **Description:** Modifiers that have an aromatic ring connected to a carboxylic acid via a medium-length aliphatic chain (four or more carbons) yield high. This structure balances hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, enhancing binding with the catalyst.

  **Examples:**
  - **High Yield:**
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**
  - **Low Yield:**
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** *(Shorter chain length reduces favorable interactions)*

---

- **Rule 10: Modifiers with Electron-Withdrawing Groups on Fused Aromatic Rings Yield High**

  **Description:** Modifiers containing fused aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., keto groups) yield high. These groups enhance the electron-deficient nature of the aromatic system, improving coordination with the metal catalyst.
