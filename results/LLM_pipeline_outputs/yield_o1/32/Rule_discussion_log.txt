- **Comment 1**: **Rule 1** is clear in its structural description—aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position leading to high yield. The physical-chemical insight is solid, explaining how EWGs enhance coordination with the metal center. The rule combines sub-structures (aromatic ring, carboxylic acid, para EWG), adding appropriate complexity. Coverage is adequate, supported by examples like 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid and 4-nitrobenzoic acid. The balance between complexity and coverage is well-maintained.

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 2** provides a clear criterion—aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position result in low yield. The insight about EDGs increasing electron density and hindering catalyst interaction is appropriate. The rule's complexity lies in the combination of aromatic structures with specific substituents. Examples like 4-methylbenzoic acid support the rule, and coverage is sufficient. The rule strikes a good balance between specificity and applicability.

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 3** is clearly stated, focusing on aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with an α-amino group yielding high results. The explanation regarding enhanced chelation due to the amino and carboxylate groups offers strong chemical insight. The rule is complex enough, involving multiple functional groups in specific positions. Supported by data points like (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, coverage is adequate, and the rule is well-balanced.

- **Comment 4**: **Rule 4** is clear about modifiers with amino groups more than five carbons away from the carboxyl group leading to low yield. The physical-chemical insight concerning decreased coordination ability due to increased distance is valid. Complexity is appropriate, considering spatial arrangement. Examples such as 7-aminoheptanoic acid provide sufficient coverage. The rule maintains a good balance between specificity and general applicability.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** clearly states that modifiers with pyridine rings directly attached to the carboxyl group result in high yield. The insight about pyridine nitrogen coordinating with metal centers is strong. The rule has suitable complexity, integrating heterocyclic aromatics with functional groups. Examples like pyridine-3-carboxylic acid support the rule, and coverage is satisfactory. Balance is well-achieved.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** is clear in identifying fluorinated alkyl chains leading to low yield. The explanation about strong electron-withdrawing effects and interference with catalyst interactions provides good insight. Complexity involves specific functional groups within the modifiers. Examples such as 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid support the rule, and coverage is adequate. The rule balances specificity with applicability.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** clearly states that polyhydroxylated carboxylic acids tend to result in high yield. The physical-chemical insight about enhanced hydrogen bonding and coordination is appropriate. The complexity is suitable, focusing on multiple hydroxyl groups. Examples like (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid provide coverage. The rule maintains a good balance.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** is clear regarding aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups leading to low yield. The insight about potential side reactions or catalyst deactivation is valid. Complexity involves the combination of aromatics with reactive functional groups. Examples like 4-formylbenzoic acid support the rule, and coverage is sufficient. The rule is balanced in its specificity.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** clearly states that aliphatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups on long chains result in low yield. The explanation about steric hindrance is reasonable. Complexity is appropriate, considering both chain length and functional groups. Examples like 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid support the rule, though coverage is somewhat limited. The rule is balanced but could benefit from more data points.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** suggests that simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups lead to high yield. While the rule is clear, the inclusion of 5-aminopentanoic acid as an example (which contains an amino group) contradicts the "without additional functional groups" criterion. This affects clarity and balance. The physical-chemical insight is acceptable but could be refined for better consistency. Coverage is limited, and the rule may need revision for clarity.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** is somewhat conditional, stating that modifiers with para amino groups result in high yield if the amino group coordinates effectively. This conditionality affects clarity. The insight about amino groups acting as chelating agents is valid. Complexity is moderate, involving specific positions of functional groups. Examples like 4-aminobenzoic acid support the rule, but coverage is limited. The rule could be clearer and more definitive.

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** clearly states that amino acids with aromatic heterocyclic side chains result in high yield. The insight about metal coordination is strong. Complexity is appropriate, but coverage is limited to a single example, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid. The rule could be strengthened with additional supporting data points for better coverage and balance.

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13** clearly indicates that amino acids with non-polar aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms lead to low yield. The physical-chemical insight is reasonable. Complexity is acceptable, but coverage is limited to one example, (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid. The rule meets clarity and insight criteria but lacks sufficient coverage for strong validation.

- **Comment 14**: **Rule 14** states that modifiers with sulfur groups attached to aromatic rings result in low yield. The rule is clear, and the insight about sulfur poisoning the catalyst is valid. However, the example of 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid yielding high results contradicts the rule, affecting clarity and reliability. Coverage is conflicting, and the rule may need refinement to resolve contradictions and improve balance.

- **Comment 15**: **Rule 15** clearly identifies modifiers with long ethylene glycol chains leading to low yield. The explanation about steric hindrance is acceptable. Complexity is reasonable, but coverage is limited to a single data point, 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid. The rule meets clarity and insight criteria but lacks sufficient coverage, affecting balance.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**:
  - **Rule 1**: The rule is clear, stating that modifiers which are α-amino acids with additional carboxyl groups in their side chains (acidic amino acids) tend to result in high yield. This allows for straightforward prediction based on the modifier's structure. The property insight is strong, linking the presence of multiple carboxyl and amino groups to enhanced chelation with metal centers, thereby improving catalyst stability and reactivity. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures—both amino and multiple carboxyl groups—satisfying the complexity criterion. Coverage is adequate with at least two supporting data points (Aspartic acid and Glutamic acid). The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 2**:
  - **Rule 2**: The rule provides clarity by specifying that short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino groups within three carbon atoms of the carboxyl group tend to result in high yield, whereas those with amino groups farther away tend to result in low yield. This clear distinction aids in predicting outcomes based on structure. The property insight is solid, explaining that the proximity enables bidentate coordination with metal ions, enhancing catalyst performance. The rule involves combinations of functional groups (amino and carboxyl), meeting the complexity criterion. Coverage is sufficient, with examples supporting both high and low yields (5-aminopentanoic acid for high yield, 7-aminoheptanoic acid and 8-aminooctanoic acid for low yield). The balance between complexity and coverage is well maintained.

- **Comment 3**:
  - **Rule 3**: This rule is clear in predicting high yield for modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position. The clarity aids in straightforward application of the rule. The property insight is strong, connecting increased acidity from electron-withdrawing groups to improved coordination with metal catalysts. Complexity is present as it considers both the aromatic carboxylic acid structure and the presence of electron-withdrawing substituents at a specific position. Coverage is adequate with at least two data points (4-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid). The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 4**:
  - **Rule 4**: Clarity is achieved by stating that aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-donating groups at the para position tend to result in low yield. This allows for clear predictions. The property insight is sound, explaining how electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, hindering effective coordination with metal centers. Complexity is addressed by combining the aromatic carboxylic acid structure with electron-donating substituents at a specific position. Coverage is adequate, with at least two examples (4-methylbenzoic acid and 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid). The balance between complexity and coverage is satisfactory.

- **Comment 5**:
  - **Rule 5**: The rule clearly states that modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains tend to result in low yield, enabling straightforward predictions. The property insight is adequate, highlighting the impact of high electronegativity and steric effects of fluorinated chains on catalyst interactions. Complexity is present as the rule focuses on a specific sub-structure (fluorinated alkyl chains).

Coverage is adequate with two examples (4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid). The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 8**:
  - **Rule 8**: The rule is moderately clear, stating that aliphatic carboxylic acids with long, unbranched chains without additional functional groups tend to result in high yield. The inclusion of an example with a distant hydroxyphenyl group (5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid) introduces some complexity but remains within the rule's scope as the functional group is distanced by an aliphatic chain. The property insight is acceptable, emphasizing minimal steric hindrance and effective coordination. Complexity is moderate, focusing on chain length and absence of interfering groups. Coverage is sufficient with at least two examples. The balance between simplicity and coverage is acceptable, though the rule could benefit from clearer boundaries regarding permissible functional groups.

- **Comment 9**:
  - **Rule 9**: The rule provides clarity by distinguishing between modifiers with hydroxyl groups on short versus long aliphatic chains, predicting high and low yields respectively. The property insight is reasonable, explaining that hydroxyl groups on short chains can enhance coordination, while on longer chains they may cause steric hindrance. Complexity is addressed by considering both the presence of hydroxyl groups and the length of the aliphatic chain. Coverage is adequate with examples of both high yield ((2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid) and low yield (7-hydroxyheptanoic acid).

Complexity is present by considering both the amino acid backbone and the nature of the side chain. However, coverage is limited to a single example ((2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid). Additional data points are needed to strengthen the rule. The balance between complexity and coverage is suboptimal due to limited support.

- **Comment 12**:
  - **Rule 12**: The rule clearly states that modifiers with long ethylene glycol chains attached to the carboxyl group tend to result in low yield, facilitating straightforward predictions. The property insight is adequate, explaining how flexible ethylene glycol chains may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorable interactions. Complexity is addressed by focusing on the presence of ethylene glycol chains. Coverage meets the criterion with two examples (2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid and 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid). The balance between specificity and coverage is acceptable.

- **Comment 13**:
  - **Rule 13**: The rule provides clarity by distinguishing between thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings (resulting in low yield) and those on aliphatic chains (resulting in high yield). This specificity aids in accurate predictions. The property insight is reasonable, discussing how thiol groups on aromatic rings can strongly bind to metal centers and potentially inhibit catalytic activity, whereas on aliphatic chains they are less interfering. Complexity is present, considering both the placement of the thiol group and the nature of the carbon chain. Coverage is limited, with only one example for each case (4-sulfanylbenzoic acid for low yield and 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid for high yield). Additional data points would strengthen the rule. The balance between complexity and coverage could be improved.

- **Comment 14**:
  - **Rule 14**: Clarity is achieved by specifying that aromatic carboxylic acids with ketone groups adjacent to the aromatic ring tend to result in low yield, while ketone groups separated by an aliphatic chain may result in high yield. This aids in predicting outcomes based on structural differences. Property insight is acceptable, explaining how adjacent ketone groups can alter electronic properties or participate in side reactions. Complexity is present, considering both the position of the ketone group and its effect on the aromatic system. Coverage is limited, with one example for each case (4-oxoheptanedioic acid for low yield and 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid for high yield). More data points are necessary to enhance the rule's reliability. The balance between complexity and coverage needs improvement due to limited support.

- **Comment 15**:
  - **Rule 15**: The rule is clear, indicating that modifiers with heterocyclic structures containing multiple coordinating atoms tend to result in high yield. This provides a broad but useful guideline for prediction. The property insight is strong, explaining how multiple coordinating sites can enhance interaction with metal centers, promoting catalyst stability and efficiency. Complexity is high, incorporating complex heterocyclic structures with multiple coordinating atoms. Coverage is good, supported by at least three examples (1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid, and 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid). The balance between complexity and coverage is well maintained.

**Summary and Key Considerations:**

These rules have been developed by analyzing the structural features of the modifiers and their correlation with the reaction yield. Each rule combines multiple substructures or functional groups and considers underlying physicochemical properties such as electronic effects, coordination ability, and steric factors. By applying these rules, we can predict whether a given modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield in the reaction.

**Highlights:**

- **Coordination Ability**: Modifiers capable of effective coordination with the metal center, such as those with nearby amino or hydroxyl groups, tend to enhance catalyst activity and result in high yield.

- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group and promote coordination, leading to higher yields. Electron-donating groups have the opposite effect.

- **Steric Factors**: Modifiers with bulky groups or long flexible chains that can cause steric hindrance tend to result in low yield due to reduced coordination efficiency.

- **Functional Group Positioning**: The position of functional groups relative to the carboxyl group is crucial; groups closer to the carboxyl can participate effectively in coordination.

**Notes:**

- **Exceptions**: Some compounds may not fit neatly into the rules due to unique structural features or synergistic effects of multiple functionalities.

- **Applicability**: These rules can guide the design of new modifiers to optimize reaction yields by focusing on enhancing coordination with the catalyst while minimizing steric hindrance and unfavorable electronic effects.

- **Further Refinement**: Additional data and experimental verification can help refine these rules and improve their predictive accuracy.

**Summary and Key Considerations:**

These rules illustrate the relationships between specific combinations of substructures (functional groups) in molecular modifiers and the reaction yield. By considering underlying physicochemical properties such as coordination ability, electronic effects, and steric factors, the rules help predict whether a modifier will result in a high or low yield.

**Highlights:**

**Summary and Key Considerations:**

These rules define the relationship between molecular modifiers' structural features and their influence on the reaction yield. By combining multiple functional groups and considering their positions relative to the carboxyl group, the rules predict the modifiers' effectiveness in the catalytic process.

**Highlights:**

- **Effective Coordination**: Modifiers that can chelate the metal center through proximal functional groups like amino, hydroxyl, thiol, and accessible nitrogen atoms tend to enhance catalyst performance and result in high yield.

- **Functional Group Positioning**: The spatial arrangement of functional groups is crucial. Groups located near the carboxylate enhance metal coordination, while distant or hindered groups are less effective.

- **Steric and Electronic Effects**: Bulky substituents, flexible ether linkages, and electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups can influence the coordination environment, affecting the reaction yield.

- **Hydrophobic Interactions**: Simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups can enhance yield through favorable interactions without hindering the active site.

**Applicability:**

These rules offer guidance for selecting and designing molecular modifiers to optimize the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By applying these principles, chemists can predict modifier performance based on structural features and make informed decisions to improve reaction outcomes.

**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: **Rule 1** is clear and allows for unambiguous classification of modifiers based on the position of amino or hydroxyl groups relative to the carboxyl group. The rule provides adequate physical-chemical insight regarding the importance of proximity for effective coordination with the metal center. It considers combinations of functional groups and their positions, satisfying the complexity criterion. The coverage is strong, with multiple data points supporting both high and low yield outcomes (e.g., octanoic acid and 5-aminopentanoic acid for high yield; 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid and 7-aminoheptanoic acid for low yield). Overall, the rule meets all the criteria effectively.

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 2** has inconsistencies with the dataset. While the rule states that electron-donating substituents at the para position lead to high yield and electron-withdrawing groups lead to low yield, 4-nitrobenzoic acid (which has a strongly electron-withdrawing nitro group) is listed as resulting in high yield. Conversely, 4-methylbenzoic acid (with an electron-donating methyl group) is associated with low yield. This contradiction indicates that the rule does not align with the observed data.

The rule is clear and provides physical-chemical reasoning. However, the coverage is weak, with only one supporting example (4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid). This limits the rule's reliability, partially meeting the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 15**: **Rule 15** states that modifiers that are diacids or contain multiple carboxylic acid groups tend to result in high yield due to chelation through multiple coordination points. While the rule is clear and offers solid physical-chemical insight, it overlaps significantly with **Rule 3**, which also addresses α-amino acids with carboxylate side chains. The coverage is adequate, with examples like aspartic acid and glutamic acid supporting the rule. However, the redundancy suggests that this rule could be consolidated with Rule 3 for clarity and conciseness.

**Summary and Key Considerations:**

These rules have been developed to capture the relationship between the structural features of molecular modifiers and their impact on the reaction yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization of aliphatic alcohols. By focusing on combinations of functional groups and their positions relative to the carboxylate, the rules predict whether a modifier is likely to result in high or low yield.

**Highlights:**

- **Effective Coordination**: Modifiers that can chelate the metal center through proximal functional groups like amino, hydroxyl, thiol, and accessible nitrogen atoms enhance catalyst performance, leading to high yield.

- **Functional Group Positioning**: The spatial arrangement of functional groups is crucial. Coordinating groups near the carboxylate improve metal interaction, while distant or sterically hindered groups are less effective.

- **Steric and Electronic Effects**: Bulky substituents, flexible chains, and electron-withdrawing groups can negatively impact the coordination environment, reducing the reaction yield.

- **Multiple Coordination Sites**: Modifiers with multiple coordinating groups, such as diacids or polyhydroxy acids, can form more stable complexes with the metal center, improving catalytic activity.

**Applicability:**

These rules provide practical guidance for selecting and designing molecular modifiers to optimize the yield of the target reaction. By applying these principles, chemists can predict modifier performance based on structural features and make informed decisions to enhance reaction outcomes.

**Note:**

The rules have been carefully refined to balance simplicity and complexity, covering a broad range of the dataset while focusing on the underlying physicochemical properties that influence catalytic activity. Each rule combines multiple sub-structures and provides clear predictions for the yield, aligning with the specified requirements.

**Summary and Key Considerations**

These rules highlight the importance of specific functional groups and their positioning within the molecular modifiers on the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. The presence of coordinating groups such as amino, hydroxyl, thiol, and nitrogen-containing heterocycles near the carboxylate improves metal coordination through chelation, leading to higher yields. Conversely, modifiers lacking these features or containing groups that hinder coordination tend to result in lower yields.

**Highlights:**

- **Enhancement of Metal Coordination:**
  - **Proximity of Coordinating Groups:** Functional groups like amino and hydroxyl near the carboxylate enhance chelation.
  - **Multiple Coordination Sites:** Modifiers with several coordinating groups form stronger complexes.
  - **Heteroaromatic Nitrogen Atoms:** Nitrogen in heterocycles can coordinate effectively with metals.

- **Factors Reducing Yield:**
  - **Steric Hindrance:** Bulky substituents and flexible chains can impede coordination.
  - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups:** Strong electron-withdrawing groups may decrease coordination ability if overly reducing electron density.
  - **Lack of Coordinating Groups:** Simple aliphatic acids without additional functional groups have limited interaction with metals.
  - **Intramolecular Interactions:** Internal hydrogen bonding can sequester coordinating groups.

**Applicability:**

These rules can guide the selection and design of molecular modifiers to optimize the yield of the reaction. By focusing on the incorporation of appropriate functional groups and considering their spatial arrangement relative to the carboxylate, it is possible to enhance metal coordination and catalytic efficiency.

---

**Conclusion**

Understanding the relationship between the structural features of molecular modifiers and their impact on reaction yield is crucial for catalyst optimization. The generated rules provide a framework for predicting the efficacy of potential modifiers and can assist in the rational design of new compounds to achieve higher yields in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization of aliphatic alcohols.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: *Rule 4* has inconsistencies with the dataset. It lists **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** as a low yield example due to steric hindrance of the nitrogen atom. However, according to the dataset, **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** actually results in a high yield (**yield_high_or_low_value: True**). This contradiction suggests that the rule may not accurately reflect the influence of heteroaromatic nitrogen atoms on the reaction yield.

- **Comment 2**: *Rule 6* is contradicted by the data. The rule states that modifiers which are aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups tend to result in low yield, citing **octanoic acid** as a low yield example. However, the dataset shows that **octanoic acid** yields high yield (**yield_high_or_low_value: True**). This indicates that the absence of additional coordinating groups in aliphatic carboxylic acids does not necessarily lead to low yield, and the rule may need revision.

- **Comment 3**: *Rule 9* is not consistent with the dataset. The rule claims that amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking additional coordinating groups tend to result in low yield, using **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan) as a low yield example. However, in the dataset, tryptophan is associated with a high yield (**yield_high_or_low_value: True**). This discrepancy suggests that the rule does not adequately capture the effect of aromatic amino acids on the reaction yield.

- **Comment 4**: *Rule 15* has limited coverage and support. It addresses modifiers with intramolecular hydrogen bonds sequestering coordinating groups, but provides only one low yield example (**(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**). With such minimal data support, it's difficult to validate the rule's general applicability. More data points are needed to substantiate this rule.

- **Comment 5**: Some rules lack sufficient complexity and coverage. For instance, *Rule 10* discusses the contrasting effects of aliphatic versus aromatic thiol groups but is based on only one high yield example and one low yield example. To meet the complexity criterion and strengthen the rule, additional data points and consideration of combinations of functional groups would be beneficial.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows for easy determination of high-yield modifiers based on the structural description of α- or β-amino acids where the amino group is within two carbons of the carboxylic acid. The rule provides strong property insight into how the proximity facilitates bidentate ligation, enhancing catalyst activity. It effectively combines multiple substructures, demonstrating adequate complexity. It is well-supported by data points from both high and low yield examples, ensuring good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 provides a reasonable structural description of modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position. The property insight is solid, linking increased acidity to enhanced coordination. However, coverage is somewhat limited with only a few data points, suggesting the rule could be strengthened with more examples to enhance its applicability and balance.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 has a fairly clear description of heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating nitrogen atoms. The property insight explaining enhanced catalytic efficiency due to nitrogen coordination is strong. The rule considers multiple substructures, adding necessary complexity. Coverage is limited and could benefit from additional data points to confirm its validity and improve balance.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4's description of modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxylic acid group is somewhat clear. The property insight is reasonable, explaining how hydroxyl groups contribute to chelation. However, the rule's complexity and coverage are limited. Including more data points and refining the description could enhance this rule and achieve better balance.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 clearly specifies that acylated amino groups or amino groups distant from the carboxyl group lead to low yield. The property insight effectively explains the reduced coordination ability due to blocking or distance. The rule exhibits adequate complexity by considering combined structural features and is supported by multiple data points, ensuring good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 specifies that modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains near the carboxyl group result in low yield. The property insight is acceptable, linking electron-withdrawing effects to weakened coordination. However, coverage is minimal with only two data points, suggesting the rule could be strengthened with more examples to improve its balance and applicability.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 indicates that bulky or flexible ether chains near the carboxyl group lead to low yield due to steric hindrance and reduced coordination efficiency. The description is reasonably clear, and the property insight is acceptable. Coverage is limited, so more data points would help confirm the rule's validity and enhance its balance.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 describes modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid leading to low yield, possibly due to competitive coordination or side reactions. While the property insight is acceptable, coverage is minimal with only a couple of examples. Clarifying the term "adjacent" and adding more data points would improve the rule's clarity, coverage, and balance.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 states that unfunctionalized aliphatic carboxylic acids with long chains tend to result in high yield. The rule is clear but lacks complexity and coverage, being supported by only one data point. Adding more examples or refining the rule could enhance its utility and balance.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 differentiates between thiol groups on aliphatic chains (high yield) and aromatic rings (low yield). The property insight about potential catalyst poisoning is reasonable. However, coverage is limited to two examples. Additional data points would strengthen the rule and improve its balance.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 effectively identifies modifiers with multiple coordinating groups in close proximity leading to high yield due to enhanced chelation. The rule is clear, demonstrates high complexity by considering combinations of functional groups, and is well-supported by several data points, exhibiting good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 notes that electron-donating groups at positions that do not enhance coordination lead to low yield. While the description and property insight are acceptable, coverage is minimal. Refining the rule and adding more data points would improve its strength and balance.

**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: **Rule 1** is clear in specifying that α-amino acids with additional carboxyl groups or coordinating side chains result in high yield. The property insight is strong, linking enhanced coordination from amino and carboxyl groups to catalyst stabilization. Complexity is moderate, considering combinations of functional groups (amino acids with additional coordinating groups). Coverage is good, with multiple high yield examples (aspartic acid, glutamic acid, tryptophan) and a contrasting low yield example (phenylalanine). The rule effectively balances complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 2** clearly states that aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position lead to high yield. The property insight is solid, explaining increased acidity and coordination ability due to electron-withdrawing groups. Complexity is acceptable, focusing on specific substituents on the aromatic ring. Coverage is adequate, with high yield examples (4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid) and low yield counterexamples (4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-formylbenzoic acid). The rule is well-balanced between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 3** specifies that modifiers with hydroxyl or amino groups adjacent to the carboxyl group result in high yield. Clarity is excellent, and the property insight correctly associates additional coordination sites with enhanced catalyst performance. Complexity is moderate, involving the position of functional groups relative to the carboxyl group. Coverage is strong, supported by high yield examples (gluconic acid, 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid, 4-aminobenzoic acid, 5-aminopentanoic acid) and low yield examples where the functional groups are distant (7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid). The rule demonstrates a good balance.

- **Comment 4**: **Rule 4** clearly indicates that heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms adjacent to the carboxyl group result in high yield. The property insight is appropriate, linking nitrogen coordination with catalyst stabilization. Complexity is reasonable, focusing on heteroaromatic structures with adjacent nitrogen atoms. Coverage is satisfactory, with high yield examples (pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid) and a low yield example (4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid) where the nitrogen is too distant. The rule balances clarity, complexity, and coverage effectively.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** states that unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids of medium chain lengths (C5–C8) tend to result in high yield. The rule is clear, but the property insight is limited, attributing the effect to optimal hydrophobicity and flexibility without detailed explanation. Complexity is low, considering straightforward aliphatic chains. Coverage is minimal, with only one high yield example (octanoic acid) and a low yield example (8-aminooctanoic acid). The rule lacks sufficient data points to strongly support its validity.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** posits that modifiers with multiple electron-donating groups near the carboxyl group result in high yield. Clarity is good, and the property insight connects multiple coordinating groups to enhanced catalyst stability. Complexity is moderate, involving combinations of functional groups. Coverage is limited, with two high yield examples (5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid) and no low yield counterexamples. Additional data points would strengthen the rule's coverage.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** is clear in stating that functional groups capable of coordination located far from the carboxyl group lead to low yield. The property insight is logical, relating decreased chelating ability to reduced catalyst performance. Complexity is moderate, considering spatial arrangement within the molecule. Coverage is adequate, with several low yield examples (7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid). The rule effectively balances complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** suggests that modifiers with long, flexible ether chains near the carboxyl group result in low yield due to steric hindrance. Clarity is acceptable, and the property insight is plausible. Complexity is moderate, focusing on specific structural features that impact coordination. Coverage is limited, with two low yield examples (2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid). More supporting data would enhance the rule's validity.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** states that modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains adjacent to the carboxyl group result in low yield. Clarity is good, and the property insight correctly associates electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups with reduced coordinating ability. Complexity is low, focusing on a specific type of substituent. Coverage is minimal, with only one low yield example (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid). Additional examples are needed to strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** explains that modifiers with acylated amino groups near the carboxyl group result in low yield. Clarity is acceptable, and the property insight regarding reduced electron density on nitrogen is sound. Complexity is moderate, considering functional group modifications near the coordination site. Coverage is limited, with two low yield examples ((2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid). More data points would improve the rule's support.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** suggests that dicarboxylic acids with ketone groups between carboxyl groups result in low yield due to competing interactions. Clarity is fair, but the property insight is speculative without strong evidence. Complexity is moderate. Coverage is minimal, with only one low yield example (4-oxoheptanedioic acid). The rule requires additional supporting data and clearer justification.

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** states that modifiers with substituents capable of strong intramolecular interactions near the carboxyl group result in low yield. Clarity could be improved by specifying the types of interactions. The property insight is reasonable, linking intramolecular interactions to reduced coordination. Complexity is moderate. Coverage includes two low yield examples (4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid), but more examples and clearer definitions would enhance the rule.

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13** indicates that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups that cannot participate in coordination result in low yield. Clarity is acceptable, and the property insight explains the lack of enhanced coordination despite increased electron density. Complexity is low. Coverage is limited, with one low yield example (4-methylbenzoic acid) and no high yield contrasts. Additional data points are needed for stronger support.

- **Comment 14**: **Rule 14** mentions that bulky substituents impeding coordination lead to low yield. Clarity is good, and the property insight regarding steric hindrance is sound. Complexity is low to moderate. Coverage is minimal, with one low yield example ((2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid). Including more examples would strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 15**: **Rule 15** states that modifiers combining multiple unfavorable features tend to result in low yield. Clarity is limited due to the vagueness of "unfavorable features." The property insight is general, acknowledging that multiple negative factors reduce performance. Complexity is high, considering multiple structural aspects. Coverage includes two low yield examples (4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid). Refining the rule for specificity would improve its clarity and utility.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing multiple electron-donating ether linkages and lacking effective coordinating groups tend to result in a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: The presence of multiple ether linkages can increase flexibility but may reduce the overall electron density available for coordination due to electron delocalization. Without strong coordinating groups, this leads to weaker metal-ligand interactions.

  - **Low Yield Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**: Ether linkages dominate the structure, reducing coordination ability.
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**: Despite the amino group, ether linkages interfere with effective coordination.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with side chains capable of forming internal hydrogen bonds or zwitterionic structures tend to result in a **low yield** due to reduced availability of coordination sites.**
