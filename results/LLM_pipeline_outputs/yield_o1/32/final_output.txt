    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with carboxylic acid side chains tend to result in high yield.**
  - *Explanation*: α-Amino acids with additional carboxyl groups can act as multidentate ligands, enhancing coordination with metal centers and stabilizing the catalyst.
  - *Examples*: 
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (High yield)
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (High yield)
    - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (High yield)

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position tend to result in high yield.**
  - *Explanation*: Electron-withdrawing groups like nitro (-NO₂) and bromomethyl (-CH₂Br) increase the acidity of the carboxyl group and enhance coordination with the metal catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid (High yield)
    - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid (High yield)

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-donating groups at the para position tend to result in low yield.**
  - *Explanation*: Electron-donating groups such as methyl (-CH₃), methoxy (-OCH₃), and hydroxyl (-OH) decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, hindering effective coordination with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid (Low yield)
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid (Low yield)
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (Low yield)

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers where the carboxyl group is directly attached to a pyridine or other heterocyclic nitrogen-containing ring tend to result in high yield; however, if the pyridine ring is attached via an additional aromatic ring, the yield tends to be low.**
  - *Explanation*: Direct attachment allows the nitrogen atom to coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalyst stability. Attachment through an additional aromatic ring increases steric hindrance and reduces effective coordination.
  - *Examples*:
    - High Yield:
      - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (High yield)
      - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid (High yield)
    - Low Yield:
      - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (Low yield)

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino groups at the γ or δ position tend to result in high yield, while those with amino groups further away tend to result in low yield.**
  - *Explanation*: Amino groups close to the carboxyl group can participate in chelation with the metal center, enhancing catalyst performance. Greater distances reduce this chelating ability.
  - *Examples*:
    - High Yield:
      - 5-aminopentanoic acid (High yield)
      - 4-aminobenzoic acid (High yield) *(Note: Aromatic but amino group is para to carboxyl group)*
    - Low Yield:
      - 7-aminoheptanoic acid (Low yield)
      - 8-aminooctanoic acid (Low yield)

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups on short aliphatic chains tend to result in high yield, whereas those with hydroxyl groups on long chains tend to result in low yield.**
  - *Explanation*: Multiple hydroxyl groups on short chains enhance coordination through hydrogen bonding and chelation. Long chains introduce steric hindrance and reduce coordination efficiency.
  - *Examples*:
    - High Yield:
      - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (High yield)
    - Low Yield:
      - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid (Low yield)

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are fluorinated carboxylic acids tend to result in low yield.**
  - *Explanation*: Fluorinated groups are highly electronegative and can interfere with catalyst interactions due to their strong electron-withdrawing effects and potential steric hindrance.
  - *Examples*:
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid (Low yield)
    - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid (Low yield)

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) groups tend to result in low yield.**
  - *Explanation*: Aldehyde groups may undergo side reactions or interact unfavorably with the catalyst, reducing its activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid (Low yield)
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (Low yield)

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with long ethylene glycol chains attached to the carboxyl group tend to result in low yield.**
  - *Explanation*: Flexible ethylene glycol chains increase steric bulk and reduce effective coordination with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid (Low yield)
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid (Low yield)

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups tend to result in high yield.**
  - *Explanation*: Lack of interfering functional groups allows for unimpeded coordination with the metal center.
  - *Examples*:
    - Octanoic acid (High yield)
    - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid (High yield) *(Note: Contains a thiol group but gives high yield, suggesting exceptions)*

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol (sulfanyl) groups tend to result in low yield unless the thiol group is on a short aliphatic chain.**
  - *Explanation*: Aromatic thiol groups can bind strongly to metal centers, potentially poisoning the catalyst. Thiol groups on short chains may coordinate differently.
  - *Examples*:
    - Low Yield:
      - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid (Low yield)
    - High Yield:
      - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid (High yield)

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with nonpolar aromatic side chains lacking additional coordinating groups tend to result in low yield.**
  - *Explanation*: Without functional groups capable of coordinating with the metal center, the modifier does not enhance catalyst activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Low yield)

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy or alkoxy groups directly attached to the ring tend to result in low yield unless separated by an aliphatic chain.**
  - *Explanation*: Electron-donating alkoxy groups decrease the acidity and coordinating ability of the carboxyl group. An aliphatic spacer can mitigate this effect.
  - *Examples*:
    - Low Yield:
      - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid (Low yield)
    - High Yield:
      - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid (High yield)

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with ketone groups adjacent to the carboxyl group tend to result in low yield, whereas ketone groups separated by an aliphatic chain may result in high yield.**
  - *Explanation*: Adjacent ketone groups can interact negatively with the catalyst. Separation by an aliphatic chain reduces this interaction.
  - *Examples*:
    - Low Yield:
      - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid (Low yield)
    - High Yield:
      - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid (High yield)

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with heterocyclic aromatic rings containing multiple coordinating atoms (e.g., pyrazole, indole) tend to result in high yield.**
  - *Explanation*: Multiple heteroatoms can enhance coordination with the metal center, stabilizing the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid (High yield)
    - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (High yield)

**Summary of Improvements and Considerations:**

- **Combining Functional Groups**: Many rules incorporate multiple functional groups to explain the yield outcome, fulfilling Requirement 1.
- **Physico-Chemical Properties**: Each rule considers underlying properties such as acidity, electron donation/withdrawal, steric hindrance, and coordination ability, addressing Requirement 2.
- **Clarity and Predictability**: Each rule clearly predicts high or low yield based on specific structural features, satisfying Requirement 3.
- **Coverage**: The rules collectively cover a broad range of the dataset, prioritizing modifiers that exemplify the patterns, in line with Requirement 4.
- **Number of Rules**: Fifteen rules have been provided, meeting Requirement 5.
- **Balance**: The rules strike a balance between simplicity (e.g., Rule 2) and complexity (e.g., Rule 4), adhering to Requirement 6.
- **Refinements**: Ineffective or contradictory rules from the previous set were revised or replaced to enhance accuracy, following Requirement 7.

---

**Notes:**

- Some modifiers may present exceptions due to unique structural features or interactions not fully captured by the rules. For instance, 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid gives a high yield despite containing a thiol group, suggesting the influence of chain length or overall molecular context.
- Modifiers with aliphatic chains separating potentially interfering groups (e.g., methoxy, ketone) from the carboxyl group often result in higher yields, highlighting the importance of molecular positioning.
- The rules are intended to guide predictions and may require further refinement with additional data or computational modeling for precise applications.---------------------------------------------------------------

    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with acidic side chains containing additional carboxyl groups tend to result in high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: The presence of both an amino group and additional carboxyl groups enables strong chelation with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid *(High yield)*
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid *(High yield)*

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halogens) at the para position tend to result in high yield, whereas those with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy) tend to result in low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing coordination ability with metal centers. Electron-donating groups reduce acidity, hindering effective coordination.
  - *Examples*:
    - *High Yield*:
      - 4-nitrobenzoic acid *(High yield)*
      - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid *(High yield)*
    - *Low Yield*:
      - 4-methylbenzoic acid *(Low yield)*
      - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid *(Low yield)*

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino groups located close to the carboxyl group (within three carbon atoms) tend to result in high yield; those with amino groups farther away tend to result in low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Proximity of the amino group to the carboxyl group enables effective chelation, enhancing catalyst performance. Distant amino groups are less effective in coordination.
  - *Examples*:
    - *High Yield*:
      - 5-aminopentanoic acid *(High yield)*
    - *Low Yield*:
      - 7-aminoheptanoic acid *(Low yield)*
      - 8-aminooctanoic acid *(Low yield)*

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms within the ring tend to result in high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid *(High yield)*
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid *(High yield)*
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid *(High yield)*
  - *Counter-Examples*:
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid *(Low yield)*

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) groups at the ortho or para position tend to result in low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Aldehyde groups can form unproductive interactions or side reactions with the catalyst, reducing effectiveness.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid *(Low yield)*
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid *(Low yield)*

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length unbranched chains (C6-C8) and no additional functional groups tend to result in high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Simple aliphatic acids can coordinate effectively without steric hindrance or interfering functionalities.
  - *Examples*:
    - Octanoic acid *(High yield)*
  - *Counter-Examples*:
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid *(Low yield)*

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing fluorinated alkyl chains tend to result in low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Fluorinated chains are highly electronegative and can interfere with coordination or cause steric hindrance.
  - *Examples*:
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid *(Low yield)*
    - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid *(Low yield)*

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with hydrophobic aromatic side chains lacking additional coordinating groups tend to result in low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Lack of additional functional groups capable of coordination does not enhance catalyst performance.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid *(Low yield)*

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with long ethylene glycol chains attached to the carboxyl group tend to result in low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Flexible ethylene glycol chains may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorable interactions.
  - *Examples*:
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid *(Low yield)*
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid *(Low yield)*

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol (sulfanyl) groups on the ring tend to result in low yield; thiol groups on aliphatic chains tend to result in high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Aromatic thiols can bind strongly to metal centers, possibly deactivating the catalyst, whereas aliphatic thiols are less disruptive.
  - *Examples*:
    - *Low Yield*:
      - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid *(Low yield)*
    - *High Yield*:
      - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid *(High yield)*

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups on short aliphatic chains tend to result in high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance coordination interactions with the metal center.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid *(High yield)*

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with indole side chains tend to result in high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: The indole nitrogen can provide additional coordination, enhancing catalyst activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid *(High yield)*

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., methoxy, hydroxy) at the ortho or para position tend to result in low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Electron-donating groups reduce the acidity of the carboxyl group, hindering coordination.
  - *Examples*:
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid *(Low yield)*
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid *(Low yield)*
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid *(High yield)* — *Exception due to aliphatic chain separating hydroxyl group from carboxyl*

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with long aliphatic chains containing hydroxyl or amino groups far from the carboxyl group (more than five carbons away) tend to result in low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Functional groups distant from the carboxyl group are less effective in coordination and may introduce steric hindrance.
  - *Examples*:
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid *(Low yield)*
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid *(Low yield)*

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are dicarboxylic acids with ketone groups in the chain tend to result in low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: The ketone can interfere with coordination or cause steric hindrance.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid *(Low yield)*

**End of Rules**

**Summary and Key Considerations:**

These rules have been developed by analyzing the structural features of the modifiers and their correlation with the reaction yield. Each rule combines multiple substructures or functional groups and considers underlying physicochemical properties such as electronic effects, coordination ability, and steric factors. By applying these rules, we can predict whether a given modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield in the reaction.

**Highlights:**

- **Coordination Ability**: Modifiers capable of effective coordination with the metal center, such as those with nearby amino or hydroxyl groups, tend to enhance catalyst activity and result in high yield.

- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group and promote coordination, leading to higher yields. Electron-donating groups have the opposite effect.

- **Steric Factors**: Modifiers with bulky groups or long flexible chains that can cause steric hindrance tend to result in low yield due to reduced coordination efficiency.

- **Functional Group Positioning**: The position of functional groups relative to the carboxyl group is crucial; groups closer to the carboxyl can participate effectively in coordination.

**Notes:**

- **Exceptions**: Some compounds may not fit neatly into the rules due to unique structural features or synergistic effects of multiple functionalities.

- **Applicability**: These rules can guide the design of new modifiers to optimize reaction yields by focusing on enhancing coordination with the catalyst while minimizing steric hindrance and unfavorable electronic effects.

- **Further Refinement**: Additional data and experimental verification can help refine these rules and improve their predictive accuracy.

This updated set of rules aims to provide a clearer and more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between modifier structures and reaction yield. By focusing on the key factors that influence coordination and catalyst performance, these rules should be useful for predicting outcomes and designing effective modifiers.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with no additional functional groups or with hydroxyl or amino groups within three carbons of the carboxyl group tend to result in high yield. If the hydroxyl or amino groups are beyond three carbons from the carboxyl group, the yield tends to be low.**

  - *Explanation*: Functional groups close to the carboxyl group can effectively coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalyst stability and activity. When these groups are farther away, their coordinating ability diminishes due to increased flexibility and reduced chelation efficiency.
  
  - *Examples*:
    - *High Yield*:
      - **Octanoic acid** *(High yield)*
      - **5-aminopentanoic acid** *(High yield)*
    - *Low Yield*:
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(Low yield)*
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(Low yield)*
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(Low yield)*

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents (like amino or hydroxyl groups) at the para position tend to result in high yield. Electron-withdrawing groups (like aldehydes or fluorine) at the para position tend to result in low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Electron-donating groups enhance the electron density of the carboxylate, improving its ability to coordinate with the metal center. Electron-withdrawing groups reduce electron density, impeding effective coordination and catalytic activity.
  
  - *Examples*:
    - *High Yield*:
      - **4-aminobenzoic acid** *(High yield)*
      - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(High yield)*
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** *(High yield)*
    - *Low Yield*:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(Low yield)*
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(Low yield)*
      - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** *(Low yield)*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with carboxylate side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) tend to result in high yield, whereas α-amino acids with hydrophobic side chains lacking functional groups (e.g., phenylalanine) tend to result in low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Side-chain carboxylate groups can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalyst performance through multidentate binding. Hydrophobic side chains without coordinating groups do not contribute to metal coordination, leading to lower activity.
  
  - *Examples*:
    - *High Yield*:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(Aspartic acid, High yield)*
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(Glutamic acid, High yield)*
    - *Low Yield*:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(Phenylalanine, Low yield)*
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(Low yield)*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen atoms capable of coordinating (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole) tend to result in high yield, especially when the nitrogen is positioned for effective metal interaction.**

  - *Explanation*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings can donate lone pairs to the metal center, forming stable coordination bonds that enhance catalytic activity.
  
  - *Examples*:
    - *High Yield*:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(High yield)*
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** *(High yield)*
    - *Low Yield*:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(Low yield due to steric hindrance or less accessible nitrogen)*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with bulky substituents or long, flexible chains near coordinating groups tend to result in low yield due to steric hindrance and reduced effective coordination.**

  - *Explanation*: Bulky groups or flexible chains can impede the approach of the modifier to the metal center, hindering coordination and decreasing catalytic efficiency.
  
  - *Examples*:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(Low yield)*
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** *(Low yield)*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., fluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups) tend to result in low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Electron-withdrawing groups reduce the electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening their ability to bind to the metal center and diminishing catalytic performance.
  
  - *Examples*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(Low yield)*
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** *(Low yield)*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with thiol groups near the carboxylate tend to result in high yield; however, aromatic thiols may result in low yield due to potential over-coordination or catalyst poisoning.**

  - *Explanation*: Aliphatic thiols coordinate effectively without overly stabilizing the metal center, enhancing catalysis. Aromatic thiols can bind too strongly or interfere with active sites, reducing activity.
  
  - *Examples*:
    - *High Yield*:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(High yield)*
    - *Low Yield*:
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** *(Low yield)*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxylate or aromatic ring tend to result in low yield due to competing coordination or side reactions.**

  - *Explanation*: Carbonyl groups can act as competing ligands, distract the metal center, or participate in side reactions that compromise catalyst effectiveness.
  
  - *Examples*:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(Low yield)*
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** *(Low yield)*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are sugar acids or polyhydroxy carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxylate tend to result in high yield due to enhanced chelation through multiple coordination sites.**

  - *Explanation*: Multiple hydroxyl groups can form several coordination bonds with the metal center, increasing catalyst stability and activity.
  
  - *Examples*:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(Gluconic acid, High yield)*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with additional coordinating groups in the side chain at an optimal distance from the carboxylate (e.g., four to five carbons) can result in high yield if the functional group is capable of metal coordination (e.g., phenolic hydroxyl, pyridyl nitrogen).**

  - *Explanation*: The side chain length allows the coordinating group to effectively interact with the metal center, forming stable complexes that enhance catalysis.
  
  - *Examples*:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** *(High yield)*
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** *(High yield)*

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing nitrogen heterocycles (e.g., tryptophan derivatives) tend to result in high yield due to additional coordination through the side chain nitrogen.**

  - *Explanation*: The nitrogen in heterocycles like indole can coordinate with the metal center, providing extra stability and enhancing catalytic performance.
  
  - *Examples*:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(Tryptophan, High yield)*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with functional groups capable of forming intramolecular hydrogen bonds that reduce the availability of coordinating atoms tend to result in low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Intramolecular hydrogen bonding can sequester functional groups, preventing them from effectively coordinating with the metal center.
  
  - *Examples*:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(Low yield)*

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing ketone groups within aliphatic chains tend to result in low yield, possibly due to increased flexibility and less effective coordination with the metal center.**

  - *Explanation*: Ketone groups can introduce conformational flexibility and may not position coordinating atoms optimally for metal interaction.
  
  - *Examples*:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** *(Low yield)*

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with substituents capable of both electron donation and coordination (e.g., bromomethyl group) can lead to high yield due to enhanced interaction with the metal center.**

  - *Explanation*: Substituents like bromomethyl can activate the aromatic ring and participate in coordination, improving catalyst performance.
  
  - *Examples*:
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** *(High yield)*

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are diacids or contain multiple carboxylic acid groups tend to result in high yield due to the ability to chelate the metal center through multiple coordination points.**

  - *Explanation*: Multiple carboxylate groups can bind simultaneously to the metal, forming more stable complexes and enhancing catalytic activity.
  
  - *Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(Aspartic acid, High yield)*
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(Glutamic acid, High yield)*

**End of Rules**

**Summary and Key Considerations:**

These rules are designed to capture the relationship between the structural features of molecular modifiers and their impact on the reaction yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization of aliphatic alcohols. By combining multiple functional groups and considering their positions relative to the carboxyl group, the rules predict whether a modifier is likely to result in high or low yield.

**Highlights:**

- **Effective Coordination:** Modifiers that can chelate the metal center through proximal functional groups like amino, hydroxyl, thiol, and accessible nitrogen atoms enhance catalyst performance, leading to high yield.

- **Functional Group Positioning:** The spatial arrangement of functional groups is crucial. Coordinating groups near the carboxylate enhance metal interaction, while distant or sterically hindered groups are less effective.

- **Steric and Electronic Effects:** Bulky substituents, flexible chains, and electron-withdrawing groups can negatively impact the coordination environment, reducing the reaction yield.

- **Multiple Coordination Sites:** Modifiers with multiple coordinating groups, such as diacids or polyhydroxy acids, can form more stable complexes with the metal center, improving catalytic activity.

**Applicability:**

These rules provide practical guidance for selecting and designing molecular modifiers to optimize the yield of the target reaction. By applying these principles, chemists can predict modifier performance based on structural features and make informed decisions to enhance reaction outcomes.

---

**Note:**

The rules have been carefully crafted to balance simplicity and complexity, covering a broad range of the dataset while focusing on the underlying physicochemical properties that influence catalytic activity. Each rule combines multiple sub-structures and provides clear predictions for the yield, aligning with the specified requirements.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are carboxylic acids containing an amino group within three carbons of the carboxylate tend to result in high yield, especially when the amino group is in the alpha or beta position relative to the carboxylate.**

  - *Explanation*: Proximal amino groups can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity through chelation.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(Glutamic acid)*
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(Aspartic acid)*
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position, such as amino, nitro, or bromomethyl groups, tend to result in high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Electron-withdrawing groups at the para position can enhance metal coordination by increasing the acidity of the carboxylate and facilitating interaction with metal centers.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are carboxylic acids containing hydroxyl groups within two to three carbons of the carboxylate tend to result in high yield when these hydroxyl groups can coordinate with metals.**

  - *Explanation*: Hydroxyl groups near the carboxylate can act as additional coordination sites, enhancing chelation and stabilizing the metal catalyst.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(Gluconic acid)*

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms in positions that can coordinate with metals tend to result in high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings can act as ligands, coordinating with metal centers to enhance catalytic activity.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(Nicotinic acid)*
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with multiple carboxylic acid groups (diacids) tend to result in high yield due to the ability to chelate through multiple coordination sites.**

  - *Explanation*: Diacids can coordinate through both carboxylate groups, forming stable chelating complexes with metal centers.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(Aspartic acid)*
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(Glutamic acid)*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with aliphatic thiol groups within three carbons of the carboxylate tend to result in high yield, whereas aromatic thiol groups may result in low yield due to possible catalyst poisoning.**

  - *Explanation*: Aliphatic thiols can coordinate with metal centers without excessively binding or deactivating them, whereas aromatic thiols may bind too strongly or interfere with catalysis.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups such as perfluoroalkyl chains near the carboxylate tend to result in low yield due to decreased electron density for coordination.**

  - *Explanation*: Electron-withdrawing groups reduce the ability of the carboxylate to coordinate effectively with metal centers.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers featuring bulky or flexible ether chains adjacent to the carboxylate tend to result in low yield due to steric hindrance impeding coordination.**

  - *Explanation*: Bulky ether chains can prevent effective interaction between the modifier and the metal center.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking additional coordinating functional groups tend to result in low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Aromatic side chains without coordinating groups do not enhance metal coordination beyond the amino and carboxylate groups.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(Phenylalanine)*
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** *(Methionine derivative)*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are carboxylic acids containing carbonyl groups (aldehyde or ketone) adjacent to the carboxylate tend to result in low yield due to possible side reactions or competing coordination.**

  - *Explanation*: Carbonyl groups can interact with metal centers or participate in side reactions, reducing catalytic efficiency.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with intramolecular hydrogen bonding that sequesters coordinating groups tend to result in low yield due to decreased availability of these groups for metal coordination.**

  - *Explanation*: Internal hydrogen bonds can reduce the ability of functional groups to coordinate with the metal, diminishing catalytic activity.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(Acetylated lysine)*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers combining multiple proximate coordinating groups, such as amino and hydroxyl groups near the carboxylate, tend to result in high yield due to synergistic chelation effects.**

  - *Explanation*: Multiple adjacent coordinating groups enhance binding to the metal center, stabilizing the catalyst.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(Gluconic acid)*

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups tend to result in lower yield due to limited coordination ability.**

  - *Explanation*: Lack of functional groups beyond the carboxylate reduces the ability to form strong interactions with metal centers.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **Octanoic acid**
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with electron-donating groups at positions that do not enhance metal coordination tend to result in low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Electron-donating groups may increase electron density but may not improve coordination unless properly positioned.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing nitrogen heterocycles capable of coordination tend to result in high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Side-chain nitrogen atoms in heterocycles can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(Tryptophan)*

---

**End of Rules**

---

**Summary and Key Considerations:**

These rules establish the relationship between the structural features of molecular modifiers and their effect on the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. They emphasize the importance of functional groups capable of coordinating with metal centers, such as amino, hydroxyl, thiol, and heteroaromatic nitrogen atoms.

**Highlights:**

- **Proximal Coordinating Groups Enhance Yield**: Functional groups like amino and hydroxyl near the carboxylate increase metal coordination through chelation, leading to higher yields.

- **Aromatic Substituents' Influence**: Electron-withdrawing groups at strategic positions on aromatic rings can facilitate coordination, whereas electron-donating groups without proper positioning may not.

- **Chelation Through Multiple Sites**: Modifiers with multiple coordinating sites, such as diacids or compounds with several functional groups, form more stable complexes with metal centers.

- **Steric and Electronic Hindrance**: Bulky groups, flexible chains, or electron-withdrawing substituents can impede effective coordination, leading to lower yields.

**Applicability:**

These rules serve as guidelines for selecting molecular modifiers to optimize the yield of the reaction. By analyzing the presence and positioning of functional groups, chemists can predict the performance of modifiers and tailor them to enhance catalytic activity.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with free amino groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield, whereas those with bulky side chains or acylated amino groups tend to result in low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: The proximity of the amino group to the carboxyl group allows effective chelation with the metal center, enhancing catalyst activity. Bulky side chains or acylation can hinder coordination due to steric effects or blocked coordination sites.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(Aspartic acid)*
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(Glutamic acid)*
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(Tryptophan)*

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(Phenylalanine, bulky aromatic side chain)*
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(Acetylated amino group)*

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with strong electron-withdrawing groups at para positions tend to result in high yield, while those with electron-donating groups result in low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with the metal center. Electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl) decrease acidity and coordination effectiveness.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(Electron-donating methyl group reduces coordination efficiency)*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the heteroatom positioned to facilitate coordination tend to result in high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Heteroatoms like nitrogen in the aromatic ring can provide additional coordination sites, enhancing interaction with the metal center and improving catalytic performance.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(Nicotinic acid)*
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(Heteroatom position and steric factors may impede coordination)*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups in close proximity to the carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Polyhydroxylated compounds can engage in multidentate coordination with the metal center, forming stronger complexes and enhancing catalyst stability.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(Gluconic acid)*

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(Hydroxyl group too distant for effective coordination)*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are unfunctionalized aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium chain lengths tend to result in high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Simple aliphatic acids lack steric hindrance and additional functional groups that could interfere with coordination, allowing effective interaction with the metal center.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **Octanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing thiol groups on aliphatic chains near the carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield, whereas thiol groups on aromatic rings lead to low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**

  - *Explanation*: Aliphatic thiols can coordinate beneficially with the metal center. Aromatic thiols may bind too strongly or deactivate the catalyst through tight binding or electron transfer.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups or amino groups located far from the carboxylic acid group tend to result in low yield due to reduced coordination capability.**

  - *Explanation*: Acylation blocks the amino group's lone pair from coordinating with the metal center. Distant amino groups are less effective in forming stable chelation complexes.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing fluorinated alkyl chains near the carboxylic acid group tend to result in low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups decrease electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, weakening its coordination ability with the metal center.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid tend to result in low yield due to potential competing coordination or side reactions with the metal center.**

  - *Explanation*: Carbonyl groups near the carboxylate may compete for coordination sites or undergo side reactions, reducing catalyst effectiveness.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with bulky or flexible ether chains near the carboxylic acid group tend to result in low yield due to steric hindrance and reduced coordination efficiency.**

  - *Explanation*: Ether chains can create steric barriers that prevent the carboxylate from effectively coordinating with the metal center.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been developed by analyzing the structural features of the modifiers and their corresponding yields in the reaction. By considering combinations of functional groups, their positions, and underlying physical-chemical properties such as coordination ability, electron effects, and steric factors, these rules provide predictive insights into how modifiers influence the catalytic performance.

The rules aim to cover a broad range of modifiers in the dataset, striking a balance between simple, widely applicable rules and more complex, specific ones. This approach facilitates the selection and design of molecular modifiers to optimize and control the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with small side chains or additional carboxyl groups tend to result in high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: The α-amino and carboxyl groups can chelate with the metal center, enhancing coordination. Small side chains reduce steric hindrance, and extra carboxyl groups provide additional binding sites, stabilizing the catalyst complex.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(Aspartic acid)*
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(Glutamic acid)*
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(Phenylalanine, bulky aromatic side chain)*
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(Tryptophan, bulky indole ring)*

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position tend to result in high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with the metal center and forming stronger metal-ligand bonds.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(Electron-donating methyl group decreases acidity)*
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(Aldehyde group may not effectively enhance coordination)*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group tend to result in high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Multiple hydroxyl groups can engage in hydrogen bonding and chelation with the metal center, improving catalyst performance by stabilizing the metal complex.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(Gluconic acid)*
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(Hydroxyl group too distant for effective coordination)*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are heterocyclic aromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms adjacent to the carboxyl group tend to result in high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles can coordinate with the metal center. When close to the carboxyl group, they form bidentate ligands, enhancing catalyst stability.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(Nicotinic acid)*
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(Nitrogen atom too distant to assist in coordination)*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium chain lengths (C5–C8) and additional coordinating groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) tend to result in high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: These molecules provide flexibility for effective coordination, and additional functional groups enhance binding to the metal center.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **Octanoic acid**
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(Amino group too far from carboxyl group for effective chelation)*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with thiol groups (–SH) near the carboxyl group tend to result in high yield when properly positioned for coordination.**

  - *Explanation*: Thiol groups can strongly bind to metal centers, enhancing coordination when not causing catalyst poisoning.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** *(Aromatic thiol may interfere with catalyst activity)*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups capable of coordination (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) at the para position can result in high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: While electron-donating groups decrease acidity, functional groups like amino or hydroxyl can participate directly in metal coordination.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(Methyl group cannot coordinate with metal)*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains tend to result in low yield due to steric hindrance.**

  - *Explanation*: Bulky side chains hinder optimal ligand access to the metal center, reducing coordination efficiency.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(Phenylalanine)*
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(Tryptophan)*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing long, flexible ether chains near the carboxyl group tend to result in low yield due to steric hindrance and decreased coordination ability.**

  - *Explanation*: Ether chains introduce flexibility and steric bulk, hindering optimal positioning for metal coordination.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains adjacent to the carboxyl group tend to result in low yield due to reduced coordinating ability.**

  - *Explanation*: Highly electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups weaken the carboxylate's ability to coordinate with the metal center.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are dicarboxylic acids with ketone groups between the carboxyl groups tend to result in low yield due to potential competing interactions.**

  - *Explanation*: Ketone groups may engage in unwanted interactions with the metal center, reducing catalyst effectiveness.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with functional groups capable of intramolecular hydrogen bonding near the carboxyl group tend to result in low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Intramolecular hydrogen bonding can sequester coordinating groups, preventing them from interacting with the metal center.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups adjacent to the carboxyl group tend to result in low yield due to reduced coordination capability.**

  - *Explanation*: Acylation decreases the electron density on the nitrogen, weakening its ability to coordinate with the metal center.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers combining multiple negative features (e.g., electron-donating groups without coordinating ability, flexible chains, steric hindrance) tend to result in low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Multiple unfavorable features amplify the negative impact on metal coordination and catalyst performance.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(Rigid structure with nitrogen too far from carboxyl group)*
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** *(Bulky, flexible, acylated amine)*

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with amino groups located far from the carboxyl group on long aliphatic chains tend to result in low yield due to decreased chelating ability.**

  - *Explanation*: Distant amino groups are less effective in forming stable chelates with the metal center.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

---

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with additional coordinating side chains or functional groups tend to result in **high yield**.**

  - *Explanation*: The presence of both amino and carboxyl groups at the α-position allows for chelation with the metal center. Additional coordinating groups (e.g., hydroxyl, extra carboxyl, indole ring) enhance metal-ligand interactions, stabilizing the catalyst complex and improving yield.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(Aspartic acid)*
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(Glutamic acid)*
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(Tryptophan)*

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(Phenylalanine)* *(Lacks additional coordinating groups)*

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position tend to result in **high yield**.**

  - *Explanation*: Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halomethyl) increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with the metal center. They may also stabilize negative charges through resonance, improving catalyst performance.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(Electron-donating methyl group decreases acidity and coordination ability)*
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(Aldehyde group may not significantly enhance coordination)*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers containing hydroxyl or amino groups positioned beta or gamma to the carboxyl group tend to result in **high yield** if these groups can participate in coordination.**

  - *Explanation*: Hydroxyl or amino groups near the carboxyl group can act as additional coordination sites, forming chelate rings with the metal center. This chelation enhances catalyst stability and reactivity.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(Amino group is too distant for effective chelation)*
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(Hydroxyl group too far to participate in coordination)*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the heteroatom adjacent to the carboxyl group tend to result in **high yield**.**

  - *Explanation*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles adjacent to the carboxyl group can coordinate with the metal center, forming bidentate ligands. This enhances the stability and activity of the catalyst complex.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(Nicotinic acid)*
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(Nitrogen atom too distant to assist in coordination)*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with multiple coordination sites (e.g., hydroxyl, amino, carboxyl groups) in close proximity tend to result in **high yield**.**

  - *Explanation*: Multiple coordinating groups can chelate the metal center more effectively, enhancing catalyst stability and performance.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(Gluconic acid)*
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(Coordinating groups may be too flexible or distant)*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids of medium chain length (C5–C8) without interfering functional groups tend to result in **high yield**.**

  - *Explanation*: Medium-chain unbranched acids provide optimal hydrophobicity and flexibility, allowing effective interaction with the catalyst without causing steric hindrance or introducing disruptive functional groups.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **Octanoic acid**

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(Amino group may interfere with coordination if not properly positioned)*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with bulky or sterically hindering substituents near the coordinating groups tend to result in **low yield** due to reduced access to the metal center.**

  - *Explanation*: Bulky groups can obstruct coordinating atoms from effectively interacting with the metal center, diminishing catalyst efficiency.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(Phenyl group causes steric hindrance)*
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with electron-donating groups that cannot participate in coordination tend to result in **low yield** due to decreased acidity and ineffective metal interaction.**

  - *Explanation*: Electron-donating groups increase electron density but may not enhance coordination if they cannot directly bind to the metal center, reducing the overall catalyst performance.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(Pyridyl group too remote for effective coordination)*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing long, flexible chains or bulky substituents that separate coordinating groups from the metal center tend to result in **low yield**.**

  - *Explanation*: Flexible chains can decrease the effective concentration of coordinating groups near the metal center, reducing coordination efficiency and catalyst activity.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups adjacent to donor atoms may result in **low yield** due to reduced electron density on coordinating atoms.**

  - *Explanation*: Electron-withdrawing groups diminish the ability of donor atoms to coordinate effectively with the metal center, weakening metal-ligand interactions.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with functional groups capable of intramolecular interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonding) that sequester coordinating atoms tend to result in **low yield**.**

  - *Explanation*: Intramolecular interactions can prevent coordinating groups from interacting with the metal center, reducing coordination and catalyst efficiency.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with functional groups distant from the carboxyl group tend to result in **low yield** due to ineffective chelation.**

  - *Explanation*: Functional groups too far from the carboxyl group cannot participate in forming stable chelate rings with the metal center, reducing coordination efficacy.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups near the carboxyl group tend to result in **low yield** due to decreased coordination capability.**

  - *Explanation*: Acylation reduces the electron density on nitrogen atoms, weakening their ability to coordinate with the metal center and diminishing catalyst performance.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with substituents that can engage in competing interactions or block coordination sites tend to result in **low yield** due to interference with metal coordination.**

  - *Explanation*: Functional groups that compete with the primary coordinating groups can disrupt optimal metal-ligand interactions.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** *(Ketone group may engage in competing interactions)*
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** *(Thiol group may interfere with coordination)*

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers combining multiple unfavorable features (e.g., steric bulk, distant coordinating groups, electron-withdrawing groups near donor atoms) tend to result in **low yield**.**

  - *Explanation*: The combination of several negative factors amplifies the reduction in coordination ability and overall catalyst performance.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** *(Bulky, flexible, with acylated amine)*
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** *(Nitrogen atom distant from carboxyl group, reducing coordination)*

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with side chains containing additional coordinating functional groups (e.g., extra carboxyl groups, hydroxyl groups, or heteroaromatic rings) tend to result in a **high yield**.**

  - *Explanation*: The amino and carboxyl groups at the α-position facilitate bidentate coordination with the metal center. Side chains with additional coordinating groups enhance metal-ligand interactions through chelation, stabilizing the catalyst complex and improving the reaction yield.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(Aspartic acid)*: Contains an extra carboxyl group in the side chain.
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(Glutamic acid)*: Has a longer side chain with an additional carboxyl group.
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(Tryptophan)*: Features an indole ring capable of coordinating with the metal.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(Phenylalanine)*: Lacks additional coordinating groups in the side chain.
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**: Acetamido group may not effectively coordinate due to steric hindrance.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position tend to result in a **high yield**.**

  - *Explanation*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to deprotonate and coordinate with the metal center. They may also facilitate better delocalization of electron density, stabilizing the metal-ligand complex.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**: Nitro group is a strong electron-withdrawing group.
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**: Bromomethyl group acts as an electron-withdrawing substituent.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**: Methyl group is electron-donating, reducing acidity.
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**: Aldehyde group is less electron-withdrawing and may engage in side reactions.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the heteroatom positioned to coordinate with the metal center tend to result in a **high yield**.**

  - *Explanation*: Heteroatoms like nitrogen in the aromatic ring can act as additional coordination sites. When positioned appropriately, they facilitate chelation with the metal, enhancing catalyst stability.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(Nicotinic acid)*: Nitrogen atom at position 3 relative to the carboxyl group.
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**: Nitrogen atoms in the pyrazole ring can coordinate with the metal.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**: The pyridyl nitrogen is too distant from the carboxyl group for effective chelation.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with additional coordinating functional groups (e.g., amino, thiol, hydroxyl) located β or γ to the carboxyl group tend to result in a **high yield**.**

  - *Explanation*: Functional groups positioned near the carboxyl group can participate in chelation, forming stable five- or six-membered rings with the metal center. This stabilizes the catalyst's active species, enhancing performance.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**: Amino group at the δ position aids in coordination.
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**: Thiol group at the β position participates in chelation.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**: Amino group is too distant for effective chelation.
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**: Amino group is too remote from the carboxyl group.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers possessing multiple hydroxyl groups capable of chelation tend to result in a **high yield**.**

  - *Explanation*: Multiple hydroxyl groups can engage in polydentate coordination with the metal, forming stable complexes. This enhances the catalyst's capability by providing a robust coordination environment.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(Gluconic acid)*: Contains several hydroxyl groups for chelation.
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**: Multiple hydroxyls enhance coordination.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**: Ether linkages reduce the availability of lone pairs for coordination.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of C6–C8 tend to result in a **high yield**, provided they do not contain functional groups that interfere with coordination.**

  - *Explanation*: Medium-chain aliphatic acids can interact favorably with the catalyst without causing steric hindrance or introducing interfering electronic effects.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **Octanoic acid**: An eight-carbon unbranched chain without interfering groups.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**: Hydroxyl group may lead to undesired interactions.
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**: Amino group may interfere with coordination.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that contain functional groups capable of forming intramolecular hydrogen bonds near the coordinating atoms tend to result in a **low yield** due to sequestering of coordination sites.**

  - *Explanation*: Intramolecular hydrogen bonds can tie up potential coordination sites, preventing them from interacting with the metal center, thus reducing catalytic activity.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**: Intramolecular hydrogen bonding between hydroxyl and formyl groups reduces availability of donor atoms.
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**: Intramolecular interactions sequester coordinating atoms.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**: Amino group is available for coordination without significant intramolecular interactions.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy) on the aromatic ring without additional coordinating groups tend to result in a **low yield**.**

  - *Explanation*: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing its ability to coordinate effectively with the metal center. Without other coordinating sites, this diminishes the catalyst's efficacy.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**: Methyl group decreases carboxylate coordination ability.
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**: Although it contains a pyridyl group, its position limits coordination effectiveness.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**: Hydroxyl group enhances coordination.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with strongly electron-withdrawing groups adjacent to coordinating atoms, which decrease donor atom basicity, tend to result in a **low yield**.**

  - *Explanation*: Strong electron-withdrawing groups reduce the electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening metal-ligand bond strength and leading to less stable catalyst complexes.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**: Fluorinated carbons withdraw electrons strongly, reducing coordination ability.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**: While nitro is electron-withdrawing, its position enhances carboxylate acidity without significantly reducing coordination at the donor atom.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky or hydrophobic side chains lacking additional coordination sites tend to result in a **low yield**.**

  - *Explanation*: Bulky or hydrophobic side chains can cause steric hindrance, preventing effective coordination to the metal center. Lack of additional coordination sites reduces the potential for stabilizing interactions.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(Phenylalanine)*: Phenyl group is bulky and lacks coordinating ability.
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**: Side chain may cause steric hindrance and lacks additional coordination sites.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(Tryptophan)*: Indole ring can participate in coordination.

    Current_Rules:
    ---

**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxyl or coordinating functional groups tend to result in a **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: α-Amino acids with side chains that have additional carboxyl groups or other coordinating functionalities (e.g., hydroxyl, amino, indole rings) can form stable chelate complexes with metal centers. This multidentate coordination enhances the catalyst's effectiveness by stabilizing the metal-ligand complex.

  - **High Yield Examples**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(Aspartic acid)*: Contains an extra carboxyl group in the side chain for additional coordination.
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(Glutamic acid)*: Side chain has an additional carboxyl group, allowing for bidentate coordination.
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(Tryptophan)*: Indole ring can participate in metal coordination through π-interactions or lone pairs.

  - **Low Yield Examples**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(Phenylalanine)*: Phenyl side chain lacks additional coordinating sites.
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(Acetylated Lysine)*: Acetylation reduces the availability of the amino group for coordination.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with functional groups capable of coordinating to the metal center at the para position (e.g., amino, nitro, hydroxyl) tend to result in a **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Functional groups at the para position that can act as electron donors or acceptors facilitate coordination with the metal center. This dual coordination stabilizes the catalyst complex and enhances reactivity.

  - **High Yield Examples**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**: Para-amino group provides an additional site for metal coordination.
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**: Nitro group can coordinate through oxygen atoms.

  - **Low Yield Examples**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**: Methyl group is not capable of coordination and is electron-donating, reducing carboxylate acidity.
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**: Formyl group may not effectively coordinate due to potential intramolecular interactions or steric effects.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that contain functional groups capable of forming five- or six-membered chelate rings with the metal center tend to result in a **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: The formation of stable five- or six-membered chelate rings through coordination of functional groups (e.g., amino, thiol, hydroxyl) with the metal enhances the stability and activity of the catalyst.

  - **High Yield Examples**:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**: Amino and carboxyl groups can chelate to form a stable six-membered ring.
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**: Thiol and carboxyl groups can form a five-membered chelate ring.
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**: Hydroxyl group and carboxyl group can participate in chelation.

  - **Low Yield Examples**:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**: Chain length too long to form stable chelate rings with the metal center.
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**: Similar issue with chain length preventing effective chelation.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of C6 to C8 and without additional functional groups tend to result in a **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Medium-chain aliphatic acids can interact with the metal center without steric hindrance or interference from other functional groups. Their hydrophobic nature may also influence the microenvironment around the catalyst favorably.

  - **High Yield Examples**:
    - **Octanoic acid**: An eight-carbon unbranched carboxylic acid lacking additional functional groups.

  - **Low Yield Examples**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**: Presence of a hydroxyl group may interfere with coordination or solubility.
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**: Amino group may not be positioned optimally for coordination and could introduce steric hindrance.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are polyhydroxy carboxylic acids, containing multiple hydroxyl groups capable of chelation, tend to result in a **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase the number of coordination sites, enabling polydentate binding to the metal center. This enhances the stability and reactivity of the catalyst complex.

  - **High Yield Examples**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(Gluconic acid)*: Multiple hydroxyl groups facilitate strong chelation.
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**: Rich in hydroxyl groups for coordination.

  - **Low Yield Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**: Ether linkages reduce the availability of lone pairs for coordination due to electron delocalization over the ether oxygen.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are perfluorinated carboxylic acids tend to result in a **low yield** due to strong electron-withdrawing effects.**

  - **Explanation**: The electron-withdrawing nature of fluorine atoms reduces the basicity of the carboxylate oxygen, weakening its ability to coordinate effectively with the metal center. This leads to less stable catalyst complexes.

  - **Low Yield Examples**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**: High degree of fluorination diminishes coordination ability.

  - **High Yield Examples**:
    - **Octanoic acid**: Lacks electron-withdrawing groups, maintaining effective coordination capability.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with ether linkages adjacent to the carboxyl group tend to result in a **low yield** due to decreased coordination ability.**

  - **Explanation**: Ether oxygens have lone pairs that are delocalized, reducing their availability for effective coordination with the metal center. This impairs the formation of stable catalyst complexes.

  - **Low Yield Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**: Multiple ether linkages adjacent to the carboxyl group.
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**: Ether linkages interfere with coordination despite the presence of an amino group.

  - **High Yield Examples**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**: Contains hydroxyl groups instead of ethers, enhancing coordination.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with ortho-substituted hydroxyl or formyl groups capable of intramolecular hydrogen bonding tend to result in a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Intramolecular hydrogen bonding sequesters potential coordination sites, reducing their availability to interact with the metal center. This diminishes the catalyst's effectiveness.

  - **Low Yield Examples**:
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**: Ortho hydroxyl and formyl groups may engage in intramolecular hydrogen bonding.
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**: Intramolecular interactions hinder coordination.

  - **High Yield Examples**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**: Para-substituted amino group remains available for coordination without significant intramolecular interactions.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains lacking additional coordinating functionalities tend to result in a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Bulky hydrophobic side chains can cause steric hindrance, preventing effective coordination between the modifier and the metal center. The absence of additional coordination sites further reduces catalyst stability.

  - **Low Yield Examples**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(Phenylalanine)*: Phenyl side chain is bulky and lacks coordinating ability.
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**: Acetylated side chain reduces coordination potential.

  - **High Yield Examples**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(Tryptophan)*: Indole ring can participate in additional coordination.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with heteroatoms positioned to coordinate with the metal center tend to result in a **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen) in aromatic rings can serve as additional coordination sites. When positioned appropriately, they enhance chelation, stabilize the catalyst complex, and improve reaction yield.

  - **High Yield Examples**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(Nicotinic acid)*: Nitrogen atom at position 3 relative to the carboxyl group facilitates coordination.
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**: Nitrogen atoms in the pyrazole ring coordinate with the metal center.
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**: Carbonyl and heterocyclic nitrogen provide coordination sites.

  - **Low Yield Examples**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**: Nitrogen atom is not positioned optimally for effective chelation.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing multiple electron-donating ether linkages and lacking effective coordinating groups tend to result in a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: The presence of multiple ether linkages can increase flexibility but may reduce the overall electron density available for coordination due to electron delocalization. Without strong coordinating groups, this leads to weaker metal-ligand interactions.

  - **Low Yield Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**: Ether linkages dominate the structure, reducing coordination ability.
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**: Despite the amino group, ether linkages interfere with effective coordination.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with side chains capable of forming internal hydrogen bonds or zwitterionic structures tend to result in a **low yield** due to reduced availability of coordination sites.**

  - **Explanation**: Internal hydrogen bonding or zwitterionic forms can sequester donor atoms (e.g., amino and carboxyl groups), making them less available for coordination with the metal center.

  - **Low Yield Examples**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**: Acetamido group may form internal hydrogen bonds.
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**: Potential for internal interactions reduces coordination.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with functional groups that introduce steric bulk near the coordinating sites without providing additional coordination tend to result in a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Steric hindrance near the coordination sites can impede the approach and binding of the metal center, thus reducing the catalyst's efficiency.

  - **Low Yield Examples**:
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**: Trifluoroacetyl group adds steric bulk and strong electron-withdrawing effects.
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** *(if low yield)*: Methoxy groups increase steric hindrance without enhancing coordination.

  - **High Yield Examples**:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**: Hydroxyl group can coordinate, mitigating steric effects.

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are keto acids with carbonyl groups positioned to participate in chelation tend to result in a **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Carbonyl groups adjacent to carboxyl groups can act as additional coordination sites, forming stable chelate rings with the metal center.

  - **High Yield Examples**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**: Carbonyl groups contribute to chelation.
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** *(if high yield)*: Keto group adjacent to carboxyl group enhances coordination.

  - **Low Yield Examples**:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**: May lack optimal positioning for effective chelation.

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with functional groups capable of engaging in π-backbonding or π-interactions with the metal center tend to result in a **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Aromatic rings and unsaturated systems can interact with metal orbitals, stabilizing the metal complex through π-backbonding or π-interactions.

  - **High Yield Examples**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(Tryptophan)*: Indole ring can participate in π-interactions.
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**: Aromatic ring with nitrogen atoms enhances metal interaction.

  - **Low Yield Examples**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(Phenylalanine)*: Phenyl ring less effective in coordination compared to heteroaromatic systems.
