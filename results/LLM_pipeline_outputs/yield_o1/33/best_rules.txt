**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are α-amino acids with two carboxyl groups (dicarboxylic amino acids) give **high yield**.
  - *Examples*: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (glutamic acid).
  - *Rationale*: The presence of two carboxyl groups enhances coordination with metal centers, stabilizing the catalyst and facilitating electron transfer.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted at the para position with groups capable of coordinating with metal ions (e.g., amino, hydroxy, nitro) give **high yield**; those with non-coordinating substituents (e.g., methyl, formyl) give **low yield**.
  - *High yield examples*: 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid.
  - *Low yield examples*: 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-formylbenzoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Coordinating groups at the para position enhance metal-ligand interactions, improving catalyst stability and activity.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing nitrogen heterocycles capable of coordinating with metal centers give **high yield**.
  - *Examples*: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (nicotinic acid), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles coordinate with metal ions, enhancing catalyst performance through improved electron transfer and stabilization.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains (polyhydroxy carboxylic acids) give **high yield**.
  - *Example*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid).
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups facilitate hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst, stabilizing reactive intermediates.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (6 to 10 carbons) without additional polar functional groups give **high yield**; those with terminal polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) give **low yield**.
  - *High yield example*: Octanoic acid.
  - *Low yield examples*: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Hydrophobic chains enhance interactions with organic substrates and improve the catalyst's microenvironment, while terminal polar groups may introduce steric hindrance or disrupt catalyst binding.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with thiol (–SH) groups on short aliphatic chains (three carbons or fewer) give **high yield**; those with thiol groups attached to aromatic rings give **low yield**.
  - *High yield example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.
  - *Low yield example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols provide favorable coordination with metal centers without deactivating the catalyst, while aromatic thiols may bind too strongly, inhibiting catalytic activity.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups give **low yield**.
  - *Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can undergo side reactions or form inactive complexes with metal centers, deactivating the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with amide bonds within their structures (excluding simple amino acids) give **low yield**.
  - *Examples*: 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid, (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Amide groups may compete with the catalyst for metal binding or block active sites, reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with strongly electron-withdrawing groups such as perfluoroalkyl chains give **low yield**.
  - *Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups decrease electron density around coordinating atoms, disrupting catalyst interactions and electron transfer.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing polyether chains (i.e., multiple ether linkages) give **low yield**.
  - *Example*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Polyether chains can interfere with the coordination environment of the catalyst and decrease solubility in the reaction medium, hindering catalytic activity.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acid groups (α-keto acids) or within the aliphatic chain give **low yield** unless the ketone is part of an extended conjugated system, which can give **high yield**.
  - *Low yield example*: 4-oxoheptanedioic acid.
  - *High yield example*: 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Simple ketone groups may form inhibitory complexes with metal centers, while conjugated ketones can stabilize the catalyst through resonance.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers containing indole or other large aromatic systems give **high yield**.
  - *Example*: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan).
  - *Rationale*: Large aromatic systems enhance π-π interactions and can stabilize transition states, improving catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with terminal amino groups on aliphatic chains (alkylamines) give **high yield**.
  - *Example*: 5-aminopentanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Terminal amino groups coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity through additional metal-ligand interactions.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with ortho-hydroxyl groups (salicylic acid derivatives) give **low yield**.
  - *Example*: 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Ortho-hydroxyl groups can form strong chelates with metal centers, potentially deactivating the catalyst by forming stable, inactive complexes.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with phenolic hydroxyl groups attached to aliphatic chains give **high yield**; those with phenolic groups directly linked to the aromatic carboxylic acid ring give **low yield**.
  - *High yield example*: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.
  - *Low yield example*: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: The separation of the phenolic group from the carboxylic acid via an aliphatic chain reduces intramolecular chelation, enhancing coordination with the catalyst, whereas direct attachment may lead to strong intramolecular interactions that hinder catalyst binding.
