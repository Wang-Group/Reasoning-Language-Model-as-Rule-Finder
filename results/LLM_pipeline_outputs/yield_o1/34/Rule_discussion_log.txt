- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and unambiguous, focusing on modifiers with aldehyde groups directly attached to aromatic rings, resulting in low yields. It provides adequate property insight, suggesting that such groups negatively influence the reaction, possibly due to the reactivity of the aldehyde interfering with the catalyst. The rule's complexity is appropriate, considering specific sub-structures, and it is supported by two data points with no counter-examples.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is relatively clear but could benefit from more precise definitions of electron-withdrawing substituents. It offers acceptable property insight into how these groups enhance yield, likely by stabilizing reaction intermediates. The complexity is good, considering specific substituents on aromatic rings. Coverage includes supporting examples, though addressing potential exceptions (e.g., perfluorinated compounds) would strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear and well-defined, specifying that α-amino acids with two carboxylic acid groups yield high values of yield. The property insight is solid, suggesting that the additional carboxyl group may enhance coordination with the catalyst. The complexity is appropriate, and coverage is adequate, supported by data points without counter-examples.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 effectively communicates how the attachment of thiol groups to different structures influences yield. It provides good property insight, indicating that the nature of the linkage (aliphatic vs. aromatic) affects thiol reactivity. The complexity is high, considering both functional groups and structural context. Coverage is supported by two examples, adequately substantiating the rule.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear and specifies that long aliphatic chains ending with amino groups lead to low yields. While the property insight could be deepened to explain why chain length and terminal amino groups negatively impact the reaction, the rule has acceptable complexity. Coverage is sufficient with two data points, supporting its validity.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear and provides strong property insight into the importance of direct attachment of heteroaromatic rings to carboxylic acid groups, enhancing yield. The complexity is high, considering specific ring structures and attachment points. Coverage is solid, strengthened by acknowledging exceptions, and supported by multiple data points.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 clearly explains how electron-donating substituents on aromatic rings affect yield, resulting in low values. The exception noted demonstrates good property insight, suggesting that longer aliphatic chains can counterbalance the electron-donating effect. Complexity is high, and coverage is adequate with supporting data points and exceptions, making the rule robust.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear, indicating that polyhydroxylated aliphatic acids yield high values of yield. However, coverage is limited to a single data point, which weakens the rule despite its acceptable complexity and property insight into the role of multiple hydroxyl groups in facilitating interactions with the catalyst.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is straightforward and clear but lacks complexity and has limited coverage, supported by only one data point (*octanoic acid*). The property insight is minimal, suggesting that simple fatty acids are favorable, but without additional data, the rule's strength is reduced.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is relatively clear and provides good property insight into how different aromatic side chains in α-amino acids influence yield—indole rings yielding high values and phenyl rings yielding low values. The complexity is high, considering specific side chain structures. Coverage is adequate with supporting data points, validating the rule.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear but lacks depth in property insight; it would benefit from an explanation of why perfluorinated alkyl chains lower the yield. Coverage is limited to a single data point, reducing its overall strength despite acceptable complexity.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is clear with high complexity, focusing on amide bonds adjacent to carboxylic acid groups leading to low yields. It could offer more property insight into why these structures reduce yield, perhaps due to steric hindrance or electronic effects. Coverage is acceptable with two supporting data points.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear and has acceptable complexity, addressing ether linkages in aliphatic chains or terminal positions leading to low yields. However, it lacks in property insight and coverage, with only one supporting data point, suggesting a need for further data to strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 is somewhat unclear due to the variability it describes but provides some property insight by noting that electron-donating substituents on aromatic rings can influence the yield in ketone-containing modifiers. The complexity is high, considering multiple structural features, and coverage is acceptable with contrasting examples, but the rule would benefit from greater clarity and detail.

  - *8-aminooctanoic acid* (Low yield)  

**End of Rules**

These rules reflect the observed trends in the dataset and are based on the underlying chemical properties:

- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid and enhance coordination with the metal catalyst, leading to higher yields. Conversely, electron-donating groups decrease acidity and coordination ability, resulting in lower yields.

- **Steric Effects**: Bulky groups can hinder effective coordination with the catalyst. Short-chain modifiers are more favorable due to less steric hindrance.

- **Coordination Ability**: Functional groups like amino, hydroxyl, and thiol groups can act as additional coordination sites, influencing the yield depending on their position and chain length.

- **Chelation**: Polyfunctional modifiers capable of chelating the metal center can stabilize the catalyst complex, affecting the reaction yield.

These rules aim to provide clear guidelines for predicting the outcome of the reaction based on the structure of the molecular modifiers. By applying these rules, one can assess whether a given SMILES structure is likely to yield a high or low value of yield in the reaction.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: **Rule 1** is clear and allows us to determine whether a modifier fits the criteria based on its structure. It provides good physical-chemical insight by associating unbranched saturated chains without additional functional groups with higher yields, likely due to minimal steric hindrance and favorable coordination with the catalyst. The rule is not overly complex and focuses on specific structural features. It is supported by multiple data points—octanoic acid (high yield) and counterexamples like 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid and 7-aminoheptanoic acid (low yield)—meeting the coverage criterion. Overall, Rule 1 scores high on clarity, insight, complexity, and coverage.

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 2** clearly specifies that short-chain aliphatic amino acids with amino groups at the α or ω position yield high yields. The rule offers solid physical-chemical insight by highlighting how chain length and amino group position influence coordination with the catalyst. It combines multiple structural factors, adding to its complexity in a balanced way. With supporting examples like aspartic acid, glutamic acid, and 5-aminopentanoic acid (all high yield), and counterexamples such as 6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid and 8-aminooctanoic acid (low yield), the rule has strong coverage. Rule 2 performs well across all criteria.

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 3** is clear in its structural description, focusing on aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position yielding high yields. It provides adequate physical-chemical insight by explaining how electron-withdrawing groups enhance acidity and coordination with the metal catalyst. The rule effectively combines aromatic structure with electronic effects, achieving a good balance of complexity. Supported by data points like 4-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid (high yield), and counterexamples like 4-methylbenzoic acid and 4-formylbenzoic acid (low yield), it meets the coverage criterion. Rule 3 scores high on all fronts.

- **Comment 4**: **Rule 4** offers a clear criterion by identifying heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the ring as yielding high yields. The physical-chemical insight is strong, suggesting that such structures enhance coordination due to the heteroatoms and ring electronics. The rule combines ring type and functional group position, bringing in suitable complexity. With examples like nicotinic acid, pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, and 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid (all high yield), and a counterexample, 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (low yield), it has adequate coverage. Rule 4 scores well on all criteria.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** is clear in specifying polyhydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids (sugar acids) yield high yields. The physical-chemical insight is sound, attributing the enhanced yield to multiple coordination sites provided by the hydroxyl groups. The complexity is appropriate, focusing on modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups in conjunction with a carboxylic acid. While supported by data points like gluconic acid and a polyhydroxylated acetic acid derivative (both high yield), coverage is limited to these examples. Despite the limited data, the rule is acceptable and scores well on clarity, insight, and complexity.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** provides a clear distinction between aliphatic thiols (yielding high yields) and aromatic thiols (yielding low yields). The rule offers good physical-chemical insight by suggesting that aliphatic thiols facilitate coordination without poisoning the catalyst, whereas aromatic thiols may bind too strongly. It combines functional group type and position, adding suitable complexity. Supported by examples like 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid (high yield) and 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid (low yield), the rule meets the coverage criterion. Rule 6 performs well across all criteria.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** is generally clear but could benefit from refinement. It states that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position yield low yields due to decreased acidity. However, it acknowledges an exception with 4-aminobenzoic acid (high yield) because the amino group can act as a bidentate ligand, enhancing coordination. The rule demonstrates physical-chemical insight into electronic effects but may confuse users due to the exception. It balances complexity by considering both electronic properties and functional group effects. Coverage is adequate with examples and counterexamples. Rule 7 meets most criteria but could improve on clarity regarding exceptions.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** is clear in specifying that perfluorinated alkyl chains yield low yields. It provides logical physical-chemical insight, as perfluorinated groups are strongly electron-withdrawing and may destabilize the catalyst complex. The rule is not overly complex but is specific. However, coverage is limited to a single data point—nonafluoropentanoic acid (low yield)—which weakens its overall score. More data points are needed to strengthen this rule. Rule 8 scores well on clarity and insight but falls short on coverage.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** clearly states that modifiers with aldehyde groups directly attached to aromatic rings yield low yields. The physical-chemical insight is reasonable, considering potential side reactions or strong binding to the catalyst. The rule is straightforward in complexity and is supported by two data points—4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (both low yield)—meeting the coverage criterion. Rule 9 scores well across all criteria.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** is moderately clear, discussing α-amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains and their variable effects on yield. It provides valuable physical-chemical insight, distinguishing between indole rings (tryptophan, high yield) that may promote π-π interactions and phenyl rings (phenylalanine, low yield) that may cause steric hindrance. The complexity arises from considering both the amino acid backbone and side chain nature. Coverage is acceptable with at least two data points. Rule 10 meets the criteria but could be clearer in its presentation.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** is clear, focusing on modifiers with ether linkages in aliphatic chains yielding low yields. The physical-chemical insight suggests potential distraction of the metal center due to ether oxygen coordination. The rule is simple in complexity. However, it is based on a single data point—2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid (low yield)—which limits its coverage and overall score. Additional data would strengthen this rule.

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** clearly states that modifiers with amide bonds adjacent to carboxylic acid groups yield low yields. The physical-chemical insight is sound, citing reduced availability of lone pairs and steric effects. The complexity is moderate, involving specific functional group arrangements. Supported by examples like 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid and a modified amino acid derivative (both low yield), the rule meets the coverage criterion. Rule 12 scores well on clarity, insight, complexity, and coverage.

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13** is clear in indicating that ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acids generally lead to low yields, with exceptions if electron-donating groups are present. The physical-chemical insight is strong, explaining electron-withdrawing effects and compensation by electron-donating groups. It demonstrates appropriate complexity by considering combinations of functional groups and their electronic impacts. Coverage is acceptable with examples like 4-oxoheptanedioic acid (low yield) and an exception—4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid (high yield). Rule 13 meets all criteria effectively.

- **Comment 14**: **Rule 14** is somewhat broad but clear, stating that fused-ring carboxylic acids or those containing lactone structures yield high yields. The physical-chemical insight suggests that rigid structures may facilitate precise coordination. The complexity is moderate, focusing on overall molecular architecture. However, coverage is limited to a single data point—1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid (high yield)—which weakens the rule's strength. Additional examples are needed for better support. Rule 14 meets criteria for clarity and insight but lacks in coverage.

- **Comment 15**: **Rule 15** is clear and specifies that modifiers with amino groups on long aliphatic chains (more than 6 carbons) yield low yields. It provides logical physical-chemical insight by attributing decreased yields to steric hindrance and unfavorable interactions. The complexity is appropriate, considering both chain length and functional group placement. Supported by data points like 7-aminoheptanoic acid and 8-aminooctanoic acid (both low yield), the rule meets the coverage criterion. Rule 15 scores high across all criteria.

**End of Rules**

These rules capture the relationship between the structural features of the molecular modifiers and the reaction yield. They consider the following underlying physical-chemical properties:

- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase acidity and coordination ability, enhancing yield. Electron-donating groups decrease these properties, lowering yield.
- **Steric Effects**: Bulky substituents and long chains introduce steric hindrance, affecting the modifier's ability to interact with the catalyst.
- **Coordination Ability**: Functional groups capable of coordinating with the metal center (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, thiol groups) influence yield based on their position and the overall structure.
- **Chelation and Rigid Structures**: Modifiers that can chelate or have rigid structures facilitate better interaction with the catalyst, improving yield.

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a given molecular modifier will result in a high or low reaction yield based on its structural features.

**End of Rules**

These rules capture the relationship between the structural features of the molecular modifiers and the reaction yield by considering the following underlying physical-chemical properties:

- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase acidity and enhance the ability of the modifier to coordinate with the metal catalyst, leading to higher yields. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and weaken coordination, resulting in lower yields.

- **Steric Effects**: Bulky substituents and long aliphatic chains introduce steric hindrance, which can impede the effective interaction between the modifier and the catalyst, leading to lower yields.

- **Coordination Ability**: Functional groups capable of strong coordination with the metal center (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, thiol groups) influence the yield based on their position and the overall structure of the modifier. Optimal positioning enhances coordination and increases yield.

- **Chelation and Rigidity**: Modifiers that can chelate the metal center or have rigid structures facilitate better alignment and interaction with the catalyst, improving the reaction yield.

**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: **Rule 1** is clear and allows for easy determination of high-yield modifiers by specifying straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups. The physical-chemical insight is strong, attributing high yield to minimal steric hindrance and favorable hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst. The rule is simple yet effective, covering multiple data points, including *octanoic acid* (high yield) and counterexamples like *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* and *8-aminooctanoic acid* (both low yield). This rule strikes a good balance between simplicity and coverage.

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 2** provides clear criteria by differentiating α-amino acids based on side-chain characteristics—short, non-bulky side chains lead to high yield, while bulky or aromatic side chains result in low yield. The physical-chemical insight is adequate, focusing on steric effects and coordination with metal centers. The rule is of moderate complexity, considering combinations of substructures (amino acids with varying side chains), and is supported by multiple data points such as *aspartic acid*, *glutamic acid*, and *5-aminopentanoic acid* (high yield), and *phenylalanine* and *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (low yield). It maintains a suitable balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 3** is generally clear, focusing on aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position (excluding aldehydes) yielding high yield. The physical-chemical insight is solid, linking increased acidity to enhanced coordination with the catalyst. However, there is a discrepancy with *4-aminobenzoic acid*, which, despite having an electron-donating amino group, yields a high value. This indicates a potential exception or limitation in the rule. The rule has moderate complexity and is supported by multiple data points but may require refinement to account for such exceptions.

- **Comment 4**: **Rule 4** is clear and specifies that nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the heterocycle yield high yield due to strong coordination with metal catalysts. The physical-chemical insight is adequate, emphasizing coordination ability. The rule is moderately complex, considering both heteroatoms and aromatic structures, and is supported by data points like *nicotinic acid*, *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid* (high yield), and the counterexample *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (low yield). It achieves a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** is clear, indicating that thiol groups on short aliphatic chains lead to high yield, whereas thiol groups on aromatic rings result in low yield. The physical-chemical insight is adequate, focusing on sulfur-metal coordination. The rule is specific and of moderate complexity, considering the position of thiol groups. However, it has lower coverage with only two data points: *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid* (high yield) and *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* (low yield). The rule is valuable but has limited impact due to low coverage.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** is clear, stating that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains yield high value due to enhanced hydrogen bonding and catalyst stabilization. The physical-chemical insight is strong. The rule is of moderate complexity, considering polyhydroxylation, but has limited coverage with data points like *gluconic acid* and *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid* (both high yield) and the counterexample *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (low yield). The low coverage reduces its overall significance.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** is clear but lacks sufficient coverage, being supported by only one data point: *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid* (low yield). The physical-chemical insight is adequate, focusing on the electron-withdrawing effects of fluorine disrupting catalyst interactions. The rule is simple and specific but needs more data points to strengthen its validity.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** is clear and straightforward, indicating that modifiers with aldehyde groups attached to aromatic rings yield low value due to potential side reactions and inhibited coordination. The physical-chemical insight is adequate. The rule is simple and is supported by two data points: *4-formylbenzoic acid* and *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid* (both low yield). The coverage is minimal but acceptable for such a specific rule.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** is clear, focusing on α-amino acids with indole side chains yielding high value due to π–π stacking and possible coordination via the indole nitrogen. The physical-chemical insight is strong. The rule is complex, considering specific side-chain interactions, but it has low coverage with only two data points: *tryptophan* (high yield) and *phenylalanine* (low yield). The low coverage limits its general applicability.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** is clear and states that long aliphatic chains with polar functional groups yield low value due to steric hindrance and decreased coordination efficiency. The physical-chemical insight is solid. The rule is of moderate complexity and is supported by multiple data points such as *7-aminoheptanoic acid*, *8-aminooctanoic acid*, and *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (all low yield), with *octanoic acid* serving as a counterexample (high yield). This rule achieves a good balance between complexity and coverage.

**Analysis of Current Rules and Dataset**

After analyzing the provided dataset and the current set of rules, I've identified opportunities to refine the rules for better clarity, coverage, and alignment with the underlying physical-chemical principles. Below is a revised set of rules that more effectively describe the relationship between molecular modifiers and the relative high or low yield of the reaction.

---

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups yield a high value of yield due to favorable hydrophobic interactions and minimal steric hindrance. Introduction of polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) lowers the yield.**

  *Examples*:
  - *Octanoic acid* (High yield)

  *Counterexamples*:
  - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Low yield; hydroxyl group increases polarity)
  - *8-aminooctanoic acid* (Low yield; amino group introduces polarity and potential unwanted interactions)

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with short, non-bulky, polar side chains (e.g., carboxylate, hydroxyl) yield a high value of yield due to effective coordination with the catalyst's metal centers. Bulky or aromatic side chains reduce the yield due to steric hindrance and decreased coordination efficiency.**

  *Examples*:
  - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid, High yield)
  - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid, High yield)
  - *5-aminopentanoic acid* (High yield)

  *Counterexamples*:
  - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine, Low yield)
  - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (Low yield; additional amide group adds steric bulk)

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halogens) at the para position yield a high value of yield due to increased acidity and enhanced metal coordination. Electron-donating groups or aldehydes at the para position lower the yield due to decreased acidity or potential side reactions.**

  *Examples*:
  - *4-nitrobenzoic acid* (High yield)
  - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid* (High yield)

  *Counterexamples*:

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the heterocycle yield a high value of yield due to strong coordination through the heteroatom. Additional aromatic rings or bulky substituents decrease the yield due to steric hindrance.**

  *Examples*:
  - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid, High yield)
  - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid* (High yield)

  *Example*:
  - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid* (High yield)

  *Counterexample*:
  - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* (Low yield)

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are polyhydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids (sugar acids) yield a high value of yield due to multiple hydrogen bonding interactions and chelation with the catalyst. Monohydroxylated acids typically yield a low value of yield.**

  - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid* (High yield)

  *Counterexample*:
  - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Low yield; single hydroxyl group insufficient)

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains yield a low value of yield due to the electron-withdrawing effects of fluorine atoms, which reduce the coordinating ability of the carboxylate group.**

  *Example*:
  - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid* (Low yield)

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde groups conjugated to aromatic rings yield a low value of yield due to potential side reactions with the catalyst and inhibition of coordination sites.**

  *Examples*:
  - *4-formylbenzoic acid* (Low yield)
  - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid* (Low yield)

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with indole side chains yield a high value of yield due to π–π stacking interactions and potential coordination via the indole nitrogen. Amino acids with phenyl side chains without heteroatoms yield a low value of yield due to lack of coordination ability and increased steric hindrance.**

  *Counterexample*:
  - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine, Low yield)

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with long aliphatic chains (7 carbons or more) bearing polar functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) yield a low value of yield due to increased steric hindrance and reduced effective coordination with the catalyst.**

  *Examples*:
  - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Low yield)
  - *7-aminoheptanoic acid* (Low yield)
  - *8-aminooctanoic acid* (Low yield)

  *Counterexample*:
  - *Octanoic acid* (High yield; absence of polar groups)

---

  *Example*:
  - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid* (Low yield)

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with secondary functional groups capable of chelation or competition with the catalyst's active sites (e.g., ketones, amides, additional carboxyl groups) yield a low value of yield due to interference with catalyst performance.**

  *Examples*:
  - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid* (Low yield; ketone group)
  - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (Low yield; amide group)

  *Example*:
  - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (Low yield)

---

**End of Rules**

**Underlying Physical-Chemical Properties**

- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing coordination with the metal catalyst and increasing yield. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity, reducing coordination efficiency and yield.

- **Steric Effects**: Bulky substituents and long chains with polar groups introduce steric hindrance, interfering with catalyst access and decreasing yield.

- **Coordination Ability**: Functional groups capable of strong coordination (e.g., amino, thiol, indole nitrogen) enhance interactions with the metal catalyst, improving yield. Proper positioning is crucial for effective coordination.

- **Hydrogen Bonding and Chelation**: Polyhydroxylated acids can form multiple hydrogen bonds and chelate with the metal center, stabilizing the catalyst complex and increasing yield.

- **π–π Interactions**: Modifiers with aromatic rings capable of π–π stacking (e.g., indole rings) stabilize the catalyst-modifier complex, enhancing yield.

- **Hydrophobic Interactions**: Non-polar aliphatic chains favor hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst, leading to higher yields.

- **Competitive Coordination**: Functional groups like aldehydes and ketones may compete with the catalyst's active site or participate in side reactions, reducing yield.

**Coverage and Balance**

This set of 13 rules maintains a suitable balance between simplicity and complexity:

- **Simple Rules with Higher Coverage**:
  - **Rule 1** addresses straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids.
  - **Rule 2** covers α-amino acids based on side chain characteristics.
  - **Rule 3** focuses on aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups.

- **Complex Rules with Lower Coverage**:
  - **Rule 5** and **Rule 9** target specific functional groups like thiols and indole rings.
  - **Rule 6** addresses polyhydroxylated acids with multiple hydrogen bonding capabilities.

These rules collectively cover a broad range of modifiers in the dataset, providing clear guidance for predicting the reaction yield based on structural features.

**Application**

Applying these rules allows for the prediction of whether a given molecular modifier will result in a high or low yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**:
  - **Rule 1** is clear and unambiguous. It specifies that straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with no additional functional groups result in a **high** yield. The rule is easy to apply, and the example of octanoic acid supports it. The physical-chemical insight is sound, attributing high yield to minimal steric hindrance and optimal catalyst interaction. However, coverage is limited to one data point, so while the rule is simple and clear, it would benefit from additional supporting examples.

---

- **Comment 2**:
  - **Rule 2** provides a clear structural criterion: aliphatic carboxylic acids with a thiol (-SH) group on a short (3-carbon) chain result in a **high** yield. The rule offers good chemical insight by suggesting enhanced coordination with metal centers due to the thiol group. Complexity is appropriate, considering both functional groups and chain length. Coverage is limited to a single example (3-sulfanylpropanoic acid), so the rule would be stronger with more supporting data.

---

- **Comment 3**:
  - **Rule 3** is clear in identifying aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position as resulting in a **high** yield. It provides solid chemical reasoning about increased acidity improving coordination with the metal catalyst. The complexity is suitable, and coverage is good with at least two supporting examples (4-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid). This rule balances complexity and coverage effectively.

---

- **Comment 4**:
  - **Rule 4** states that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position result in a **low** yield. While the rule is clear and the chemical insight about decreased acidity is plausible, there is a contradiction in the dataset. The modifier *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid* is categorized as having a **high** yield, despite fitting the rule's criteria. This inconsistency suggests that the rule may need refinement or exceptions to account for such cases. Coverage is adequate, but the contradiction impacts the rule's reliability.

---

- **Comment 5**:
  - **Rule 5** clearly differentiates between amino acids with short, polar side chains resulting in a **high** yield and those with bulky or aromatic side chains resulting in a **low** yield. The rule provides good chemical insight into steric effects and catalyst interaction. It considers combinations of substructures, adding to its complexity. Coverage is strong, with multiple data points supporting both outcomes. The rule achieves a good balance between complexity and coverage.

---

- **Comment 6**:
  - **Rule 6** identifies nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the ring as resulting in a **high** yield. The clarity is high, and the chemical insight about enhanced coordination through lone pairs is sound. The rule's complexity is appropriate, and it is supported by several data points (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid). This rule is well-balanced and robust.

---

- **Comment 7**:
  - **Rule 7** is clear in stating that aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups result in a **low** yield. The chemical insight regarding potential side reactions or catalyst inhibition is plausible. The rule is specific yet simple, and coverage is adequate with examples like 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid. This rule is effective in its scope and application.

---

- **Comment 8**:
  - **Rule 8** specifies that modifiers with long aliphatic chains (7 carbons or more) containing additional polar functional groups result in a **low** yield. The rule is clear and considers the combination of chain length and functional groups, adding complexity. The chemical reasoning about steric hindrance and disrupted interactions is valid. Coverage includes multiple data points (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid), providing strong support.

---

- **Comment 9**:
  - **Rule 9** states that polyhydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids (sugar acids) result in a **high** yield. The clarity is high, and the chemical insight about chelation enhancing catalyst stability is solid. Complexity is moderate, and coverage is sufficient with examples like gluconic acid. The rule is well-balanced and contributes valuably to understanding modifier effects.

---

- **Comment 10**:
  - **Rule 10** indicates that modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains result in a **low** yield. The rule is clear, but the chemical insight, while plausible due to electron-withdrawing effects, could be expanded. Complexity is low, focusing on a single feature. Coverage is limited to one example (nonafluoropentanoic acid), so additional data points would strengthen the rule.

  - **Rule 12** claims that modifiers containing sulfhydryl (-SH) groups attached to aromatic rings result in a **low** yield. The rule is clear, and the explanation about steric hindrance is logical. Complexity is moderate. However, coverage is based on a single example (4-sulfanylbenzoic acid). The rule would benefit from additional supporting data.

---

- **Comment 13**:
  - **Rule 13** specifies that aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages in the chain result in a **low** yield. The rule is clear and provides chemical insight about increased polarity interfering with catalyst interactions. Complexity is low. Coverage is limited to one data point (2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid), suggesting the need for more examples to confirm the rule.

---

- **Comment 1**: *Rule 2* lacks clarity in defining the exceptions. Phrases like "capable of additional interactions such as π–π stacking or chelation" are ambiguous without specifying structural features. Providing clear criteria or examples for these exceptions would improve the rule's clarity.

- **Comment 2**: *Rule 9* is supported by only one data point, which limits its coverage and reliability. Additional examples of modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains and their corresponding yields would strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 3**: Similarly, *Rule 10* is based on a single data point. To enhance its coverage, more data points involving aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages should be included.

- **Comment 4**: *Rule 13* also suffers from low coverage, relying on just one example. Expanding the dataset to include more modifiers with multiple carboxyl groups separated by a ketone group is necessary for a robust rule.

- **Comment 5**: Some rules, such as *Rule 4* and *Rule 14*, mention exceptions and compensating effects but lack precise criteria. Defining the structural features that lead to these exceptions would improve clarity and assist in accurate predictions.

- **Comment 6**: Overall, while the rules provide valuable physical-chemical insights and consider combinations of substructures, the limited coverage and ambiguities in certain rules suggest that they may not be sufficient for reliably predicting the yield outcomes of new modifiers.

These rules collectively describe how combinations of functional groups and structural features in molecular modifiers influence the **high** or **low** yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By focusing on direct combinations of substructures and considering physical-chemical properties such as metal coordination ability, steric effects, electronic effects, and hydrogen bonding, we can predict the impact of modifiers on the reaction yield.

- **High Yield Modifiers**: Typically possess functional groups that enhance coordination with the Fe ion without causing steric hindrance. Examples include aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrophobic chains, additional carboxyl or hydroxyl groups, and accessible heteroatoms like nitrogen or sulfur capable of effective metal coordination.

- **Low Yield Modifiers**: Often contain functional groups that interfere with Fe coordination or diminish catalytic activity. These include electron-donating groups that reduce acidity, bulky side chains causing steric hindrance, strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds limiting coordination sites, and electron-withdrawing groups that excessively decrease electron density on coordinating atoms.

These rules collectively describe how combinations of functional groups and structural features in molecular modifiers influence the **high** or **low** yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By focusing on direct combinations of substructures and considering physical and chemical properties such as metal coordination ability, steric effects, electronic effects, and hydrogen bonding, we can predict the impact of modifiers on the reaction yield.

- **High Yield Modifiers**: Typically possess functional groups that enhance coordination with the Fe ion without causing steric hindrance. Examples include aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrophobic chains, additional carboxyl or hydroxyl groups, accessible heteroatoms like nitrogen or sulfur, and flexible linkers connecting aromatic systems.

- **Low Yield Modifiers**: Often contain functional groups that interfere with Fe coordination or diminish catalytic activity. These include electron-donating groups that reduce acidity, bulky side chains causing steric hindrance, strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds limiting coordination sites, and electron-withdrawing groups that excessively decrease electron density on coordinating atoms.

By applying these rules, one can predict the potential effectiveness of new molecular modifiers in the reaction and guide the design of modifiers to optimize and control the yield.

    - *4-Pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* — Low yield

  - *Explanation*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles serve as effective coordination sites for the Fe ion when directly attached, promoting catalyst formation. Rigid structures with additional aromatic rings can cause steric hindrance, reducing coordination efficiency and yield.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are **amino acids with side chains containing nitrogen heterocycles** result in a **high** yield; **amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains** lacking coordinating heteroatoms result in a **low** yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *(2R)-2-Amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (Tryptophan) — High yield
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *(2S)-2-Amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine) — Low yield

  - *Explanation*: Nitrogen heterocycles in side chains provide additional coordination sites for the Fe ion. This strengthens metal-ligand interactions and improves catalytic activity. Bulky side chains without coordinating heteroatoms can cause steric hindrance, preventing effective interaction with the Fe ion.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with internal thiol groups** result in a **high** yield; **aromatic thiol carboxylic acids** result in a **low** yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *3-Sulfanylpropanoic acid* — High yield
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *4-Sulfanylbenzoic acid* — Low yield

  - *Explanation*: In aliphatic acids, thiol groups are more available for coordination with the Fe ion, enhancing catalyst activity. In aromatic acids, the thiol group's lone pair can delocalize into the aromatic system, reducing its availability for coordination.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups** adjacent to the ring result in a **low** yield.**

  - *Examples*:
    - *4-Formylbenzoic acid* — Low yield
    - *5-Formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid* — Low yield

  - *Explanation*: Aldehyde groups can interact with the Fe ion, forming inactive complexes or engaging in side reactions. This depletes the active catalyst species, lowering the reaction yield.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are **perfluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids** result in a **low** yield.**

  - *Example*:
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid* — Low yield

  - *Explanation*: Electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms decrease electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, weakening its ability to coordinate with the Fe ion. This results in less effective catalyst formation and lower yield.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with **multiple hydroxyl groups**, particularly **polyhydroxy aliphatic acids**, result in a **high** yield.**

  - *Examples*:
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-Pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* — High yield
    - *2-[[1,3-Dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid* — High yield

  - *Explanation*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites and facilitate hydrogen bonding networks. This stabilizes the Fe ion and enhances catalytic activity through effective metal-ligand interactions.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with internal ether linkages** and multiple hydroxyl groups result in a **high** yield; those with **terminal ether groups** and fewer hydroxyls result in a **low** yield.**

  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *2-[[1,3-Dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid* — High yield
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *2-[2-(2-Methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid* — Low yield

  - *Explanation*: Internal ether linkages with multiple hydroxyl groups enhance the ability to coordinate with the Fe ion. Terminal ether groups offer less coordination due to steric hindrance and fewer hydroxyl groups, reducing catalytic effectiveness.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are **amino acids with side chains containing sulfur in a thioether linkage** result in a **low** yield.**

  - *Example*:
    - *2-[[(2S)-2-Amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid* — Low yield

  - *Explanation*: Thioether sulfur is less effective in coordinating with the Fe ion compared to thiol sulfur. Additionally, bulky sulfur-containing side chains can cause steric hindrance, decreasing catalytic efficiency.

These rules describe how combinations of functional groups and structural features in molecular modifiers influence the **high** or **low** yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By focusing on direct combinations of substructures and considering physicochemical properties such as metal coordination ability, steric effects, electronic effects, and hydrogen bonding, we can predict the impact of modifiers on the reaction yield.

- **High Yield Modifiers**: Typically possess functional groups that enhance coordination with the Fe ion without causing steric hindrance. Examples include:

  - **Aliphatic carboxylic acids** with long hydrophobic chains and **no terminal polar groups**.
  - **Amino acids** with additional **carboxylate groups** or **nitrogen-containing heterocycles** in side chains.
  - **Aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-withdrawing groups** at the para position.
  - Compounds with accessible **nitrogen heterocycles** directly attached to the carboxyl group.
  - **Polyhydroxy aliphatic acids** and those with **internal ether linkages** and multiple hydroxyl groups.
  - Aliphatic carboxylic acids with **internal thiol groups**.

- **Low Yield Modifiers**: Often contain functional groups that interfere with Fe coordination or diminish catalytic activity. These include:

  - **Aliphatic acids** with **terminal polar groups** (e.g., hydroxy, amino).
  - **Amino acids** with **bulky, non-coordinating side chains** (e.g., phenyl group).
  - **Aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-donating groups** or **aldehyde groups** adjacent to the ring.
  - Compounds with rigid structures causing **steric hindrance**.
  - **Perfluorinated acids** and **aromatic thiol acids** where coordinating atoms are less available.
  - Amino acids with **thioether-containing side chains**.

By applying these rules, one can predict the potential effectiveness of new molecular modifiers in the reaction and guide the design of modifiers to optimize and control the yield.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is **clear** and allows for an unambiguous determination of yield based on the presence or absence of terminal polar groups in aliphatic carboxylic acids with chains of five or more carbons. The **property insight** is strong, linking hydrophobic interactions and substrate accessibility to catalytic efficiency. The rule considers combinations of substructures—chain length and functional groups—adding **complexity**. The **coverage** is good, supported by multiple data points for both high (e.g., *octanoic acid*) and low yields (e.g., *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*, *7-aminoheptanoic acid*, *8-aminooctanoic acid*). The **balance** between complexity and coverage is appropriate, making this a robust rule.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is **clear**, focusing on amino acids with additional carboxylate groups in the side chain resulting in high yield. The **property insight** is solid, explaining how extra coordination sites enhance catalyst activity. The rule combines structural features—amino acids and dicarboxylic side chains—showing **complexity**. The **coverage** includes at least two supporting data points (*aspartic acid*, *glutamic acid*), satisfying the requirement. The rule strikes a good **balance** between specificity and applicability.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is **clear**, distinguishing between electron-withdrawing and electron-donating para-substituents on aromatic carboxylic acids and their impact on yield. The **property insight** effectively connects substituent effects on acidity and coordination ability with the Fe ion. It involves **complexity** by considering both the aromatic ring and the nature of the substituent. The **coverage** is adequate, with multiple examples for both high (e.g., *4-nitrobenzoic acid*, *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid*) and low yields (e.g., *4-methylbenzoic acid*, *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*). The rule is well-**balanced**, making it reliable.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is **clear** in stating that aromatic carboxylic acids with para amino groups result in high yield. The **property insight** is reasonable, highlighting the amino group's role in bidentate coordination. However, the **coverage** is limited to a single data point (*4-aminobenzoic acid*), which weakens its reliability. To improve **balance**, more data points are needed to support this rule and confirm its general applicability.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is **clear**, distinguishing between nitrogen heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group and those connected via an additional aromatic ring. The **property insight** appropriately explains how direct attachment facilitates coordination. The rule demonstrates **complexity** by considering structural attachment and resulting rigidity. The **coverage** includes positive examples (*pyridine-3-carboxylic acid*, *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*) and a negative example (*4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*), satisfying the criteria. The **balance** between complexity and coverage is effective.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is **clear**, contrasting amino acids with nitrogen heterocycles in side chains (high yield) versus bulky hydrophobic side chains lacking heteroatoms (low yield). The **property insight** connects coordination capability with catalytic activity. While the rule shows **complexity** by considering side-chain functionality, the **coverage** is minimal, supported by one high yield (*tryptophan*) and one low yield example (*phenylalanine*). Enhancing **balance** would require additional data points to strengthen the rule's validity.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is **clear**, distinguishing between aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups. The **property insight** explains the availability of thiol groups for coordination in aliphatic acids. The rule incorporates **complexity** by comparing internal thiol positions and aromatic contexts. However, the **coverage** is limited to one example for each yield outcome (*3-sulfanylpropanoic acid* for high yield, *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* for low yield). To achieve better **balance**, more supporting data is necessary.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is **clear**, stating that aromatic carboxylic acids with adjacent aldehyde groups result in low yield. The **property insight** regarding the formation of inactive complexes is plausible. The rule is not overly complex but sufficiently specific. The **coverage** meets the criteria with two supporting data points (*4-formylbenzoic acid*, *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*). The rule maintains a good **balance** between specificity and supporting evidence.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is **clear**, focusing on perfluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids leading to low yield. The **property insight** about electron-withdrawing effects decreasing coordination ability is relevant. However, the **coverage** is inadequate, relying on a single data point (*2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*). This lack of additional examples undermines the rule's reliability. Improving **balance** requires more data to confirm the rule's general applicability.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is **clear** and articulates that polyhydroxy aliphatic acids result in high yield. The **property insight** effectively links multiple hydroxyl groups with enhanced coordination and hydrogen bonding. The rule considers **complexity** by focusing on compounds with multiple hydroxyl groups. The **coverage** is sufficient, with two high-yielding examples (*pentahydroxyhexanoic acid*, *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*). The **balance** between rule complexity and the amount of supporting data is appropriate.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is **clear** but somewhat complex, differentiating between internal and terminal ether linkages and the number of hydroxyl groups. The **property insight** is sound, explaining how internal ethers and multiple hydroxyls enhance coordination. The **coverage** is minimal, with one high yield (*2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*) and one low yield example (*2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*). To achieve better **balance**, additional data points are needed to reinforce the rule.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is **clear**, stating that amino acids with thioether-containing side chains result in low yield. The **property insight** about the inefficiency of thioether sulfur in coordination is logical. However, the **coverage** is limited to a single data point (*2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid*), which weakens the rule's robustness. Enhancing **balance** would require more examples to substantiate the rule.

    - *5-Formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid* — Low yield

  - *Explanation*: Aldehyde groups can form inactive complexes with Fe ions or participate in side reactions, reducing the availability of active catalyst species.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are **dicarboxylic acids** without additional coordinating groups result in a **low** yield if the carboxyl groups are too distant to effectively chelate the Fe ion.**

  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *4-Oxoheptanedioic acid* — Low yield

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are **amino acids** with side chains containing **sulfur as thioethers** result in a **low** yield.**

  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *2-[[(2S)-2-Amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid* (Methionine derivative) — Low yield

  - *Explanation*: Thioether groups are less effective at coordinating with Fe ions compared to thiols. Additionally, bulky sulfur-containing side chains can introduce steric hindrance, reducing catalyst efficiency.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with **electron-donating substituents** on **aromatic rings** that do not coordinate with Fe ions result in a **low** yield.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-Methylbenzoic acid* — Low yield
    - *3-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* — Low yield

  - *Explanation*: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions, leading to decreased catalyst formation and activity.

These rules illustrate how combinations of functional groups and structural features in molecular modifiers influence the **high** or **low** yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By considering underlying physicochemical properties such as metal coordination ability, steric effects, electronic effects, and hydrogen bonding potential, we can predict the impact of modifiers on the reaction yield.

- **High Yield Modifiers** tend to have:

  - Functional groups that enhance coordination with Fe ions (e.g., additional carboxylate groups, nitrogen heterocycles, multiple hydroxyl groups).
  - Structures that avoid steric hindrance, allowing effective interaction with the catalyst.
  - Substituents capable of coordinating with Fe ions (e.g., amino groups, pyridine rings).

- **Low Yield Modifiers** often possess:

  - Functional groups that interfere with Fe coordination (e.g., electron-donating groups without coordination ability, terminal polar groups on long chains).
  - Bulky or rigid structures causing steric hindrance.
  - Groups that can participate in side reactions or form inactive complexes (e.g., aldehydes, perfluorinated chains).

By applying these rules, researchers can predict the effectiveness of new molecular modifiers and tailor them to optimize and control the reaction yield.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear in its distinction between high and low yield modifiers based on the presence of long aliphatic chains without terminal polar groups. The property insight is strong, linking hydrophobic interactions and the absence of polar groups to improved catalyst interaction and yield. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures (chain length and terminal groups), meeting the complexity criterion. It is well-supported by multiple data points (e.g., octanoic acid for high yield; 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid for low yield), fulfilling the coverage requirement. Overall, the rule strikes an excellent balance between clarity, insight, complexity, and coverage.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 clearly states that amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxyl groups result in high yield. The property insight is solid, attributing enhanced yield to extra coordination sites provided by the additional carboxyl groups. The rule focuses on specific structural features, adding complexity. With at least two supporting data points (aspartic acid and glutamic acid showing high yield), the coverage is adequate. The rule effectively balances specificity and applicability.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 offers clear guidance by differentiating between amino acids with nitrogen heterocycles (high yield) and those with bulky hydrophobic side chains lacking coordinating heteroatoms (low yield). The property insight is meaningful, highlighting the importance of coordination ability and steric effects. Complexity is addressed by considering both the presence of heterocycles and the absence of coordinating atoms in bulky side chains. The rule is supported by data points such as tryptophan (high yield) and phenylalanine (low yield), satisfying the coverage criterion. The balance between complexity and coverage is well-maintained.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear and comprehensive, associating high yield with aromatic carboxylic acids possessing substituents capable of coordinating with Fe ions. The property insight effectively links the presence of coordinating groups to catalyst formation and activity. Complexity is present through consideration of various substituents and their coordinating abilities. Multiple data points (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid and pyridine-3-carboxylic acid for high yield; 4-methylbenzoic acid for low yield) provide substantial coverage. The rule demonstrates a good balance between detailed structural considerations and broad applicability.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 clearly defines that nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids result in high yield. The property insight is appropriate, emphasizing the role of nitrogen atoms as coordination sites. While the rule focuses on a specific modifier class, it includes several examples (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid), meeting the coverage criterion. The specificity adds complexity, and the rule maintains a reasonable balance.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 distinctly contrasts polyhydroxy aliphatic acids (high yield) with ethers lacking multiple hydroxyl groups (low yield). The property insight is solid, attributing increased yield to enhanced coordination through multiple hydroxyl groups. The rule combines functional group presence and absence, adding complexity. Supported by data points like gluconic acid (high yield) and 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid (low yield), the rule satisfies the coverage requirement. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 provides a clear distinction between aliphatic thiol-containing modifiers (high yield) and aromatic thiol-containing modifiers (low yield). The property insight relates the availability of thiol groups for coordination to the yield outcome. However, the coverage is limited, with only one high yield example (3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) and one low yield example (4-sulfanylbenzoic acid). This minimal data support does not fully meet the coverage criterion of having at least two supporting data points per rule, slightly weakening the rule's robustness despite its clarity and insight.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear in stating that perfluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids result in low yield due to diminished coordination ability from electron withdrawal. The property insight is valid. Nevertheless, the rule is based on a single data point (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), which does not satisfy the coverage criterion. The lack of additional supporting examples limits the rule's reliability and applicability.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 clearly associates low yield with aromatic carboxylic acids having aldehyde groups adjacent to the ring. The property insight is strong, explaining how aldehyde groups can form inactive complexes or participate in side reactions. The rule considers specific sub-structures, adding complexity. It is supported by multiple data points (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid), fulfilling the coverage criterion. The balance between specificity and coverage is well-achieved.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 suggests that dicarboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups result in low yield if carboxyl groups cannot effectively chelate the Fe ion due to spatial distance. The property insight is logical. However, the rule is supported by only one data point (4-oxoheptanedioic acid), which does not meet the coverage requirement. This limited data support reduces the rule's overall strength, despite its clear rationale.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 clearly states that amino acids with thioether-containing side chains result in low yield. The property insight concerning the lower coordinating ability of thioethers and potential steric hindrance is valid. The rule's coverage is inadequate, relying on a single data point (a methionine derivative). This insufficient support fails to meet the coverage criterion, affecting the rule's dependability.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is clear in its assertion that electron-donating substituents on aromatic rings, which do not coordinate with Fe ions, result in low yield. The property insight appropriately connects decreased acidity and coordination ability with reduced catalyst formation. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures (electron-donating groups on aromatics lacking coordination ability), fulfilling the complexity criterion. Supported by multiple data points (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid), the rule meets the coverage requirement. The balance between complexity and coverage is effective.

These rules combine multiple functional groups and structural features to predict whether a molecular modifier will result in a high or low yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. They consider underlying physicochemical properties such as metal coordination ability, steric effects, electronic effects, and chelation potential.

By applying these rules, researchers can:

- **Predict High Yield Modifiers**: Look for compounds with functional groups that enhance coordination with Fe ions (e.g., additional carboxylate groups, nitrogen heterocycles, multiple hydroxyl groups, electron-withdrawing substituents).

- **Identify Low Yield Modifiers**: Avoid compounds with functional groups that interfere with Fe coordination (e.g., electron-donating groups, aldehydes, perfluorinated chains) or have steric hindrance.

This approach aids in optimizing and controlling the reaction yield by selecting appropriate molecular modifiers based on their structural features.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are **amino acids** with side chains containing **additional acidic groups** (e.g., carboxyl or hydroxyl groups) result in a **high yield**; those with **non-polar or bulky side chains** result in a **low yield**.**

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *(2S)-2-Aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid)
    - *(2S)-2-Aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid)
    - *5-Aminopentanoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *(2S)-2-Amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine)
    - *(2S)-6-Acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (Lysine derivative)
    - *8-Aminooctanoic acid*

  - *Explanation*: Additional acidic groups (like carboxyl or hydroxyl) in the side chain increase the molecule's ability to coordinate with Fe ions through additional binding sites and hydrogen bonding. This enhances the formation and activity of the Fe-based catalyst. Non-polar or bulky side chains lack these coordination sites and may introduce steric hindrance, reducing catalyst formation and activity.

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-withdrawing substituents** (e.g., nitro, halogens) in the **para position** result in a **high yield**; those with **electron-donating substituents** result in a **low yield**.**

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *4-Nitrobenzoic acid*
    - *4-(Bromomethyl)benzoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-Methylbenzoic acid*
    - *3-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*

  - *Explanation*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid by stabilizing the negative charge on the carboxylate ion, enhancing its ability to coordinate with Fe ions. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity, diminishing coordination ability. The para position maximizes this effect due to resonance.

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that contain **nitrogen-containing heterocycles** (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole) attached directly or via short linkers to the **carboxyl group** result in a **high yield**; those with **bulky aromatic linkers** result in a **low yield**.**

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
    - *1H-Pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
    - *4-Pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *4-Pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*

  - *Explanation*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles act as additional coordination sites for Fe ions, enhancing catalyst formation. Short linkers ensure effective metal-ligand interactions. Bulky aromatic linkers introduce steric hindrance, impeding coordination.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxylate** result in a **high yield**; those with **insufficient hydroxyl groups** or **hydroxyl groups far from the carboxylate** result in a **low yield**.**

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-Pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
    - *2-[[1,3-Dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *7-Hydroxyheptanoic acid*

  - *Explanation*: Multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxylate enhance Fe ion coordination through chelation and hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst. Hydroxyl groups distant from the carboxylate or in insufficient numbers cannot effectively participate in metal coordination.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **accessible thiol groups** result in a **high yield**; those with **thiol groups in aromatic systems** result in a **low yield**.**

  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *3-Sulfanylpropanoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *4-Sulfanylbenzoic acid*

  - *Explanation*: Thiol groups are strong ligands for Fe ions due to their soft Lewis base character. In aliphatic chains, thiol groups are more accessible for coordination. In aromatic systems, thiol groups are less available due to resonance stabilization with the aromatic ring, reducing their ability to coordinate with Fe ions.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **aldehyde or acyl substituents** result in a **low yield**.**

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-Formylbenzoic acid*
    - *5-Formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*
    - *4-Oxoheptanedioic acid*
    - *4-[(2,2,2-Trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid*

  - *Explanation*: Aldehyde and acyl groups can interfere with Fe ion coordination by either participating in side reactions (e.g., forming Schiff bases with amines) or by withdrawing electron density from the carboxylate group, weakening its coordinating ability.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are **perfluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids** result in a **low yield** due to reduced electron density on the carboxylate group.**

  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid*

  - *Explanation*: The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms decreases the electron density of the carboxylate, weakening its coordination to Fe ions. This results in less effective catalyst formation.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **amino groups on short chains** (up to 5 carbons) result in a **high yield**; those with **amino groups on longer chains** result in a **low yield**.**

  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *5-Aminopentanoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *7-Aminoheptanoic acid*
    - *8-Aminooctanoic acid*

  - *Explanation*: Amino groups on short chains can effectively coordinate with Fe ions by forming stable chelates. On longer chains, the amino group is spatially distant from the carboxylate, reducing the likelihood of simultaneous coordination (chelation) and potentially introducing steric hindrance.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are **ethers with multiple hydroxyl groups** near the **carboxylate** result in a **high yield**; ethers lacking sufficient hydroxyl groups result in a **low yield**.**

  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *2-[[1,3-Dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *2-[2-(2-Methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*

  - *Explanation*: Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance coordination with Fe ions through hydrogen bonding and chelation. Ethers without enough hydroxyl groups cannot provide these interactions, resulting in weaker metal coordination and lower catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **bulky substituents directly attached to the ring** result in a **low yield**; increasing the distance between bulky groups and the carboxylate leads to a **high yield**.**

  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *5-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-Pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*
    - *2-[(4-Hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*

  - *Explanation*: Bulky substituents adjacent to the carboxylate group cause steric hindrance, impeding effective coordination with Fe ions. A longer aliphatic linker distances the bulky group from the carboxylate, reducing steric effects and allowing better metal-ligand interactions.

   - **Modifiers with Sterically Hindered Carboxylate Groups (Rule 10):** Do not use modifiers where bulky groups are adjacent to the carboxylate.
     - *Examples:* 4-Pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.

**Underlying Physicochemical Principles:**

- **Coordination Ability:** Modifiers that can effectively coordinate with Fe ions through multiple binding sites (e.g., carboxylate, hydroxyl, amino, thiol, nitrogen heterocycles) enhance catalyst formation and activity.
- **Steric Effects:** Bulky groups near coordination sites impede effective metal-ligand interactions due to steric hindrance.
- **Electronic Effects:** Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity and coordinating ability of the carboxylate anion, while electron-donating groups have the opposite effect.
- **Chelation Potential:** Modifiers capable of chelating Fe ions through multiple neighboring donor atoms form more stable complexes, improving catalyst performance.
- **Side Reactions:** Functional groups like aldehydes may participate in side reactions, reducing the availability of the modifier to coordinate with Fe ions.

**Note on Rule Application:**

When evaluating a new modifier:

- **Consider All Applicable Rules:** A compound may fall under multiple rules; assess each rule's impact based on the modifier's structure.
- **Balance Between Features:** Some features may enhance yield, while others may diminish it. Prioritize modifiers where the enhancing features dominate.
- **Physicochemical Context:** Think about how the modifier's functional groups interact during catalyst formation and the reaction process.

**Summary:**

These rules provide a comprehensive framework for predicting the efficacy of molecular modifiers in enhancing the yield of the target reaction. By focusing on the presence and combination of specific functional groups and structural features, grounded in coordination chemistry and steric considerations, researchers can make informed decisions when selecting or designing new modifiers. This approach facilitates the optimization and control of the reaction yield, advancing the goals of the research program.
