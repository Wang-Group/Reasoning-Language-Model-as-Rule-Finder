  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** – **Low yield** (perfluoroalkyl group is too electron-withdrawing)

- **Underlying Chemistry**: The **nitro group** can facilitate **π-backbonding** and stabilize the metal complex through resonance, enhancing catalytic activity.

---

**Rule 8: Modifiers with Long Aliphatic Chains Terminated with Polar Groups Yield Low**

- **Description**: Aliphatic carboxylic acids with **long chains** terminated by **polar functional groups** (like hydroxyl or amino groups) result in **low yield**.

- **Examples**:
  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** – **Low yield**

- **Examples**:
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid** – **Low yield**

**End of Rules**

These rules capture the relationship between the structural features of molecular modifiers and their impact on the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction:

- **Coordination Capability**: Modifiers with functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, sulfanyl) positioned to coordinate effectively with the metal center promote high yields by stabilizing the catalytic complex.

- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-donating groups enhance metal coordination, while strongly electron-withdrawing groups can either hinder or, in specific cases (like nitro groups), enhance coordination depending on the overall structure.

- **Steric Considerations**: Modifiers with flexible chains or steric hindrance due to bulky groups or functional groups can negatively impact yield by preventing effective interaction with the catalyst.

By understanding these relationships, researchers can predict the performance of potential modifiers and design new ones to optimize reaction outcomes.---------------------------------------------------------------
