- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and well-supported by data points Entries 0 and 2. It offers adequate physical-chemical insight by highlighting that amino acids with additional carboxyl groups enhance coordination with the metal center. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures—specifically, amino acids with side chains containing carboxyl groups—and meets the coverage criterion with two supporting examples.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is generally clear, focusing on heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of metal coordination. It is supported by Entries 7, 15, and 21, which show high yields. However, Entry 11 (4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid) exhibits low yield, suggesting an exception. Refinement is needed to specify positional requirements of nitrogen atoms to improve clarity and coverage.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear, stating that electron-withdrawing groups at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids lead to high yields. It provides good property insight and is supported by Entries 1 and 20. Potential counterexamples, such as Entry 19 (4-formylbenzoic acid) with a para aldehyde group resulting in low yield, indicate that certain electron-withdrawing groups like aldehydes may not conform, suggesting the rule could be refined.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 offers valuable physical-chemical insight into how multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group can enhance coordination. However, it is primarily supported by a single data point (Entry 8). To improve its strength, additional supporting examples are necessary to meet the coverage criterion adequately.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear and supported by Entries 29, 31, and 34, all showing low yields for modifiers with long aliphatic chains and distant polar groups. It provides solid physical-chemical insight into how increased flexibility and distant functionalities can diminish effective coordination. The rule effectively balances complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear and is supported by Entries 13 and 28, which have low yields due to strongly electron-withdrawing groups near the carboxyl group. However, Entry 20 (4-nitrobenzoic acid) shows a high yield despite having an electron-withdrawing group, suggesting that not all such groups adversely affect coordination. The rule might benefit from specifying which electron-withdrawing groups reduce coordination capability.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear, with Entries 10 and 32 supporting the observation that flexible ether linkages or polyether chains lead to low yields. The rule provides good physical-chemical insight by linking conformational flexibility to reduced metal coordination. It appropriately balances complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear but is supported only by Entry 17. While it provides good insight into how a thiol group in close proximity to the carboxyl group can enhance coordination, the limited coverage suggests the need for more data points. Additionally, Entry 9 (4-sulfanylbenzoic acid) shows low yield, indicating that aromatic thiol modifiers may not conform to the rule.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 suggests that hydroxyl or methoxy substitutions can lead to high yields. While supported by Entries 6 and 25, it is contradicted by Entries 26 and 30, which have similar functional groups but low yields. This inconsistency indicates that the rule lacks clarity regarding the positioning of substituents and may require refinement to consider steric or electronic effects more precisely.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear and supported by Entries 18 and 19, both showing low yields for modifiers with aldehyde groups at ortho or para positions. The rule provides sound property insight into how aldehyde groups may interfere with coordination or participate in side reactions. It meets the complexity and coverage criteria effectively.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear and highlights that amino acids with hydrophobic side chains lacking coordinating groups result in low yields, as exemplified by Entry 12. It provides adequate physical-chemical insight and considers combinations of sub-structures. While coverage could be enhanced with more examples, it satisfactorily meets the criteria.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is clear but supported only by Entry 4. It suggests that simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without interfering functional groups can lead to high yields. While the rule offers some property insight, the limited coverage due to a single supporting data point indicates that additional examples are needed for stronger validation.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear, with Entries 14 and 16 supporting the observation that fused aromatic systems with potential coordination sites lead to high yields. It offers good physical-chemical insight and balances complexity and coverage effectively.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14, focusing on modifiers with functional groups capable of chelation, is clear and supported by Entries 7 and 15. It provides strong property insight into the importance of bidentate ligands in stabilizing the metal center. The rule aligns well with the complexity and coverage criteria.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 is specific and provides insight into how a flexible aliphatic linker between a carboxyl group and an aromatic ring containing heteroatoms can enhance coordination, as supported by Entry 24. However, with only one supporting data point, the rule's coverage is limited. Additional examples would strengthen its validity.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows us to predict high yield modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids with short aliphatic chains. The property insight is sound, as multiple coordination sites can enhance metal binding and catalyst performance. The rule considers a combination of functional groups (α-amino and two carboxyl groups), indicating sufficient complexity. Coverage is supported by at least two data points (Entries 0 and 2), aligning with high yield outcomes.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clearly defined, specifying aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position, predicting high yield. The property insight is logical, as electron-withdrawing groups increase carboxyl acidity and enhance metal coordination. The rule combines multiple sub-structures (aromatic ring, carboxyl group, EWG at para position), showing appropriate complexity. Coverage is robust with three supporting data points (Entries 1, 3, and 20), all corresponding to high yields.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clearly articulated, focusing on modifiers with heteroaromatic rings containing nitrogen atoms that serve as coordination sites, predicting high yield. The property insight is solid, as nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings can coordinate with metals. The rule demonstrates suitable complexity by integrating heteroaromatic structures and coordination chemistry. Coverage includes at least three data points (Entries 7, 15, and 21), all yielding high outcomes.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 specifies modifiers that are polyhydroxy carboxylic acids or contain multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group, predicting high yield. The clarity is acceptable, and the property insight is reasonable, as additional hydroxyl groups can provide coordination via oxygen atoms. Complexity is moderate, involving multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl. However, coverage is limited with only one supporting data point (Entry 8), which may weaken the rule's validity.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 proposes that modifiers with thiol groups near the carboxyl group result in high yield. While the rule is clear and the property insight is plausible (sulfur coordination), there is a concern with coverage and data consistency. Entry 17 (3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) aligns with high yield (True), supporting the rule. However, Entry 9 (4-sulfanylbenzoic acid) is listed as a low yield (False) in the dataset, which contradicts the rule's assertion. This inconsistency raises questions about the rule's validity and suggests that it may not reliably predict yield.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear, indicating that aliphatic carboxylic acids with long chains and functional groups distant from the carboxyl group result in low yield. The property insight is reasonable; distant functional groups may not effectively coordinate, and long chains may introduce steric hindrance. Complexity is appropriate, considering chain length and functional group positioning. Coverage is adequate, with three supporting data points (Entries 29, 31, and 34), all corresponding to low yield.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 states that modifiers with electron-donating groups at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids result in low yield due to decreased acidity and weakened metal coordination. The clarity is acceptable, and the property insight is logical. Complexity involves combining aromatic carboxylic acids with specific substituents. Coverage is mixed; while Entries 22 and 30 (both False) support low yield, Entry 25 (True) contradicts the rule, suggesting that modifiers with methoxy groups may not always lead to low yield. This inconsistency indicates that the rule may not be entirely reliable.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 clearly identifies modifiers with flexible ether linkages or polyether chains as leading to low yield, due to entropic hindrance in metal coordination. The property insight is sound. Complexity is appropriate, considering specific sub-structures. Coverage is adequate with two supporting data points (Entries 10 and 32), both yielding low outcomes.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clearly defined, indicating that modifiers with functional groups (aldehydes, ketones, amides) near the carboxyl group interfere with metal coordination, resulting in low yield. The property insight is logical. Complexity involves considering interfering functional groups in close proximity to the carboxyl group. Coverage is strong, with three supporting data points (Entries 19, 26, and 27), all showing low yield. This enhances the rule's reliability.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear, stating that simple aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length chains and minimal steric hindrance yield high performance. The property insight is acceptable, as such structures may coordinate effectively with the metal center. Complexity is lower, focusing on basic structural features. Coverage is adequate, with two supporting data points (Entries 4 and 6), both corresponding to high yield.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 clearly identifies amino acids with bulky or hydrophobic side chains lacking additional coordinating groups as leading to low yield due to ineffective metal interaction. The property insight is logical. Complexity involves the consideration of amino acid side chain properties. Coverage is sufficient with two examples (Entries 12 and 33), both consistent with low yield.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 states that modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing perfluoroalkyl groups result in low yield. The clarity is good, and the property insight is sound. Complexity is moderate, focusing on a specific functional group. However, coverage is limited to a single data point (Entry 13), reducing the rule's robustness.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 suggests that modifiers with additional coordination sites provided by hydroxyl or amino groups near aromatic rings result in high yield via chelation. While the rule is clear and the property insight is reasonable, there is an inconsistency in the data. Entry 18 (5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) shows low yield (False), contradicting the rule. Furthermore, "4-hydroxybenzoic acid derivative modifiers" is not explicitly represented in the dataset. This discrepancy raises concerns about the rule's validity and coverage.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 states that modifiers causing over-chelation result in low yield due to catalyst deactivation. The clarity is acceptable, and the property insight is plausible. Complexity involves over-chelation effects. However, the coverage is limited to a single data point (Entry 11), which weakens the rule's general applicability.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 indicates that modifiers with conjugated systems or fused ring structures adjacent to the carboxyl group result in high yield due to enhanced electron delocalization and stronger metal coordination. The clarity and property insight are acceptable. The rule involves complex structural features, adding to its complexity. However, coverage is limited to a single data point (Entry 16), making it difficult to assess the rule's reliability.

- **Comment 1**: **Rule 1** is clear and specifies modifiers that are **α-amino acids with additional carboxylic acid groups in the side chain**. This rule provides strong physical-chemical insight by linking the presence of multiple carboxylate groups to enhanced metal chelation and improved catalytic activity. It considers a combination of sub-structures (an α-amino acid backbone and extra carboxylate groups), fulfilling the complexity criterion. The rule is supported by at least two data points (Entries **0** and **2**), demonstrating good coverage. Overall, the rule is well-balanced and effectively correlates structure to reactivity.

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 2** is clear in identifying modifiers that are **α-amino acids with hydrophobic side chains lacking additional coordinating groups**, leading to low yield. It provides property insight by associating the absence of extra coordination sites with reduced metal binding efficiency. However, the rule's coverage is limited, primarily supported by a single data point (**Entry 12**). Additionally, **Entry 14** (Tryptophan) is an α-amino acid with a hydrophobic side chain but results in a high yield, suggesting exceptions to the rule. Enhancing coverage or refining the rule to account for such exceptions would improve its reliability.

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 3** clearly states that **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position** yield high activity. The rule offers sound physical-chemical insight, linking increased acidity from electron-withdrawing groups to enhanced metal coordination. It has good coverage with at least two supporting data points (**Entries 1** and **20**). However, **Entry 19** (4-formylbenzoic acid) possesses an electron-withdrawing group but exhibits low yield, indicating exceptions. The rule could be refined to address such anomalies, perhaps by considering the specific nature of electron-withdrawing groups and their potential interference in coordination.

- **Comment 4**: **Rule 4** is clear and connects **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents at the para position** to low yield due to decreased acidity and weakened metal coordination.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** is clear, indicating that modifiers with **strong electron-withdrawing perfluoroalkyl groups near the carboxyl group** result in low yield by weakening the coordinating ability of the carboxyl oxygen. While it provides sound property insight, coverage is limited to **Entry 13**. Additional data points would strengthen the rule's validity.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** mentions that **unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional distant functional groups** yield high activity. The rule is clear and provides property insight by emphasizing simplicity in the structure aiding effective coordination. However, coverage is limited to **Entry 4**. More examples are needed to enhance coverage and confirm the rule's applicability.

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** points out that **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (>6 carbons) with distant functional groups beyond three carbons from the carboxyl group** lead to low yield. The rule is clear and offers property insight into the inefficiency of distant functional groups in metal coordination. It has good coverage with **Entries 29**, **31**, and **34** supporting it, showing a balanced approach.

**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1 (High Yield)**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with additional coordinating functional groups** (e.g., **carboxyl**, **hydroxyl**, **amino**, **sulfhydryl**) in the side chain within three carbons of the α-carbon. These groups enhance metal coordination through chelation, stabilizing the catalyst.
   - *Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(Glutamic acid, Entry 0)*, **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(Aspartic acid, Entry 2)*, **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(Tryptophan, Entry 14)*

2. **Rule 2 (Low Yield)**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with non-coordinating side chains**, lacking additional donor atoms near the α-carbon. The absence of effective coordinating groups reduces metal-binding efficiency.
   - *Examples*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(Phenylalanine, Entry 12)*, **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(N-Acetyllysine, Entry 33)*

3. **Rule 3 (High Yield)**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents** (e.g., **nitro**, **halogen**) at the para position. These substituents increase the acidity and coordinating ability of the carboxyl group.
   - *Examples*: **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(Entry 20)*, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** *(Entry 1)*

4. **Rule 4 (Low Yield)**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents** (e.g., **methyl**, **methoxy**) directly attached to the aromatic ring without spacer chains. These groups decrease the acidity and coordinating ability of the carboxyl group.
   - *Example*: **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(Entry 22)*

5. **Rule 5 (High Yield)**: Modifiers that are **nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids**, where nitrogen atoms serve as additional coordination sites, enhancing metal binding and catalyst stability.
   - *Examples*: **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(Nicotinic acid, Entry 21)*, **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** *(Entry 15)*, **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** *(Entry 7)*

6. **Rule 6 (Low Yield)**: Modifiers with **bulky aromatic systems directly adjacent to the carboxyl group**, causing steric hindrance that impedes effective metal coordination.
   - *Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(Entry 11)*

7. **Rule 7 (High Yield)**: Modifiers where an **aromatic ring bearing additional coordinating groups** (e.g., **hydroxyl**, **amino**) is connected to the carboxyl group via a **flexible aliphatic chain** of 3–5 carbons. The chain reduces steric hindrance, and the coordinating groups enhance metal binding.
   - *Examples*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** *(Entry 6)*, **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** *(Entry 24)*

8. **Rule 8 (Low Yield)**: Modifiers with **flexible polyether chains** terminating in a carboxylic acid group. The conformational flexibility hinders effective metal coordination, reducing catalytic efficiency.
   - *Examples*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(Entry 10)*, **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** *(Entry 32)*

9. **Rule 9 (High Yield)**: Modifiers possessing **additional coordinating groups** (e.g., **hydroxyl**, **thiol**, **amino**) within **three carbons of the carboxyl group** in aliphatic chains. These groups enhance metal binding via chelation, stabilizing the catalyst.
   - *Examples*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(Entry 17)*, **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** *(Entry 5)*

10. **Rule 10 (Low Yield)**: Modifiers with **strong electron-withdrawing perfluoroalkyl groups** adjacent to the carboxyl group. Excessive electron withdrawal destabilizes carboxylate-metal interactions, weakening coordination.
     - *Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(Entry 13)*

11. **Rule 11 (Low Yield)**: Modifiers with **functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) located more than three carbons away** from the carboxyl group in aliphatic chains. Distant groups are less effective in metal coordination.
     - *Examples*: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(Entry 29)*, **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(Entry 31)*, **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(Entry 34)*

12. **Rule 12 (High Yield)**: Modifiers that are **unbranched medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** (e.g., **octanoic acid**) without additional functional groups. The lack of steric hindrance allows effective coordination through the carboxyl group.
     - *Example*: **octanoic acid** *(Entry 4)*

13. **Rule 13 (Low Yield)**: Modifiers with **aldehyde, ketone, or acylamide groups adjacent to the carboxyl group**. These groups can compete with the carboxylate for metal coordination, reducing efficiency.
     - *Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(Entry 19)*, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** *(Entry 18)*, **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** *(Entry 27)*

14. **Rule 14 (High Yield)**: Modifiers containing **conjugated systems adjacent to the carboxyl group**, especially with **heteroatoms** capable of coordination (e.g., **oxygen**, **nitrogen**). Conjugation and heteroatoms enhance electron delocalization and strengthen metal-ligand interactions.
     - *Examples*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(Tryptophan, Entry 14)*, **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** *(Entry 16)*

15. **Rule 15 (High Yield)**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups that serve as additional coordinating sites** (e.g., **amino**, **hydroxyl**) directly attached to the aromatic ring. These groups can enhance metal coordination through chelation.
     - *Example*: **4-aminobenzoic acid** *(Entry 3)*

**End of Rules**

These rules capture the relationship between molecular modifiers and the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By considering functional groups, their positions, and the underlying physicochemical properties, the rules can predict whether a modifier will result in a high or low yield. Modifiers that facilitate effective metal coordination through additional coordinating groups and optimal molecular geometry tend to enhance the catalyst's stability and activity, leading to higher yields. Conversely, modifiers that hinder coordination due to steric effects, lack of coordinating groups, or excessive electron-withdrawing effects often result in lower yields.
