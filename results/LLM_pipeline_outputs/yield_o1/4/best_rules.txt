**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **High Yield** is achieved when the modifier is an **amino acid with side chains containing additional carboxyl groups or nitrogen-containing heterocycles capable of coordination**, such as aspartic acid, glutamic acid, or tryptophan. These side chains provide multiple coordination sites to the metal center, enhancing catalyst stability and efficiency.
  - *Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(Aspartic acid, Entry 2)*, **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(Glutamic acid, Entry 0)*, **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(Tryptophan, Entry 14)*

- **Rule 2**: **Low Yield** occurs when the modifier is an **aromatic carboxylic acid with electron-donating groups at the para position**, such as methyl or phenolic hydroxyl groups. These groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group and reduce its ability to effectively coordinate with the metal center.
  - *Examples*: **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(Entry 22)*, **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** *(Entry 30)*

- **Rule 3**: **High Yield** is observed with modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids featuring amino groups at the para position**, where the amino group can act as an additional coordination site, enhancing metal binding and catalyst performance.
  - *Example*: **4-aminobenzoic acid** *(Entry 3)*

- **Rule 4**: **Low Yield** results when the modifier contains **aldehyde groups adjacent to aromatic rings and carboxyl groups**, such as in formylbenzoic acids. Aldehyde groups may interfere with metal coordination or participate in side reactions, hindering catalyst efficiency.
  - *Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(Entry 19)*, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** *(Entry 18)*

- **Rule 5**: **Low Yield** is observed with modifiers containing **long aliphatic chains (seven carbons or more) with polar functional groups distant from the carboxyl group**, such as terminal hydroxyl or amino groups. The increased chain length and flexibility reduce effective metal coordination due to steric and entropic factors.
  - *Examples*: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(Entry 29)*, **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(Entry 31)*, **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(Entry 34)*

- **Rule 6**: **High Yield** occurs with **simple aliphatic carboxylic acids lacking additional interfering functional groups**, allowing effective coordination with the metal center due to minimal steric hindrance and optimal spatial orientation.
  - *Example*: **octanoic acid** *(Entry 4)*

- **Rule 7**: **Low Yield** results when the modifier contains **flexible ether linkages or polyether chains**, such as poly(ethylene glycol) analogs. These structures increase conformational flexibility and create entropic barriers, reducing effective metal coordination.
  - *Examples*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(Entry 10)*, **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** *(Entry 32)*

- **Rule 8**: **High Yield** is achieved when the modifier is a **heteroaromatic carboxylic acid containing nitrogen atoms positioned to coordinate with the metal center**. Nitrogen heteroatoms act as additional Lewis bases, stabilizing the catalyst through chelation without causing excessive steric hindrance.
  - *Examples*: **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(Nicotinic acid, Entry 21)*, **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** *(Entry 15)*, **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** *(Chelidamic acid, Entry 7)*

- **Rule 9**: **Low Yield** occurs when the modifier may **over-chelate or strongly bind to the metal center**, potentially deactivating it or hindering catalytic activity due to steric hindrance or excessive coordination. Modifiers with multiple aromatic rings and multiple coordinating groups can cause this effect.
  - *Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(Entry 11)*

- **Rule 10**: **High Yield** is observed with modifiers containing **aliphatic thiol (â€“SH) groups adjacent to the carboxyl group**, providing additional coordination sites without significant steric hindrance. Thiol groups enhance interaction with the metal center through strong metal-sulfur bonds.
  - *Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(Entry 17)*

- **Rule 11**: **Low Yield** is observed when the modifier contains **perfluorinated alkyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms decreases the nucleophilicity of the carboxylate oxygen and may introduce steric hindrance, reducing the ability to coordinate with the metal center.
  - *Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(Entry 13)*

- **Rule 12**: **High Yield** is achieved with modifiers that have **multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group without flexible ether linkages**, such as polyhydroxy acids. The presence of several hydroxyl groups enhances coordination through multiple hydrogen bonds or direct coordination, stabilizing the catalyst.
  - *Example*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(Gluconic acid, Entry 8)*

- **Rule 13**: **Low Yield** occurs with modifiers that are **amino acids possessing hydrophobic side chains without additional coordinating functional groups**, leading to diminished interaction with the metal center due to lack of auxiliary coordination sites.
  - *Examples*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(Phenylalanine, Entry 12)*, **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(Entry 33)*

- **Rule 14**: **High Yield** is observed when modifiers contain **aromatic groups linked via longer aliphatic chains (four carbons or more)**, distancing potential steric hindrance from the metal coordination site at the carboxyl group. This allows the carboxyl group to effectively coordinate without interference from bulky groups.
  - *Examples*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** *(Entry 6)*, **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** *(Entry 24)*

- **Rule 15**: **Low Yield** results when the modifier contains **amide functionalities involving the carboxyl group**, converting it into an amide bond. This transformation reduces or eliminates the ability of the original carboxyl group to coordinate with the metal center.
  - *Example*: **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** *(Entry 26)*
