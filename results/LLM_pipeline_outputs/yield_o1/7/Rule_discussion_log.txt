- **Comment 1**:
  - *Rule 1* has clear structural criteria and potential physical-chemical insight due to the SH group's coordination ability. However, the coverage is low, as only one data point (3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) supports the rule. The rule could benefit from more supporting data.

- **Comment 2**:
  - *Rule 2* is clear and considers specific structural features of pyridine-carboxylic acids, with at least two data points supporting high yield. It aligns with the physical-chemical insight that pyridine may coordinate with Fe ions, enhancing the reaction yield. The rule effectively balances complexity and coverage.

These rules have been formulated by analyzing the dataset and identifying patterns between the molecular features of the modifiers and their influence on the reaction yield. Each rule combines multiple sub-structures where possible and considers underlying physical-chemical properties, such as electronic effects, steric hindrance, and coordination abilities with the catalyst.

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a new molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield in the reaction based on its structural features.

These rules have been carefully formulated by analyzing the dataset and identifying patterns between the molecular features of the modifiers and their influence on the reaction yield. Each rule combines multiple sub-structures where applicable and considers underlying physical-chemical properties such as electronic effects, steric factors, and coordination abilities with the catalyst.

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a new molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield in the reaction based on its structural features.

These rules have been developed by analyzing the provided dataset and identifying patterns between structural features of the molecular modifiers and the observed reaction yields. Each rule considers combinations of substructures (functional groups) and their underlying physical-chemical properties, such as coordination abilities, electronic effects, steric factors, and potential side reactions.

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a particular molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. This approach aids in the rational design and selection of modifiers to optimize and control the reaction outcome.

The rules prioritize coverage of the dataset and maintain a balance between simplicity and complexity. Simple rules with broader coverage help generalize predictions, while more complex rules capture specific nuances that affect the reaction yield.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows for easy determination of high yield when a modifier contains both an amino group and a carboxylic acid on an aliphatic chain. The physical-chemical insight provided is adequate, explaining the chelation effect that enhances catalysis. The rule considers combinations of substructures and is supported by multiple data points (e.g., entries 0, 2, and 3), achieving a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 clearly states that heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms in the ring lead to high yield. The property insight is solid, highlighting the role of nitrogen as a coordinating site. It considers specific combinations of substructures and is supported by several data points (entries 7, 15, 21, and 24). However, there's an exception with entry 11 (**4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**), which fits the structural description but results in low yield, suggesting that steric factors or additional substituents may influence the outcome.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear, focusing on aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups leading to high yield. The physical-chemical explanation about increased acidity enhancing coordination is adequate. It combines substructures and is supported by data (entries 1 and 20). Nonetheless, there are exceptions like **4-formylbenzoic acid** (entry 19) that, despite having an electron-withdrawing group, results in low yield, indicating that not all electron-withdrawing substituents may have the same effect.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear, indicating that short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with additional coordinating groups result in high yield. The insight into enhanced chelation through additional functional groups is appropriate. It combines multiple substructures and is supported by data points like entries 6 and 17. The rule maintains a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 clearly states that medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups tend to give moderate to high yield. The property insight is sufficient, and the rule considers specific structural features. It is supported by data (entry 5 with **octanoic acid**). However, the coverage is limited, and including more examples would strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear and explains how electron-donating substituents decrease the carboxylic acid's ability to coordinate, leading to low yield. It effectively combines substructures and positions of substituents, with adequate physical-chemical explanations. Supported by entries 26 and 30, the rule strikes a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 clearly identifies that long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar groups far from the carboxyl group lead to low yield. The physical-chemical insight about reduced coordination efficiency due to chain length and steric hindrance is sound. It considers combinations of features and is supported by multiple data points (entries 29, 31, and 34), achieving appropriate coverage and balance.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear, noting that modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid result in low yield. The insight about possible side reactions and catalyst interactions is adequate. It combines functional groups and is supported by entries 18, 19, and 27, maintaining a good balance.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 clearly states that modifiers with polyether chains or multiple ether linkages tend to result in low yield. The property insight regarding competition for coordination and solvation effects is valid. It considers specific substructures and is supported by entries 10 and 32. The rule is balanced in terms of complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear about heavily fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids leading to low yield. The physical-chemical explanation about increased hydrophobicity and reduced interactions is adequate. Though the rule is specific, it has limited coverage with only one data point (entry 13). Including more examples would enhance its robustness.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 clearly indicates that amino acids with acylated amino groups result in low yield due to reduced coordination sites. The insight is appropriate. It is supported by entry 33 but has limited coverage. Additional data points would improve the rule's validity.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is clear and explains catalyst deactivation by functional groups like aromatic thiols leading to low yield. The property insight is solid, and it combines specific substructures. Supported by entry 9, the rule has limited coverage but maintains a balance between complexity and explanatory power.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 clearly addresses steric hindrance from bulky substituents adjacent to coordination sites causing low yield. The physical-chemical insight is adequate, considering the impact of steric effects. Supported by entries 11 and 12, the rule combines substructures effectively and achieves good coverage.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 is clear, focusing on modifiers with multiple functional groups that may interfere with coordination, leading to variable or low yield. The property insight is sound. While it combines complex substructures, the coverage is limited to entry 23. Including more data points would enhance the rule's applicability.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 clearly states that aromatic carboxylic acids with a balance of electron-donating and electron-withdrawing substituents favor high yield. The physical-chemical insight into electronic effects is appropriate. It is supported by entry 16 but has limited coverage. More examples are needed for stronger validation.

It is supported by examples such as **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** in the dataset, meeting coverage expectations. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 4**: *Rule 4* is clear and specifies short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with additional coordinating groups. The property insight is adequate, focusing on multiple binding sites and reduced steric hindrance. The rule is appropriately complex, considering both chain length and functional groups. It is supported by several data points, including **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**, **5-aminopentanoic acid**, and **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**, ensuring strong coverage. The balance criterion is well met.

- **Comment 5**: *Rule 5* is clear in identifying amino acids with nitrogen-containing aromatic side chains. The physical-chemical properties are explained through the coordination ability of the indole ring's nitrogen atom. However, the coverage is limited, with only one supporting data point—**(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan)—in the dataset. This weakens the rule's robustness and suggests the need for additional data to strengthen coverage.

- **Comment 6**: *Rule 6* lacks clarity due to contradictions with the dataset. While it states that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents tend to result in low yield, the dataset shows that **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** results in a **high yield**. This inconsistency indicates insufficient property insight and misalignment with empirical data. The rule may require revision to accurately reflect the observed outcomes.

- **Comment 7**: *Rule 7* presents issues with clarity and coverage. It claims that long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups yield low results. However, the dataset shows that **octanoic acid** results in a **high yield**, contradicting the rule. This inconsistency undermines the rule's validity and suggests that the underlying physical-chemical properties are not adequately accounted for, necessitating refinement.

- **Comment 8**: *Rule 8* is clear and provides sound property insight into how aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid can lead to low yield due to potential side reactions or altered coordination. The rule considers complex substructures, fulfilling the complexity criterion. It is well-supported by data points like **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**, and **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**, meeting the coverage requirement. The balance is appropriate.

- **Comment 9**: *Rule 9* is clear in identifying modifiers with polyether chains or multiple ether linkages leading to low yield. The property insight is adequate, explaining the competition of ether oxygen atoms in coordination and the impact on catalyst interaction. The rule involves complex substructures, satisfying the complexity criterion. It is supported by data points such as **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**, ensuring sufficient coverage. The balance is well-maintained.

- **Comment 10**: *Rule 10* is clear regarding amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains resulting in low yield due to steric hindrance. The property insight is acceptable but limited to steric factors. The rule considers specific substructures, meeting the complexity criterion. However, coverage is limited to a single data point—**(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine)—which weakens its robustness. Additional supporting data would enhance the rule's validity.

- **Comment 11**: *Rule 11* is clear and provides strong property insight into how strongly coordinating groups like thiols on aromatic rings can deactivate catalysts. It considers combinations of substructures, fulfilling the complexity criterion. The rule is supported by at least one data point—**4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**—which results in a low yield, but additional examples would strengthen coverage. The balance between complexity and coverage is acceptable.

- **Comment 12**: *Rule 12* is clear in identifying heavily fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids leading to low yield. The property insight is adequate, discussing the effects of fluorination on acidity and hydrophobicity. The rule involves complex substructures, meeting the complexity criterion. Coverage is limited to a single data point—**2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**—suggesting the need for more data to enhance robustness.

- **Comment 13**: *Rule 13* is clear and provides acceptable property insight into how N-acetylation of amino acids blocks coordination sites, leading to low yield. The rule considers modifications of functional groups, adding complexity. Coverage is limited to one example—**(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**—which reduces its strength. Additional data points are needed for better coverage.

- **Comment 14**: *Rule 14* lacks clarity due to its broad scope, mentioning complex structures or multiple competing functional groups without specific structural criteria. The property insight is general, and the rule may overlap with other rules, causing potential confusion. Coverage is unclear, and without specific examples linked to the dataset, it's difficult to assess the rule's validity. The balance between complexity and clarity needs improvement.

- **Comment 15**: *Rule 15* may overlap with *Rule 8*, focusing on modifiers with ketone groups within aliphatic chains. While the rule is clear, the property insight is similar to that of *Rule 8*, possibly making it redundant. Coverage is limited, with only **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** as a supporting data point. This reduces the rule's robustness and suggests that it could be merged with *Rule 8* for better coherence.

These rules have been carefully developed by analyzing the provided dataset and identifying consistent patterns between the structural features of the molecular modifiers and the observed reaction yields in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization of aliphatic alcohols. Each rule combines multiple sub-structures (functional groups) and incorporates underlying physical-chemical properties, such as coordination abilities, electronic effects, steric factors, and potential side reactions.

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a particular molecular modifier is likely to result in a **high** or **low yield** for any given structure that fits the descriptions. This systematic approach facilitates the rational design and selection of modifiers to optimize and control the reaction outcome.

The rules prioritize broader coverage of the dataset while maintaining a balance between simplicity and complexity.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**:

  Rule 1 is well-defined and clear, specifying modifiers that are α-amino acids with side-chain carboxyl groups, leading to high yield. The physical-chemical insight regarding multidentate coordination is appropriate. The complexity is sufficient, considering the combination of an α-amino group and an additional carboxyl group. The rule is supported by at least two data points (aspartic acid and glutamic acid), providing good coverage.

- **Comment 2**:

  Rule 2 is clear in defining modifiers as aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position, resulting in high yield. The physical-chemical insight about increased acidity enhancing metal coordination is sound. The rule effectively combines multiple substructures and is supported by at least two data points (4-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid), demonstrating good coverage.

- **Comment 3**:

  Rule 3 clearly states that aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups at the ortho or para position lead to low yield. The property insight about potential side reactions and interference with metal coordination is appropriate. The rule combines multiple substructures and is supported by data points (4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) showing low yield, providing sufficient coverage.

- **Comment 4**:

  Rule 4 proposes that heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms result in high yield due to additional coordination sites provided by nitrogen atoms. While this is supported by examples like pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid (both showing high yield), there is a contradictory case (4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid) which shows low yield. This suggests that additional factors may influence the outcome, and the rule may need refinement to improve clarity and coverage.

- **Comment 5**:

  Rule 5 states that long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups result in high yield. The rule is clear and provides appropriate physical-chemical insight about efficient packing and minimal steric hindrance. However, the rule is relatively simple and is supported by only one data point (octanoic acid), limiting its coverage.

- **Comment 6**:

  Rule 6 clearly defines long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar functional groups along the chain as resulting in low yield, supported by physical-chemical insight about steric hindrance and competing coordination. The rule combines multiple substructures and is well-supported by multiple data points (7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid), providing strong coverage.

- **Comment 7**:

  Rule 7 distinguishes between α-amino acids with nitrogenous aromatic side chains (resulting in high yield) and those with non-nitrogenous aromatic side chains (resulting in low yield). The rule is clear and provides sound physical-chemical reasoning. It combines substructures and is well-supported by data (tryptophan shows high yield, phenylalanine shows low yield), demonstrating adequate coverage.

- **Comment 8**:

  Rule 8 clearly specifies that carboxylic acids with ether linkages in aliphatic chains result in low yield due to potential chelation by ether oxygen atoms. The rule combines multiple substructures and is supported by data points (2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid) showing low yield, ensuring sufficient coverage.

- **Comment 9**:

  Rule 9 indicates that carboxylic acids with heavily fluorinated aliphatic chains result in low yield due to changes in hydrophobicity and electronic environment. The rule is clear and provides physical-chemical insight but is based on a single data point (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), limiting its coverage. The complexity is moderate, focusing on a specific modification.

- **Comment 10**:

  Rule 10 states that aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups directly attached result in low yield due to strong binding of thiol groups to metal centers. The rule is clear and provides appropriate physical-chemical insight. It combines multiple substructures but is based on only one data point (4-sulfanylbenzoic acid), limiting coverage.

- **Comment 11**:

  Rule 11 specifies that aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups on the chain result in high yield due to effective coordination without catalyst poisoning. The rule is clear and provides solid physical-chemical insight. It combines multiple structural features but is supported by only one data point (3-sulfanylpropanoic acid), limiting coverage.

- **Comment 12**:

  Rule 12 indicates that polyalcohol carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups result in high yield due to additional coordination sites and hydrogen bonding. The rule is clear and considers multiple functional groups but is supported by only one data point (gluconic acid), which limits coverage.

- **Comment 13**:

  Rule 13 clearly states that amino acids with acylated amino groups result in low yield due to reduced coordination sites. The rule considers multiple structural features and is supported by at least two data points ((2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid), providing good coverage.

- **Comment 14**:

  Rule 14 indicates that dicarboxylic acids with internal ketone groups result in low yield due to unfavorable interactions affecting metal coordination. The rule is clear and offers appropriate insight but is supported by only one data point (4-oxoheptanedioic acid), which limits its coverage.

- **Comment 15**:

  Rule 15 suggests that aromatic carboxylic acids with extended conjugation or multiple aromatic rings linked via aliphatic chains result in high yield due to enhanced electron delocalization. While the rule has sound physical-chemical reasoning and complexity, the clarity could be improved to specify the required structural features more precisely. Coverage is generally good but may be compromised by contradictory data (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid shows low yield), indicating that additional factors may influence the outcome.

The physical-chemical insight is adequate, explaining how multiple carboxyl groups enable **chelation** with metal ions, enhancing catalyst stability and activity through **bidentate coordination**. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures (α-amino acids and side-chain carboxyl groups), satisfying the complexity criterion. It is supported by at least two data points—**(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid**—both resulting in high yield, ensuring good coverage.

- **Comment 2**:

  **Rule 2** provides a clear distinction between modifiers resulting in high and low yield based on the presence of additional polar groups in long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids. The physical-chemical properties are well-explained, emphasizing how unsubstituted chains allow for **flexible coordination** and minimize **steric hindrance**, while polar groups introduce hindrance or interfere with metal coordination. The rule addresses combinations of functional groups, meeting the complexity criterion. It is well-supported with examples: **octanoic acid** (high yield) and **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid** (low yield), demonstrating strong coverage.

- **Comment 3**:

  **Rule 3** is clear in its structural criteria, focusing on **aromatic carboxylic acids with EWGs or EDGs at the para position**. The underlying physical-chemical insight is solid, relating the effects of substituents on acidity and metal coordination ability. The rule incorporates combinations of sub-structures, fulfilling the complexity requirement. It has ample coverage with high-yield examples like **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**, and low-yield examples like **4-methylbenzoic acid** and **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**.

- **Comment 4**:

  **Rule 4** is clearly defined, describing **nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids without bulky substituents**. The physical-chemical insight is adequate, explaining the role of nitrogen atoms as additional coordination sites. The rule considers combinations of functional groups, satisfying complexity. Supported by examples such as **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** and **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**, both yielding high results, the rule demonstrates good coverage.

- **Comment 5**:

  **Rule 5** distinctly differentiates modifiers based on side-chain structures in **α-amino acids**. The physical-chemical reasoning is sound, attributing high yield to additional coordination from nitrogen-containing aromatic side chains. The complexity criterion is met by considering both the amino acid backbone and side chain variations. The rule is supported by data: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan) yields high, while **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine) yields low, indicating sufficient coverage.

- **Comment 6**:

  **Rule 6** effectively distinguishes between aliphatic and aromatic thiol-containing carboxylic acids. The clarity is good, and the physical-chemical insight explains the differing effects of thiol positioning on catalyst activity. The rule meets the complexity criterion by considering both the carboxyl and thiol groups' positions. It is backed by examples: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (high yield) and **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (low yield), ensuring adequate coverage.

- **Comment 7**:

  **Rule 7** clearly identifies **perfluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids** as resulting in low yield, with physical-chemical insight regarding electron-withdrawing effects and reduced metal coordination. However, the rule focuses on a single functional group (perfluorination), which slightly limits its complexity. The coverage is insufficient, supported by only one data point—**2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**—which may weaken the rule's validity.

- **Comment 8**:

  **Rule 8** is clear in specifying **aromatic carboxylic acids with adjacent aldehyde groups** resulting in low yield. The physical-chemical insight about side reactions and catalyst deactivation is appropriate. The rule considers combinations of functional groups, fulfilling the complexity criterion. It is adequately supported by data points: **4-formylbenzoic acid** and **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (both low yield).

- **Comment 9**:

  **Rule 9** clearly states that **aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages** result in low yield. The physical-chemical explanation involves disruption of metal coordination due to ether-induced flexibility. While the rule meets clarity and complexity criteria, it lacks sufficient coverage, being supported by only one example—**2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.

- **Comment 10**:

  **Rule 10** describes **polyhydroxy aliphatic acids (sugar acids)** yielding high results, with good physical-chemical insight about enhanced hydrogen bonding and additional coordination sites. The rule considers multiple functional groups, but coverage is limited to a single data point—**(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**—which may not be sufficient.

- **Comment 11**:

  **Rule 11** focuses on **acylated amino acids (amide derivatives)** resulting in low yield. The rule is clear, and the physical-chemical reasoning about reduced metal coordination due to acylation is valid. Complexity is addressed by considering modifications to amino acids. However, the rule is only supported by one example—**(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**—limiting its coverage.

- **Comment 12**:

  **Rule 12** specifies that **aromatic carboxylic acids with bulky substituents or extended conjugation** result in low yield. The physical-chemical insight regarding steric hindrance and electron delocalization is appropriate. The rule meets the complexity criterion and is supported by at least two data points—**4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** and **(2S)-2-amino-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (tyrosine)—both yielding low, ensuring adequate coverage.

- **Comment 13**:

  **Rule 13** highlights that modifiers with **adjacent keto and carboxyl groups on an aromatic system** yield high results. The physical-chemical explanation about forming stable chelate rings is sound. The rule is clear and considers combinations of functional groups. However, coverage is limited to a single example—**1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**—which may not adequately support the rule.

- **Comment 14**:

  **Rule 14** describes modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy groups and additional carbonyl groups** resulting in high yield. The physical-chemical insight is solid, but the rule is based on a single data point—**4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**—limiting its coverage despite meeting clarity and complexity criteria.

- **Comment 15**:

  **Rule 15** states that **aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with keto groups** result in low yield, providing an acceptable physical-chemical rationale. The rule is clear and meets complexity requirements by combining multiple functional groups. However, it is only supported by one example—**4-oxoheptanedioic acid**—which may not offer sufficient coverage.
