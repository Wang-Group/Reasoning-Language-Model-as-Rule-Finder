**Start of Rules**

1. **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids yield high yields.**

   - *High Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (*Aspartic acid*), **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (*Glutamic acid*).
   - *Rationale*: The presence of an α-amino group and two carboxylic acid groups provides multiple coordination sites for metal ions, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity through effective chelation.

2. **Para-substituted benzoic acids yield high yields when the para-substituent is an electron-withdrawing group (e.g., amino, nitro, halomethyl); substituents like methyl, formyl, or thiol yield low yields.**

   - *High Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups enhance metal-ligand interactions by increasing the electrophilicity of the aromatic ring, improving catalyst binding. Electron-donating groups or those that can interfere with metal coordination reduce effectiveness.

3. **Modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups (polyols) on aliphatic chains yield high yields; those with single or distant hydroxyl groups yield low yields.**

   - *High Yield Examples*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (*Gluconic acid*), **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]-2-oxoacetic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Example*: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups enhance chelation with metal centers due to increased coordination sites, improving catalyst effectiveness. Isolated hydroxyl groups offer limited coordination.

4. **Unsubstituted aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 6 to 8 carbons yield high yields; introduction of polar functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) lowers the yield.**

   - *High Yield Example*: **Octanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**, **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Unsubstituted aliphatic chains favor hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst surface, enhancing activity. Polar substituents may interfere with these interactions or lead to undesired coordination, resulting in lower yields.

5. **Modifiers containing flexible ether linkages yield low yields due to decreased coordination efficiency and increased conformational flexibility.**

   - *Low Yield Examples*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: The flexibility introduced by ether linkages can hinder optimal alignment of coordinating groups with metal centers, reducing the effectiveness of catalyst modification.

6. **Modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups such as perfluoroalkyl or trifluoroacetyl chains yield low yields due to decreased electron density on coordinating atoms.**

   - *Low Yield Examples*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**, **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups reduce the ability of coordinating atoms to donate electron density to metal ions, weakening the metal-ligand interaction necessary for effective catalysis.

7. **Modifiers with thiol groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid yield high yields if aliphatic; if aromatic, they yield low yields due to potential catalyst poisoning.**

   - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiol groups can coordinate effectively with metal ions, enhancing catalyst activity. Aromatic thiol groups may bind too strongly or irreversibly, causing deactivation.

8. **Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups yield low yields due to potential catalyst deactivation through side reactions.**

   - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Reactive aldehyde groups may form adducts with the catalyst or participate in side reactions, reducing the availability of active catalytic sites.

9. **Nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids yield high yields when the carboxyl group is directly attached to the heterocycle; those with additional aromatic rings or linkers yield low yields.**

   - *High Yield Examples*: **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (*Niacin*), **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.
   - *Rationale*: Direct attachment enables effective bidentate coordination, enhancing metal-ligand interactions. Additional linkers can disrupt optimal geometry.

10. **Amino acids with aromatic side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms yield high yields; those without heteroatoms yield low yields.**

    - *High Yield Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (*Tryptophan*).
    - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (*Phenylalanine*).
    - *Rationale*: Heteroatoms in aromatic side chains provide additional coordination sites for metal ions, enhancing catalyst activity.

11. **Modifiers where amino groups are acylated yield low yields due to reduced availability of lone pair electrons for metal coordination.**

    - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Acylation diminishes nucleophilicity of amino groups, resulting in less effective catalyst modification.

12. **Modifiers with electron-donating methoxy groups on aromatic rings can yield high yields; however, the position and number of methoxy groups are important.**

    - *High Yield Example*: **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Examples*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups increase electron density, enhancing metal-ligand interactions. Optimal positioning is crucial for effective coordination.

13. **Modifiers with rigid aromatic systems containing additional carbonyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group yield high yields.**

    - *High Yield Example*: **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Example*: **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Rigid structures with multiple coordination sites enhance metal binding due to fixed geometry and proximity of functional groups.

14. **Modifiers with terminal amino groups on flexible aliphatic chains yield low yields due to ineffective coordination and potential interference with catalyst sites.**

    - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Flexible chains may not position amino groups optimally for coordination, and terminal amino groups may occupy active sites without contributing to catalysis.

15. **Modifiers that are amino acids with sulfur-containing side chains yield low yields due to potential catalyst poisoning or deactivation.**

    - *Low Yield Example*: **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Sulfur-containing groups can bind strongly to metal centers, potentially blocking active sites and reducing catalyst activity.

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been formulated by analyzing the provided dataset and considering the underlying physicochemical properties that influence the reaction yield. Each rule combines multiple substructures (functional groups) to predict whether a molecular modifier will result in a high or low yield. By applying these rules, one can anticipate the expected yield outcome for any new SMILES structure fitting the described criteria, aiding in the optimization and control of the reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------
