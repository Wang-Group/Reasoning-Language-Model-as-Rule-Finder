# Results for the paper

- [direct_rule_generation](direct_rule_generation): the process of direct rules and codes generation via various LLMs. Containing the accuracis and standard error plotted in Figure 5.
- [drawing](drawing): draw the accuracies and SHAP values plots shown in Figure 5.
- [metric_beyond_accuracy_inFig4.ipynb](metric_beyond_accuracy_inFig4.ipynb): precision, recall, F1_scores, ROC-AUC scores for methods shown in Figure 5. The results are logged in the Supporting Information.
- [LLM_pipeline_outputs](LLM_pipeline_outputs): original logs of iterative LLM pipelines.
- [rule_selection_o1](rule_selection_o1): the rule selection process on the o1-generated rules during the iterative process.
- [selected_rule_log_o1](selected_rule_log_o1): the original log for the selected rule: **para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing, metal-coordinating groups give high yields; while electron-donating or non-coordinating substitution groups give low yields.**
- [traditional_feature_selection](traditional_feature_selection): feature selection on the traditional descriptors.
- [Accuracis_of_iterative_LLMs.ipynb](Accuracis_of_iterative_LLMs.ipynb): Calculate the accuracies for iterative LLMs
- [ARIAL.TTF](ARIAL.TTF): the font file for plotting.
- [langgraph_visulization.ipynb](langgraph_visulization.ipynb): the visualizaiton of the langgraph pipeline.
