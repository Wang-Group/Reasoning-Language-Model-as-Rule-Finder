Below is a structured summary of the results and supporting materials you provided for the paper:

1. [direct_rule_generation](direct_rule_generation) 
   • Description: Outlines the process for generating rules and code directly via various LLMs.  
   • Output: Includes accuracy measurements with standard error, which are visualized in Figure 5.

2. [drawing](drawing) 
   • Description: Contains scripts or code to plot the results.   
   • Output: Produces the accuracy graphs and SHAP values plots shown in Figure 5.

3. [metric_beyond_accuracy_inFig4.ipynb](metric_beyond_accuracy_inFig4.ipynb) 
   • Description: A Jupyter Notebook that calculates additional evaluation metrics.  
   • Output: Computes precision, recall, F1_scores, and ROC-AUC scores for the methods described in Figure 5. These results are documented in the Supporting Information (Table S4).

4. [LLM_pipeline_outputs](LLM_pipeline_outputs)
   • Description: Provides original logs for the iterative LLM pipelines used in the study.  
   • Output: Serves as a reference for the full sequence of pipeline outputs during iterations.

5. [rule_selection_o1](rule_selection_o1)
   • Description: Documents the rule selection process applied to rules generated by method o1.  
   • Output: Shows how candidate rules are filtered and selected during the iterative process.

6. [selected_rule_log_o1](selected_rule_log_o1)
   • Description: Contains the log for a specific selected rule.  
   • Key Rule: "para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing, metal-coordinating groups give high yields; while electron-donating or non-coordinating substitution groups give low yields."  
   • Output: Provides details on the rationale and logging for this selected rule.

7. [traditional_feature_selection](traditional_feature_selection)  
   • Description: Details the feature selection performed on traditional descriptors.  
   • Output: Helps compare and contrast traditional feature engineering methods with LLM-based approaches.
