- exp_statistics: only experimental descriptors are used.
- trad_statistics: Only traditional descriptors are used.
- Fe_statistics: only Fe loading is used as the feature.
- kimi_statistics: kimi-k1.5 (Direct) + Exp. Descriptor.
- o3mini_statistics: o3-mini (Direct) + Exp. Descriptor.
- qwen_statistics: qwen-max (Direct) + Exp. Descriptor.
- o1_1rule_statistics: o1 (Code) + Exp. Descriptor.
- o1_4rules_statistics: the top four significant rules generated by o1 pipeline with code + Exp. Descriptor.
Both the first rule and the rule set of the top four rules are found meaningful. But the first rule is proved to result in a larger accuracy.
- o1_direct_statistics: o1 (Direct) + Exp. Descriptor.
- tradnexp_statistics: Exp. + Traditional Descriptor.
