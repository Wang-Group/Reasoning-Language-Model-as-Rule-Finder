      "**Modifiers Whose Yields Are Driven by Fe Loading:**\n",
      "\n",
      "For modifiers where the yield correlates directly with Fe loading—meaning high Fe loading results in high yield and low Fe loading leads to low yield—the reaction's success depends on the availability of catalytically active Fe centers within the Hf-TPY-MOL framework. These modifiers lack functional groups that can compensate for low Fe loading or enhance the catalytic activity independently. Therefore, sufficient Fe incorporation into the catalyst is essential for these reactions to proceed efficiently.\n",

      "\n",
      "- **Octanoic acid** (Index 5): A simple aliphatic carboxylic acid without additional coordinating groups.\n",
      "- **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Index 22): Although it contains a pyridine ring, when Fe loading is low, there isn't enough Fe to facilitate the reaction effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Chemical Insight:** These modifiers do not possess functional groups capable of coordinating to Fe or participating in alternative catalytic pathways. As a result, their reaction yields are directly influenced by the amount of Fe loaded into the catalyst. High Fe loading provides more active sites for catalysis, leading to higher yields.\n",

These modifiers contain functional groups that can interact with Fe ions, enhancing the catalytic activity even when Fe loading is low. They may form stable complexes with Fe, acting as co-catalysts or facilitating electron transfer processes essential for the radical-mediated reaction.\n",

      "- **4-(3,4-Dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (Index 26): Methoxy groups can donate electron density to Fe, stabilizing it and facilitating catalysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Chemical Insight:** The presence of amino groups, heterocycles like indole, or methoxy substituents allows these modifiers to bind to Fe ions effectively, forming complexes that are catalytically competent even when the overall Fe loading is low. These functional groups can donate electron density, stabilize oxidation states of Fe, and assist in electron transfer during the radical process, ensuring high yields independent of Fe loading.\n",

      "An interesting case is **4-Sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Index 10), where the yield is low despite high Fe loading.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Chemical Insight:** The sulfanyl (thiol) group in this modifier has a strong affinity for Fe, potentially leading to the formation of very stable Fe-sulfur complexes. While coordination to Fe is occurring, these complexes might be catalytically inactive or may even poison the catalyst by blocking active sites necessary for the reaction. The strong binding of sulfur to Fe could prevent the Fe from participating in the desired radical-mediated process, thus resulting in low yields despite high Fe loading.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:**\n",
      "\n",

      "- **Modifiers with Fe-coordinating functional groups** (e.g., amino, methoxy, indole rings) can maintain or enhance catalytic activity even at low Fe loading by forming active Fe complexes; their yields are not driven by Fe loading.\n",

    "This is a data set of modifier in modulating the catalytic acitivity. we explored modifying metal-organic layer (MOL) surfaces to enhance their catalytic activity in C–H bond activation of long-chain alcohols22, as shown in Figure 1. The MOLs were constructed from Hf6(μ3-O)4(μ3-OH)4(HCO2)6 clusters as the secondary building units (SBUs) and terpyridine-tricarboxylate (TPY) as ligands. Fe centers were anchored on the TPY ligands23, which catalyze sp³ C–H bond activation through photon-driven ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) process22. Using a dataset of carboxylic acids as molecular modifiers on the MOL surface, we systematically examined how the structure of these modifiers influences catalytic performance (Figure 1a-b). \n",
    "Hf-TPY-MOL, Hf6(μ3-O)4(μ3-OH)4(HCO2)6(TPY)2, was employed as a support for Fe3+ ions to study the heterogeneous photocatalytic δ-C(sp3)-H amination of 1-pentanol22. The Hf-TPY-MOL was synthesized following a previously published procedure23, and its structure and morphology were confirmed using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). To load Fe3+, Hf-TPY-MOL was dispersed in acetonitrile (CH3CN) containing 1.05 equivalents of Fe(OTf)3 relative to TPY ligands and stirred at room temperature for 24 hours. The resulting Fe3+-loaded Hf-TPY-MOL (Hf-TPY-MOL-Fe) exhibited a blue-violet color and was washed extensively with CH3CN to remove uncoordinated Fe3+, as confirmed by UV-Vis spectroscopy. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) indicated Fe3+ 102% metalation of the TPY ligands with the determined amount of Fe corresponding to 102% of the TPY sites.\n",
    "The catalytic activity of Hf-TPY-MOL-Fe was tested in the photocatalytic amination of 1-pentanol with di-tert-butyl azodicarboxylate (DBAD). A mixture of Hf-TPY-MOL-Fe (2 mg), DBAD (1 equivalent), 1-pentanol (3 equivalents), and tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBACl, 1.25 mol%) was irradiated with 393 nm LED light under a nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature for 12 hours. Reaction yields were quantified using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (¹H-NMR) with CH₂Br₂ as an internal standard, yielding a moderate product conversion of 9% relative to DBAD, corresponding to a turnover number (TON) of 41 on Fe.\n",
    "To confirm the heterogeneous nature of the catalysis and rule out the leaching of Fe³⁺ ions, UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy of the reaction supernatant revealed no detectable Fe³⁺ signals. Cross-experiments were conducted using 1-pentanol as the substrate, followed by the addition of n-hexane to the supernatant after isolating the solid catalyst. Significant conversion of 1-pentanol, but no reaction with n-hexane, confirmed that the supernatant lacked catalytic activity. In comparison, the Hf-TPY-MOL-Fe has high activity (TON of 233, yield of 35% after irradiation of 12 h) for converting n-hexane to a mixture of 1-substitution (di-tert-butyl 1-hexylhydrazine-1,2-dicarboxylate), 2-substitution, and 3-substitution (2.0: 1.9: 1.0). Furthermore, ICP-OES analysis verified that the Fe/Hf ratio remained unchanged before and after the reaction, confirming that Fe³⁺ ions remained bound to the MOL throughout the reaction.\n",
    "The Hf6(μ3-O)4(μ3-OH)4 SBU in the Hf-TPY-MOL contains six formate-capped sites that can be replaced by other carboxylates, enabling post-synthetic modification of the MOLs. This straightforward replacement chemistry allows systematic tuning of the surface properties (Figure 2a). Surface modification not only affects the interaction between the terpyridine-Fe3+-Cl active site and the substrate but also alters the surface solvent structure, thereby influencing catalytic activity. To investigate these effects, we systematically studied how different molecular modifiers impact the catalytic performance of Fe3+-loaded MOLs.\n",
    "For each modifier, Hf-TPY-MOL was incubated with a 0.2 M solution of a carboxylic acid modifier in CH3CN, H2O, DMF, or THF, chosen based on solubility, at 55 oC for 24 h. Structural integrity after modification was confirmed by PXRD and TEM (Figure 1b). The amount of substituted modifier was quantified by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) after digesting the MOL with K3PO4/D2O, expressed as the Modifier/SBU ratio. Subsequently, Fe3+ was loaded onto the modified Hf-TPY-MOL by reacting with Fe(OTf)3, and the resulting materials were tested as catalysts.\n",
    "Significant variations in activity and yield were observed among different modifications (Figure 2b). Most carboxylic acid modifications enhanced activity, with several achieving a turnover number (TON) exceeding 600, indicating substantial improvement. However, certain modifiers, such as 2-(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)acetic acid, 4-mercaptobenzoic acid, and 4-formylbenzoic acid, inhibited the reaction, resulting in reduced catalytic activity. \n",
    "Fe3+ ions can coordinate with either the TPY ligands or the molecular modifiers on the SBUs in Hf-TPY-MOL. To differentiate the roles of Fe3+ ions at these two sites, we designed a control catalyst, Hf-BTB-MOL, using 1,3, 5-tri (4-carboxyphenyl) benzene (H3BTB) as the ligand, which lacks TPY sites for Fe coordination (Figure S2a). The synthesized Hf-BTB-MOL was characterized by PXRD and TEM (Figure S2b-d). Upon loading Fe3+ via reaction with Fe(OTf)₃ (1.05 equivalents) in CH3CN, yellow MOLs were obtained. Under standard catalytic conditions, Hf-BTB-MOL (Fe) exhibited no activity (0% yield). However, when modified with L-aspartate, the catalyst achieved a significantly higher yield of 80.4%, indicating that both Fe³⁺ ions on TPY sites and Fe3+ ions interacting with modifiers contribute to the catalytic activity.\n",
    "To elucidate the reaction mechanism, free radical trapping agents were employed. The addition of radical quenchers, such as Butylated Hydroxytoluene (BHT) or 2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO), completely inhibited the reaction, supporting the proposed radical pathway. This finding aligns with prior research22. Control experiments without Fe3+ showed no conversion, confirming that Fe3+ is essential for catalysis. Similarly, reactions conducted in the dark yielded no conversion, demonstrating the photo-driven nature of the reaction. \n",
    "Additionally, removing TBACl from the reaction system resulted in zero conversion, highlighting the critical of Cl- in forming a Fe3+-Cl bond. This bond facilitates ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT), generating Cl• radicals that initiate hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) with 1-pentanol. Substrate scope experiments (Figure S3) further validated the importance of the hydroxyl groups for δ-position selectivity via [1,5] HAT pathway. \n",
    "To address missing factors, two experimental descriptors—Fe loading (defined as the amount of Fe relative to the substrate) and the modifier/SBU ratio—were introduced into the models. Notably, Fe loading was deliberately decoupled from the Fe/Hf ratio by varying the amount of Hf-TPY-MOL used in each experiment. This random variation ensured that Fe loading (relative to the substrate) was independent of any molecular descriptors, avoiding potential biases where molecular modifications could affect Fe coordination and thus distort feature selection.\n",

    "rules = '''\n",
    "Below is a high‐level look at what stands out in the data and some plausible “rules” or trends that correlate structural features of the carboxylic‐acid modifiers with the observed yields. Obviously, with only a few dozen data points, these are qualitative guidelines rather than hard‐and‐fast conclusions.\n",
    "1. Certain para‐substituted benzoic acids give large boosts—unless they can chelate Fe\n",
    "Several substituted‐benzoic acids in the dataset show high yields (e.g., p‐bromo, p‐amino, p‐nitro), but others crash the yield (e.g., p‐formyl or p‐mercapto). A likely interpretation:\n",
    "High‐yield substituents such as –Br, –NO₂, –NH₂ at the para‐position are either purely electron‐withdrawing (–Br, –NO₂) or electron‐donating but not strongly Fe‐chelating (para‐amino). They presumably tune the local electronics favorably without “stealing” the iron center from the terpyridine site.\n",
    "Low‐yield substituents (e.g., –CHO, –SH on the ring) are prone to coordinate/chelate Fe³⁺ or otherwise disrupt the active site. A formyl group (–CHO) can interact with metal centers, and a thiol on an aromatic ring can bind Fe or form disulfides. Both appear to poison the catalyst.\n",
    "Concrete examples from the table:\n",
    "p‐Bromo “C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O” → Yield ~0.70\n",
    "p‐Amino “C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)N” → Yield ~0.68\n",
    "p‐Nitro “C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)N+[O-]” → Yield ~0.65\n",
    "p‐Formyl “C1=CC(=CC=C1C=O)C(=O)O” → Yield = 0.00\n",
    "p‐Mercapto “C1=CC(=C(C=C1C(=O)O)S” → Yield ~0.07\n",
    "Hence, simple ring substituents that don’t bind Fe directly can be good, but ring substituents that introduce strong Fe interactions (chelation, etc.) kill activity.\n",
    "2. Aliphatic modifiers can be quite good—unless they have strongly coordinating groups placed badly\n",
    "Straight‐chain carboxylic acids (no additional polar functional groups near the metal site) often give respectable yields. For instance:\n",
    "Octanoic acid (“CCCCCCCC(=O)O”) → Yield ~0.69\n",
    "3‐Mercaptopropionic acid (“C(CS)C(=O)O”) → Yield ~0.69\n",
    "Interestingly, having a thiol far from the carboxyl (as in 3‐mercaptopropionic acid) works well, while a thiol directly on an aromatic ring (4‐mercaptobenzoic acid) wrecks the yield. This suggests that if a “soft” donor group (like –SH) is positioned too close to (or conjugated with) the aromatic ring, it can coordinate to Fe³⁺ and block the terpyridine site. But if it is “spaced out” on a flexible chain, it no longer poisons the iron center.\n",
    "By contrast, many large “functionalized” chains with multiple polar groups or strongly coordinating moieties drastically reduce yields (e.g., the PEG‐like “COCCOCCOCC(=O)O” had yield ~0.03).\n",
    "3. Amino‐acid‐type modifiers often boost yields (e.g., aspartic acid)\n",
    "Several amino acids or related molecules give high or at least moderate yields. For example:\n",
    "Aspartic acid (“C(CC(=O)O)C@@HN”) → Yield ~0.71 (highest)\n",
    "Another aspartate‐like structure → Yield ~0.66\n",
    "Other short‐chain amino acids (e.g., GABA‐type “C(CCN)CC(=O)O”) → moderate yields ~0.50\n",
    "Probably these modifiers assist hydrogen bonding or orient the substrate favorably around the Fe–TPY sites, without strongly chelating Fe. However, once the amino‐acid side chain grows too large or carries additional strongly coordinating groups (amides, phenols, etc.), the yield tends to drop.\n",
    "4. Substituents that directly coordinate Fe can “poison” the site\n",
    "Compounds that have functional groups known to bind strongly to metal centers (e.g., a phenolate, –SH on an aromatic ring, –CHO that can form metal–imine or metal–O interactions) correlate with low yields. This is especially visible in:\n",
    "4‐formylbenzoic acid (–CHO) → 0% yield\n",
    "4‐mercaptobenzoic acid (aromatic –SH) → 0.07\n",
    "Meanwhile, “gentle” electron donors or withdrawing groups that do not overshadow the Fe–TPY binding (like p‐NO₂, p‐Br, p‐NH₂) leave the catalytic site accessible and yield higher activity.\n",
    "5. No simple “numeric” correlation with Fe‐loading or M_SBU\n",
    "Looking purely at the numeric columns:\n",
    "Fe_loading (moles Fe relative to substrate) varies widely (0.2–1.35) with both high‐ and low‐yield examples scattered across the range.\n",
    "M_SBU (the number of modifier molecules per Hf6 SBU) likewise does not show a simple linear correlation with yield.\n",
    "In other words, “just adding more Fe” or “just substituting more modifier” is not enough. The chemical nature of the modifier (i.e., can it coordinate Fe in an undesired way or not?) is the main driver.\n",
    "6. Summary of “Rules of Thumb”\n",
    "From this small dataset, a few broad guidelines emerge:\n",
    "Avoid strong Fe‐chelating functional groups near the carboxylate (especially on aromatic rings). They disrupt or compete with the terpyridine–Fe active site.\n",
    "Electron‐withdrawing or mildly electron‐donating ring substituents (e.g., nitro, bromo, amino in the para position) are often beneficial—likely because they tune polarity or local environment but do not bind Fe directly.\n",
    "Simple aliphatic acids (especially medium‐chain length) and amino acids can give high yields, as long as any extra functional groups (like –SH) are spatially separated from Fe.\n",
    "Overly polar or large “multidentate” functional groups (PEG‐like or ring‐attached donors) can kill the yield by introducing unwanted Fe coordination or strongly altering the MOL’s environment.\n",
    "These observations are consistent with the idea that the best modifiers either:\n",
    "Gently tune local polarity/electronic structure around Fe without “stealing” it from the TPY site,\n",
    "Or help orient the substrate for efficient HAT and radical chemistry,\n",
    "But do not provide direct coordination sites to the iron center beyond the primary TPY–Fe–Cl motif.\n",
    "Hence, when choosing new modifiers, one would avoid substituents known to be strong chelators or that form strong internal hydrogen/coordinate bonds to Fe, and instead select moieties that remain mostly “innocent” while providing the right balance of polarity near the surface.\n",

    "Below is a concise summary of the trends we can extract from the data:\n",
    "Key Role of Modifier Structure:\n",
    "– Problematic Functional Groups: Modifiers bearing groups known to bind strongly to Fe (or otherwise interfere with the LMCT process) give very low yields. For example:\n",
    " • 4‐Mercaptobenzoic acid (SMILES with “S”, row 11) gives yield ≈ 0.07, and\n",
    " • 4‐Formylbenzoic acid (row 21) gives 0% yield.\n",
    "– Polyether‐Type Modifiers: A modifier with a chain of ethoxy units (row 12) also nearly shuts down the reaction (yield ≈ 0.03), suggesting that too much hydrophilicity or conformational flexibility can be detrimental.\n",
    "Beneficial Modifiers:\n",
    "– Many “simple” carboxylic acids—whether aliphatic (e.g. octanoic acid, row 6) or aromatic with modest substituents (e.g. brominated or nitrobenzoic acids, rows 2 and 22)—tend to give high yields (≈ 0.65–0.71).\n",
    "– Some amino acid derivatives (e.g. aspartic acid in row 1 and aminobenzoic acid in row 5) also perform well.\n",
    "Surface Coverage (M_SBU) Effects:\n",
    "– The modifier/SBU ratio (M_SBU) varies from about 0.3 to 3. In some cases a high substitution (e.g. M_SBU ≈ 3 in row 9) is compatible with high yield, but when combined with a problematic functional group (as in row 11), high coverage correlates with inhibition.\n",
    "– Thus, an optimal degree of modification appears to depend on the chemical nature of the modifier: too little may not influence the surface enough, but too much of an “active” (i.e. interfering) modifier can hurt performance.\n",
    "Fe‐Loading and Fe/Hf Ratios:\n",
    "– No simple linear correlation is seen between yield and either Fe_loading or Fe_Hf. The variation in these parameters (which were deliberately decoupled from the modifier chemistry) suggests that while the Fe metrics are important for catalysis, the chemical “identity” of the modifier is the dominant factor.\n",
    "Overall Rule-of-Thumb:\n",
    "Modifiers that are “innocent” – that is, those that do not introduce strongly coordinating or disruptive groups (like –SH or –CHO) and that provide moderate surface coverage – tend to enhance or at least maintain high catalytic yields. In contrast, modifiers with groups that can either bind too strongly to Fe or overly alter the local solvent/coordination environment tend to inhibit the reaction.\n",
    "These qualitative trends suggest that when selecting or designing new modifiers, one should avoid functionalities (e.g. thiol or aldehyde groups, or overly flexible polyether chains) that may interfere with the critical Fe³⁺–Cl LMCT step, and instead favor simple carboxylic acids or derivatives that offer the right balance of hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity without strong competing coordination.\n",

    "In summary, possible rules could be:\n",
    "Aromatic Rings with Electron-Withdrawing Groups: Modifiers containing aromatic rings (like benzene) with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., -NO2, -Br) tend to have higher yields. These groups might activate the Fe center.\n",
    "Multiple Carboxylic Acid Groups: Modifiers with more than one carboxylic acid group may anchor more effectively to the Fe centers, enhancing activity. However, this isn't always the case, so other factors like steric effects might interfere.\n",
    "Presence of Electron-Donating Groups: Modifiers with electron-donating groups (e.g., -OCH3, -NH2) might reduce activity by deactivating the Fe center.\n",
    "Steric Hindrance: Bulky or highly branched modifiers could hinder substrate access to the active site, leading to lower yields.\n",
    "Functional Groups That Bind to Fe: Modifiers with functional groups that can coordinate to Fe (like carboxylic acids) are necessary for activity, but certain groups (like thiols or aldehydes) might inhibit by blocking the active site.\n",
    "Modifier/SBU Ratio: Higher M_SBU ratios (more modifier per SBU) might sometimes correlate with higher yields, but this isn't consistent, indicating that the structure of the modifier is more critical than the quantity.\n",
    "To validate these rules, I could perform a more detailed analysis, such as calculating molecular descriptors (e.g., logP, number of aromatic rings, presence of specific functional groups) and using statistical methods or machine learning to find correlations with yield. However, given the limited data, these are preliminary observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze the rules governing the effect of molecular modifiers on catalytic yields, we systematically examined the relationship between structural features of the modifiers (represented by SMILES) and the provided parameters (Fe_loading, Fe_Hf, M_SBU, Yield). Below is a structured summary of the key observations and inferred rules:\n",
    "1. Structural Features of Modifiers\n",
    "A. Aromatic Rings with Electron-Withdrawing Groups (EWGs)\n",
    "High-Yield Examples:\n",
    "SMILES: C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O (yield: 0.696), C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)N (yield: 0.680), C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)[N+](=O)[O-] (yield: 0.645).\n",
    "Key Features: Benzene rings with halogens (Br, Cl) or nitro groups (-NO₂) enhance catalytic activity. EWGs likely stabilize charge transfer processes or activate the Fe³⁺ center.\n",
    "B. Electron-Donating Groups (EDGs)\n",
    "Low-Yield Examples:\n",
    "SMILES: COCCOCCOCC(=O)O (yield: 0.029), C(COCCOCCN)C(=O)O (yield: 0.207).\n",
    "Key Features: Long alkyl chains or ethers (e.g., -OCH₂CH₂-) may reduce activity by deactivating the Fe³⁺ center or introducing steric hindrance.\n",
    "C. Steric Hindrance\n",
    "Low-Yield Examples:\n",
    "SMILES: C1=CC=C2C(=C1)C(=CN2)C[C@H](C(=O)O)N (yield: 0.614), C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N (yield: 0.091).\n",
    "Key Features: Bulky or highly branched structures (e.g., polycyclic rings) likely hinder substrate access to the active site.\n",
    "D. Functional Groups That Bind to Fe³⁺\n",
    "High-Yield Examples:\n",
    "SMILES: C(CS)C(=O)O (yield: 0.688), C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)S (yield: 0.066).\n",
    "Key Features: Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are essential for Fe³⁺ coordination. However, thiols (-SH) or aldehydes (-CHO) may inhibit activity by blocking the active site.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Parameter Analysis\n",
    "A. Fe_loading (Fe/substrate ratio)\n",
    "Observation: No clear correlation with yield. For example:\n",
    "High Fe_loading (0.88) → yield: 0.656.\n",
    "Low Fe_loading (0.22) → yield: 0.680.\n",
    "Inference: Fe_loading alone does not dictate yield; modifier structure is more critical.\n",
    "B. Fe_Hf (Fe/Hf ratio)\n",
    "Observation: Higher Fe_Hf ratios (e.g., 0.314) correlate with moderate yields (e.g., 0.396), but exceptions exist.\n",
    "Inference: Fe_Hf is not a primary driver of activity.\n",
    "C. M_SBU (Modifier/SBU ratio)\n",
    "Observation: Higher M_SBU ratios (e.g., 3) sometimes improve yield (e.g., 0.659), but not consistently.\n",
    "Inference: Modifier structure outweighs quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inhibitory Modifiers\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "SMILES: C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)S (yield: 0.066), C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N (yield: 0.091).\n",
    "Key Features: Thiols (-SH) or complex chiral centers may block the Fe³⁺-Cl bond critical for ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Proposed Rules\n",
    "Aromatic Rings with EWGs: Enhance activity by stabilizing charge transfer.\n",
    "Electron-Donating Groups: Reduce activity by deactivating Fe³⁺.\n",
    "Steric Hindrance: Bulky modifiers hinder substrate access.\n",
    "Fe³⁺-Binding Groups: Carboxylic acids are essential; thiols/aldehydes inhibit.\n",
    "Modifier Structure > Quantity: M_SBU ratio is secondary to structural effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Recommendations for Future Work\n",
    "Molecular Descriptors: Calculate logP, aromaticity, and functional group counts to quantify structure-activity relationships.\n",
    "Machine Learning: Train models to predict yields from SMILES and parameters.\n",
    "Mechanistic Studies: Use DFT calculations to explore charge transfer pathways for high-yield modifiers.\n",
    "This analysis provides a framework for rational design of modifiers to optimize catalytic performance in Fe³⁺-loaded MOL systems.\n",

Below, I outline potential trends and relationships based on the data:\n",

      "### **1. Structural Features of Modifiers**\n",
      "The SMILES strings represent the molecular structures of the carboxylic acid modifiers. By examining these, we can identify functional groups or structural motifs that correlate with high or low yields:\n",

      "#### a. **Functional Groups Linked to High Yields**\n",
      "Modifiers achieving higher yields (> 0.5) often contain:\n",
      "   - Aromatic rings (e.g., benzoic acids): These appear frequently in high-yield entries.\n",
      "     - Examples: `C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)N`, `C1=CC(=CN=C1)C(=O)O`.\n",
      "   - Hydroxyl groups: Compounds with hydroxyl groups or ether linkages tend to improve activity.\n",
      "     - Example: `C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)O`.\n",
      "   - Aliphatic chains with amine functionalities: These may enhance substrate interaction.\n",

      "### **Key Takeaways**\n",
      "The activity of Fe3+-loaded MOLs is highly sensitive to both the chemical structure of the modifiers and their interaction with the catalyst surface. Aromatic and polar modifiers with moderate surface coverage and Fe loading tend to maximize catalytic efficiency. Steric hindrance and electron-withdrawing groups should be avoided to prevent deactivation of the Fe3+ centers.\n",
      "\n",
      "If additional data or computational tools (e.g., machine learning models) become available, more precise predictions can be made regarding optimal modifier designs for future studies. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Boxed Final Answer**:\n",
      "Patterns suggest that **aromaticity**, **polar groups**, and **moderate steric bulk** enhance catalytic yields, while electron-withdrawing groups, bulky moieties, and excessive surface coverage inhibit activity. The most effective configurations occur under Fe_loading ≈ 0.4–0.7, Fe_Hf ≈ 0.1–0.25, and M_SBU ≈ 1–2.\n"

    "This is a data set of modifier in modulating the catalytic acitivity. we explored modifying metal-organic layer (MOL) surfaces to enhance their catalytic activity in C–H bond activation of long-chain alcohols22, as shown in Figure 1. The MOLs were constructed from Hf6(μ3-O)4(μ3-OH)4(HCO2)6 clusters as the secondary building units (SBUs) and terpyridine-tricarboxylate (TPY) as ligands. Fe centers were anchored on the TPY ligands23, which catalyze sp³ C–H bond activation through photon-driven ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) process22. Using a dataset of carboxylic acids as molecular modifiers on the MOL surface, we systematically examined how the structure of these modifiers influences catalytic performance (Figure 1a-b). \n",
    "Hf-TPY-MOL, Hf6(μ3-O)4(μ3-OH)4(HCO2)6(TPY)2, was employed as a support for Fe3+ ions to study the heterogeneous photocatalytic δ-C(sp3)-H amination of 1-pentanol22. The Hf-TPY-MOL was synthesized following a previously published procedure23, and its structure and morphology were confirmed using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). To load Fe3+, Hf-TPY-MOL was dispersed in acetonitrile (CH3CN) containing 1.05 equivalents of Fe(OTf)3 relative to TPY ligands and stirred at room temperature for 24 hours. The resulting Fe3+-loaded Hf-TPY-MOL (Hf-TPY-MOL-Fe) exhibited a blue-violet color and was washed extensively with CH3CN to remove uncoordinated Fe3+, as confirmed by UV-Vis spectroscopy. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) indicated Fe3+ 102% metalation of the TPY ligands with the determined amount of Fe corresponding to 102% of the TPY sites.\n",
    "The catalytic activity of Hf-TPY-MOL-Fe was tested in the photocatalytic amination of 1-pentanol with di-tert-butyl azodicarboxylate (DBAD). A mixture of Hf-TPY-MOL-Fe (2 mg), DBAD (1 equivalent), 1-pentanol (3 equivalents), and tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBACl, 1.25 mol%) was irradiated with 393 nm LED light under a nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature for 12 hours. Reaction yields were quantified using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (¹H-NMR) with CH₂Br₂ as an internal standard, yielding a moderate product conversion of 9% relative to DBAD, corresponding to a turnover number (TON) of 41 on Fe.\n",
    "To confirm the heterogeneous nature of the catalysis and rule out the leaching of Fe³⁺ ions, UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy of the reaction supernatant revealed no detectable Fe³⁺ signals. Cross-experiments were conducted using 1-pentanol as the substrate, followed by the addition of n-hexane to the supernatant after isolating the solid catalyst. Significant conversion of 1-pentanol, but no reaction with n-hexane, confirmed that the supernatant lacked catalytic activity. In comparison, the Hf-TPY-MOL-Fe has high activity (TON of 233, yield of 35% after irradiation of 12 h) for converting n-hexane to a mixture of 1-substitution (di-tert-butyl 1-hexylhydrazine-1,2-dicarboxylate), 2-substitution, and 3-substitution (2.0: 1.9: 1.0). Furthermore, ICP-OES analysis verified that the Fe/Hf ratio remained unchanged before and after the reaction, confirming that Fe³⁺ ions remained bound to the MOL throughout the reaction.\n",
    "The Hf6(μ3-O)4(μ3-OH)4 SBU in the Hf-TPY-MOL contains six formate-capped sites that can be replaced by other carboxylates, enabling post-synthetic modification of the MOLs. This straightforward replacement chemistry allows systematic tuning of the surface properties (Figure 2a). Surface modification not only affects the interaction between the terpyridine-Fe3+-Cl active site and the substrate but also alters the surface solvent structure, thereby influencing catalytic activity. To investigate these effects, we systematically studied how different molecular modifiers impact the catalytic performance of Fe3+-loaded MOLs.\n",
    "For each modifier, Hf-TPY-MOL was incubated with a 0.2 M solution of a carboxylic acid modifier in CH3CN, H2O, DMF, or THF, chosen based on solubility, at 55 oC for 24 h. Structural integrity after modification was confirmed by PXRD and TEM (Figure 1b). The amount of substituted modifier was quantified by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) after digesting the MOL with K3PO4/D2O, expressed as the Modifier/SBU ratio. Subsequently, Fe3+ was loaded onto the modified Hf-TPY-MOL by reacting with Fe(OTf)3, and the resulting materials were tested as catalysts.\n",
    "Significant variations in activity and yield were observed among different modifications (Figure 2b). Most carboxylic acid modifications enhanced activity, with several achieving a turnover number (TON) exceeding 600, indicating substantial improvement. However, certain modifiers, such as 2-(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)acetic acid, 4-mercaptobenzoic acid, and 4-formylbenzoic acid, inhibited the reaction, resulting in reduced catalytic activity. \n",
    "Fe3+ ions can coordinate with either the TPY ligands or the molecular modifiers on the SBUs in Hf-TPY-MOL. To differentiate the roles of Fe3+ ions at these two sites, we designed a control catalyst, Hf-BTB-MOL, using 1,3, 5-tri (4-carboxyphenyl) benzene (H3BTB) as the ligand, which lacks TPY sites for Fe coordination (Figure S2a). The synthesized Hf-BTB-MOL was characterized by PXRD and TEM (Figure S2b-d). Upon loading Fe3+ via reaction with Fe(OTf)₃ (1.05 equivalents) in CH3CN, yellow MOLs were obtained. Under standard catalytic conditions, Hf-BTB-MOL (Fe) exhibited no activity (0% yield). However, when modified with L-aspartate, the catalyst achieved a significantly higher yield of 80.4%, indicating that both Fe³⁺ ions on TPY sites and Fe3+ ions interacting with modifiers contribute to the catalytic activity.\n",
    "To elucidate the reaction mechanism, free radical trapping agents were employed. The addition of radical quenchers, such as Butylated Hydroxytoluene (BHT) or 2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO), completely inhibited the reaction, supporting the proposed radical pathway. This finding aligns with prior research22. Control experiments without Fe3+ showed no conversion, confirming that Fe3+ is essential for catalysis. Similarly, reactions conducted in the dark yielded no conversion, demonstrating the photo-driven nature of the reaction. \n",
    "Additionally, removing TBACl from the reaction system resulted in zero conversion, highlighting the critical of Cl- in forming a Fe3+-Cl bond. This bond facilitates ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT), generating Cl• radicals that initiate hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) with 1-pentanol. Substrate scope experiments (Figure S3) further validated the importance of the hydroxyl groups for δ-position selectivity via [1,5] HAT pathway. \n",
    "To address missing factors, two experimental descriptors—Fe loading (defined as the amount of Fe relative to the substrate) and the modifier/SBU ratio—were introduced into the models. Notably, Fe loading was deliberately decoupled from the Fe/Hf ratio by varying the amount of Hf-TPY-MOL used in each experiment. This random variation ensured that Fe loading (relative to the substrate) was independent of any molecular descriptors, avoiding potential biases where molecular modifications could affect Fe coordination and thus distort feature selection.\n",

Below, I outline potential trends and relationships based on the data:\n",

    "### **1. Structural Features of Modifiers**\n",
    "The SMILES strings represent the molecular structures of the carboxylic acid modifiers. By examining these, we can identify functional groups or structural motifs that correlate with high or low yields:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. **Functional Groups Linked to High Yields**\n",
    "Modifiers achieving higher yields (> 0.5) often contain:\n",
    "   - Aromatic rings (e.g., benzoic acids): These appear frequently in high-yield entries.\n",
    "     - Examples: `C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)N`, `C1=CC(=CN=C1)C(=O)O`.\n",
    "   - Hydroxyl groups: Compounds with hydroxyl groups or ether linkages tend to improve activity.\n",
    "     - Example: `C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)O`.\n",
    "   - Aliphatic chains with amine functionalities: These may enhance substrate interaction.\n",
    "     - Example: `C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. **Functional Groups Linked to Low Yields**\n",
    "Modifiers with very low yields (< 0.1) often contain:\n",
    "   - Electron-withdrawing groups like nitro groups (-NO2) or formyl groups (-CHO), which may deactivate the Fe3+ center.\n",
    "     - Example: `C1=CC(=CC=C1C=O)C(=O)O` (contains aldehyde).\n",
    "   - Bulky functional groups or long polyether chains, which may sterically hinder the active site.\n",
    "     - Example: `COCCOCCOCC(=O)O` (long polyether chain).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Quantitative Relationships**\n",
    "#### a. **Fe Loading (Fe_loading)**\n",
    "Higher Fe loading generally correlates with better yields, but this is not universally true. Some compounds achieve high yields even at low Fe loading, likely due to optimized interactions between the modifier and the substrate.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **High Fe_loading + High Yield**: Compounds like `C1=C(C=NN1)C(=O)O` and `C([C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](C(=O)O)O)O)O)O)O`.\n",
    "   - **Low Fe_loading + Moderate Yield**: Compounds like `C(CCN)CC(=O)O`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. **Modifier-to-SBU Ratio (M_SBU)**\n",
    "Modifiers with M_SBU values around 1–2 tend to produce higher yields, suggesting an optimal balance between surface modification and active site accessibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Optimal Range**: M_SBU ≈ 1–2.\n",
    "     - Example: `C1=CNC(=O)C=C1C(=O)O` (high yield, M_SBU = 3).\n",
    "   - **Too High M_SBU**: May block active sites, reducing yield.\n",
    "     - Example: `C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)S` (very low yield, M_SBU = 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### c. **Fe/Hf Ratio (Fe_Hf)**\n",
    "This descriptor indicates the extent of Fe coordination relative to Hf6 clusters. Optimal Fe_Hf ranges for high yield are typically 0.1–0.25.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Optimal Range**: Fe_Hf ≈ 0.1–0.25.\n",
    "     - Example: `C1=C(C=NN1)C(=O)O` (high yield, Fe_Hf = 0.2).\n",
    "   - **Too High Fe_Hf**: May lead to overcoordination, reducing activity.\n",
    "     - Example: `C1=CC(=CC=C1C=O)C(=O)O` (very low yield, Fe_Hf = 0.12).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Trends in Specific Functionalities**\n",
    "#### a. **Aromaticity**\n",
    "Aromatic modifiers dominate among high-yield compounds. Their π-electron systems likely stabilize intermediates involved in LMCT processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - High-Yield Examples:\n",
    "     - `C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)N` (nitrogen-containing aromatic ring).\n",
    "     - `C1=CC(=CN=C1)C(=O)O` (pyridine derivative).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding**\n",
    "Modifiers with polar functional groups (e.g., -OH, -NH2) or hydrogen bond donors/acceptors often exhibit improved activity due to enhanced substrate binding.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Example: `C1=CC(=CC=C1CCCCC(=O)O)O` (hydroxyl group enhances yield).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### c. **Steric Hindrance**\n",
    "Bulky modifiers or those with long side chains tend to reduce activity, likely due to steric blocking of the Fe3+ center.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Low-Yield Examples:\n",
    "     - `COCCOCCOCC(=O)O` (long polyether chain).\n",
    "     - `C1=CC(=CC=C1C=O)C(=O)O` (bulky aldehyde group).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Interaction Between Descriptors**\n",
    "#### a. **Synergy Between Fe_loading and M_SBU**\n",
    "Modifiers with moderate Fe_loading (~0.4–0.7) and M_SBU (~1–2) often show the highest yields, suggesting a balance between Fe availability and surface coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Example: `C1=CC(=CC=C1CCC(=O)O)O` (moderate Fe_loading = 0.54, M_SBU = 1.2, high yield).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. **Impact of Fe_Hf**\n",
    "At higher Fe_Hf values (> 0.25), yields decrease regardless of other factors, indicating potential saturation of Fe centers.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Example: `C1=CC(=CC=C1C=O)C(=O)O` (low yield, high Fe_Hf = 0.12).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. General Rules Derived from Analysis**\n",
    "Based on the patterns observed:\n",
    "   1. **Favorable Structures**:\n",
    "      - Aromatic rings (esp. with electron-donating substituents like -OH, -NH2).\n",
    "      - Short-to-moderate-length polar chains.\n",
    "      - Minimal sterically demanding groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. **Unfavorable Structures**:\n",
    "      - Bulky functional groups (e.g., aldehydes, large alkyl chains).\n",
    "      - Long polyether chains.\n",
    "      - Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., -NO2).\n",
    "\n",
    "   3. **Optimal Quantitative Parameters**:\n",
    "      - Fe_loading ≈ 0.4–0.7.\n",
    "      - Fe_Hf ≈ 0.1–0.25.\n",
    "      - M_SBU ≈ 1–2.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Takeaways**\n",
    "The activity of Fe3+-loaded MOLs is highly sensitive to both the chemical structure of the modifiers and their interaction with the catalyst surface. Aromatic and polar modifiers with moderate surface coverage and Fe loading tend to maximize catalytic efficiency. Steric hindrance and electron-withdrawing groups should be avoided to prevent deactivation of the Fe3+ centers.\n",
    "\n",
    "If additional data or computational tools (e.g., machine learning models) become available, more precise predictions can be made regarding optimal modifier designs for future studies. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Boxed Final Answer**:\n",
    "Patterns suggest that **aromaticity**, **polar groups**, and **moderate steric bulk** enhance catalytic yields, while electron-withdrawing groups, bulky moieties, and excessive surface coverage inhibit activity. The most effective configurations occur under Fe_loading ≈ 0.4–0.7, Fe_Hf ≈ 0.1–0.25, and M_SBU ≈ 1–2.\n",
