"Rule 1: Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing, Metal-Coordinating Groups Yield High; Electron-Donating or Non-Coordinating Groups Yield Low",Rule 2: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position (excluding amino groups) result in a low yield,Rule 3: Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing Substituents at the Para Position (Excluding Aldehydes) Lead to High Yield,Rule 4: Modifiers containing thiol groups on aromatic rings result in low yield due to steric hindrance and reduced thiol accessibility,Rule 5: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar functional groups on longer chains (six carbons or more) lead to low yield,Rule 6: Modifiers that contain amide bonds involving the amino group or near the carboxyl group predict a low yield,"Rule 7: Modifiers containing thiol groups lead to varying yields depending on their position: thiol groups on aliphatic chains result in high yield, while thiol groups on aromatic rings result in low yield",Rule 8: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with an amino group (-NHâ‚‚) at the para position tend to result in high yield,"Rule 9: Modifiers that include sulfur-containing groups, such as sulfanyl or thioether groups, generally produce a low yield","Rule 10: Modifiers that are aromatic amino acids with electron-rich heterocyclic side chains lead to high yield, while those with simple aromatic side chains lead to low yield"
