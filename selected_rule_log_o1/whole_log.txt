**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Combine or Remove Rules with Insufficient Coverage**

  Rules that are only supported by one data point (Rules 7, 10, 12, 13, 14) have insufficient coverage. Consider combining them with similar rules to increase their coverage or remove them if they cannot be supported with additional data. For example, merge Rule 7 (highly fluorinated aliphatic chains yield low) with other rules that relate to hydrophobic modifiers yielding low yield.

- **Advice 2**: **Clarify and Refine Rules with Ambiguities**

  Rules that lack clarity or have conflicting data (Rules 9 and 15) need to be refined. For Rule 9, avoid ambiguous terms like "variable results" and clearly specify the structural features that lead to high or low yield. For Rule 15, resolve any conflicting data points and ensure the rule accurately reflects the trends observed.

- **Advice 3**: **Increase Coverage by Generalizing or Merging Similar Rules**

  To improve coverage, consider generalizing rules or merging similar ones. For instance, combine Rules 6 and 12, both of which involve carbonyl groups (aldehyde and ketone) leading to low yield, into a single rule about modifiers with carbonyl groups adjacent to carboxylic acids resulting in low yield.

- **Advice 4**: **Expand Existing Rules to Include Additional Data Points**

  Review the dataset to identify additional modifiers that fit within existing rules but are not currently included. This can help strengthen the rules by increasing their coverage. For example, see if other modifiers with hydroxyl groups (Rule 5) or heterocyclic carboxylic acids (Rule 3) can be incorporated.

- **Advice 5**: **Introduce New Rules Based on Unaddressed Data Patterns**

  Analyze the dataset for patterns not covered by existing rules and consider formulating new rules. For instance, modifiers with amino groups on aromatic rings may influence yield; if this pattern exists, create a rule to capture it.

- **Advice 6**: **Ensure Each Rule Provides Clear Property Insight**

  Revisit each rule to ensure it offers a clear and specific property insight that explains the observed effect on yield. Avoid overly broad or vague statements. This will enhance the usefulness and applicability of the rules.

- **Advice 7**: **Validate Rules Against the Full Dataset**

  Cross-check each rule against the entire dataset to confirm that it consistently predicts high or low yield for relevant modifiers. This helps to identify exceptions or necessary refinements to the rules.

5. 
Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**
- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear in specifying that short-chain aliphatic amino acids (3-5 carbons, no aromatic rings) yield high, while longer chains (6+ carbons) yield low. The structural criteria are well-defined, and the examples in the dataset support the rule, with multiple data points on each side. The rule provides property insight by implicating chain length as a factor influencing yield, possibly due to steric or electronic effects. The complexity is appropriate; it considers both chain length and the absence of aromatic rings. Overall, the rule meets the criteria of clarity, property insight, complexity, and coverage.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 attempts to correlate para-substituent electronic effects with yield, stating that electron-withdrawing groups result in high yield, while electron-donating or bulky groups result in low yield. However, there are inconsistencies with this rule. For example, 4-aminobenzoic acid is listed as high yield, but the amino group is generally electron-donating. Similarly, 4-formylbenzoic acid, which contains an electron-withdrawing formyl group, is listed as low yield. This suggests a lack of clarity and property insight in the rule. The rule may need to be refined to accurately reflect the observed data. The complexity of the rule is acceptable, but the coverage is undermined by these inconsistencies.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear in stating that heterocyclic carboxylic acids yield high, supported by examples in the dataset. The property insight is sound, as heterocyclic compounds can coordinate with metal centers, potentially facilitating electron transfer in the catalytic process. The complexity is appropriate, focusing on heterocyclic structures. The rule is well-supported by data points, meeting the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 states that long-chain (6-8 carbons) aliphatic carboxylic acids yield high, while amino-substituted analogs yield low. The rule is clear and offers property insight by suggesting that the addition of amino groups decreases yield due to increased polarity or interference with the catalyst. However, the coverage is limited, with only one data point (octanoic acid) supporting high yield for the unmodified long-chain acids. For the amino-substituted analogs, there are two data points showing low yield, which partially supports the rule. The rule's complexity is acceptable, but the limited coverage reduces its robustness.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 states that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups yield high, attributing this to enhanced solubility and hydrogen-bonding interactions with the catalyst. The rule is clear and provides reasonable property insight. However, the coverage is limited, with only two data points supporting the rule and no contrasting low-yield examples. The complexity is acceptable. To strengthen the rule, additional data points would be beneficial.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 states that modifiers with aldehyde groups yield low due to potential side reactions like Schiff base formation or catalyst poisoning. The rule is clear and offers property insight. However, the coverage is minimal, with only two data points supporting the rule. The rule's complexity is low. To enhance the rule's robustness, more data points and perhaps contrasting high-yield examples without aldehyde groups would be helpful.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 differentiates between thiol groups on aliphatic chains (high yield) and aromatic rings (low yield). The rule is clear and offers plausible property insight. However, the coverage is very limited, with only one data point for each case. The rule's complexity is acceptable. To strengthen the rule, additional data points are needed to confirm the trend.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 states that modifiers with highly fluorinated aliphatic chains yield low due to hydrophobicity affecting interactions with catalytic sites. The rule is clear and offers reasonable property insight. However, the coverage is minimal, with only one data point supporting the rule. The complexity is low. Additional data points are needed to confirm this pattern.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 suggests that modifiers with extended conjugated aromatic systems yield high due to π-π stacking interactions. While the rule provides property insight, the term "extended conjugated aromatic systems" is somewhat vague and may lack clarity. The coverage is limited, with only two data points. The complexity is acceptable. To improve the rule, clearer definitions and more supporting data would be beneficial.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 states that modifiers with polyether chains yield low due to steric hindrance or unfavorable solvation effects. The rule is clear and offers property insight. However, the coverage is minimal, with only one data point. The complexity is acceptable. Additional examples are needed to support the rule.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 states that hydroxyphenyl groups with longer aliphatic linkers yield high, while those with shorter linkers yield low. The rule is clear and provides property insight. The complexity is appropriate, considering both chain length and functional groups. The coverage is minimal, with only one example for each case. More data points are needed to confirm this trend.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 suggests that modifiers with ketone groups near carboxylic acids yield low due to chelation with metal centers or interference with catalytic activity. The rule is clear and offers property insight. However, the coverage is minimal, with only one data point. The complexity is acceptable. More supporting data is needed.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 states that modifiers with bulky aromatic substituents not conjugated with the carboxylic acid yield low. While the rule provides property insight, it may lack clarity due to the complexity of defining "not conjugated" in this context. The coverage is minimal, with only two data points. The complexity of the rule is high. Clarification and additional data points would strengthen the rule.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Refine Rule 2 to Align with Observed Data**  
  The current Rule 2 suggests that electron-withdrawing groups at the para position lead to high yield, while electron-donating groups result in low yield. However, the data shows inconsistencies—for example, 4-aminobenzoic acid (an electron-donating amino group) yields high, and 4-formylbenzoic acid (an electron-withdrawing formyl group) yields low. Refine the rule to focus on the ability of the substituents to coordinate with the metal center or participate in specific interactions rather than solely on their electronic nature. Consider grouping substituents based on their coordination potential or steric effects.

- **Advice 2**: **Increase Coverage by Combining Similar Rules**  
  Many rules (e.g., Rules 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13) have limited coverage with only one or two supporting data points. To enhance robustness, consider combining rules that share common structural features or mechanisms. For instance, merge Rules 4 and 5 to create a broader rule about aliphatic carboxylic acids with functional groups that enhance solubility or interact favorably with the catalyst.

- **Advice 3**: **Clarify Vague Terminology in Rules**  
  Terms like "extended conjugated aromatic systems" in Rule 9 are vague and may lead to misinterpretation. Provide specific structural criteria, such as the minimum number of fused rings or specific aromatic systems (e.g., indole, benzofuran). This will improve clarity and applicability.

- **Advice 4**: **Re-express Rules to Reflect Functional Group Context**  
  Recognize that the same functional group can have different effects depending on its context in the molecule. For example, amino groups in aliphatic chains might decrease yield (Rule 4), while the same groups in aromatic systems may coordinate with the catalyst and increase yield (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid). Adjust the rules to account for these contextual differences.

- **Advice 5**: **Incorporate Functional Group Combinations and Positions**  
  Develop rules that consider combinations of functional groups and their positions within the molecule. For example, the presence of both hydroxyl and carboxylic acid groups on an aliphatic chain may enhance yield (as in gluconic acid), while the same groups in other positions might not have the same effect.

- **Advice 6**: **Gather Additional Data to Support Low-Coverage Rules**  
  For rules with minimal data support, such as Rules 7 (thiol groups), 8 (fluorinated chains), and 10 (polyether chains), collect more experimental data. Additional examples will help confirm whether these patterns hold true and justify retaining or modifying the rules.

- **Advice 7**: **Clarify and Refine Rule 13 Regarding Bulky Aromatics**  
  The definition of "bulky aromatic substituents not conjugated with the carboxylic acid" is unclear. Provide explicit structural examples or criteria, such as specifying the size of the aromatic group or the nature of its linkage to the carboxylic acid. Re-evaluate the rule to focus on steric hindrance effects and gather more data to support it.

- **Advice 8**: **Emphasize Specific Interactions Over General Electronic Effects**  
  Instead of broadly categorizing substituents as electron-donating or -withdrawing, focus on their ability to participate in specific interactions (e.g., metal coordination, hydrogen bonding). This approach may provide better property insight and explain exceptions observed in the data.

- **Advice 9**: **Prioritize Rules with Strong Support and Clear Insights**  
  Focus on refining and retaining rules that have robust data support and offer clear property insights, such as Rules 1 and 3. Consider omitting or significantly revising rules that cannot be adequately supported, to improve the overall quality and reliability of the rule set.

- **Advice 10**: **Consider Steric and Electronic Effects Together**  
  In rules where electronic effects don't fully explain the observed yields (e.g., Rule 2), incorporate steric considerations. For example, bulky substituents may hinder catalyst interaction regardless of their electronic nature. Adjust the rules to reflect the combined influence of steric and electronic factors.

      - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid – High Yield
      - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid – High Yield

- **Rule 4**: **Long-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Yield High; Amino-Substituted Analogs Yield Low**

  Modifiers that are long-chain (6 carbons or more) aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups result in high yield. Introducing amino groups into the chain decreases the yield, possibly due to increased polarity or interference with catalyst coordination.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - Octanoic acid – High Yield
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 7-aminoheptanoic acid – Low Yield
      - 8-aminooctanoic acid – Low Yield

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups Yield High**

  Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially on aliphatic chains, result in high yield due to enhanced solubility and hydrogen-bonding interactions with the catalyst. These interactions may facilitate better dispersion and accessibility of active sites.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid) – High Yield
      - 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid – High Yield

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers Containing Carbonyl Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acids Yield Low**

  Modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acids tend to result in low yield. These carbonyl groups might chelate with metal centers or undergo side reactions, hindering the catalyst's activity.

  *Examples:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-formylbenzoic acid – Low Yield
      - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid – Low Yield
      - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid – Low Yield

- **Rule 7**: **Thiol Groups on Aliphatic Chains Yield High; Thiol Groups on Aromatic Rings Yield Low**

  Modifiers with thiol (sulfanyl) groups attached to aliphatic chains result in high yield, likely due to their ability to enhance interactions with the metal center. Thiol groups on aromatic rings may lead to catalyst deactivation, resulting in low yield.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid – High Yield
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid – Low Yield

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with Highly Fluorinated Aliphatic Chains Yield Low**

  Highly fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids result in low yield. The strong electronegativity and hydrophobicity of fluorinated chains can reduce interactions with the catalyst and impede the reaction.

  *Example:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid – Low Yield

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with Extended Conjugated Aromatic Systems Yield High**

  Modifiers containing extended conjugated aromatic systems directly attached to carboxylic acid groups facilitate π-π stacking and electronic interactions with the catalyst, resulting in high yield.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid – High Yield
      - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan) – High Yield
    - **Low Yield:**
      - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine) – Low Yield

- **Rule 10**: **Hydroxyphenyl Groups with Longer Aliphatic Linkers Yield High; Shorter Linkers Yield Low**

  Modifiers with hydroxyphenyl groups connected via longer aliphatic chains (five carbons or more) result in high yield, while those with shorter chains yield low. Longer linkers may provide flexibility, enhancing interactions with the catalyst.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid – High Yield
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid – Low Yield

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with Polyether Chains Yield Low**

  Modifiers containing polyether chains, such as methoxyethoxy groups, result in low yield. These chains may cause steric hindrance or unfavorable solvation effects, interfering with catalyst interaction.

  *Example:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid – Low Yield

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with Bulky Non-Conjugated Aromatic Substituents Yield Low**

  Modifiers with bulky aromatic substituents that are not directly conjugated with the carboxylic acid group result in low yield. Steric hindrance or lack of effective electronic interaction with the catalyst may reduce effectiveness.

  *Examples:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid – Low Yield
      - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid – Low Yield

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Short-Chain Aliphatic Amino Acids Yield High; Long-Chain Amino Acids Yield Low**

  Modifiers that are aliphatic amino acids with carbon chain lengths of 4 to 5 carbons (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) result in high yield. Those with longer aliphatic chains (6 carbons or more) yield low. This may be due to the optimal size and coordination ability of shorter chains with the catalyst.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid) – High Yield
      - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid) – High Yield
      - 5-aminopentanoic acid – High Yield
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 7-aminoheptanoic acid – Low Yield
      - 8-aminooctanoic acid – Low Yield
      - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid – Low Yield

- **Rule 2**: **Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids with Metal-Coordinating Groups Yield High; Non-Coordinating Groups Yield Low**

  Modifiers that are benzoic acid derivatives with substituents at the para position capable of coordinating with metal centers (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl) result in high yield. Substituents that are non-coordinating or solely electron-donating (e.g., methyl) yield low. Coordination enhances interaction with the catalyst.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 4-aminobenzoic acid – High Yield
      - 4-nitrobenzoic acid – High Yield
      - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid – High Yield
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-methylbenzoic acid – Low Yield
      - 4-formylbenzoic acid – Low Yield

- **Rule 3**: **Heterocyclic Carboxylic Acids Yield High**

  Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids, such as pyridine carboxylic acids and pyrazole carboxylic acids, result in high yield. Their heteroaromatic rings can coordinate with metal centers and facilitate electron transfer, enhancing catalytic activity.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid – High Yield
      - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid – High Yield
      - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid – High Yield

- **Rule 4**: **Long-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Yield High; Amino-Substituted Analogs Yield Low**

  Modifiers that are long-chain (6 carbons or more) aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups result in high yield. Introducing amino groups into the chain decreases the yield, possibly due to increased polarity or interference with catalyst coordination.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - Octanoic acid – High Yield
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 7-aminoheptanoic acid – Low Yield
      - 8-aminooctanoic acid – Low Yield

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups Yield High**

  Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially on aliphatic chains, result in high yield due to enhanced solubility and hydrogen-bonding interactions with the catalyst. These interactions may facilitate better dispersion and accessibility of active sites.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid) – High Yield
      - 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid – High Yield

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers Containing Carbonyl Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acids Yield Low**

  Modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acids tend to result in low yield. These carbonyl groups might chelate with metal centers or undergo side reactions, hindering the catalyst's activity.

  *Examples:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-formylbenzoic acid – Low Yield
      - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid – Low Yield
      - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid – Low Yield

- **Rule 7**: **Thiol Groups on Aliphatic Chains Yield High; Thiol Groups on Aromatic Rings Yield Low**

  Modifiers with thiol (sulfanyl) groups attached to aliphatic chains result in high yield, likely due to their ability to enhance interactions with the metal center. Thiol groups on aromatic rings may lead to catalyst deactivation, resulting in low yield.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid – High Yield
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid – Low Yield

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with Highly Fluorinated Aliphatic Chains Yield Low**

  Highly fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids result in low yield. The strong electronegativity and hydrophobicity of fluorinated chains can reduce interactions with the catalyst and impede the reaction.

  *Example:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid – Low Yield

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with Extended Conjugated Aromatic Systems Yield High**

  Modifiers containing extended conjugated aromatic systems directly attached to carboxylic acid groups facilitate π-π stacking and electronic interactions with the catalyst, resulting in high yield.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid – High Yield
      - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan) – High Yield
    - **Low Yield:**
      - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine) – Low Yield

- **Rule 10**: **Hydroxyphenyl Groups with Longer Aliphatic Linkers Yield High; Shorter Linkers Yield Low**

  Modifiers with hydroxyphenyl groups connected via longer aliphatic chains (five carbons or more) result in high yield, while those with shorter chains yield low. Longer linkers may provide flexibility, enhancing interactions with the catalyst.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid – High Yield
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid – Low Yield

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with Polyether Chains Yield Low**

  Modifiers containing polyether chains, such as methoxyethoxy groups, result in low yield. These chains may cause steric hindrance or unfavorable solvation effects, interfering with catalyst interaction.

  *Example:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid – Low Yield

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with Bulky Non-Conjugated Aromatic Substituents Yield Low**

  Modifiers with bulky aromatic substituents that are not directly conjugated with the carboxylic acid group result in low yield. Steric hindrance or lack of effective electronic interaction with the catalyst may reduce effectiveness.

  *Examples:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid – Low Yield
      - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid – Low Yield

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: Modify Rule 1 in the code to exclude aromatic systems. Currently, the code counts the chain length between the amine and carboxylic acid irrespective of whether it's aliphatic or aromatic. Since Rule 1 specifically refers to aliphatic amino acids, the code should ensure that the path between the amine and carboxylic acid consists only of aliphatic (non-aromatic) carbons.
- ** Suggestion 2 **: Adjust the SMARTS patterns in Rule 1 to explicitly match aliphatic chains. You can use the `[C;!R]` notation to specify non-aromatic carbons. For example, redefine the patterns to ensure that both the amine and carboxylic acid are connected via an aliphatic chain without traversing any aromatic atoms.
- ** Suggestion 3 **: For Rule 2, revise the SMARTS patterns to accurately detect para-substituted benzoic acids with coordinating groups. The current patterns may not correctly identify molecules like 4-aminobenzoic acid. Use explicit substitution patterns to ensure that the substituents are at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid group.
- ** Suggestion 4 **: Modify the `benzoic_acid` pattern in Rule 2 to specify the carboxylic acid at the para position relative to the substituent. For example, use a SMARTS like `c1cc(ccc1[X])C(=O)[OH]`, where `[X]` represents the para-substituent. This will help in distinguishing between para, meta, and ortho substitutions.
- ** Suggestion 5 **: In Rule 4, replace the specific SMILES `'C[C@H](CCCC)C(=O)[OH]'` with a more general SMARTS pattern that matches long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids. For instance, use `'CCCCCCC(=O)[OH]'` to match chains with six or more carbons. Additionally, account for any stereochemistry by removing chirality specifications unless necessary.
- ** Suggestion 6 **: Update the `amino_substituted` pattern in Rule 4. The pattern `'*N*'` is too broad and matches any molecule containing nitrogen. Instead, use a SMARTS pattern that identifies amino groups attached to the aliphatic chain of the carboxylic acid, such as `'CCCNCC(=O)[OH]'` for a three-carbon chain with an amino group.
- ** Suggestion 7 **: Refine the SMARTS pattern in Rule 3 to accurately capture heterocyclic carboxylic acids. The current pattern `'[cH,r5,r6][cH,r5,r6]C(=O)[OH]'` might match unintended structures. Consider using a pattern like `'[n,o,s][#6]C(=O)[OH]'` to match heteroatoms in a ring directly attached to a carboxylic acid.
- ** Suggestion 8 **: Incorporate validation steps in the code to ensure that each rule applies exclusively to its intended molecular features. This may involve adding checks for ring sizes, heteroatoms, or specific functional group arrangements to prevent misclassification.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Short-Chain Aliphatic Amino Acids Yield High; Long-Chain Amino Acids Yield Low**

  Modifiers that are aliphatic amino acids with carbon chain lengths of 4 to 5 carbons (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) result in high yield. Those with longer aliphatic chains (6 carbons or more) yield low. This may be due to the optimal size and coordination ability of shorter chains with the catalyst.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid) – High Yield
      - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid) – High Yield
      - 5-aminopentanoic acid – High Yield
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 7-aminoheptanoic acid – Low Yield
      - 8-aminooctanoic acid – Low Yield
      - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid – Low Yield

- **Rule 2**: **Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids with Metal-Coordinating Groups Yield High; Non-Coordinating Groups Yield Low**

  Modifiers that are benzoic acid derivatives with substituents at the para position capable of coordinating with metal centers (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl) result in high yield. Substituents that are non-coordinating or solely electron-donating (e.g., methyl) yield low. Coordination enhances interaction with the catalyst.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 4-aminobenzoic acid – High Yield
      - 4-nitrobenzoic acid – High Yield
      - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid – High Yield
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-methylbenzoic acid – Low Yield
      - 4-formylbenzoic acid – Low Yield

- **Rule 3**: **Heterocyclic Carboxylic Acids Yield High**

  Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids, such as pyridine carboxylic acids and pyrazole carboxylic acids, result in high yield. Their heteroaromatic rings can coordinate with metal centers and facilitate electron transfer, enhancing catalytic activity.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid – High Yield
      - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid – High Yield
      - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid – High Yield

- **Rule 4**: **Long-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Yield High; Amino-Substituted Analogs Yield Low**

  Modifiers that are long-chain (6 carbons or more) aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups result in high yield. Introducing amino groups into the chain decreases the yield, possibly due to increased polarity or interference with catalyst coordination.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - Octanoic acid – High Yield
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 7-aminoheptanoic acid – Low Yield
      - 8-aminooctanoic acid – Low Yield

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups Yield High**

  Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially on aliphatic chains, result in high yield due to enhanced solubility and hydrogen-bonding interactions with the catalyst. These interactions may facilitate better dispersion and accessibility of active sites.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid) – High Yield
      - 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid – High Yield

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers Containing Carbonyl Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acids Yield Low**

  Modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acids tend to result in low yield. These carbonyl groups might chelate with metal centers or undergo side reactions, hindering the catalyst's activity.

  *Examples:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-formylbenzoic acid – Low Yield
      - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid – Low Yield
      - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid – Low Yield

- **Rule 7**: **Thiol Groups on Aliphatic Chains Yield High; Thiol Groups on Aromatic Rings Yield Low**

  Modifiers with thiol (sulfanyl) groups attached to aliphatic chains result in high yield, likely due to their ability to enhance interactions with the metal center. Thiol groups on aromatic rings may lead to catalyst deactivation, resulting in low yield.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid – High Yield
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid – Low Yield

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with Highly Fluorinated Aliphatic Chains Yield Low**

  Highly fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids result in low yield. The strong electronegativity and hydrophobicity of fluorinated chains can reduce interactions with the catalyst and impede the reaction.

  *Example:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid – Low Yield

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with Extended Conjugated Aromatic Systems Yield High**

  Modifiers containing extended conjugated aromatic systems directly attached to carboxylic acid groups facilitate π-π stacking and electronic interactions with the catalyst, resulting in high yield.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid – High Yield
      - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan) – High Yield
    - **Low Yield:**
      - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine) – Low Yield

- **Rule 10**: **Hydroxyphenyl Groups with Longer Aliphatic Linkers Yield High; Shorter Linkers Yield Low**

  Modifiers with hydroxyphenyl groups connected via longer aliphatic chains (five carbons or more) result in high yield, while those with shorter chains yield low. Longer linkers may provide flexibility, enhancing interactions with the catalyst.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid – High Yield
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid – Low Yield

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with Polyether Chains Yield Low**

  Modifiers containing polyether chains, such as methoxyethoxy groups, result in low yield. These chains may cause steric hindrance or unfavorable solvation effects, interfering with catalyst interaction.

  *Example:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid – Low Yield

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with Bulky Non-Conjugated Aromatic Substituents Yield Low**

  Modifiers with bulky aromatic substituents that are not directly conjugated with the carboxylic acid group result in low yield. Steric hindrance or lack of effective electronic interaction with the catalyst may reduce effectiveness.

  *Examples:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid – Low Yield
      - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid – Low Yield

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Align the SMILES Set with the Feature Matrix**

  There is a mismatch between the number of SMILES strings (24) and the number of rows in the feature matrix (36). Ensure that each SMILES string corresponds to one row in the feature matrix. This alignment is crucial for accurate mapping and evaluation.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Correct Chain Length Calculation in Rule 1**

  In Rule 1, instead of counting the number of carbons in the shortest path between the amine and carboxylic acid groups, identify the side chain connected to the α-carbon of the amino acid. The chain length should be the number of carbons in the side chain (excluding the α-carbon). Modify the code to accurately identify and count the side chain carbons to distinguish between short and long-chain amino acids.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Generalize the SMARTS Patterns in Rule 2**

  The SMARTS patterns for para-substituted benzoic acids with coordinating and non-coordinating groups are too specific. Generalize the patterns to match any para-substituted benzoic acid with metal-coordinating groups (e.g., `[NX3;H2,H1,H0]`, `[OX1-,OX2]`, `[SX2]`) and non-coordinating groups (e.g., alkyl, aldehyde). Use wildcard patterns or specify properties (like donor atoms) to capture a broader range of substituents.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Expand Heterocycle Patterns in Rule 3**

  The heterocycle pattern in Rule 3 only matches five-membered rings, whereas the rule includes six-membered heterocycles like pyridine. Modify the SMARTS pattern to include both five- and six-membered heteroaromatic rings, such as `[n,o,s]1cccc1` and `[n,o,s]1ccccc1`, to accurately identify all relevant heterocyclic carboxylic acids.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Parameterize Chain Length in Rule 4**

  In Rule 4, the `long_chain_acid_pattern` is hard-coded for a specific chain length. Replace it with a pattern that matches aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of six carbons or more, such as `CCCCCCC(=O)[OH]` and use recursive SMARTS or quantifiers to specify chain lengths (e.g., `C[C;R0][C;R0]{4,}`).

- **Suggestion 6**: **Refine Amino Substituent Detection in Rule 4**

  The `amino_substituted_pattern` in Rule 4 may not detect all amino-substituted analogs. Update it to match amino groups anywhere on the carbon chain, not just directly attached to a carbon atom, using a pattern like `[$([NX3H2,NX3H1][C;!R])]`.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Implement Missing Rules and Update Code**

  The code currently only implements Rules 1 to 4. Extend the code to include the remaining rules (Rules 5 to 12). Carefully translate each natural language rule into the corresponding SMARTS patterns, ensuring they accurately reflect the described chemical features.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Validate SMARTS Patterns Against Examples**

  For each rule, test the SMARTS patterns against the provided examples to confirm that they match high-yield and low-yield modifiers appropriately. Adjust the patterns as needed based on the validation results.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Improve Error Handling and Molecule Parsing**

  Enhance the code's robustness by adding error handling for cases where the SMILES strings may not parse correctly or where substructure searches might fail due to different tautomeric forms or resonance structures. Use standardized molecule representations (e.g., Kekulization, tautomer normalization) to improve matching accuracy.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Add Comments and Documentation to Code**

  Include detailed comments and documentation within the code to explain the purpose of each SMARTS pattern, the logic behind each rule implementation, and any assumptions made. This will aid in future code maintenance and facilitate collaboration.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Standardize Numerical Descriptors for Molecular Features**

  To facilitate the generation of a numeric feature matrix, it's essential to express the molecular features in terms of standardized numerical descriptors. For example, instead of categorical descriptions like "short-chain" or "long-chain" amino acids, specify the exact carbon chain length or range (e.g., chain length = 4–5 carbons yields high; chain length ≥6 carbons yields low). Utilize numerical values for features such as:

  - Carbon chain length
  - Number of functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino, carboxyl)
  - Positions of substituents on aromatic rings (e.g., para-position = 1 if substituted, 0 if not)
  - Electronic properties (e.g., Hammett sigma constants for substituents)

- **Advice 2**: **Quantify Electronic and Steric Effects**

  Incorporate quantitative measures of electronic and steric effects to make the rules more precise. Use parameters such as:

  - **Electronic Effects**: Quantify substituents using their electron-donating or electron-withdrawing strengths (e.g., Taft or Hammett constants).
  - **Steric Effects**: Use steric parameters like molar refractivity or Verloop parameters to account for the size and shape of substituents.

- **Advice 3**: **Use Molecular Descriptors Common in QSAR Studies**

  Apply molecular descriptors commonly used in Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) models to encode the modifiers numerically:

  - **Hydrophobicity (Log P)**
  - **Topological Polar Surface Area (TPSA)**
  - **Molecular Weight**
  - **Number of Rotatable Bonds**
  - **Hydrogen Bond Donors/Acceptors**

- **Advice 4**: **Create a Structured Feature Matrix**

  Develop a feature matrix where each row represents a modifier, and each column represents a quantified molecular feature. This structure aids in statistical analysis and model building. Ensure that:

  - All modifiers are represented consistently.
  - Missing values are minimized or appropriately imputed.

- **Advice 5**: **Simplify and Generalize the Rules**

  Revise the rules to reduce complexity and overlap. Consolidate similar rules and focus on the most impactful features. For example:

  - Combine Rules 1 and 4 by creating a rule that specifies the optimal carbon chain length for aliphatic carboxylic acids and amino acids.
  - Merge Rules 2 and 9 by focusing on the presence of metal-coordinating groups and conjugated systems, quantified by specific descriptors.

- **Advice 6**: **Incorporate Machine-Learnable Features**

  Modify the rules to include features that machine learning algorithms can easily interpret:

  - **Binary Indicators**: Presence or absence of specific functional groups (1 or 0).
  - **Counts**: Number of times a particular feature appears (e.g., number of hydroxyl groups).
  - **Distances**: Number of bonds between functional groups (e.g., distance from carboxyl group to amino group).

- **Advice 7**: **Use Hierarchical Classification of Functional Groups**

  Classify functional groups hierarchically to capture both general and specific features:

  - **Level 1**: Broad categories (e.g., aliphatic, aromatic, heterocyclic).
  - **Level 2**: Specific functional groups (e.g., carboxylic acid, hydroxyl group).
  - **Level 3**: Substituent positions and patterns (e.g., para-substituted aromatic ring).

- **Advice 8**: **Annotate Modifiers with SMARTS Patterns**

  Utilize SMILES Arbitrary Target Specification (SMARTS) patterns to precisely define structural features:

  - Create SMARTS patterns for high-yielding motifs.
  - Use these patterns to identify and annotate modifiers programmatically.

- **Advice 9**: **Perform Statistical Analysis to Identify Key Features**

  Analyze the existing dataset statistically to determine which features most strongly correlate with high yield:

  - Use methods like correlation coefficients or feature importance from machine learning models.
  - Focus the rules on these key features to improve predictive power.

- **Advice 10**: **Validate and Iterate the Rules**

  After revising the rules, validate them against the dataset to ensure they accurately predict the yield outcomes:

  - Check for consistency between the rules and experimental results.
  - Refine the rules based on discrepancies to improve accuracy.

14.
Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Short-Chain Aliphatic Amino Acids Yield High; Longer-Chain Analogs Yield Low**

  Modifiers that are aliphatic amino acids with a carbon chain length of 4 or 5 carbons and an amino group at the α-position result in high yield. Longer-chain amino acids (6 carbons or more) yield low. This may be due to optimal coordination and minimal steric hindrance with the catalyst for shorter chains.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)
      - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)
      - 5-aminopentanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:**
      - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
      - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
      - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 2**: **Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing, Metal-Coordinating Groups Yield High; Electron-Donating or Non-Coordinating Groups Yield Low**

  Modifiers that are benzoic acid derivatives with electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position capable of coordinating with metal centers (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl) result in high yield. Those with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy) or non-coordinating substituents yield low. Coordination enhances interaction with the catalyst.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 4-aminobenzoic acid
      - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
      - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-methylbenzoic acid
      - 4-formylbenzoic acid
      - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 3**: **Nitrogen-Containing Heterocyclic Carboxylic Acids Yield High**

  Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids with nitrogen-containing aromatic rings, such as pyridine and pyrazole carboxylic acids, result in high yield. Their ability to coordinate with metal centers enhances catalytic activity.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Niacin)
      - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
      - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 4**: **Straight-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Yield High; Addition of Polar Functional Groups Lowers Yield**

  Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups result in high yield. Introducing polar groups like hydroxyl or amino decreases the yield, potentially due to altered solubility or interference with catalyst coordination.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - Octanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
      - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
      - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups on Short Chains Yield High; Single Hydroxyl on Long Chains Yields Low**

  Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups on short aliphatic chains enhance solubility and interaction with the catalyst, resulting in high yield. A single hydroxyl group on a longer chain does not have the same effect and yields low.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid

- **Rule 6**: **Aliphatic Thiol Groups Yield High; Aromatic Thiol Groups Yield Low**

  Modifiers with thiol (–SH) groups on aliphatic chains result in high yield, likely due to effective coordination with the metal catalyst. Thiol groups attached to aromatic rings may lead to catalyst poisoning or deactivation, yielding low.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 7**: **Highly Fluorinated Aliphatic Chains Yield Low**

  Modifiers with multiple fluorine atoms in aliphatic chains result in low yield. The strong electronegativity and hydrophobic nature of fluorinated chains can reduce interactions with the catalyst and hinder the reaction.

  *Example:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with Carbonyl Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acids Yield Low**

  Modifiers possessing aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acids tend to yield low. These carbonyl groups might chelate with the metal catalyst or participate in side reactions, reducing catalytic efficiency.

  *Examples:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-formylbenzoic acid
      - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
      - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with Extended Conjugation Involving Heterocycles Yield High**

  Modifiers containing extended conjugated systems with oxygen or nitrogen heterocycles enhance electron delocalization and coordination with the catalyst, resulting in high yield.

  *Example:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 10**: **Hydroxyphenyl Groups Connected by Long Aliphatic Chains Yield High; Short Chains Yield Low**

  Modifiers with hydroxyphenyl groups linked by aliphatic chains of five or more carbons to a carboxylic acid yield high, possibly due to increased flexibility and optimal interaction with the catalyst. Shorter chains may not provide this advantage.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with Polyether Chains Yield Low**

  Modifiers containing polyether chains, such as methoxyethoxy units, result in low yield. These moieties may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorable solvation effects, impeding effective catalyst interaction.

  *Example:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid

- **Rule 12**: **Bulky Non-Coordinating Substituents Yield Low**

  Modifiers with bulky substituents that cannot effectively coordinate with the metal catalyst lead to low yield. Steric hindrance may prevent proper interaction with the active sites.

  *Examples:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
      - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 13**: **Aromatic Rings with Amino Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acids Yield High**

  Modifiers where an amino group is directly attached to an aromatic ring adjacent to a carboxylic acid enhance metal coordination, resulting in high yield.

  *Example:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 4-aminobenzoic acid

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with Methoxy Groups Without Coordinating Substituents Yield Low**

  Modifiers featuring methoxy groups attached to aromatic rings or aliphatic chains yield low if they lack other coordinating groups. Methoxy groups are electron-donating but do not coordinate effectively with metal catalysts.

  *Examples:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
      - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid (Note: Despite containing methoxy groups, this compound yields high, possibly due to other contributing factors.)

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with Fused Nitrogen Heterocyclic Aromatic Systems Yield High**

  Modifiers containing fused aromatic systems with nitrogen heterocycles (e.g., indole ring in tryptophan) can delocalize electrons and coordinate with metal centers effectively, yielding high.

  *Example:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows us to determine the yield based on the carbon chain length and the position of the amino group in aliphatic amino acids. It provides strong physical-chemical insight, attributing high yields to optimal coordination and minimal steric hindrance in shorter chains. The rule considers both chain length and functional groups, offering a good balance between complexity and coverage with multiple supporting data points.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is well-defined, focusing on para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing, metal-coordinating groups yielding high, and those with electron-donating or non-coordinating groups yielding low. It offers solid physical-chemical insight into how electron-withdrawing substituents enhance metal coordination. The rule effectively balances complexity and coverage, supported by multiple data points that validate its applicability.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 provides clear guidance by identifying nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids as yielding high. It offers adequate physical-chemical insight into the role of nitrogen heterocycles in metal coordination. While the rule is clear and considers specific substructures, its coverage could be strengthened with additional data points, although it currently meets the minimum requirement.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is straightforward and clear, stating that straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids yield high, while the addition of polar functional groups lowers the yield. The rule provides reasonable physical-chemical insight into how polar groups may alter solubility or interfere with catalyst coordination. It effectively balances complexity by considering both the absence and presence of functional groups and is well-supported by multiple data points.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 lacks sufficient coverage, with limited data points supporting the high yield for modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on short chains. While it offers some physical-chemical insight into enhanced solubility and catalyst interaction, the rule's complexity may not justify its limited applicability. Additional data is needed to strengthen the rule's reliability.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear in distinguishing between aliphatic and aromatic thiol groups' effects on yield. However, the rule's coverage is minimal, relying on a single high-yield and one low-yield example. Despite providing physical-chemical insight into metal coordination and potential catalyst poisoning, the limited data reduces confidence in the rule's general applicability.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 identifies that highly fluorinated aliphatic chains yield low, attributing this to reduced catalyst interaction due to electronegativity and hydrophobicity. The rule is clear but has very limited coverage with only one supporting data point. This minimal coverage hampers its effectiveness and reliability for broader application.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear and supported by several data points showing that modifiers with carbonyl groups adjacent to carboxylic acids yield low. It offers adequate physical-chemical insight, suggesting possible chelation or side reactions with the catalyst. The rule balances complexity by focusing on specific functional group arrangements and has sufficient coverage to support its validity.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 has low coverage, supported by only one data point. While it introduces the concept that extended conjugation involving heterocycles yields high, the rule lacks clarity due to its vague description. The physical-chemical insight is plausible but not sufficiently detailed, and more data points are needed to validate this rule.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 discusses the impact of chain length in hydroxyphenyl-substituted aliphatic acids on yield. Despite offering some physical-chemical insight, the rule is based on minimal data, with only one high-yield and one low-yield example. The limited coverage and specificity reduce its reliability for predicting outcomes with new modifiers.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 addresses modifiers with polyether chains yielding low, suggesting steric hindrance or unfavorable solvation effects. The rule is clear but has insufficient coverage, supported by a single data point. This minimal support limits its applicability and confidence in the rule's generalizability.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is clear in stating that bulky non-coordinating substituents yield low. It provides reasonable physical-chemical insight into how steric hindrance may prevent proper catalyst interaction. The rule considers combinations of substructures and is supported by at least two data points, offering a balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 overlaps with Rule 2, focusing on aromatic rings with amino groups adjacent to carboxylic acids yielding high. While it provides adequate physical-chemical insight into enhanced metal coordination, the rule's coverage is limited to a single data point. The redundancy and minimal support reduce its added value beyond what is already covered in Rule 2.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 is unclear and contains contradictory information. The rule states that modifiers with methoxy groups without coordinating substituents yield low, yet provides an example where such a compound yields high. This inconsistency undermines the rule's clarity and reliability, and the lack of sufficient supporting data further weakens its validity.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 introduces the idea that modifiers with fused nitrogen heterocyclic aromatic systems yield high, exemplified by tryptophan. While the rule offers physical-chemical insight into electron delocalization and metal coordination, it is supported by only one data point. The limited coverage necessitates more data to confirm the rule's applicability and strengthen its predictive power.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Clarify and Correct Rule 2 Regarding Metal Coordination**

  **Issue**: Rule 2 currently states that para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing, metal-coordinating groups yield high, while electron-donating or non-coordinating groups yield low. However, there is inconsistency because 4-aminobenzoic acid (an electron-donating group) yields high.

  **Suggestion**:

  - **Focus on Metal-Coordinating Ability**: Redefine the rule to emphasize that substituents capable of coordinating with metal centers (regardless of their electron-donating or -withdrawing nature) lead to high yield.
  - **Remove Conflicting Information**: Eliminate references to electron-donating or -withdrawing properties that do not align with the observed data.
  - **Practical Implementation**: Adjust the rule to state:

    > **Rule 2 (Revised)**: **Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids with Metal-Coordinating Groups Yield High; Non-Coordinating Groups Yield Low**

    This focuses on the presence of functional groups (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl) that can coordinate with the metal catalyst, leading to high yield.

- **Advice 2**: **Combine Overlapping Rules Related to Heterocyclic and Conjugated Systems**

  **Issue**: Rules 3, 9, and 15 all deal with heterocyclic or conjugated aromatic systems yielding high due to enhanced coordination but are fragmented.

  **Suggestion**:

  - **Create a Unified Rule**: Merge these rules into a single rule that covers modifiers with heterocyclic aromatic systems containing nitrogen or oxygen.
  - **Enhance Clarity and Coverage**: Provide a broader definition that can be applied more generally.

  **Practical Implementation**:

    > **Rule (Combined)**: **Modifiers with Nitrogen or Oxygen-Containing Heterocyclic Aromatic Systems Yield High**

    This consolidated rule simplifies the rule set and encompasses more compounds, improving usability.

- **Advice 3**: **Strengthen Rules with Limited Data by Including More Examples or Revising**

  **Issue**: Rules 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, and 15 have limited supporting data, reducing their reliability.

  **Suggestion**:

  - **Collect Additional Data**: Search for more compounds that fit these rules to validate them.
  - **Revise or Eliminate Weak Rules**: If additional data is not available, consider combining these rules with others or removing them to prevent confusion.

  **Practical Implementation**:

  - For Rule 5 (Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups Yield High), find more examples or integrate it with Rule 1 or Rule 4 if appropriate.
  - For Rule 6 (Thiol Groups), assess whether the effect is significant across more data points.
  - Focus on rules with strong support and practical significance.

- **Advice 4**: **Address Contradictions in Rules Involving Methoxy Groups**

  **Issue**: Rule 14 states that modifiers with methoxy groups without coordinating substituents yield low, yet an example provided yields high.

  **Suggestion**:

  - **Reevaluate the Rule**: Examine the data to understand why exceptions occur.
  - **Clarify Exceptions**: If other functional groups contribute to high yield despite the presence of methoxy groups, note this in the rule.

  **Practical Implementation**:

    - Modify the rule to:

      > **Rule (Revised)**: **Modifiers with Methoxy Groups Yield Low Unless Accompanied by Strong Metal-Coordinating Functionalities**

    - Provide explanations for exceptions to guide proper application.

- **Advice 5**: **Enhance Physical-Chemical Insights in Rules**

  **Issue**: Some rules lack detailed explanations, which can limit understanding and application.

  **Suggestion**:

  - **Include Mechanistic Rationale**: Add explanations on how specific groups influence the reaction, such as electronic effects, steric hindrance, or solubility factors.
  - **Link to Catalyst Interaction**: Describe how modifiers affect the coordination environment of the metal center.

  **Practical Implementation**:

  - For each rule, include a brief discussion of the underlying chemistry.
  - For example, in the revised Rule 2, explain that metal-coordinating groups can form coordination bonds with the Fe center, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Advice 6**: **Prioritize Rules Based on Data Strength and Predictive Power**

  **Issue**: Not all rules are equally robust or valuable for predictions.

  **Suggestion**:

  - **Focus on High-Confidence Rules**: Emphasize rules with strong data support and clear trends.
  - **Simplify the Rule Set**: Remove or consolidate less reliable rules to make the set more user-friendly.

  **Practical Implementation**:

  - Create a tiered rule set where primary rules have strong support, and secondary rules are used with caution.
  - Ensure that the rules included are those that consistently predict the yield outcome based on the dataset.

- **Advice 7**: **Include Structural Features in SMILES-Based Rules**

  **Issue**: To practically apply the rules, specific structural identifiers need to be translated into SMILES patterns.

  **Suggestion**:

  - **Define SMILES Substructures**: For each rule, specify the SMILES patterns corresponding to the functional groups or motifs described.
  - **Use SMARTS Notation for Substructures**: Incorporate SMARTS patterns to identify functional groups within SMILES strings.

  **Practical Implementation**:

  - For example, in the revised Rule 2:

    - Metal-coordinating groups can be identified by SMARTS patterns for amino (`[NH2]`), nitro (`[N+](=O)[O-]`), or bromomethyl (`[CH2]Br`) substituents at the para position.
  
  - Provide these patterns alongside the rules to facilitate computational screening.

- **Advice 8**: **Ensure Consistent Terminology and Definitions**

  **Issue**: Inconsistent use of terms (e.g., 'long-chain' vs. specific carbon numbers) can cause confusion.

  **Suggestion**:

  - **Standardize Definitions**: Use consistent terminology for chain lengths, functional group positions, and substituent types.
  - **Specify Carbon Counts**: When referring to chain lengths, provide exact numbers (e.g., C4-C5 for short chains, C6+ for long chains).

  **Practical Implementation**:

  - Update rules to include precise definitions.
  - For example, revise Rule 1 to specify "carbon chain lengths of exactly 4 or 5 carbons".

- **Advice 9**: **Incorporate Negative Rules Where Appropriate**

  **Issue**: Some compounds consistently yield low, and identifying these can prevent ineffective modifications.

  **Suggestion**:

  - **Explicitly State Negative Predictors**: Define structures or functional groups that reliably result in low yields.
  - **Balance Positive and Negative Rules**: This will improve the overall predictive power of the rule set.

  **Practical Implementation**:

  - For example, create a rule such as:

    > **Rule**: **Modifiers with Polyether Chains Yield Low**

    - Clearly list such structures to avoid in future designs.

- **Advice 10**: **Validate and Update Rules with Ongoing Data**

  **Issue**: As new data becomes available, rules may need adjustments.

  **Suggestion**:

  - **Implement Continuous Validation**: Regularly test rules against new compounds.
  - **Be Open to Refinement**: Update rules to reflect new findings and improve accuracy.

  **Practical Implementation**:

  - Establish a feedback mechanism where experimental results are used to validate and refine the rules over time.
  - Encourage collaboration between experimentalists and modelers to maintain an up-to-date rule set.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Short-Chain Aliphatic Amino Acids Yield High; Longer-Chain Analogs Yield Low**

  Modifiers that are aliphatic amino acids with a carbon chain length of 4 or 5 carbons and an amino group at the α-position result in high yield. Longer-chain amino acids (6 carbons or more) yield low. This may be due to optimal coordination and minimal steric hindrance with the catalyst for shorter chains.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)
      - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)
      - 5-aminopentanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:**
      - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
      - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
      - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 2**: **Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing, Metal-Coordinating Groups Yield High; Electron-Donating or Non-Coordinating Groups Yield Low**

  Modifiers that are benzoic acid derivatives with electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position capable of coordinating with metal centers (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl) result in high yield. Those with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy) or non-coordinating substituents yield low. Coordination enhances interaction with the catalyst.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 4-aminobenzoic acid
      - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
      - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-methylbenzoic acid
      - 4-formylbenzoic acid
      - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 3**: **Nitrogen-Containing Heterocyclic Carboxylic Acids Yield High**

  Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids with nitrogen-containing aromatic rings, such as pyridine and pyrazole carboxylic acids, result in high yield. Their ability to coordinate with metal centers enhances catalytic activity.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Niacin)
      - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
      - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 4**: **Straight-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Yield High; Addition of Polar Functional Groups Lowers Yield**

  Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups result in high yield. Introducing polar groups like hydroxyl or amino decreases the yield, potentially due to altered solubility or interference with catalyst coordination.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - Octanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
      - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
      - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups on Short Chains Yield High; Single Hydroxyl on Long Chains Yields Low**

  Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups on short aliphatic chains enhance solubility and interaction with the catalyst, resulting in high yield. A single hydroxyl group on a longer chain does not have the same effect and yields low.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid

- **Rule 6**: **Aliphatic Thiol Groups Yield High; Aromatic Thiol Groups Yield Low**

  Modifiers with thiol (–SH) groups on aliphatic chains result in high yield, likely due to effective coordination with the metal catalyst. Thiol groups attached to aromatic rings may lead to catalyst poisoning or deactivation, yielding low.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 7**: **Highly Fluorinated Aliphatic Chains Yield Low**

  Modifiers with multiple fluorine atoms in aliphatic chains result in low yield. The strong electronegativity and hydrophobic nature of fluorinated chains can reduce interactions with the catalyst and hinder the reaction.

  *Example:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with Carbonyl Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acids Yield Low**

  Modifiers possessing aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acids tend to yield low. These carbonyl groups might chelate with the metal catalyst or participate in side reactions, reducing catalytic efficiency.

  *Examples:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-formylbenzoic acid
      - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
      - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with Extended Conjugation Involving Heterocycles Yield High**

  Modifiers containing extended conjugated systems with oxygen or nitrogen heterocycles enhance electron delocalization and coordination with the catalyst, resulting in high yield.

  *Example:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 10**: **Hydroxyphenyl Groups Connected by Long Aliphatic Chains Yield High; Short Chains Yield Low**

  Modifiers with hydroxyphenyl groups linked by aliphatic chains of five or more carbons to a carboxylic acid yield high, possibly due to increased flexibility and optimal interaction with the catalyst. Shorter chains may not provide this advantage.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with Polyether Chains Yield Low**

  Modifiers containing polyether chains, such as methoxyethoxy units, result in low yield. These moieties may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorable solvation effects, impeding effective catalyst interaction.

  *Example:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid

- **Rule 12**: **Bulky Non-Coordinating Substituents Yield Low**

  Modifiers with bulky substituents that cannot effectively coordinate with the metal catalyst lead to low yield. Steric hindrance may prevent proper interaction with the active sites.

  *Examples:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
      - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 13**: **Aromatic Rings with Amino Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acids Yield High**

  Modifiers where an amino group is directly attached to an aromatic ring adjacent to a carboxylic acid enhance metal coordination, resulting in high yield.

  *Example:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 4-aminobenzoic acid

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with Methoxy Groups Without Coordinating Substituents Yield Low**

  Modifiers featuring methoxy groups attached to aromatic rings or aliphatic chains yield low if they lack other coordinating groups. Methoxy groups are electron-donating but do not coordinate effectively with metal catalysts.

  *Examples:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
      - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid (Note: Despite containing methoxy groups, this compound yields high, possibly due to other contributing factors.)

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with Fused Nitrogen Heterocyclic Aromatic Systems Yield High**

  Modifiers containing fused aromatic systems with nitrogen heterocycles (e.g., indole ring in tryptophan) can delocalize electrons and coordinate with metal centers effectively, yielding high.

  *Example:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Refine the SMARTS pattern for Rule 7 to accurately represent highly fluorinated aliphatic chains**. The current pattern `'[CX4](F)(F)(F)'` matches any trifluoromethyl group, including those attached to non-aliphatic carbons (e.g., attached directly to heteroatoms or aromatic rings). Rule 7 specifies that modifiers with multiple fluorine atoms in *aliphatic chains* yield low. Update the SMARTS pattern to capture fluorinated aliphatic chains with multiple fluorinated carbons, such as `'[*][C;R0;X4](F)(F)[C;R0;X4](F)(F)[*]'`, which looks for consecutive aliphatic carbons each bearing fluorines.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Adjust the code for Rule 4 to accurately identify straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids and the presence of additional polar functional groups**. The current code may incorrectly assign high or low yields without properly checking for chain branching or ring structures. Modify the SMARTS for straight-chain carboxylic acids to exclude rings and branches, e.g., `'C(-C)(-C)-C(=O)[O;H1,-]'`. Additionally, ensure the code checks for the absence of any other functional groups besides the terminal carboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Improve the chain length calculation in `check_rule1` for Rule 1**. The current function `get_chain_length_from_alpha` may not accurately calculate the chain length from the alpha carbon to the terminal carbon, potentially including side chains or overestimating the chain length. Refine the function to trace the longest linear carbon chain starting from the alpha carbon, excluding branches. Utilize breadth-first search (BFS) limiting traversal to acyclic, aliphatic carbon atoms.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Enhance the SMARTS patterns in Rule 2 to ensure correct identification of para-substituted benzoic acids with coordinating groups**. The current code may not specifically check that the substituents are at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid group. Update the SMARTS to `'c1cc([$(N),$(N(=O)=O),$(CBr)])ccc1C(=O)[O;H1,-]'`, where `[$(N),$(N(=O)=O),$(CBr)]` represents the amino, nitro, or bromomethyl groups at the para position.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Refine the handling of Rule 5 to distinguish between multiple hydroxyl groups on short chains and single hydroxyl groups on long chains**. The current code might not accurately differentiate chain lengths or the number of hydroxyl groups. Implement more specific SMARTS patterns to check for short aliphatic chains (e.g., 5 carbons or fewer) with two or more hydroxyl groups, such as `'[C&R0]-[C&R0]-[C&R0]-[C&R0]-C(=O)[O;H1,-]'` with multiple `-OH` groups attached.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Implement the remaining rules (8 to 15) in the code to provide a complete feature matrix**. This will enable a thorough evaluation of the transformation effectiveness. Each rule should have a corresponding function, similar to `check_rule1` to `check_rule7`, with appropriate SMARTS patterns and logic based on the natural language descriptions.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Update the SMARTS pattern for Rule 13 to accurately identify aromatic rings with amino groups adjacent to carboxylic acids**. The current pattern `'[c][NX3;H2,H1][c][C](=O)[O;H1,-]'` may not correctly capture all relevant molecules. Modify it to `'c1ccc([NH2])cc1C(=O)[O;H1,-]'` to ensure the amino group is directly attached to the aromatic ring and adjacent (ortho or para) to the carboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Ensure that the context and connectivity of functional groups are correctly considered in all SMARTS patterns**. For example, in Rule 7, the fluorine atoms should be attached to carbons within an aliphatic chain, not to carbons of functional groups like carbonyls or aromatic systems. Adjust patterns to check for fluorine substitutions along linear aliphatic chains.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Validate and test the SMARTS patterns against known positive and negative examples**. For each rule, create a set of test molecules that should match or not match the SMARTS patterns. This will help verify that the patterns are accurately capturing the intended structures and can be adjusted based on test results.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Consider advanced features like recursive SMARTS or molecular fingerprints for complex rules**. For rules involving extended conjugation (Rule 9) or fused aromatic heterocycles (Rule 15), simple SMARTS patterns may be insufficient. Use recursive SMARTS or substructure searches that can capture these more complex molecular features.

**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

After reviewing the current rule metrics in comparison with the reference metrics from previous iterations, we can make the following observations and evaluations focusing on **confidence** and **lift** as key indicators of rule performance.

---

### **Current Metrics vs. Reference Metrics**

**Support:**

- **Current Train Support:** **0.0705**
- **Previous Train Support:** **0.1667**, **0.1845**

*Interpretation:*

- The **current train support** is significantly lower than the previous values.
- **Lower support** indicates the current rules apply to a **smaller portion** of the training data.
- This suggests that the rules have become **more specific**, potentially limiting their applicability.

---

**Confidence:**

- **Current Train Confidence:** **0.5919**
- **Previous Train Confidence:** **0.6352**, **0.5396**

*Interpretation:*

- The current confidence is **slightly below** the first previous value and **above** the second.
- This indicates that when the rule conditions are met, there is approximately a **59.19% chance** of correctly predicting the outcome.
- The confidence level remains **moderate** but has not significantly improved.

---

**Lift:**

- **Current Train Lift:** **1.1849**
- **Previous Train Lift:** **1.2048**, **1.0559**

*Interpretation:*

- The current lift is **slightly below** the first previous value and **above** the second.
- A lift value **greater than 1** signifies that the rule is **better than random chance** at predicting the outcome.
- The **current lift** reflects a **moderate association**, similar to previous iterations.

---

**Leverage:**

- **Current Train Leverage:** **0.0095**
- **Previous Train Leverage:** **0.0289**, **-0.0041**

*Interpretation:*

- The current leverage is **lower** than the first previous value but **higher** than the second, which was negative.
- **Positive leverage** indicates the rule has predictive power **above chance**, but the small value suggests the association is **weak**.

---

### **Overall Performance Assessment**

- **Support Decrease:** The drop in support suggests the rules are covering **fewer data instances**, potentially affecting the rules' **generalizability** and **practical usefulness**.
- **Confidence Stability:** Confidence remains at a **moderate level**, indicating **no significant improvement** in the accuracy of the predictions when the rule conditions are satisfied.
- **Lift Consistency:** The lift values have remained relatively **stable**, showing **no substantial enhancement** in the rules’ ability to predict the outcome compared to the prior probability.
- **Leverage Weakness:** The low leverage value points to a **limited increase** in the rule’s predictive power over random chance.

---

### **Local Minimum Consideration**

- The metrics suggest that the current iteration has **not achieved significant improvements** over previous iterations.
- The **stagnation** in confidence and lift, coupled with the **reduced support**, indicates that we may have reached a **local minimum** in rule performance.
- **Further iterations** using the current approach may yield **diminishing returns**, suggesting a need to **re-evaluate** the strategy.

---

### **Recommendations for Rule Improvement**

To enhance the current rules' performance, the following strategies are recommended:

1. **Expand Rule Coverage (Increase Support):**
   - **Generalize Rule Conditions:**
     - Broaden specific conditions within the rules to **encompass a wider range** of data points.
     - **Combine similar rules** to reduce redundancy and increase overall support.
   - **Example Action:**
     - For rules that specify exact chain lengths or positions, consider using **ranges** or **patterns** to include more compounds.

2. **Enhance Predictive Accuracy (Improve Confidence and Lift):**
   - **Identify Strong Predictors:**
     - Utilize statistical techniques (e.g., **correlation analysis, feature importance metrics**) to pinpoint variables with the **strongest influence** on the outcome.
     - Focus on these variables when formulating or modifying rules.
   - **Optimize Rule Conditions:**
     - Refine existing rules to **eliminate ambiguity** and enhance specificity where it contributes to higher confidence.

3. **Mitigate Overfitting Risks:**
   - **Simplify Rules:**
     - Avoid overly complex rules that may not generalize well to new data.
     - Ensure each rule has a balance between **complexity and generalizability**.
   - **Cross-Validation:**
     - Employ cross-validation techniques to test the rules on multiple subsets of data, ensuring they perform consistently.

4. **Integrate Additional Data or Features:**
   - **Expand Dataset:**
     - Incorporate more data points, possibly from **external datasets**, to provide a richer basis for rule generation.
   - **Add Relevant Features:**
     - Consider additional chemical descriptors or properties (e.g., **lipophilicity, electronic effects**) that may influence catalytic activity.

5. **Explore Alternative Rule-Induction Methods:**
   - **Machine Learning Algorithms:**
     - Use algorithms such as **decision trees, random forests, or association rule mining** to uncover patterns not evident through manual rule creation.
   - **Unsupervised Learning:**
     - Apply clustering methods to identify **natural groupings** in the data that may inform new rules.

6. **Re-evaluate Current Rules:**
   - **Rule Testing and Validation:**
     - Systematically test each rule against the data to assess its individual performance.
     - **Eliminate or revise** rules that contribute minimally or negatively to overall metrics.
   - **Incorporate Feedback:**
     - Engage domain experts to review the rules for **chemical plausibility** and **practical relevance**.

---

### **Specific Suggestions Based on Current Rules**

- **Rule Consolidation:**
  - **Merge overlapping rules** to reduce complexity and improve support.
  - For example, Rules 1, 4, and 5 all deal with **chain length and functional group presence**; consider combining them into a comprehensive rule regarding aliphatic chain modifiers.
  
- **Adjust Rule Specificity:**
  - **Broaden overly specific conditions** to include more compounds.
  - For instance, Rules 7 and 11 focus on specific substituents (fluorination, polyethers) yielding low. Generalizing to "Modifications that increase steric hindrance or electronegativity reduce yield" could cover more cases.

- **Reconsider Underperforming Rules:**
  - **Eliminate or revise rules** that contribute to low support without significantly improving confidence or lift.
  - Rules with **limited examples** or **exceptions** (e.g., Rule 14) may need refinement.

- **Incorporate Positive Interactions:**
  - Identify combinations of features that **synergistically enhance** catalytic performance.
  - For example, modifiers with **both electron-donating groups and metal-coordinating abilities**.

---

### **Conclusion**

The analysis indicates that the current set of rules has **not substantially improved** in terms of confidence and lift when compared to previous iterations, and the **decrease in support** suggests a **narrowing applicability**. To progress beyond this **local minimum**, it is essential to:

- **Reassess and broaden the rules** to cover more data points without sacrificing predictive power.
- **Leverage advanced analytical methods** and incorporate additional data to uncover new patterns.
- **Balance specificity and generality** to enhance both the practical utility and the predictive accuracy of the rules.

By implementing these recommendations, we can aim to develop a set of rules that not only predict high yields with greater confidence and reliability but also apply to a broader range of modifiers, thereby enhancing the overall effectiveness of the catalytic research program.

---

**Next Steps:**

- **Collaborate with team members** to discuss these findings and decide on the most feasible strategies to implement.
- **Prioritize actions** that are likely to yield the most significant improvements in rule performance.
- **Schedule iterative reviews** after implementing changes to continually assess progress and adjust the approach as needed.

Traditional Commenter Message:
# Performance Evaluation of Current Rules

Upon reviewing the latest training results, several critical observations can be made regarding the performance of the current rules:

- **Significant Drop in Validation Accuracy**: The current 5-fold validation accuracy is **0.457**, which is substantially lower than the previous reference validation accuracies of **approximately 0.76**. Similarly, the test accuracy has decreased from values like **0.75** to **0.625** or even lower in previous runs.

- **Indication of Underfitting**: The marked decrease in validation accuracy suggests that the current rules are not capturing the underlying patterns necessary for accurate predictions. This underperformance implies that the model may be **underfitting**, struggling to generalize from the training data to unseen data.

- **Ineffectiveness of Current Rules**: The existing set of rules appears insufficient for the complexity of the dataset. The rules may be too simplistic, overly broad, or missing critical chemical features that influence the catalyst modifier loading.

# SHAP Analysis and Detailed Insights

The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values provide insights into how each rule contributes to the model's predictions for individual molecules. By analyzing the SHAP values, we can identify which rules are contributing to mispredictions and need refinement.

## Analyzing Misclassifications

### Underestimations (Predicted Low, Experimental High)

In these cases, the model predicts a **low loading**, but the experimental value shows a **high loading**. According to the guidance, the rule with the most **negative SHAP value** for high loading is likely attributing to the underestimation.

#### Examples:

1. **Molecule**: `C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N`
   - **Rule2 SHAP**: +0.03748
   - **Rule5 SHAP**: **-0.03748**
   - **Analysis**: Rule 5 has a negative SHAP value, suggesting it's pushing the prediction towards low loading. This indicates that Rule 5 may not be adequately accounting for the features of this molecule.

2. **Molecule**: `C([C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](C(=O)O)O)O)O)O)O`
   - **Rule2 SHAP**: +0.03748
   - **Rule5 SHAP**: **-0.03748**
   - **Analysis**: Similar to the first molecule, Rule 5 negatively impacts the prediction, leading to underestimation.

3. **Molecule**: `C1=CC(=C(C=C1C=O)C(=O)O)O`
   - **Rule2 SHAP**: -0.43682
   - **Rule5 SHAP**: -0.06317
   - **Analysis**: Both Rule 2 and Rule 5 have negative SHAP values, with Rule 2 having a more significant impact. This suggests issues with both rules for this molecule.

4. **Molecule**: `C1=CNC(=O)C=C1C(=O)O`
   - **Rule2 SHAP**: **-0.04548**
   - **Rule5 SHAP**: -0.05451
   - **Analysis**: Rule 2 has a notable negative SHAP value, indicating it may be incorrectly influencing the prediction towards low loading.

### Overestimations (Predicted High, Experimental Low)

In these cases, the model predicts a **high loading**, but the experimental value shows a **low loading**. The rule with the most **positive SHAP value** for high loading is likely causing the overestimation.

#### Examples:

1. **Molecule**: `C(CCCO)CCC(=O)O`
   - **Rule2 SHAP**: -0.00214
   - **Rule5 SHAP**: **+0.06642**
   - **Analysis**: Rule 5 has a positive SHAP value, pushing the prediction towards high loading when it should be low, indicating a potential issue with Rule 5.

2. **Molecule**: `C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O`
   - **Rule2 SHAP**: +0.03122
   - **Rule5 SHAP**: **+0.30211**
   - **Analysis**: Rule 5 is significantly contributing to the overestimation, suggesting it may need refinement.

3. **Molecule**: `C(CCCO)CC(=O)O`
   - **Rule2 SHAP**: -0.01567
   - **Rule5 SHAP**: **+0.08718**
   - **Analysis**: Positive SHAP value from Rule 5 leads to overestimation.

## Patterns Identified

- **Rule 5**:
  - Frequently exhibits **negative SHAP values** in underestimations and **positive SHAP values** in overestimations.
  - Suggests that Rule 5 is contributing inconsistently to the predictions, leading to misclassifications.

- **Rule 2**:
  - Shows significant **negative SHAP values** in several underestimations.
  - Indicates that Rule 2 might be suppressing the prediction of high loading when it is actually high.

# Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment

The substantial decrease in validation accuracy without evidence of high training accuracy suggests that the model is **underfitting**. This means:

- The model lacks complexity to capture the underlying data patterns.
- The current rules do not encompass all necessary features influencing the target variable.
- Additional rules or features may be required to improve predictive performance.

# Recommendations for Improvement

Based on the SHAP analysis and performance evaluation, the following recommendations are proposed to enhance the current rules:

## 1. Refine Rule 5

### **Current Rule 5**:

- **Description**: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on short chains yield high; single hydroxyl on long chains yields low.
- **Issue**: Rule 5 contributes to both overestimations and underestimations, indicating that it may be too general or misclassified.

### **Suggested Refinements**:

- **Specify Chain Length and Hydroxyl Positions**:
  - Precisely define what constitutes a "short chain" (e.g., chains with 3-5 carbons).
  - Detail the positions of hydroxyl groups that promote high loading.
  - Example: *Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on chains of 3-5 carbons, with hydroxyls at adjacent carbons, yield high loading.*

- **Introduce Exceptions**:
  - Identify molecules that do not conform to Rule 5 and adjust the rule to exclude them.
  - For instance, molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups but additional functional groups that interfere with loading should be excluded.

- **Consider Steric Effects**:
  - Assess how steric hindrance from bulky groups may affect the applicability of Rule 5.
  - Modify the rule to account for steric factors that could lower loading despite multiple hydroxyl groups.

## 2. Adjust Rule 2

### **Current Rule 2**:

- **Description**: Para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing, metal-coordinating groups yield high; electron-donating or non-coordinating groups yield low.
- **Issue**: Rule 2 sometimes incorrectly contributes to low loading predictions when the experimental value is high.

### **Suggested Refinements**:

- **Clarify Electron-Withdrawing Groups**:
  - Provide a specific list of substituents considered electron-withdrawing and capable of metal coordination.
  - Example: *Nitro, amino, and halogen groups at the para position yield high loading.*

- **Differentiate between Substituents**:
  - Recognize that not all electron-withdrawing groups equally impact loading.
  - Adjust the rule to reflect the relative strength of different substituents.

- **Incorporate Ortho and Meta Positions**:
  - Consider the effect of substituents at positions other than para.
  - Expand the rule to include molecules where the position of the substituent influences loading.

## 3. Introduce Additional Rules

### **Identify Missing Chemical Features**:

- **Heterocyclic Compounds**: Some underestimations involve heterocyclic carboxylic acids. Develop rules that better capture the behavior of such compounds.
  - **New Rule Suggestion**: *Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids with ring systems capable of resonance stabilization yield high loading.*

### **Address Long-Chain Aliphatic Acids**:

- The molecule `CCCCCCCC(=O)O` (octanoic acid) is underestimated. Consider adding or refining a rule to capture the effect of longer aliphatic chains.

  - **New Rule Suggestion**: *Long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (7 carbons or more) without polar functional groups yield high loading due to increased hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst.*

## 4. Improve Generalization

### **Avoid Overfitting Specific Cases**:

- Ensure that rules are not overly tailored to specific molecules at the expense of general applicability.
  
### **Increase Rule Complexity Where Necessary**:

- Introduce quantitative descriptors or thresholds (e.g., electronegativity values, pKa ranges) to make rules more precise.

### **Consider Multivariate Interactions**:

- Explore rules that account for interactions between multiple functional groups within a molecule.
  
## 5. Utilize SHAP Analysis for Rule Refinement

### **Iterative Refinement Process**:

- Continue using SHAP values to identify problematic rules in future iterations.
- Focus on rules that consistently contribute to mispredictions.

### **Feedback Loop Between Model and Rules**:

- Use model performance and SHAP insights to inform rule adjustments.
- After modifying rules, retrain the model and reassess SHAP contributions.

## 6. Re-Evaluate Molecules with High Misclassification Rates

### **Investigate Outliers**:

- Examine molecules that are frequently misclassified to identify unique features not captured by current rules.

### **Potentially Exclude or Specially Treat Outliers**:

- If certain molecules do not conform to any rule patterns, consider treating them as exceptions or developing specific rules.

# Conclusion

The current set of rules demonstrates limitations in accurately predicting the catalyst modifier loading, as evidenced by the decreased validation accuracy and SHAP analysis. To address these issues:

- **Refine existing rules** like Rule 5 and Rule 2 to be more precise and better reflect the chemical behavior influencing loading.
- **Introduce new rules** to capture missing features and improve the model's ability to generalize.
- **Use SHAP analysis** systematically to guide rule adjustments and understand the impact of each rule.
- **Adopt an iterative approach** to model training and rule refinement, ensuring continuous improvement in predictive performance.

By implementing these recommendations, it is anticipated that the model's accuracy will improve, moving closer to or surpassing previous validation accuracies.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Rule Optimization**

**1. Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

The current set of rules for predicting the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction shows suboptimal performance, as evidenced by the metrics and analyses provided:

- **Significant Drop in Validation Accuracy**: The 5-fold validation accuracy has decreased to **45.71%**, a notable decline from previous accuracies of approximately **76%**. This indicates that the model's predictive capability has diminished.
  
- **SHAP Analysis Highlights Misclassifications**: The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis reveals that certain rules, particularly **Rule 2** and **Rule 5**, are contributing to both overestimations and underestimations of the modifier loading on the catalyst. This inconsistency suggests that these rules may not be accurately capturing the underlying chemical behavior.

- **Underfitting Indication**: The low validation accuracy, coupled with no evidence of overfitting (i.e., training accuracy is not significantly higher than validation accuracy), suggests that the model is underfitting. It lacks the complexity necessary to model the data adequately.

**2. Analysis of Specific Rules**

- **Rule 2 (Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids)**:
  - **Issue**: Rule 2 sometimes incorrectly predicts low loading for molecules that experimentally have high loading. The SHAP values indicate that Rule 2 contributes negatively in these cases.
  - **Possible Cause**: The current SMARTS patterns may not be accurately identifying all relevant functional groups or their positions, particularly the para-substitution pattern and metal-coordinating capabilities.

- **Rule 5 (Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups)**:
  - **Issue**: Rule 5 contributes to misclassifications by both overestimating and underestimating the yield. It seems to inconsistently predict the effect of hydroxyl groups on different chain lengths.
  - **Possible Cause**: The rule may be too general or not adequately specifying the effect of chain length and the number or position of hydroxyl groups.

**3. Suggestions to Improve Current Rules**

**A. Refine Rule 2**

- **Clarify Substituent Positions**: Ensure that the SMARTS patterns specifically identify para-substituted benzoic acids. Modify the pattern to target substituents at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid group.

- **Update Metal-Coordinating Groups**: Expand or refine the list of electron-withdrawing, metal-coordinating substituents. Explicitly include groups known to coordinate with metals (e.g., amino, nitro, halogens like bromine).

- **Consider Other Positions**: Examine whether substitutions at ortho or meta positions affect yield and update the rule accordingly.

**B. Refine Rule 5**

- **Specify Chain Length and Hydroxyl Group Count**: Clearly define what constitutes a "short chain" (e.g., 3-5 carbons) and stipulate the minimum number of hydroxyl groups required to impact yield positively.

- **Detail Hydroxyl Group Positions**: Indicate that hydroxyl groups should be on adjacent carbons or in specific configurations that favor interaction with the catalyst.

- **Exclude Confounding Functional Groups**: Modify the rule to exclude molecules where additional functional groups negate the positive effect of multiple hydroxyl groups.

**C. Introduce New Rules or Modify Existing Ones**

- **Rule for Heterocyclic Compounds with Metal-Coordinating Ability**:
  - **Suggestion**: Develop a rule that captures the behavior of nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids, as they have shown high yield due to their ability to coordinate with metal centers.

- **Rule for Long-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids**:
  - **Suggestion**: Create or adjust a rule that addresses long-chain aliphatic acids without polar functional groups, which may yield high due to hydrophobic interactions enhancing catalyst interaction.

**D. Improve SMARTS Patterns Across Rules**

- **Ensure Accurate Representation**: Review and update all SMARTS patterns to precisely match the chemical structures described in the rules. This includes correctly capturing chain lengths, functional group positions, and connectivity.

- **Test SMARTS Patterns**: Validate the updated SMARTS patterns against a set of known molecules to ensure they match the intended structures and exclude incorrect ones.

**E. Incorporate Additional Chemical Descriptors**

- **Consider Steric and Electronic Effects**: Introduce descriptors or thresholds for steric hindrance (e.g., branching, bulky groups) and electronic properties (e.g., electronegativity, resonance effects) to enhance rule specificity.

- **Utilize Quantitative Structure-Property Relationships (QSPR)**: Integrate quantitative data where possible to refine rules based on measurable properties.

**F. Re-evaluate and Simplify Rules**

- **Consolidate Overlapping Rules**: Combine rules that cover similar chemical features to increase support and reduce complexity.

- **Eliminate Redundant or Ineffective Rules**: Remove rules that do not contribute significantly to improving predictive performance or that have low support and confidence.

**4. Potential for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

There is potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting:

- **Addressing Underfitting**: Since the model is underfitting, increasing its complexity by refining the rules should improve performance. This involves making the rules more precise and better aligned with the underlying chemical principles.

- **Balancing Specificity and Generality**: By carefully refining the rules to be neither too broad nor too narrow, we can improve the model's ability to generalize without overfitting.

- **Iterative Testing and Validation**: Applying changes iteratively and validating the model's performance at each step helps prevent overfitting.

- **Incorporating Domain Expertise**: Collaborating with chemists to ensure that the rules make chemical sense can improve their effectiveness and applicability.

---

**Conclusion**

The current analysis indicates that the rules can be further optimized to enhance the model's predictive capabilities. By refining the existing rules, introducing new ones where necessary, and improving the specificity of SMARTS patterns, we can address the underfitting issue and improve both the accuracy and reliability of the predictions.

Final Metric Message:

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Short-Chain Aliphatic Amino Acids Yield High; Longer-Chain Analogs Yield Low**

  Modifiers that are aliphatic amino acids with a carbon chain length of 4 or 5 carbons and an amino group at the α-position result in high yield. Longer-chain amino acids (6 carbons or more) yield low. This may be due to optimal coordination and minimal steric hindrance with the catalyst for shorter chains.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)
      - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)
      - 5-aminopentanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:**
      - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
      - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
      - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 2**: **Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing, Metal-Coordinating Groups Yield High; Electron-Donating or Non-Coordinating Groups Yield Low**

  Modifiers that are benzoic acid derivatives with electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position capable of coordinating with metal centers (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl) result in high yield. Those with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy) or non-coordinating substituents yield low. Coordination enhances interaction with the catalyst.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 4-aminobenzoic acid
      - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
      - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-methylbenzoic acid
      - 4-formylbenzoic acid
      - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 3**: **Nitrogen-Containing Heterocyclic Carboxylic Acids Yield High**

  Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids with nitrogen-containing aromatic rings, such as pyridine and pyrazole carboxylic acids, result in high yield. Their ability to coordinate with metal centers enhances catalytic activity.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Niacin)
      - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
      - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 4**: **Straight-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Yield High; Addition of Polar Functional Groups Lowers Yield**

  Modifiers that are straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups result in high yield. Introducing polar groups like hydroxyl or amino decreases the yield, potentially due to altered solubility or interference with catalyst coordination.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - Octanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
      - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
      - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups on Short Chains Yield High; Single Hydroxyl on Long Chains Yields Low**

  Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups on short aliphatic chains enhance solubility and interaction with the catalyst, resulting in high yield. A single hydroxyl group on a longer chain does not have the same effect and yields low.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid

- **Rule 6**: **Aliphatic Thiol Groups Yield High; Aromatic Thiol Groups Yield Low**

  Modifiers with thiol (–SH) groups on aliphatic chains result in high yield, likely due to effective coordination with the metal catalyst. Thiol groups attached to aromatic rings may lead to catalyst poisoning or deactivation, yielding low.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 7**: **Highly Fluorinated Aliphatic Chains Yield Low**

  Modifiers with multiple fluorine atoms in aliphatic chains result in low yield. The strong electronegativity and hydrophobic nature of fluorinated chains can reduce interactions with the catalyst and hinder the reaction.

  *Example:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with Carbonyl Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acids Yield Low**

  Modifiers possessing aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acids tend to yield low. These carbonyl groups might chelate with the metal catalyst or participate in side reactions, reducing catalytic efficiency.

  *Examples:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-formylbenzoic acid
      - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
      - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with Extended Conjugation Involving Heterocycles Yield High**

  Modifiers containing extended conjugated systems with oxygen or nitrogen heterocycles enhance electron delocalization and coordination with the catalyst, resulting in high yield.

  *Example:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 10**: **Hydroxyphenyl Groups Connected by Long Aliphatic Chains Yield High; Short Chains Yield Low**

  Modifiers with hydroxyphenyl groups linked by aliphatic chains of five or more carbons to a carboxylic acid yield high, possibly due to increased flexibility and optimal interaction with the catalyst. Shorter chains may not provide this advantage.

  *Examples:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
    - **Low Yield:**
      - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with Polyether Chains Yield Low**

  Modifiers containing polyether chains, such as methoxyethoxy units, result in low yield. These moieties may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorable solvation effects, impeding effective catalyst interaction.

  *Example:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid

- **Rule 12**: **Bulky Non-Coordinating Substituents Yield Low**

  Modifiers with bulky substituents that cannot effectively coordinate with the metal catalyst lead to low yield. Steric hindrance may prevent proper interaction with the active sites.

  *Examples:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
      - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 13**: **Aromatic Rings with Amino Groups Adjacent to Carboxylic Acids Yield High**

  Modifiers where an amino group is directly attached to an aromatic ring adjacent to a carboxylic acid enhance metal coordination, resulting in high yield.

  *Example:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - 4-aminobenzoic acid

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with Methoxy Groups Without Coordinating Substituents Yield Low**

  Modifiers featuring methoxy groups attached to aromatic rings or aliphatic chains yield low if they lack other coordinating groups. Methoxy groups are electron-donating but do not coordinate effectively with metal catalysts.

  *Examples:*

    - **Low Yield:**
      - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
      - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid (Note: Despite containing methoxy groups, this compound yields high, possibly due to other contributing factors.)

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with Fused Nitrogen Heterocyclic Aromatic Systems Yield High**

  Modifiers containing fused aromatic systems with nitrogen heterocycles (e.g., indole ring in tryptophan) can delocalize electrons and coordinate with metal centers effectively, yielding high.

  *Example:*

    - **High Yield:**
      - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Refine Rule 2 for Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids**

  - **Update SMARTS Patterns**: Modify the SMARTS patterns in Rule 2 to specifically identify para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing, metal-coordinating groups at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid.
    - **Include Metal-Coordinating Groups**: Ensure the patterns include substituents like amino (`-NH2`), nitro (`-NO2`), halogens (e.g., bromo), and bromomethyl groups.
    - **Exclude Electron-Donating Groups**: Exclude modifiers with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy) or non-coordinating substituents.
  - **Example SMARTS Pattern for High Yield**:
    - `C1=CC([NX3;H2,H1;!$(N-C=O),OX1,O,NX2])=CC=C1C(=O)O`  
      - This pattern matches benzoic acids with a metal-coordinating group (N or O donor) at the para position.
  - **Validation**: Test the updated SMARTS patterns against known high and low yield modifiers to ensure accurate classification.

- **Advice 2**: **Refine Rule 5 for Multiple Hydroxyl Groups on Short Chains**

  - **Specify Chain Length and Hydroxyl Count**: Define "short aliphatic chains" as chains with 5 or fewer carbons and specify that high yield requires multiple (e.g., 3 or more) hydroxyl groups.
  - **Detail Hydroxyl Group Positions**: Indicate that hydroxyl groups should be on adjacent carbons to enhance interaction with the catalyst.
  - **Update SMARTS Pattern**:
    - High Yield: `O[C@@H]([C@@H](O)[C@@H](O)[C@H](O)CO)C(=O)O`  
      - Matches modifiers like gluconic acid with multiple hydroxyls on a short chain.
    - Low Yield Exclusion: Ensure that compounds with a single hydroxyl on long chains (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) do not match the high-yield pattern.
  - **Exclude Confounding Functional Groups**: Modify the rule to exclude modifiers with additional polar groups that may interfere with catalyst coordination.

- **Advice 3**: **Improve SMARTS Patterns Across All Rules**

  - **Accurate Representation**: Review and update all SMARTS patterns to precisely match the chemical structures described in the rules.
  - **Testing SMARTS Patterns**: Validate each pattern against known modifiers to confirm they match intended structures and exclude incorrect ones.
  - **Example**: For Rule 1 (Short-Chain Aliphatic Amino Acids):
    - High Yield Pattern: `N[C@@H](C(=O)O)C`  
      - Matches short-chain amino acids like alanine and aspartic acid.
    - Exclude longer chains by limiting the pattern to a specific number of carbons.

- **Advice 4**: **Introduce a New Rule for Nitrogen-Containing Heterocyclic Carboxylic Acids**

  - **Rule Statement**: Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole carboxylic acids) yield high due to effective metal coordination.
  - **SMARTS Pattern**:
    - High Yield: `[nX2]1cccc1C(=O)O`  
      - Matches pyridine carboxylic acids.
    - `[nH]1nccc1C(=O)O`  
      - Matches pyrazole carboxylic acids.
  - **Validation**: Ensure these patterns accurately identify known high-yield modifiers like niacin and exclude non-relevant compounds.

- **Advice 5**: **Adjust Rule 4 for Straight-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids**

  - **Emphasize Chain Length and Lack of Polar Groups**: Specify that high yield is associated with unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups.
  - **Update SMARTS Pattern**:
    - High Yield: `CCCCCCCC(=O)O`  
      - Matches octanoic acid and similar long-chain acids.
    - Exclude Low Yield Modifiers: Modify the pattern to exclude acids with hydroxyl or amino groups (e.g., `C[CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4]C(=O)O`).
  - **Clarify Rule Scope**: Clearly state that the presence of polar groups on the aliphatic chain lowers yield due to interference with catalytic activity.

- **Advice 6**: **Re-evaluate and Simplify Rules**

  - **Consolidate Overlapping Rules**: Identify rules covering similar chemical features (e.g., Rules 9 and 15 regarding heterocycles) and merge them to increase clarity and support.
  - **Remove Ineffective Rules**: Analyze the impact of each rule on the model's performance and eliminate those with low contribution or redundant scope.
  - **Prioritize High-Impact Rules**: Focus on rules that have strong support from both the data and chemical reasoning.

- **Advice 7**: **Incorporate Additional Chemical Descriptors**

  - **Steric Hindrance**: Introduce descriptors for steric bulk (e.g., branching, bulky substituents) to account for modifiers that may hinder catalyst access.
  - **Electronic Effects**: Include parameters like electronegativity or resonance effects to quantify the impact of substituents on metal coordination.
  - **Implement QSPR Models**: Use Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship models to provide a quantitative basis for rule refinement.

- **Advice 8**: **Iteratively Test and Validate Model Improvements**

  - **Retrain the Model**: After refining rules and SMARTS patterns, retrain the model to assess improvements in predictive accuracy.
  - **Cross-Validation**: Use k-fold cross-validation to evaluate model performance and ensure changes address underfitting without overfitting.
  - **SHAP Analysis**: Re-run SHAP analysis to identify any remaining misclassifications and refine rules accordingly.

- **Advice 9**: **Collaborate with Chemists for Expert Input**

  - **Expert Review**: Engage with chemists to ensure that all rules and patterns align with chemical intuition and experimental observations.
  - **Incorporate Feedback**: Use their insights to adjust rules, especially in cases where data is limited or ambiguous.
  - **Continuous Improvement**: Establish a feedback loop for ongoing rule refinement as new data becomes available.

- **Advice 10**: **Document All Changes and Rationales**

  - **Change Log**: Maintain detailed records of all rule modifications, including changes to SMARTS patterns and the reasons behind them.
  - **Version Control**: Use version control systems to track changes and enable rollback if needed.
  - **Transparency**: Ensure documentation is clear and accessible to all team members for collaboration and future reference.
