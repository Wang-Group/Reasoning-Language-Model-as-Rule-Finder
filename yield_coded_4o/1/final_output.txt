    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. This is likely due to the ability of the carboxylic acid to coordinate with the metal center, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. Examples include 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid and 4-aminobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with an amino group (-NH2) and a linear aliphatic chain of 4 to 6 carbons tend to result in a high yield. The amino group can enhance coordination with the metal center, while the aliphatic chain may provide steric effects that favor the reaction. Examples include 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a hydroxyl group (-OH) and an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. The hydroxyl group can participate in hydrogen bonding, potentially stabilizing the catalyst structure. Examples include 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (-O-) tend to result in a low yield. The presence of ether linkages may lead to increased flexibility and decreased rigidity in the catalyst structure, which can negatively impact the reaction. Examples include 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing a sulfanyl group (-SH) tend to result in a high yield. The sulfanyl group can provide strong coordination with the metal center, enhancing the catalytic activity. Examples include 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a nitro group (-NO2) on an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group can stabilize the metal center, enhancing the reaction. An example is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the trifluoromethyl group may destabilize the metal center, reducing catalytic activity. An example is 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing an indole group tend to result in a high yield. The indole group can provide π-π interactions and additional coordination sites, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. An example is (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring tend to result in a high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing the catalytic activity. Examples include pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing a formyl group (-CHO) on an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield. The formyl group may introduce steric hindrance or electronic effects that destabilize the metal center. Examples include 4-formylbenzoic acid.

    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents (e.g., -OH, -NH2) tend to result in a high yield. The electron-donating groups enhance coordination with the metal center, stabilizing the catalyst. Examples include 4-aminobenzoic acid and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with an amino group (-NH2) and a linear aliphatic chain of 4 to 6 carbons, without additional electron-withdrawing groups, tend to result in a high yield. The amino group enhances coordination, while the aliphatic chain provides steric effects that favor the reaction. Examples include 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a hydroxyl group (-OH) and an aromatic ring with additional electron-donating groups tend to result in a high yield. The hydroxyl group participates in hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst structure. Examples include 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (-O-) and no additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The flexibility and decreased rigidity of the catalyst structure negatively impact the reaction. Examples include 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing a sulfanyl group (-SH) with a short aliphatic chain (up to 3 carbons) tend to result in a high yield. The sulfanyl group provides strong coordination with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a nitro group (-NO2) on an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group stabilizes the metal center, enhancing the reaction. An example is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

These groups enhance the electron density on the aromatic ring, stabilizing the metal center. An example is 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a branched aliphatic chain containing an amino group (-NH2) tend to result in a low yield. The branching may introduce steric hindrance that affects coordination with the metal center. An example is (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with electron-withdrawing substituents tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature reduces the electron density on the nitrogen, affecting coordination. An example is 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbons) and no additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The long chain may introduce steric hindrance and reduce effective coordination. An example is octanoic acid.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents (e.g., -OH, -NH2) tend to result in a high yield. These groups enhance coordination with the metal center, stabilizing the catalyst. Examples include 4-aminobenzoic acid and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with an amino group (-NH2) and a linear aliphatic chain of 4 to 6 carbons, without additional electron-withdrawing groups, tend to result in a high yield. The amino group enhances coordination, while the aliphatic chain provides steric effects that favor the reaction. Examples include 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a hydroxyl group (-OH) and an aromatic ring with additional electron-donating groups tend to result in a high yield. The hydroxyl group participates in hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst structure. Examples include 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (-O-) and no additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The flexibility and decreased rigidity of the catalyst structure negatively impact the reaction. Examples include 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing a sulfanyl group (-SH) with a short aliphatic chain (up to 3 carbons) tend to result in a high yield. The sulfanyl group provides strong coordination with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a nitro group (-NO2) on an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group stabilizes the metal center, enhancing the reaction. An example is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the trifluoromethyl group destabilizes the metal center, reducing catalytic activity. An example is 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing an indole group tend to result in a high yield. The indole group provides π-π interactions and additional coordination sites, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. An example is (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring tend to result in a high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring coordinates with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing a formyl group (-CHO) on an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield. The formyl group introduces steric hindrance or electronic effects that destabilize the metal center. Examples include 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring and electron-withdrawing groups such as sulfonyl (-SO2-) or carbonyl (-C=O) groups tend to result in a low yield. These groups may destabilize the metal center. Examples include 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring and electron-donating groups such as methoxy (-OCH3) or ethoxy (-OC2H5) tend to result in a high yield. These groups enhance the electron density on the aromatic ring, stabilizing the metal center. An example is 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a branched aliphatic chain containing an amino group (-NH2) tend to result in a low yield. The branching may introduce steric hindrance that affects coordination with the metal center. An example is (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with electron-withdrawing substituents tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature reduces the electron density on the nitrogen, affecting coordination. An example is 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbons) and no additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The long chain may introduce steric hindrance and reduce effective coordination. An example is octanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with an amino group (-NH2) and a linear aliphatic chain of 4 to 6 carbons, without additional electron-withdrawing groups, tend to result in a high yield. The amino group enhances coordination, while the aliphatic chain provides steric effects that favor the reaction. Examples include 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a hydroxyl group (-OH) and an aromatic ring with additional electron-donating groups tend to result in a high yield. The hydroxyl group participates in hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst structure. Examples include 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (-O-) and no additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The flexibility and decreased rigidity of the catalyst structure negatively impact the reaction. Examples include 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing a sulfanyl group (-SH) with a short aliphatic chain (up to 3 carbons) tend to result in a high yield. The sulfanyl group provides strong coordination with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a nitro group (-NO2) on an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group stabilizes the metal center, enhancing the reaction. An example is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the trifluoromethyl group destabilizes the metal center, reducing catalytic activity. An example is 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing an indole group tend to result in a high yield. The indole group provides π-π interactions and additional coordination sites, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. An example is (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring tend to result in a high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring coordinates with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing a formyl group (-CHO) on an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield. The formyl group introduces steric hindrance or electronic effects that destabilize the metal center. Examples include 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring and electron-withdrawing groups such as sulfonyl (-SO2-) or carbonyl (-C=O) groups tend to result in a low yield. These groups may destabilize the metal center. Examples include 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring and electron-donating groups such as methoxy (-OCH3) or ethoxy (-OC2H5) tend to result in a high yield. These groups enhance the electron density on the aromatic ring, stabilizing the metal center. An example is 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a branched aliphatic chain containing an amino group (-NH2) tend to result in a low yield. The branching may introduce steric hindrance that affects coordination with the metal center. An example is (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with electron-withdrawing substituents tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature reduces the electron density on the nitrogen, affecting coordination. An example is 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbons) and no additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The long chain may introduce steric hindrance and reduce effective coordination. An example is octanoic acid.

These groups enhance coordination with the metal center, stabilizing the catalyst. Examples include 4-aminobenzoic acid and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with an amino group (-NH2) and a linear aliphatic chain of 4 to 6 carbons, without additional electron-withdrawing groups, tend to result in a high yield. The amino group enhances coordination, while the aliphatic chain provides steric effects that favor the reaction. Examples include 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a hydroxyl group (-OH) and an aromatic ring with additional electron-donating groups tend to result in a high yield. The hydroxyl group participates in hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst structure. Examples include 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (-O-) and no additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The flexibility and decreased rigidity of the catalyst structure negatively impact the reaction. Examples include 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing a sulfanyl group (-SH) with a short aliphatic chain (up to 3 carbons) tend to result in a high yield. The sulfanyl group provides strong coordination with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a nitro group (-NO2) on an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group stabilizes the metal center, enhancing the reaction. An example is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) and additional electron-donating groups on the aromatic ring can result in a high yield. The electron-donating groups may counteract the destabilizing effect of the trifluoromethyl group. An example is 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing an indole group tend to result in a high yield. The indole group provides π-π interactions and additional coordination sites, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. An example is (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring tend to result in a high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring coordinates with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing a formyl group (-CHO) on an aromatic ring with additional electron-donating groups may result in a high yield. The electron-donating groups can mitigate the negative impact of the formyl group. An example is 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring and electron-withdrawing groups such as sulfonyl (-SO2-) or carbonyl (-C=O) groups tend to result in a low yield. These groups may destabilize the metal center. Examples include 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a branched aliphatic chain containing an amino group (-NH2) and additional electron-donating groups may result in a high yield. The electron-donating groups can enhance coordination despite the branching. An example is (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbons) and additional electron-donating groups can result in a high yield. The electron-donating groups may enhance coordination and reduce steric hindrance. An example is 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with electron-withdrawing substituents tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature reduces the electron density on the nitrogen, affecting coordination. An example is 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring and electron-donating groups such as methoxy (-OCH3) or ethoxy (-OC2H5) tend to result in a high yield. These groups enhance the electron density on the aromatic ring, stabilizing the metal center. An example is 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.
