- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. This is likely due to the ability of the carboxylic acid to coordinate with the metal center, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. Examples include 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid and 4-aminobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with an amino group (-NH2) and a linear aliphatic chain of 4 to 6 carbons tend to result in a high yield. The amino group can enhance coordination with the metal center, while the aliphatic chain may provide steric effects that favor the reaction. Examples include 5-aminopentanoic acid and 7-aminoheptanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a hydroxyl group (-OH) and an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. The hydroxyl group can participate in hydrogen bonding, potentially stabilizing the catalyst structure. Examples include 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid and 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (-O-) tend to result in a low yield. The presence of ether linkages may lead to increased flexibility and decreased rigidity in the catalyst structure, which can negatively impact the reaction. Examples include 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing a sulfanyl group (-SH) tend to result in a high yield. The sulfanyl group can provide strong coordination with the metal center, enhancing the catalytic activity. Examples include 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a nitro group (-NO2) on an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group can stabilize the metal center, enhancing the reaction. An example is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the trifluoromethyl group may destabilize the metal center, reducing catalytic activity. An example is 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing an indole group tend to result in a high yield. The indole group can provide π-π interactions and additional coordination sites, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. An example is (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Advice 1**: For Rule 2, consider refining the criteria for amino group modifiers by analyzing the structural differences between high-yield and low-yield examples. This could involve examining the specific positioning of the amino group or the influence of additional functional groups on the aliphatic chain.

- **Advice 2**: For Rule 3, investigate the role of chain length and additional functional groups in modifiers with hydroxyl groups and aromatic rings. This could help identify why some compounds like 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid result in low yield, potentially leading to a more nuanced rule.

- **Advice 3**: For Rule 4, expand the rule to include other structural features that might contribute to low yield when ether linkages are present. This could involve looking at the overall flexibility of the molecule or the presence of other functional groups that might interact with the ether linkages.

- **Advice 4**: For Rule 5, analyze the structural context of sulfanyl groups in both high and low-yield examples. This could involve looking at the influence of adjacent groups or the overall molecular geometry to refine the rule and improve its coverage.

- **Advice 5**: Consider combining Rules 6 and 7 into a broader rule about electron-withdrawing groups, while still noting specific exceptions. This could help improve coverage by identifying common features among different electron-withdrawing groups that affect yield.

- **Advice 6**: For Rule 8, explore the potential for π-π interactions and additional coordination sites in other aromatic systems beyond indole. This could help generalize the rule to include other similar structures that might also enhance yield.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][c]' only checks for a carboxylic acid directly attached to an aromatic ring. However, the rule also requires the presence of an aromatic ring, which is not explicitly checked. Consider using a SMARTS pattern that ensures both the carboxylic acid and the aromatic ring are present, such as '[c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: For Rule 2, the SMARTS patterns '[NX3H2]' and '[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]?' are used. The second pattern is intended to match a linear aliphatic chain of 4 to 6 carbons, but it may not accurately capture this structure. Consider using a more specific pattern like '[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]?[C;X4]?' to ensure the chain length is between 4 and 6 carbons.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For Rule 3, the SMARTS pattern '[c][OX2H]' is used, which correctly identifies a hydroxyl group attached to an aromatic ring. This seems appropriate, but ensure that the aromatic context is correctly captured in all cases.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: For Rule 4, the SMARTS pattern '[OX2][CX4][OX2]' is used to identify multiple ether linkages. This pattern may not capture all possible ether linkages, especially if they are not in a simple linear form. Consider using a more flexible pattern like '[OX2][CX4][OX2]' with additional context to capture variations in ether linkage structures.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: For Rule 5, the SMARTS pattern '[SX2H]' is used, which correctly identifies a sulfanyl group. Ensure that this pattern is applied in the correct context to match the rule's intent.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: For Rule 6, the SMARTS pattern '[c][NX3+](=O)[O-]' is used, which correctly identifies a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring. This seems appropriate, but ensure that the aromatic context is correctly captured in all cases.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: For Rule 7, the SMARTS pattern '[CX4](F)(F)F' is used, which correctly identifies a trifluoromethyl group. This seems appropriate, but ensure that the context of the group is correctly captured in all cases.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: For Rule 8, the SMARTS pattern 'c1c[nH]c2c1cccc2' is used, which correctly identifies an indole group. This seems appropriate, but ensure that the context of the group is correctly captured in all cases.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: For Rule 9, the SMARTS pattern 'c1ccncc1' is used, which correctly identifies a pyridine ring. This seems appropriate, but ensure that the context of the group is correctly captured in all cases.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: For Rule 10, the SMARTS pattern '[c][CX3H]=O' is used, which correctly identifies a formyl group attached to an aromatic ring. This seems appropriate, but ensure that the aromatic context is correctly captured in all cases.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: Consider adding error handling or logging to capture cases where the SMILES strings cannot be converted to molecules, as this could affect the feature matrix generation.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: Review the logic for assigning 1 or -1 based on the rule index. Ensure that the rules with high prediction are correctly identified and that the logic aligns with the natural language rules.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. This is likely due to the ability of the carboxylic acid to coordinate with the metal center, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. Examples include 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid and 4-aminobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with an amino group (-NH2) and a linear aliphatic chain of 4 to 6 carbons tend to result in a high yield. The amino group can enhance coordination with the metal center, while the aliphatic chain may provide steric effects that favor the reaction. Examples include 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a hydroxyl group (-OH) and an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. The hydroxyl group can participate in hydrogen bonding, potentially stabilizing the catalyst structure. Examples include 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (-O-) tend to result in a low yield. The presence of ether linkages may lead to increased flexibility and decreased rigidity in the catalyst structure, which can negatively impact the reaction. Examples include 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing a sulfanyl group (-SH) tend to result in a high yield. The sulfanyl group can provide strong coordination with the metal center, enhancing the catalytic activity. Examples include 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a nitro group (-NO2) on an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group can stabilize the metal center, enhancing the reaction. An example is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the trifluoromethyl group may destabilize the metal center, reducing catalytic activity. An example is 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing an indole group tend to result in a high yield. The indole group can provide π-π interactions and additional coordination sites, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. An example is (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring tend to result in a high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing the catalytic activity. Examples include pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing a formyl group (-CHO) on an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield. The formyl group may introduce steric hindrance or electronic effects that destabilize the metal center. Examples include 4-formylbenzoic acid.

Metric Commenter Message:
Based on the current metrics, we can evaluate the performance of the rules and compare them to the previous metrics to assess improvements or areas needing further refinement.

### Current Metrics Analysis:
- **Train Support**: The current train support is 0.0486, which is lower than the previous train support values of 0.1667 and 0.1845. This indicates that the current rules apply to a smaller portion of the training data. While this might suggest more specific rules, it could also mean that the rules are too narrow and not capturing enough relevant data.

- **Train Confidence**: The current train confidence is 0.6083, which is slightly lower than the previous train confidence of 0.6352 but higher than 0.5396. This suggests that the rules are moderately reliable in predicting high yields, but there is room for improvement to increase the confidence level.

- **Train Lift**: The current train lift is 1.2237, which is an improvement over the previous lift values of 1.2048 and 1.0559. A lift greater than 1 indicates that the rules are effective in identifying conditions that lead to high yields, as they increase the likelihood of the outcome compared to random chance. This is a positive sign, showing that the rules are meaningful and have a significant impact.

- **Train Leverage**: The current train leverage is 0.0093, which is lower than the previous positive leverage of 0.0289 but better than the negative leverage of -0.0041. Positive leverage indicates that the rules provide additional support beyond what would be expected by chance, but the relatively low value suggests that the rules could be further optimized to increase their impact.

### Comparison to Previous Metrics:
- The current rules have a higher lift compared to previous iterations, indicating an improvement in the effectiveness of the rules in predicting high yields.
- The confidence level is moderate, suggesting that while the rules are somewhat reliable, there is potential to refine them for better accuracy.
- The support is lower, which might indicate that the rules are too specific or not capturing enough relevant cases.

### Recommendations for Improvement:
1. **Broaden Rule Conditions**: Consider expanding the conditions of the rules to capture a larger portion of the dataset, which could increase support and potentially improve confidence.

2. **Refine Specific Rules**: Focus on rules with lower confidence and lift to identify potential modifications or additional conditions that could enhance their predictive power.

3. **Analyze Low Yield Rules**: Investigate rules that predict low yields to ensure they are not overly restrictive or missing key factors that could improve their accuracy.

4. **Incorporate Additional Features**: Explore the inclusion of other chemical groups or structural features that might influence yield, potentially leading to new or improved rules.

5. **Iterative Testing**: Continue iterating on the rules, using cross-validation to ensure that improvements in metrics are consistent across different subsets of the data.

By addressing these areas, the rules can be refined to improve their overall performance, leading to more reliable predictions and better insights into the catalytic problem.

Traditional Commenter Message:
### Performance Evaluation of Current Rules

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
   - The current validation accuracy of 0.6286 is significantly lower than the previous reference accuracies, which were consistently around 0.76. This suggests that the current rules may not be as effective in capturing the underlying patterns in the data.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment:**
   - The drop in validation accuracy indicates potential underfitting, where the model is not capturing the complexity of the data. This could be due to the rules not being comprehensive or specific enough to account for the variations in the dataset.

3. **Discrepancies Analysis:**
   - For molecules where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low, Rule 1 and Rule 5 often have high positive SHAP values, indicating they might be contributing to overestimation.
   - Conversely, for molecules where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, Rule 1 consistently shows high negative SHAP values, suggesting it might be contributing to underestimation.

4. **Accuracy Improvements:**
   - The current accuracy metrics suggest that there is room for improvement. The significant drop in accuracy compared to previous iterations indicates that the current rules may not be capturing the necessary features effectively.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**
   - The SHAP analysis highlights that Rule 1 has a significant impact on both overestimations and underestimations. This suggests that Rule 1 might be too broad or not specific enough, leading to incorrect predictions.
   - Rule 5, while generally contributing positively, also shows instances where it might be overestimating the loading, indicating a need for refinement.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Rule 1:**
   - Given its significant impact on both overestimations and underestimations, Rule 1 should be refined to be more specific. Consider breaking it down into sub-rules that account for different types of carboxylic acid and aromatic ring interactions.

2. **Adjust Rule 5:**
   - Rule 5 should be evaluated for conditions where it might lead to overestimation. Consider adding additional conditions or constraints to better capture the scenarios where the sulfanyl group contributes to high loading.

3. **Improve Generalization:**
   - To address potential underfitting, consider expanding the feature set to include additional chemical properties or interactions that might be relevant. This could help the model capture more complex patterns in the data.

4. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - Use the insights from SHAP analysis to iteratively refine the rules. Focus on rules with high SHAP values for incorrect predictions and adjust them to better align with the experimental data.

5. **Incorporate Additional Data:**
   - If possible, incorporate additional data or features that might provide more context or information about the interactions between modifiers and catalysts. This could help improve the model's ability to generalize across different scenarios.

By implementing these recommendations, the rules can be refined to better capture the underlying patterns in the data, potentially improving both validation and test accuracies in future iterations.

### Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimization

1. **Current Rule Effectiveness**: The current rules show a moderate level of effectiveness with a train confidence of 0.6083 and a train lift of 1.2237, indicating some predictive power. However, the train support is low at 0.0486, suggesting that the rules apply to a small portion of the dataset.

2. **Performance Evaluation**: The validation accuracy of 0.6286 is significantly lower than previous accuracies, indicating potential underfitting. The SHAP analysis reveals that Rule 1 and Rule 5 have significant impacts on predictions, with Rule 1 contributing to both overestimations and underestimations.

3. **Rule Refinement Suggestions**:
   - **Rule 1**: Refine to be more specific by breaking it down into sub-rules that account for different interactions between carboxylic acids and aromatic rings.
   - **Rule 5**: Evaluate and adjust to prevent overestimation by adding constraints or conditions.
   - **Generalization**: Expand the feature set to include additional chemical properties or interactions to capture more complex patterns.

4. **Iterative Refinement**: Use SHAP insights to iteratively refine rules, focusing on those with high SHAP values for incorrect predictions.

5. **Additional Data**: Incorporate more data or features to provide additional context and improve generalization.

### Possibility for Further Optimization

There is potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. The current metrics suggest that the rules can be refined to improve their predictive power and generalization. By implementing the suggested refinements and incorporating additional data, the rules can be optimized to better capture the underlying patterns in the dataset.

    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. This is likely due to the ability of the carboxylic acid to coordinate with the metal center, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. Examples include 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid and 4-aminobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with an amino group (-NH2) and a linear aliphatic chain of 4 to 6 carbons tend to result in a high yield. The amino group can enhance coordination with the metal center, while the aliphatic chain may provide steric effects that favor the reaction. Examples include 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a hydroxyl group (-OH) and an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. The hydroxyl group can participate in hydrogen bonding, potentially stabilizing the catalyst structure. Examples include 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (-O-) tend to result in a low yield. The presence of ether linkages may lead to increased flexibility and decreased rigidity in the catalyst structure, which can negatively impact the reaction. Examples include 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing a sulfanyl group (-SH) tend to result in a high yield. The sulfanyl group can provide strong coordination with the metal center, enhancing the catalytic activity. Examples include 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a nitro group (-NO2) on an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group can stabilize the metal center, enhancing the reaction. An example is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the trifluoromethyl group may destabilize the metal center, reducing catalytic activity. An example is 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing an indole group tend to result in a high yield. The indole group can provide π-π interactions and additional coordination sites, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. An example is (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring tend to result in a high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing the catalytic activity. Examples include pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing a formyl group (-CHO) on an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield. The formyl group may introduce steric hindrance or electronic effects that destabilize the metal center. Examples include 4-formylbenzoic acid.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents (e.g., -OH, -NH2) tend to result in a high yield. The electron-donating groups enhance coordination with the metal center, stabilizing the catalyst. Examples include 4-aminobenzoic acid and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with an amino group (-NH2) and a linear aliphatic chain of 4 to 6 carbons, without additional electron-withdrawing groups, tend to result in a high yield. The amino group enhances coordination, while the aliphatic chain provides steric effects that favor the reaction. Examples include 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a hydroxyl group (-OH) and an aromatic ring with additional electron-donating groups tend to result in a high yield. The hydroxyl group participates in hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst structure. Examples include 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (-O-) and no additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The flexibility and decreased rigidity of the catalyst structure negatively impact the reaction. Examples include 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing a sulfanyl group (-SH) with a short aliphatic chain (up to 3 carbons) tend to result in a high yield. The sulfanyl group provides strong coordination with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a nitro group (-NO2) on an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group stabilizes the metal center, enhancing the reaction. An example is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the trifluoromethyl group destabilizes the metal center, reducing catalytic activity. An example is 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing an indole group tend to result in a high yield. The indole group provides π-π interactions and additional coordination sites, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. An example is (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring tend to result in a high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring coordinates with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing a formyl group (-CHO) on an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield. The formyl group introduces steric hindrance or electronic effects that destabilize the metal center. Examples include 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring and electron-withdrawing groups such as sulfonyl (-SO2-) or carbonyl (-C=O) groups tend to result in a low yield. These groups may destabilize the metal center. Examples include 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern `['[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]', '[c][OX2H]', '[c][NX3H2]']` does not fully capture the requirement of having both a carboxylic acid group and an aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents. Consider using a SMARTS pattern that specifically looks for a carboxylic acid group attached to an aromatic ring with electron-donating groups like `-OH` or `-NH2`.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: For Rule 2, the SMARTS pattern `['[NX3H2]', '[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]']` should be refined to ensure it captures a linear aliphatic chain of 4 to 6 carbons. The current pattern may not accurately represent the linearity or the specific chain length.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For Rule 3, the SMARTS pattern `['[OX2H]', '[c][OX2H]']` should be adjusted to ensure it captures the presence of a hydroxyl group on an aromatic ring with additional electron-donating groups. The current pattern may not fully capture the requirement of additional electron-donating groups.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: For Rule 4, the SMARTS pattern `['[OX2][C][OX2]']` should be revised to ensure it captures multiple ether linkages accurately. The current pattern may not fully represent the structural flexibility described in the rule.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: For Rule 5, the SMARTS pattern `['[SX2H]', '[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]']` should be refined to ensure it captures a sulfanyl group with a short aliphatic chain (up to 3 carbons). The current pattern may not accurately represent the chain length.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: For Rule 6, the SMARTS pattern `['[NX3+](=O)[O-]', '[c]']` should be adjusted to ensure it captures a nitro group on an aromatic ring. The current pattern may not fully represent the aromatic context.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: For Rule 7, the SMARTS pattern `['[CX4](F)(F)F']` should be checked to ensure it captures the trifluoromethyl group accurately. The current pattern seems correct, but ensure it is applied in the right context.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: For Rule 8, the SMARTS pattern `['c1c[nH]c2c1cccc2']` should be verified to ensure it captures the indole group accurately. The current pattern seems correct, but ensure it is applied in the right context.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: For Rule 9, the SMARTS pattern `['c1ccncc1']` should be verified to ensure it captures the pyridine ring accurately. The current pattern seems correct, but ensure it is applied in the right context.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: For Rule 10, the SMARTS pattern `['[CX3H]=O', '[c]']` should be refined to ensure it captures a formyl group on an aromatic ring. The current pattern may not fully represent the aromatic context.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: For Rule 11, the SMARTS pattern `['[c][SX4](=O)(=O)', '[c][CX3](=O)']` should be adjusted to ensure it captures an aromatic ring with sulfonyl or carbonyl groups accurately. The current pattern may not fully represent the structural context.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern should include both the carboxylic acid group and the aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents. The current pattern '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]' only captures the carboxylic acid group. Consider adding a pattern for electron-donating groups like '[c][OX2H]' or '[c][NX3H2]'.
- ** Suggestion 2 **: Rule 2's SMARTS pattern '[NX3H2]', '[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]' should ensure the aliphatic chain is linear and between 4 to 6 carbons. The current pattern may not accurately capture this. Consider using a more specific pattern for linear chains.
- ** Suggestion 3 **: Rule 3's SMARTS pattern '[OX2H]', '[c][OX2H]' should ensure the presence of additional electron-donating groups on the aromatic ring. The current pattern may not fully capture this requirement.
- ** Suggestion 4 **: Rule 4's SMARTS pattern '[OX2][C][OX2]' should ensure the presence of multiple ether linkages. The current pattern may not be specific enough to capture multiple ether linkages.
- ** Suggestion 5 **: Rule 5's SMARTS pattern '[SX2H]', '[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]' should ensure the aliphatic chain is short (up to 3 carbons). The current pattern may not accurately capture this.
- ** Suggestion 6 **: Rule 6's SMARTS pattern '[NX3+](=O)[O-]', '[c]' should ensure the nitro group is on an aromatic ring. The current pattern may not fully capture this requirement.
- ** Suggestion 7 **: Rule 7's SMARTS pattern '[CX4](F)(F)F' is correct for identifying trifluoromethyl groups.
- ** Suggestion 8 **: Rule 8's SMARTS pattern 'c1c[nH]c2c1cccc2' is correct for identifying indole groups.
- ** Suggestion 9 **: Rule 9's SMARTS pattern 'c1ccncc1' is correct for identifying pyridine rings.
- ** Suggestion 10 **: Rule 10's SMARTS pattern '[CX3H]=O', '[c]' should ensure the formyl group is on an aromatic ring. The current pattern may not fully capture this requirement.
- ** Suggestion 11 **: Rule 11's SMARTS pattern '[c][SX4](=O)(=O)', '[c][CX3](=O)' should ensure the presence of electron-withdrawing groups like sulfonyl or carbonyl on an aromatic ring. The current pattern may not fully capture this requirement.
- ** Suggestion 12 **: Consider adding more specific SMARTS patterns for each rule to ensure accurate matching of the structural descriptions provided in the natural language rules.
- ** Suggestion 13 **: Review the SMILES strings that resulted in 0s in the feature matrix to ensure that the rules are not being overly restrictive or missing key structural features.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing an indole group tend to result in a high yield. The indole group provides π-π interactions and additional coordination sites, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. An example is (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring tend to result in a high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring coordinates with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing a formyl group (-CHO) on an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield. The formyl group introduces steric hindrance or electronic effects that destabilize the metal center. Examples include 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring and electron-withdrawing groups such as sulfonyl (-SO2-) or carbonyl (-C=O) groups tend to result in a low yield. These groups may destabilize the metal center. Examples include 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern should include both the carboxylic acid group and an aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents. The current pattern '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]' only captures the carboxylic acid group. Consider adding a pattern for electron-donating groups like '-OH' or '-NH2' on an aromatic ring.
- ** Suggestion 2 **: Rule 2's SMARTS pattern '[NX3H2]', '[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]' does not accurately capture the requirement for a linear aliphatic chain of 4 to 6 carbons. Modify the pattern to ensure it captures a chain of the specified length.
- ** Suggestion 3 **: For Rule 3, the SMARTS pattern '[OX2H]', '[c][OX2H]' should ensure that the hydroxyl group is on an aromatic ring with additional electron-donating groups. Consider adding patterns for these additional groups.
- ** Suggestion 4 **: Rule 4's pattern '[OX2][C][OX2]' should be checked to ensure it captures multiple ether linkages correctly. Consider using a pattern that captures multiple occurrences of ether linkages.
- ** Suggestion 5 **: Rule 5's pattern '[SX2H]', '[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]' should ensure the sulfanyl group is attached to a short aliphatic chain. Verify the pattern captures chains up to 3 carbons.
- ** Suggestion 6 **: Rule 6's pattern '[NX3+](=O)[O-]', '[c]' should ensure the nitro group is on an aromatic ring. Verify the pattern captures this structure accurately.
- ** Suggestion 7 **: Rule 7's pattern '[CX4](F)(F)F' should be checked to ensure it captures the trifluoromethyl group correctly.
- ** Suggestion 8 **: Rule 8's pattern 'c1c[nH]c2c1cccc2' should be verified to ensure it captures the indole group accurately.
- ** Suggestion 9 **: Rule 9's pattern 'c1ccncc1' should be checked to ensure it captures the pyridine ring correctly.
- ** Suggestion 10 **: Rule 10's pattern '[CX3H]=O', '[c]' should ensure the formyl group is on an aromatic ring. Verify the pattern captures this structure accurately.
- ** Suggestion 11 **: Rule 11's pattern '[c][SX4](=O)(=O)', '[c][CX3](=O)' should ensure the presence of sulfonyl or carbonyl groups on an aromatic ring. Verify the pattern captures these structures accurately.
- ** Suggestion 12 **: Consider adding more specific SMARTS patterns for each rule to reduce the number of 0s in the feature matrix, ensuring that the rules are applied more accurately to the SMILES strings.

Metric Commenter Message:
Based on the current metrics, we can observe the following:

1. **Train Support**: The current train support is 0.025974, which is lower than the previous iteration's train support of 0.048571. This indicates that the current rules apply to a smaller portion of the dataset compared to the previous iteration. While support is not the primary focus, it is important to ensure that the rules are applicable to a reasonable portion of the data.

2. **Train Confidence**: The current train confidence is 0.568182, which is slightly lower than the previous iteration's confidence of 0.608333. Confidence measures the reliability of the rule when the condition is met. A decrease in confidence suggests that the rules are slightly less reliable in predicting the outcome compared to the previous iteration.

3. **Train Lift**: The current train lift is 1.138295, which is lower than the previous iteration's lift of 1.223693. Lift is a crucial metric as it indicates the strength of the rule in comparison to random chance. A lift greater than 1 suggests that the rule is useful, but the decrease in lift indicates that the current rules are less impactful than before.

4. **Train Leverage**: The current train leverage is 0.002894, which is lower than the previous iteration's leverage of 0.009306. Leverage measures the additional support the rule receives over what would be expected by chance. The decrease in leverage suggests that the current rules provide less additional information than the previous iteration.

### Recommendations for Improvement:

- **Refine Rule Conditions**: Consider revisiting the conditions of the rules to ensure they capture the most relevant features that contribute to high yield. This might involve exploring combinations of functional groups or structural features that have not been considered yet.

- **Increase Rule Applicability**: Aim to increase the support of the rules by identifying conditions that apply to a larger portion of the dataset without compromising confidence and lift. This could involve generalizing some rules or combining similar rules to cover more cases.

- **Focus on High Lift**: Prioritize rules that have a higher lift, as they provide more significant insights into the relationship between conditions and outcomes. This might involve discarding or modifying rules with a lift close to 1.

- **Iterate and Validate**: Continue iterating on the rules, using cross-validation to ensure that improvements in metrics are consistent across different subsets of the data. This will help avoid overfitting and ensure that the rules are robust.

Overall, the current iteration shows a decline in key metrics such as confidence, lift, and leverage, suggesting that the rules may need further refinement to enhance their predictive power and applicability.

Traditional Commenter Message:
### Performance Evaluation of Current Rules

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
   - The current rules appear to be less effective in predicting the loading of modifiers on catalysts accurately. The validation accuracy has decreased from previous iterations (0.76) to 0.542857, indicating a potential issue with the current rule set or model configuration.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment:**
   - The significant drop in validation accuracy suggests potential underfitting. The model may not be capturing the underlying patterns in the data effectively, possibly due to overly generalized rules or insufficient complexity in the model.

3. **Discrepancies Analysis:**
   - For molecules where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low, rules with high positive SHAP values (e.g., Rule 2, Rule 3, Rule 7) may be contributing to overestimation. Conversely, for molecules where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, rules with high negative SHAP values (e.g., Rule 2, Rule 7, Rule 9) may be contributing to underestimation.

4. **Accuracy Improvements:**
   - The decrease in accuracy metrics suggests that the current rules are not improving the model's performance. This indicates a need for revisiting and refining the rules to better capture the nuances of the data.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**
   - SHAP analysis highlights specific rules that may be contributing to incorrect predictions. For instance, Rule 2 and Rule 3 often have high positive SHAP values for overestimated loadings, suggesting they may need refinement. Similarly, Rule 7 and Rule 9 have high negative SHAP values for underestimated loadings, indicating potential areas for adjustment.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Overestimated Loading Rules:**
   - **Rule 2 and Rule 3:** Consider revising these rules to account for additional factors that may influence loading, such as steric hindrance or specific electronic effects not currently captured.

2. **Adjust Underestimated Loading Rules:**
   - **Rule 7 and Rule 9:** These rules may need to incorporate additional structural or electronic considerations that could lead to higher loading predictions. For example, exploring the impact of substituents on the aromatic ring or the presence of additional coordination sites.

3. **Improve Generalization:**
   - Introduce more nuanced rules that capture the diversity of molecular structures and their interactions with catalysts. This could involve incorporating machine learning techniques to identify patterns not evident through rule-based approaches alone.

4. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - Use insights from SHAP analysis to iteratively test and refine rules. This could involve creating new rules based on observed patterns in SHAP values or modifying existing rules to better align with experimental data.

5. **Incorporate Additional Features:**
   - Consider expanding the feature matrix to include more detailed molecular descriptors or environmental factors that could influence catalyst loading. This could help improve the model's ability to generalize across different datasets.

By addressing these areas, the model's performance can be improved, leading to more accurate predictions and a better understanding of the factors influencing catalyst loading.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents (e.g., -OH, -NH2) tend to result in a high yield. The electron-donating groups enhance coordination with the metal center, stabilizing the catalyst. Examples include 4-aminobenzoic acid and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with an amino group (-NH2) and a linear aliphatic chain of 4 to 6 carbons, without additional electron-withdrawing groups, tend to result in a high yield. The amino group enhances coordination, while the aliphatic chain provides steric effects that favor the reaction. Examples include 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a hydroxyl group (-OH) and an aromatic ring with additional electron-donating groups tend to result in a high yield. The hydroxyl group participates in hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst structure. Examples include 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (-O-) and no additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The flexibility and decreased rigidity of the catalyst structure negatively impact the reaction. Examples include 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing a sulfanyl group (-SH) with a short aliphatic chain (up to 3 carbons) tend to result in a high yield. The sulfanyl group provides strong coordination with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a nitro group (-NO2) on an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group stabilizes the metal center, enhancing the reaction. An example is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the trifluoromethyl group destabilizes the metal center, reducing catalytic activity. An example is 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing an indole group tend to result in a high yield. The indole group provides π-π interactions and additional coordination sites, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. An example is (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring tend to result in a high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring coordinates with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing a formyl group (-CHO) on an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield. The formyl group introduces steric hindrance or electronic effects that destabilize the metal center. Examples include 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring and electron-withdrawing groups such as sulfonyl (-SO2-) or carbonyl (-C=O) groups tend to result in a low yield. These groups may destabilize the metal center. Examples include 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a branched aliphatic chain containing an amino group (-NH2) tend to result in a low yield. The branching may introduce steric hindrance that affects coordination with the metal center. An example is (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with electron-withdrawing substituents tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature reduces the electron density on the nitrogen, affecting coordination. An example is 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbons) and no additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The long chain may introduce steric hindrance and reduce effective coordination. An example is octanoic acid.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents (e.g., -OH, -NH2) tend to result in a high yield. The electron-donating groups enhance coordination with the metal center, stabilizing the catalyst. Examples include 4-aminobenzoic acid and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with an amino group (-NH2) and a linear aliphatic chain of 4 to 6 carbons, without additional electron-withdrawing groups, tend to result in a high yield. The amino group enhances coordination, while the aliphatic chain provides steric effects that favor the reaction. Examples include 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a hydroxyl group (-OH) and an aromatic ring with additional electron-donating groups tend to result in a high yield. The hydroxyl group participates in hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst structure. Examples include 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern `['[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]', '[c][OX2H]', '[c][NX3;H2,H1][c]']` does not fully capture the requirement of having both a carboxylic acid group and an aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents. Consider using a SMARTS pattern that explicitly checks for both a carboxylic acid group and an aromatic ring with electron-donating groups like -OH or -NH2.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Rule 2's SMARTS pattern `['[NX3;H2]', '[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]']` should be revised to ensure it captures a linear aliphatic chain of 4 to 6 carbons. The current pattern may not accurately reflect the linearity and specific length of the aliphatic chain.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For Rule 3, the SMARTS pattern `['[OX2H]', '[c][OX2H]']` should be adjusted to ensure it captures the presence of a hydroxyl group on an aromatic ring with additional electron-donating groups. The current pattern may not fully capture the requirement for additional electron-donating groups.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Rule 4's SMARTS pattern `['[OX2][C;!R][OX2]']` should be revised to ensure it captures multiple ether linkages without additional functional groups. The current pattern may not fully capture the absence of other functional groups.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: For Rule 5, the SMARTS pattern `['[SX2H]', '[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]']` should be adjusted to ensure it captures a sulfanyl group with a short aliphatic chain (up to 3 carbons). The current pattern may not accurately reflect the specific length of the aliphatic chain.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Rule 6's SMARTS pattern `['[c][NX3+](=O)[O-]']` should be revised to ensure it captures a nitro group on an aromatic ring. The current pattern may not fully capture the presence of the nitro group.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: For Rule 7, the SMARTS pattern `['[CX4](F)(F)F']` should be adjusted to ensure it captures a trifluoromethyl group. The current pattern may not fully capture the presence of the trifluoromethyl group.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Rule 8's SMARTS pattern `['[c]1[nH]c2c(c1)cccc2']` should be revised to ensure it captures an indole group. The current pattern may not fully capture the presence of the indole group.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: For Rule 9, the SMARTS pattern `['[n]1ccccc1']` should be adjusted to ensure it captures a pyridine ring. The current pattern may not fully capture the presence of the pyridine ring.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Rule 10's SMARTS pattern `['[c][CX3H]=O']` should be revised to ensure it captures a formyl group on an aromatic ring. The current pattern may not fully capture the presence of the formyl group.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: For Rule 11, the SMARTS pattern `['[c][SX4](=O)(=O)[#6]']` should be adjusted to ensure it captures an aromatic ring with electron-withdrawing groups such as sulfonyl or carbonyl groups. The current pattern may not fully capture the presence of these groups.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: Rule 12's SMARTS pattern `['[c][OX2][C;!R]']` should be revised to ensure it captures an aromatic ring with electron-donating groups such as methoxy or ethoxy. The current pattern may not fully capture the presence of these groups.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: For Rule 13, the SMARTS pattern `['[NX3;H2][C;X4][C;X4]']` should be adjusted to ensure it captures a branched aliphatic chain containing an amino group. The current pattern may not fully capture the presence of branching.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: Rule 14's SMARTS pattern `['[n]1ccccc1[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]']` should be revised to ensure it captures a pyridine ring with electron-withdrawing substituents. The current pattern may not fully capture the presence of these substituents.

- ** Suggestion 15 **: For Rule 15, the SMARTS pattern `['[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]']` should be adjusted to ensure it captures a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbons) with no additional functional groups. The current pattern may not fully capture the absence of other functional groups.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (-O-) and no additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The flexibility and decreased rigidity of the catalyst structure negatively impact the reaction. Examples include 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing a sulfanyl group (-SH) with a short aliphatic chain (up to 3 carbons) tend to result in a high yield. The sulfanyl group provides strong coordination with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a nitro group (-NO2) on an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group stabilizes the metal center, enhancing the reaction. An example is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the trifluoromethyl group destabilizes the metal center, reducing catalytic activity. An example is 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing an indole group tend to result in a high yield. The indole group provides π-π interactions and additional coordination sites, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. An example is (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring tend to result in a high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring coordinates with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing a formyl group (-CHO) on an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield. The formyl group introduces steric hindrance or electronic effects that destabilize the metal center. Examples include 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring and electron-withdrawing groups such as sulfonyl (-SO2-) or carbonyl (-C=O) groups tend to result in a low yield. These groups may destabilize the metal center. Examples include 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring and electron-donating groups such as methoxy (-OCH3) or ethoxy (-OC2H5) tend to result in a high yield. These groups enhance the electron density on the aromatic ring, stabilizing the metal center. An example is 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a branched aliphatic chain containing an amino group (-NH2) tend to result in a low yield. The branching may introduce steric hindrance that affects coordination with the metal center. An example is (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with electron-withdrawing substituents tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature reduces the electron density on the nitrogen, affecting coordination. An example is 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbons) and no additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The long chain may introduce steric hindrance and reduce effective coordination. An example is octanoic acid.

** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern `['[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]', '[c][OX2H]', '[c][NX3;H2,H1][c]']` does not fully capture the requirement of having both a carboxylic acid group and an aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents. Consider using a SMARTS pattern that explicitly checks for an aromatic ring with electron-donating groups like `-OH` or `-NH2` in conjunction with a carboxylic acid group.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Rule 2's SMARTS pattern `['[NX3;H2]', '[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]']` should be revised to ensure it captures a linear aliphatic chain of 4 to 6 carbons. The current pattern may not accurately reflect the linearity or the specific chain length.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For Rule 3, the SMARTS `['[OX2H]', '[c][OX2H]']` should be expanded to ensure it captures additional electron-donating groups on the aromatic ring, not just the presence of a hydroxyl group.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Rule 4's SMARTS `['[OX2][C;!R][OX2]']` should be checked to ensure it captures multiple ether linkages and the absence of additional functional groups. The current pattern may not fully reflect the rule's intent.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: Rule 5's SMARTS `['[SX2H]', '[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]']` should be revised to ensure it captures a short aliphatic chain (up to 3 carbons) with a sulfanyl group. The current pattern may not accurately reflect the chain length.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: For Rule 6, the SMARTS `['[c][NX3+](=O)[O-]']` should be checked to ensure it captures a nitro group on an aromatic ring. The current pattern may not fully reflect the rule's intent.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: Rule 7's SMARTS `['[CX4](F)(F)F']` should be checked to ensure it captures the presence of a trifluoromethyl group. The current pattern seems correct, but ensure it is applied correctly in the context of the rule.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: For Rule 8, the SMARTS `['[c]1[nH]c2c(c1)cccc2']` should be checked to ensure it captures the presence of an indole group. The current pattern seems correct, but ensure it is applied correctly in the context of the rule.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: Rule 9's SMARTS `['[n]1ccccc1']` should be checked to ensure it captures the presence of a pyridine ring. The current pattern seems correct, but ensure it is applied correctly in the context of the rule.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: For Rule 10, the SMARTS `['[c][CX3H]=O']` should be checked to ensure it captures a formyl group on an aromatic ring. The current pattern may not fully reflect the rule's intent.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: Rule 11's SMARTS `['[c][SX4](=O)(=O)[#6]']` should be checked to ensure it captures electron-withdrawing groups such as sulfonyl or carbonyl groups on an aromatic ring. The current pattern may not fully reflect the rule's intent.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: For Rule 12, the SMARTS `['[c][OX2][C;!R]']` should be checked to ensure it captures electron-donating groups such as methoxy or ethoxy on an aromatic ring. The current pattern may not fully reflect the rule's intent.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: Rule 13's SMARTS `['[NX3;H2][C;X4][C;X4]']` should be revised to ensure it captures a branched aliphatic chain containing an amino group. The current pattern may not accurately reflect the branching.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: For Rule 14, the SMARTS `['[n]1ccccc1[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]']` should be checked to ensure it captures a pyridine ring with electron-withdrawing substituents. The current pattern may not fully reflect the rule's intent.

- ** Suggestion 15 **: Rule 15's SMARTS `['[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]']` should be revised to ensure it captures a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbons) with no additional functional groups. The current pattern may not accurately reflect the chain length.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents (e.g., -OH, -NH2) tend to result in a high yield. The electron-donating groups enhance coordination with the metal center, stabilizing the catalyst. Examples include 4-aminobenzoic acid and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with an amino group (-NH2) and a linear aliphatic chain of 4 to 6 carbons, without additional electron-withdrawing groups, tend to result in a high yield. The amino group enhances coordination, while the aliphatic chain provides steric effects that favor the reaction. Examples include 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a hydroxyl group (-OH) and an aromatic ring with additional electron-donating groups tend to result in a high yield. The hydroxyl group participates in hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst structure. Examples include 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (-O-) and no additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The flexibility and decreased rigidity of the catalyst structure negatively impact the reaction. Examples include 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing a sulfanyl group (-SH) with a short aliphatic chain (up to 3 carbons) tend to result in a high yield. The sulfanyl group provides strong coordination with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a nitro group (-NO2) on an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group stabilizes the metal center, enhancing the reaction. An example is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the trifluoromethyl group destabilizes the metal center, reducing catalytic activity. An example is 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing an indole group tend to result in a high yield. The indole group provides π-π interactions and additional coordination sites, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. An example is (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring tend to result in a high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring coordinates with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing a formyl group (-CHO) on an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield. The formyl group introduces steric hindrance or electronic effects that destabilize the metal center. Examples include 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring and electron-withdrawing groups such as sulfonyl (-SO2-) or carbonyl (-C=O) groups tend to result in a low yield. These groups may destabilize the metal center. Examples include 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring and electron-donating groups such as methoxy (-OCH3) or ethoxy (-OC2H5) tend to result in a high yield. These groups enhance the electron density on the aromatic ring, stabilizing the metal center. An example is 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a branched aliphatic chain containing an amino group (-NH2) tend to result in a low yield. The branching may introduce steric hindrance that affects coordination with the metal center. An example is (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with electron-withdrawing substituents tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature reduces the electron density on the nitrogen, affecting coordination. An example is 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbons) and no additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The long chain may introduce steric hindrance and reduce effective coordination. An example is octanoic acid.

** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern should include both a carboxylic acid group and an aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents.

Metric Commenter Message:
Based on the current metrics and comparing them to the previous reference metrics, here are some observations and comments on the performance of the current rules:

1. **Train Support**: The current train support is 0.0343, which is lower than the previous reference metrics (0.0486 and 0.0259). This indicates that the current rules apply to a smaller portion of the dataset. While this might suggest more specific rules, it could also mean that the rules are not capturing as many relevant instances as before.

2. **Train Confidence**: The current train confidence is 0.5944, which is slightly lower than the first reference metric (0.6083) but higher than the second (0.5682). This suggests that the rules are moderately reliable in predicting the outcome when the conditions are met. However, there is room for improvement to increase the confidence level further.

3. **Train Lift**: The current train lift is 1.1899, which is slightly lower than the first reference metric (1.2237) but higher than the second (1.1383). A lift greater than 1 indicates that the rules are providing useful information beyond random chance. However, the lift is not significantly high, suggesting that the rules could be refined to better capture the underlying patterns that lead to high yields.

4. **Train Leverage**: The current train leverage is 0.0057, which is lower than the first reference metric (0.0093) but higher than the second (0.0029). Positive leverage indicates that the rules are identifying associations that are stronger than what would be expected by chance. However, the relatively low leverage suggests that the rules might not be capturing strong associations.

### Recommendations for Improvement:

- **Refine Rule Conditions**: Consider revisiting the conditions of the rules to ensure they are capturing the most relevant features that contribute to high yields. This might involve adding or removing certain functional groups or structural features based on domain knowledge or further data analysis.

- **Increase Specificity**: While maintaining a balance with support, increasing the specificity of the rules could help improve confidence and lift. This might involve focusing on more specific combinations of functional groups or structural motifs that are known to enhance catalytic activity.

- **Explore Additional Features**: Investigate other potential features or modifiers that could be included in the rules. This could involve exploring different chemical properties or interactions that have not been considered yet.

- **Iterative Testing and Validation**: Continue iterating on the rules and validate them against new data or through experimental testing to ensure they generalize well and provide meaningful insights.

Overall, while the current rules show some promise, there is potential for further refinement to improve their predictive power and applicability.

Traditional Commenter Message:
### Performance Evaluation of Current Rules

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
   - The current rules seem to be struggling with effectiveness, as indicated by the declining validation accuracy from 0.76 in previous iterations to 0.514 in the current iteration. This suggests that the rules may not be capturing the underlying patterns in the data effectively.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting:**
   - The consistent decrease in validation accuracy suggests potential overfitting, where the model might be too tailored to the training data and not generalizing well to new data. The addition of new rules (e.g., Rule 12, Rule 13, Rule 15) might have introduced complexity that the model cannot handle effectively.

3. **Discrepancies Analysis:**
   - For molecules where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low, rules with high positive SHAP values (e.g., Rule 13 for C(CCCC(=O)O)CCCN) might be problematic.
   - Conversely, for molecules where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, rules with high negative SHAP values (e.g., Rule 13 for C([C@@H](C(=O)O)N)C(=O)O) might need adjustment.

4. **Accuracy Improvements:**
   - The decline in accuracy metrics suggests that the current rules are not improving the model's performance. The probability of improvement seems low without significant changes to the rules.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**
   - SHAP analysis indicates that certain rules (e.g., Rule 13 and Rule 15) are contributing to incorrect predictions. These rules might need refinement to better capture the relationship between molecular features and catalyst loading.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Rules with High Positive SHAP Values:**
   - Rules like Rule 13, which have high positive SHAP values for overestimated loadings, should be revisited. Consider whether the conditions in these rules are too broad or if they need additional constraints to prevent overestimation.

2. **Adjust Rules with High Negative SHAP Values:**
   - Rules with high negative SHAP values, such as Rule 13 for underestimated loadings, should be adjusted to better capture the conditions that lead to high experimental values. This might involve relaxing some constraints or adding new conditions that account for overlooked features.

3. **Improve Generalization:**
   - Simplify the rules to reduce complexity and improve generalization. This could involve merging similar rules or removing redundant conditions that do not contribute significantly to the model's performance.

4. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - Use insights from SHAP analysis to iteratively refine the rules. Focus on rules that consistently show high SHAP values (positive or negative) and assess whether they align with the chemical intuition and experimental data.

5. **Evaluate Rule Effectiveness:**
   - Continuously evaluate the effectiveness of the rules by monitoring changes in validation accuracy and SHAP values. This will help identify which rules are contributing positively and which need further refinement.

By addressing these areas, the rules can be improved to better capture the relationship between molecular features and catalyst loading, ultimately enhancing the model's predictive performance.

### Summary of Discussions

1. **Current Rule Performance:**
   - The current rules show moderate effectiveness, with a train confidence of 0.5944 and a train lift of 1.1899. However, the validation accuracy has decreased to 0.514, indicating potential overfitting and a lack of generalization to new data.

2. **SHAP Analysis Insights:**
   - Certain rules, such as Rule 13 and Rule 15, have high SHAP values, indicating they may be contributing to incorrect predictions. These rules might need refinement to better capture the relationship between molecular features and catalyst loading.

3. **Rule Specificity and Coverage:**
   - The current rules have low train support, suggesting they apply to a smaller portion of the dataset. This could mean the rules are too specific or not capturing enough relevant instances.

4. **Potential Overfitting:**
   - The decline in validation accuracy suggests potential overfitting, where the model is too tailored to the training data and not generalizing well to new data.

### Directions to Optimize Current Rules

1. **Refine Rule Conditions:**
   - Revisit the conditions of the rules to ensure they capture the most relevant features that contribute to high yields. This might involve adding or removing certain functional groups or structural features based on domain knowledge or further data analysis.

2. **Increase Specificity:**
   - While maintaining a balance with support, increase the specificity of the rules to improve confidence and lift. Focus on more specific combinations of functional groups or structural motifs that are known to enhance catalytic activity.

3. **Explore Additional Features:**
   - Investigate other potential features or modifiers that could be included in the rules. This could involve exploring different chemical properties or interactions that have not been considered yet.

4. **Iterative Testing and Validation:**
   - Continue iterating on the rules and validate them against new data or through experimental testing to ensure they generalize well and provide meaningful insights.

5. **Simplify Rules:**
   - Simplify the rules to reduce complexity and improve generalization. This could involve merging similar rules or removing redundant conditions that do not contribute significantly to the model's performance.

### Possibility for Further Optimization

There is potential for further optimization of the current rules. The current metrics and SHAP analysis suggest that the rules can be refined to better capture the underlying patterns that lead to high yields without overfitting. By addressing the areas mentioned above, the rules can be improved to enhance the model's predictive performance.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents (e.g., -OH, -NH2) tend to result in a high yield. The electron-donating groups enhance coordination with the metal center, stabilizing the catalyst. Examples include 4-aminobenzoic acid and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with an amino group (-NH2) and a linear aliphatic chain of 4 to 6 carbons, without additional electron-withdrawing groups, tend to result in a high yield. The amino group enhances coordination, while the aliphatic chain provides steric effects that favor the reaction. Examples include 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a hydroxyl group (-OH) and an aromatic ring with additional electron-donating groups tend to result in a high yield. The hydroxyl group participates in hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst structure. Examples include 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (-O-) and no additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The flexibility and decreased rigidity of the catalyst structure negatively impact the reaction. Examples include 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing a sulfanyl group (-SH) with a short aliphatic chain (up to 3 carbons) tend to result in a high yield. The sulfanyl group provides strong coordination with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a nitro group (-NO2) on an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group stabilizes the metal center, enhancing the reaction. An example is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the trifluoromethyl group destabilizes the metal center, reducing catalytic activity. An example is 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing an indole group tend to result in a high yield. The indole group provides π-π interactions and additional coordination sites, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. An example is (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring tend to result in a high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring coordinates with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing a formyl group (-CHO) on an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield. The formyl group introduces steric hindrance or electronic effects that destabilize the metal center. Examples include 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring and electron-withdrawing groups such as sulfonyl (-SO2-) or carbonyl (-C=O) groups tend to result in a low yield. These groups may destabilize the metal center. Examples include 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring and electron-donating groups such as methoxy (-OCH3) or ethoxy (-OC2H5) tend to result in a high yield. These groups enhance the electron density on the aromatic ring, stabilizing the metal center. An example is 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a branched aliphatic chain containing an amino group (-NH2) tend to result in a low yield. The branching may introduce steric hindrance that affects coordination with the metal center. An example is (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with electron-withdrawing substituents tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature reduces the electron density on the nitrogen, affecting coordination. An example is 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbons) and no additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The long chain may introduce steric hindrance and reduce effective coordination. An example is octanoic acid.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: Refine Rule 13 and Rule 15 by analyzing the specific molecular features that lead to high SHAP values. Consider revising the conditions to better align with the dataset's successful examples, possibly by incorporating additional functional groups or structural motifs that are more predictive of high yield.

- **Advice 2**: Increase the specificity of the rules by focusing on combinations of functional groups that have shown consistent high yields in the dataset. For instance, explore the impact of different electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups in conjunction with aromatic rings or aliphatic chains.

- **Advice 3**: Simplify the rules by merging similar rules or removing redundant conditions. This can help reduce complexity and improve the model's ability to generalize. For example, if multiple rules describe similar functional group effects, consider consolidating them into a single, more comprehensive rule.

- **Advice 4**: Explore additional features that could be included in the rules, such as steric effects, electronic properties, or specific interactions with the metal center. This could involve a deeper analysis of the dataset to identify underrepresented but potentially impactful features.

- **Advice 5**: Conduct iterative testing and validation of the revised rules against new data. This will help ensure that the rules are not only fitting the training data but also generalizing well to unseen examples, thereby improving validation accuracy.

- **Advice 6**: Consider using domain knowledge to guide the refinement of rules, particularly in understanding the chemical interactions that lead to high yields. Collaborate with chemists to identify potential molecular features that may not be immediately obvious from the dataset alone.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: Consider incorporating quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to refine the rules. This approach can help identify subtle patterns and interactions between functional groups and their impact on yield, providing a more nuanced understanding than qualitative rules alone.

- **Advice 2**: Expand the dataset to include more diverse examples of modifiers, especially those that do not fit neatly into the current rules. This will help identify any gaps in the rules and ensure they are comprehensive and applicable to a wider range of compounds.

- **Advice 3**: Introduce a weighting system for functional groups based on their observed impact on yield. This can help prioritize certain groups over others when multiple functional groups are present, providing a more accurate prediction of yield.

- **Advice 4**: Implement machine learning techniques to analyze the dataset and generate rules. These techniques can uncover complex interactions and dependencies that may not be immediately apparent through manual rule generation.

- **Advice 5**: Regularly update the rules based on new experimental data. As more reactions are conducted and more data becomes available, the rules should be revised to reflect the latest findings and ensure they remain relevant and accurate.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern `['[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]', '[c][OX2H]', '[c][NX3H2]']` should be revised. The current pattern does not accurately capture the presence of a carboxylic acid group and an aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents. Consider using a pattern that specifically identifies the carboxylic acid group `-COOH` and checks for electron-donating groups like `-OH` or `-NH2` on an aromatic ring.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Rule 2's SMARTS pattern `['[NX3H2]', '[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]']` should be adjusted to ensure it captures a linear aliphatic chain of 4 to 6 carbons. The current pattern may not accurately identify the length of the aliphatic chain. Consider using a pattern that specifies the exact number of carbon atoms in the chain.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For Rule 3, the SMARTS pattern `['[OX2H]', '[c][OX2H]']` should be revised to ensure it captures the presence of a hydroxyl group and additional electron-donating groups on an aromatic ring. The current pattern may not fully capture the required structural features.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Rule 4's SMARTS pattern `['[OX2][C;X4][OX2]']` should be checked to ensure it accurately identifies multiple ether linkages. The pattern should be able to detect multiple occurrences of ether linkages in the structure.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: For Rule 5, the SMARTS pattern `['[SX2H]', '[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]']` should be revised to ensure it captures a sulfanyl group with a short aliphatic chain. The current pattern may not accurately identify the length of the aliphatic chain.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Rule 6's SMARTS pattern `['[NX3+](=O)[O-]', '[c]']` should be checked to ensure it accurately identifies a nitro group on an aromatic ring. The pattern should specifically look for the nitro group `-NO2` attached to an aromatic ring.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: For Rule 7, the SMARTS pattern `['[CX4](F)(F)F']` should be checked to ensure it accurately identifies a trifluoromethyl group. The pattern should specifically look for the `-CF3` group.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Rule 8's SMARTS pattern `['[c]1[nH]c2c(c1)cccc2']` should be checked to ensure it accurately identifies an indole group. The pattern should specifically look for the indole structure.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: For Rule 9, the SMARTS pattern `['[n]1ccccc1']` should be checked to ensure it accurately identifies a pyridine ring. The pattern should specifically look for the pyridine structure.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Rule 10's SMARTS pattern `['[CX3H]=O', '[c]']` should be revised to ensure it captures a formyl group on an aromatic ring. The pattern should specifically look for the `-CHO` group attached to an aromatic ring.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: For Rule 11, the SMARTS pattern `['[c][SX4](=O)(=O)']` should be revised to ensure it captures an aromatic ring with electron-withdrawing groups such as sulfonyl or carbonyl groups. The pattern should specifically look for these groups attached to an aromatic ring.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: Rule 12's SMARTS pattern `['[c][OX2][C;X4][OX2]']` should be revised to ensure it captures an aromatic ring with electron-donating groups such as methoxy or ethoxy groups. The pattern should specifically look for these groups attached to an aromatic ring.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: For Rule 13, the SMARTS pattern `['[NX3H2]', '[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]']` should be revised to ensure it captures a branched aliphatic chain with an amino group. The current pattern may not accurately identify the branching in the aliphatic chain.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents (e.g., -OH, -NH2) tend to result in a high yield. These groups enhance coordination with the metal center, stabilizing the catalyst. Examples include 4-aminobenzoic acid and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with an amino group (-NH2) and a linear aliphatic chain of 4 to 6 carbons, without additional electron-withdrawing groups, tend to result in a high yield. The amino group enhances coordination, while the aliphatic chain provides steric effects that favor the reaction. Examples include 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a hydroxyl group (-OH) and an aromatic ring with additional electron-donating groups tend to result in a high yield. The hydroxyl group participates in hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst structure. Examples include 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (-O-) and no additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The flexibility and decreased rigidity of the catalyst structure negatively impact the reaction. Examples include 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing a sulfanyl group (-SH) with a short aliphatic chain (up to 3 carbons) tend to result in a high yield. The sulfanyl group provides strong coordination with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a nitro group (-NO2) on an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group stabilizes the metal center, enhancing the reaction. An example is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the trifluoromethyl group destabilizes the metal center, reducing catalytic activity. An example is 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing an indole group tend to result in a high yield. The indole group provides π-π interactions and additional coordination sites, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. An example is (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring tend to result in a high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring coordinates with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing a formyl group (-CHO) on an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield. The formyl group introduces steric hindrance or electronic effects that destabilize the metal center. Examples include 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring and electron-withdrawing groups such as sulfonyl (-SO2-) or carbonyl (-C=O) groups tend to result in a low yield. These groups may destabilize the metal center. Examples include 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring and electron-donating groups such as methoxy (-OCH3) or ethoxy (-OC2H5) tend to result in a high yield. These groups enhance the electron density on the aromatic ring, stabilizing the metal center. An example is 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a branched aliphatic chain containing an amino group (-NH2) tend to result in a low yield. The branching may introduce steric hindrance that affects coordination with the metal center. An example is (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with electron-withdrawing substituents tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature reduces the electron density on the nitrogen, affecting coordination. An example is 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbons) and no additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The long chain may introduce steric hindrance and reduce effective coordination. An example is octanoic acid.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents (e.g., -OH, -NH2) tend to result in a high yield. These groups enhance coordination with the metal center, stabilizing the catalyst. Examples include 4-aminobenzoic acid and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with an amino group (-NH2) and a linear aliphatic chain of 4 to 6 carbons, without additional electron-withdrawing groups, tend to result in a high yield. The amino group enhances coordination, while the aliphatic chain provides steric effects that favor the reaction. Examples include 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a hydroxyl group (-OH) and an aromatic ring with additional electron-donating groups tend to result in a high yield. The hydroxyl group participates in hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst structure. Examples include 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (-O-) and no additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The flexibility and decreased rigidity of the catalyst structure negatively impact the reaction. Examples include 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing a sulfanyl group (-SH) with a short aliphatic chain (up to 3 carbons) tend to result in a high yield. The sulfanyl group provides strong coordination with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a nitro group (-NO2) on an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group stabilizes the metal center, enhancing the reaction. An example is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the trifluoromethyl group destabilizes the metal center, reducing catalytic activity. An example is 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing an indole group tend to result in a high yield. The indole group provides π-π interactions and additional coordination sites, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. An example is (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring tend to result in a high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring coordinates with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing a formyl group (-CHO) on an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield. The formyl group introduces steric hindrance or electronic effects that destabilize the metal center. Examples include 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring and electron-withdrawing groups such as sulfonyl (-SO2-) or carbonyl (-C=O) groups tend to result in a low yield. These groups may destabilize the metal center. Examples include 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring and electron-donating groups such as methoxy (-OCH3) or ethoxy (-OC2H5) tend to result in a high yield. These groups enhance the electron density on the aromatic ring, stabilizing the metal center. An example is 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a branched aliphatic chain containing an amino group (-NH2) tend to result in a low yield. The branching may introduce steric hindrance that affects coordination with the metal center. An example is (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with electron-withdrawing substituents tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature reduces the electron density on the nitrogen, affecting coordination. An example is 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbons) and no additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The long chain may introduce steric hindrance and reduce effective coordination. An example is octanoic acid.

** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern `['[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]', '[c][OH]', '[c][NH2]']` should be revised. The pattern should ensure the presence of both a carboxylic acid group and an aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents. Consider using a pattern that captures the aromatic ring and the specific electron-donating groups more accurately.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: For Rule 2, the SMARTS pattern `['[NX3H2]', '[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]']` should be improved. The pattern should ensure the presence of an amino group and a linear aliphatic chain of 4 to 6 carbons. The current pattern may not accurately capture the linearity and length of the aliphatic chain.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For Rule 3, the SMARTS pattern `['[OX2H]', '[c][OH]', '[c][NH2]']` should be revised. The pattern should ensure the presence of a hydroxyl group and an aromatic ring with additional electron-donating groups. The current pattern may not accurately capture the specific electron-donating groups.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: For Rule 4, the SMARTS pattern `['[OX2][C;X4][OX2]', '[OX2][C;X4][OX2]']` should be improved. The pattern should ensure the presence of multiple ether linkages without additional functional groups. The current pattern may not accurately capture the absence of other functional groups.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: For Rule 5, the SMARTS pattern `['[SX2H]', '[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]']` should be revised. The pattern should ensure the presence of a sulfanyl group with a short aliphatic chain (up to 3 carbons). The current pattern may not accurately capture the length of the aliphatic chain.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: For Rule 6, the SMARTS pattern `['[c][NX3+](=O)[O-]']` should be checked. Ensure that the pattern accurately captures the nitro group on an aromatic ring.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: For Rule 7, the SMARTS pattern `['[CX4](F)(F)F']` should be checked. Ensure that the pattern accurately captures the trifluoromethyl group.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: For Rule 8, the SMARTS pattern `['[c]1[nH]c2c(c1)cccc2']` should be checked. Ensure that the pattern accurately captures the indole group.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: For Rule 9, the SMARTS pattern `['[n]1ccccc1']` should be checked. Ensure that the pattern accurately captures the pyridine ring.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: For Rule 10, the SMARTS pattern `['[c][CX3H]=O']` should be checked. Ensure that the pattern accurately captures the formyl group on an aromatic ring.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: For Rule 11, the SMARTS pattern `['[c][SX4](=O)(=O)', '[c][CX3](=O)']` should be checked. Ensure that the pattern accurately captures the aromatic ring with sulfonyl or carbonyl groups.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: For Rule 12, the SMARTS pattern `['[c][OX2][CH3]', '[c][OX2][CH2][CH3]']` should be checked. Ensure that the pattern accurately captures the aromatic ring with methoxy or ethoxy groups.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: For Rule 13, the SMARTS pattern `['[NX3H2]', '[C;X4]([C;X4])[C;X4][C;X4]']` should be revised. The pattern should ensure the presence of a branched aliphatic chain containing an amino group. The current pattern may not accurately capture the branching.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: For Rule 14, the SMARTS pattern `['[n]1ccccc1', '[c][CX3](=O)']` should be revised. The pattern should ensure the presence of a pyridine ring with electron-withdrawing substituents. The current pattern may not accurately capture the electron-withdrawing nature.

- ** Suggestion 15 **: For Rule 15, the SMARTS pattern `['[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]']` should be revised. The pattern should ensure the presence of a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbons) with no additional functional groups. The current pattern may not accurately capture the absence of other functional groups.

Metric Commenter Message:
Based on the current rule metrics and comparing them to the reference metrics, here are some observations and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Confidence**:
   - The current train confidence is 0.5556, which is slightly lower than some of the previous iterations (e.g., 0.6083, 0.5944). This indicates that the current rules are less reliable in predicting the outcome compared to some previous rules.
   - To improve confidence, it might be beneficial to refine the rules by focusing on more specific conditions or combinations of functional groups that have shown higher confidence in past iterations.

2. **Lift**:
   - The current train lift is 1.1066, which is lower than the highest lift observed in previous iterations (e.g., 1.2237). A lift greater than 1 indicates that the rule is better than random guessing, but the closer it is to 1, the less impactful the rule is.
   - To enhance lift, consider identifying and incorporating additional conditions or modifiers that have a stronger association with the desired outcome. This could involve exploring interactions between different functional groups or structural features that have not been fully captured by the current rules.

3. **Leverage**:
   - The current train leverage is 0.0037, which is relatively low compared to some previous iterations (e.g., 0.0093). This suggests that the current rules do not provide much additional support over what would be expected by chance.
   - Increasing leverage could involve focusing on rules that involve more frequent or impactful modifiers, as these are likely to provide stronger associations and thus higher leverage.

4. **Support**:
   - The current train support is 0.0229, which is lower than previous iterations (e.g., 0.0486, 0.0343). This indicates that the current rules apply to a smaller portion of the dataset.
   - To improve support, consider broadening the scope of the rules to include more common modifiers or conditions that are prevalent in the dataset, while still maintaining a balance with confidence and lift.

**Suggestions for Improvement**:
- **Refinement of Rules**: Focus on refining rules that have shown higher confidence and lift in previous iterations. This could involve narrowing down the conditions to those that consistently lead to high yields.
- **Exploration of New Combinations**: Investigate new combinations of functional groups or structural features that have not been fully explored. This could uncover new rules with higher confidence and lift.
- **Data Analysis**: Conduct a deeper analysis of the dataset to identify patterns or trends that could inform the development of more effective rules. This might involve clustering or other data mining techniques to uncover hidden relationships.
- **Iterative Testing**: Continue iterating on the rules, testing different combinations and conditions to identify those that consistently improve the metrics.

Overall, while the current rules show some promise, there is room for improvement in terms of confidence, lift, and leverage. By focusing on refining and expanding the rules, it is possible to achieve better performance in future iterations.

Traditional Commenter Message:
### Performance Evaluation of Current Rules

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
   - The current rules have shown an improvement in validation accuracy from previous iterations, reaching 0.6857. This suggests that the rules are becoming more effective in predicting the loading of modifiers on catalysts. However, there is still room for improvement as the accuracy is not yet optimal.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment:**
   - The increase in validation accuracy suggests that the model is learning better patterns from the data. However, the consistent discrepancies between predicted and experimental values for certain molecules indicate potential overfitting to specific features or underfitting to others. The model might be capturing noise or missing important interactions.

3. **Discrepancies Analysis:**
   - For molecules where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low, rules with high positive SHAP values (e.g., Rule 2, Rule 7, Rule 10) might be overestimating the effect of certain features.
   - Conversely, for molecules where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, rules with high negative SHAP values (e.g., Rule 2, Rule 7, Rule 10) might be underestimating the effect of certain features.

4. **Accuracy Improvements:**
   - The improvement in validation accuracy suggests that the current rules are moving in the right direction. However, the presence of both overestimated and underestimated loadings indicates that further refinement is necessary to achieve better generalization.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**
   - SHAP analysis highlights specific rules that contribute significantly to the predictions. For instance, Rule 2 and Rule 10 frequently appear with high SHAP values, indicating their strong influence on predictions. This suggests that these rules might need refinement to better capture the underlying chemistry.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Overestimated Rules:**
   - Rules with high positive SHAP values for overestimated loadings, such as Rule 2 and Rule 10, should be reviewed. Consider incorporating additional constraints or modifying the conditions to reduce their influence on predictions where they are not applicable.

2. **Adjust Underestimated Rules:**
   - Rules with high negative SHAP values for underestimated loadings should be adjusted to better capture the features that lead to high experimental values. This might involve relaxing certain conditions or adding new features that are currently not considered.

### Summary and Directions for Optimization

1. **Current Rule Effectiveness**:
   - The current rules have shown an improvement in validation accuracy, reaching 0.6857. This indicates progress in predicting the loading of modifiers on catalysts. However, the accuracy is not yet optimal, suggesting room for further refinement.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment**:
   - The model shows potential overfitting to specific features or underfitting to others, as indicated by discrepancies between predicted and experimental values for certain molecules. This suggests that the model might be capturing noise or missing important interactions.

3. **Discrepancies Analysis**:
   - Rules with high positive SHAP values (e.g., Rule 2, Rule 7, Rule 10) might be overestimating the effect of certain features, leading to overestimated loadings.
   - Conversely, rules with high negative SHAP values might be underestimating the effect of certain features, leading to underestimated loadings.

4. **Accuracy Improvements**:
   - The improvement in validation accuracy suggests that the current rules are moving in the right direction. However, further refinement is necessary to achieve better generalization and address both overestimated and underestimated loadings.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis**:
   - SHAP analysis highlights specific rules that contribute significantly to predictions. Rules like Rule 2 and Rule 10 frequently appear with high SHAP values, indicating their strong influence on predictions and the need for refinement.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Overestimated Rules**:
   - Review rules with high positive SHAP values for overestimated loadings, such as Rule 2 and Rule 10. Consider incorporating additional constraints or modifying conditions to reduce their influence where not applicable.

2. **Adjust Underestimated Rules**:
   - Adjust rules with high negative SHAP values for underestimated loadings to better capture features leading to high experimental values. This might involve relaxing conditions or adding new features.

3. **Improve Generalization**:
   - Simplify complex rules or combine similar rules to reduce model complexity and address potential overfitting. Explore new features capturing interactions not currently represented.

4. **Iterative Refinement**:
   - Use SHAP analysis insights to iteratively refine rules. Focus on rules consistently showing high SHAP values and adjust them based on observed data patterns.

5. **Incorporate Domain Knowledge**:
   - Collaborate with domain experts to validate the chemical relevance of rules, ensuring alignment with known catalytic mechanisms. This can help refine rules that are chemically plausible and effective.

### Possibility for Further Optimization

There is a possibility for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. By focusing on refining and expanding the rules, incorporating domain knowledge, and using iterative testing, the model's predictive accuracy and generalization capabilities can be improved.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents (e.g., -OH, -NH2) tend to result in a high yield. These groups enhance coordination with the metal center, stabilizing the catalyst. Examples include 4-aminobenzoic acid and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with an amino group (-NH2) and a linear aliphatic chain of 4 to 6 carbons, without additional electron-withdrawing groups, tend to result in a high yield. The amino group enhances coordination, while the aliphatic chain provides steric effects that favor the reaction. Examples include 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a hydroxyl group (-OH) and an aromatic ring with additional electron-donating groups tend to result in a high yield. The hydroxyl group participates in hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst structure. Examples include 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (-O-) and no additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The flexibility and decreased rigidity of the catalyst structure negatively impact the reaction. Examples include 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing a sulfanyl group (-SH) with a short aliphatic chain (up to 3 carbons) tend to result in a high yield. The sulfanyl group provides strong coordination with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a nitro group (-NO2) on an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group stabilizes the metal center, enhancing the reaction. An example is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the trifluoromethyl group destabilizes the metal center, reducing catalytic activity. An example is 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing an indole group tend to result in a high yield. The indole group provides π-π interactions and additional coordination sites, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. An example is (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring tend to result in a high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring coordinates with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing a formyl group (-CHO) on an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield. The formyl group introduces steric hindrance or electronic effects that destabilize the metal center. Examples include 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring and electron-withdrawing groups such as sulfonyl (-SO2-) or carbonyl (-C=O) groups tend to result in a low yield. These groups may destabilize the metal center. Examples include 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring and electron-donating groups such as methoxy (-OCH3) or ethoxy (-OC2H5) tend to result in a high yield. These groups enhance the electron density on the aromatic ring, stabilizing the metal center. An example is 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a branched aliphatic chain containing an amino group (-NH2) tend to result in a low yield. The branching may introduce steric hindrance that affects coordination with the metal center. An example is (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with electron-withdrawing substituents tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature reduces the electron density on the nitrogen, affecting coordination. An example is 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbons) and no additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The long chain may introduce steric hindrance and reduce effective coordination. An example is octanoic acid.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: Refine Rule 2 by incorporating additional constraints to address overestimation. Consider specifying the type of aliphatic chain or introducing a condition on the presence of other functional groups that might influence the yield.

- **Advice 2**: Modify Rule 10 to reduce its influence on overestimated loadings. Introduce conditions that account for steric hindrance or electronic effects more accurately, possibly by specifying the position of the formyl group on the aromatic ring.

- **Advice 3**: For rules with high negative SHAP values, such as those involving underestimated loadings, consider relaxing conditions or adding new features. For example, Rule 13 could be adjusted to account for the specific branching patterns that might not hinder coordination as much as currently assumed.

- **Advice 4**: Simplify complex rules by combining similar ones, such as those involving aromatic rings with electron-donating groups. This can help reduce model complexity and improve generalization by capturing broader patterns.

- **Advice 5**: Incorporate domain knowledge by consulting with chemists to validate the chemical plausibility of the rules. This can help ensure that the rules align with known catalytic mechanisms and are not just statistically derived.

- **Advice 6**: Use iterative testing and SHAP analysis to continuously refine the rules. Focus on rules that consistently show high SHAP values and adjust them based on observed data patterns to improve predictive accuracy.

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern `['[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]', '[c][OX2H]', '[c][NX3H2]']` should be revised to ensure it captures both the carboxylic acid group and the aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents. The current pattern may not fully capture the aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents like -OH or -NH2. Consider using a more specific pattern for electron-donating groups on an aromatic ring.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Rule 2's SMARTS `['[NX3H2]', '[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]']` should be checked to ensure it captures a linear aliphatic chain of 4 to 6 carbons. The current pattern may not accurately reflect the linearity or the specific carbon count. Consider using a pattern that specifies a linear chain with a specific number of carbons.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For Rule 3, the SMARTS `['[OX2H]', '[c][OX2H]']` should be checked to ensure it captures the aromatic ring with additional electron-donating groups. The current pattern may not fully capture the presence of additional electron-donating groups on the aromatic ring.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Rule 4's SMARTS `['[OX2][C;X4][OX2]']` should be revised to ensure it captures multiple ether linkages without additional functional groups. The current pattern may not fully capture the absence of other functional groups.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: For Rule 5, the SMARTS `['[SX2H]', '[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]']` should be checked to ensure it captures a short aliphatic chain (up to 3 carbons) with a sulfanyl group. The current pattern may not accurately reflect the specific carbon count.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Rule 6's SMARTS `['[c][NX3+](=O)[O-]']` should be checked to ensure it captures the nitro group on an aromatic ring. The current pattern may not fully capture the aromatic context.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: For Rule 7, the SMARTS `['[CX4](F)(F)F']` should be checked to ensure it captures the trifluoromethyl group context correctly. The current pattern may not fully capture the context in which the trifluoromethyl group is present.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Rule 8's SMARTS `['c1c[nH]c2c1cccc2']` should be checked to ensure it captures the indole group correctly. The current pattern may not fully capture the indole context.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: For Rule 9, the SMARTS `['c1ccncc1']` should be checked to ensure it captures the pyridine ring context correctly. The current pattern may not fully capture the pyridine context.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Rule 10's SMARTS `['[c][CX3H]=O']` should be checked to ensure it captures the formyl group on an aromatic ring. The current pattern may not fully capture the aromatic context.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: For Rule 11, the SMARTS `['[c][SX4](=O)(=O)']` should be checked to ensure it captures the aromatic ring with electron-withdrawing groups like sulfonyl or carbonyl. The current pattern may not fully capture the context of these groups on an aromatic ring.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: Rule 12's SMARTS `['[c][OX2][C;X4][OX2]']` should be checked to ensure it captures the aromatic ring with electron-donating groups like methoxy or ethoxy. The current pattern may not fully capture the context of these groups on an aromatic ring.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: For Rule 13, the SMARTS `['[NX3H2][C;X4][C;X4]']` should be checked to ensure it captures a branched aliphatic chain containing an amino group. The current pattern may not fully capture the branching context.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: Rule 14's SMARTS `['c1ccncc1[CX3](=O)']` should be checked to ensure it captures the pyridine ring with electron-withdrawing substituents. The current pattern may not fully capture the context of these substituents on a pyridine ring.

- ** Suggestion 15 **: For Rule 15, the SMARTS `['[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]']` should be checked to ensure it captures a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbons) with no additional functional groups.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents (e.g., -OH, -NH2) tend to result in a high yield. These groups enhance coordination with the metal center, stabilizing the catalyst. Examples include 4-aminobenzoic acid and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with an amino group (-NH2) and a linear aliphatic chain of 4 to 6 carbons, without additional electron-withdrawing groups, tend to result in a high yield. The amino group enhances coordination, while the aliphatic chain provides steric effects that favor the reaction. Examples include 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a hydroxyl group (-OH) and an aromatic ring with additional electron-donating groups tend to result in a high yield. The hydroxyl group participates in hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst structure. Examples include 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (-O-) and no additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The flexibility and decreased rigidity of the catalyst structure negatively impact the reaction. Examples include 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing a sulfanyl group (-SH) with a short aliphatic chain (up to 3 carbons) tend to result in a high yield. The sulfanyl group provides strong coordination with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a nitro group (-NO2) on an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group stabilizes the metal center, enhancing the reaction. An example is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the trifluoromethyl group destabilizes the metal center, reducing catalytic activity. An example is 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing an indole group tend to result in a high yield. The indole group provides π-π interactions and additional coordination sites, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. An example is (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring tend to result in a high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring coordinates with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing a formyl group (-CHO) on an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield. The formyl group introduces steric hindrance or electronic effects that destabilize the metal center. Examples include 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring and electron-withdrawing groups such as sulfonyl (-SO2-) or carbonyl (-C=O) groups tend to result in a low yield. These groups may destabilize the metal center. Examples include 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring and electron-donating groups such as methoxy (-OCH3) or ethoxy (-OC2H5) tend to result in a high yield. These groups enhance the electron density on the aromatic ring, stabilizing the metal center. An example is 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a branched aliphatic chain containing an amino group (-NH2) tend to result in a low yield. The branching may introduce steric hindrance that affects coordination with the metal center. An example is (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with electron-withdrawing substituents tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature reduces the electron density on the nitrogen, affecting coordination. An example is 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbons) and no additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The long chain may introduce steric hindrance and reduce effective coordination. An example is octanoic acid.

** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern should include both the carboxylic acid group and an aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents. The current pattern '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]' only captures the carboxylic acid group. Consider adding a pattern for electron-donating groups like '-OH' or '-NH2' on an aromatic ring.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Rule 2's SMARTS pattern '[NX3H2]', '[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]' does not accurately capture the requirement for a linear aliphatic chain of 4 to 6 carbons. The pattern should be adjusted to ensure it matches a chain of the specified length without additional electron-withdrawing groups.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: Rule 3's pattern '[OX2H]', '[c][OX2H]' should be expanded to include additional electron-donating groups on the aromatic ring, as specified in the rule.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Rule 4's pattern '[OX2][C;X4][OX2]' does not capture the requirement for multiple ether linkages. Consider using a pattern that matches multiple ether linkages without additional functional groups.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: Rule 5's pattern '[SX2H]', '[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]' should be refined to ensure it captures a short aliphatic chain (up to 3 carbons) with a sulfanyl group.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Rule 6's pattern '[c][NX3+](=O)[O-]' is correct for a nitro group on an aromatic ring, but ensure it is applied correctly to the SMILES strings.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: Rule 7's pattern '[CX4](F)(F)F' is correct for a trifluoromethyl group, but ensure it is applied correctly to the SMILES strings.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Rule 8's pattern 'c1c[nH]c2c1cccc2' correctly identifies an indole group, but ensure it is applied correctly to the SMILES strings.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: Rule 9's pattern 'c1ccncc1' correctly identifies a pyridine ring, but ensure it is applied correctly to the SMILES strings.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Rule 10's pattern '[c][CX3H]=O' should be checked to ensure it captures the formyl group on an aromatic ring correctly.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: Rule 11's pattern '[c][SX4](=O)(=O)' should be checked to ensure it captures electron-withdrawing groups like sulfonyl or carbonyl on an aromatic ring.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: Rule 12's pattern '[c][OX2][C;X4][OX2]' should be checked to ensure it captures electron-donating groups like methoxy or ethoxy on an aromatic ring.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: Rule 13's pattern '[NX3H2][C;X4][C;X4]' should be refined to ensure it captures a branched aliphatic chain containing an amino group.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: Rule 14's pattern 'c1ccncc1[CX3](=O)' should be checked to ensure it captures a pyridine ring with electron-withdrawing substituents.

- ** Suggestion 15 **: Rule 15's pattern '[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]' should be refined to ensure it captures a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbons) with no additional functional groups.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern `['[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]', '[c][OX2H]', '[c][NX3H2]']` should be revised to ensure it captures both the carboxylic acid group and the aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents. The current pattern may not fully capture the aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents like -OH or -NH2. Consider using a more specific pattern that includes these substituents.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: For Rule 2, the SMARTS pattern `['[NX3H2]', '[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]']` should be checked to ensure it captures the linear aliphatic chain of 4 to 6 carbons. The current pattern may not accurately reflect the length of the aliphatic chain. Consider using a pattern that specifies the exact number of carbon atoms in the chain.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For Rule 3, the SMARTS pattern `['[OX2H]', '[c][OX2H]']` should be revised to ensure it captures the aromatic ring with additional electron-donating groups. The current pattern may not fully capture the presence of additional electron-donating groups on the aromatic ring.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: For Rule 4, the SMARTS pattern `['[OX2][C;X4][OX2]']` should be checked to ensure it captures multiple ether linkages. The current pattern may not accurately reflect the presence of multiple ether linkages without additional functional groups.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: For Rule 5, the SMARTS pattern `['[SX2H]', '[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]']` should be revised to ensure it captures the sulfanyl group with a short aliphatic chain. The current pattern may not accurately reflect the length of the aliphatic chain.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: For Rule 6, the SMARTS pattern `['[c][NX3+](=O)[O-]']` should be checked to ensure it captures the nitro group on an aromatic ring. The current pattern may not fully capture the presence of the nitro group in the correct context.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: For Rule 7, the SMARTS pattern `['[CX4](F)(F)F']` should be checked to ensure it captures the trifluoromethyl group. The current pattern seems correct, but ensure it is applied in the correct context.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: For Rule 8, the SMARTS pattern `['c1c[nH]c2c1cccc2']` should be checked to ensure it captures the indole group. The current pattern seems correct, but ensure it is applied in the correct context.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: For Rule 9, the SMARTS pattern `['c1ccncc1']` should be checked to ensure it captures the pyridine ring. The current pattern seems correct, but ensure it is applied in the correct context.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: For Rule 10, the SMARTS pattern `['[c][CX3H]=O']` should be checked to ensure it captures the formyl group on an aromatic ring. The current pattern may not fully capture the presence of the formyl group in the correct context.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: For Rule 11, the SMARTS pattern `['[c][SX4](=O)(=O)']` should be checked to ensure it captures the aromatic ring with electron-withdrawing groups such as sulfonyl or carbonyl groups. The current pattern may not fully capture these groups in the correct context.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: For Rule 12, the SMARTS pattern `['[c][OX2][C;X4][OX2]']` should be checked to ensure it captures the aromatic ring with electron-donating groups such as methoxy or ethoxy. The current pattern may not fully capture these groups in the correct context.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: For Rule 13, the SMARTS pattern `['[NX3H2][C;X4][C;X4]']` should be checked to ensure it captures the branched aliphatic chain containing an amino group. The current pattern may not accurately reflect the branching.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: For Rule 14, the SMARTS pattern `['c1ccncc1[CX3](=O)']` should be checked to ensure it captures the pyridine ring with electron-withdrawing substituents. The current pattern may not fully capture these substituents in the correct context.

- ** Suggestion 15 **: For Rule 15, the SMARTS pattern `['[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]']` should be checked to ensure it captures the long aliphatic chain with more than 6 carbons. The current pattern may not accurately reflect the length of the aliphatic chain.

Metric Commenter Message:
Based on the current rule metrics and the reference metrics provided, here are some observations and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Confidence**:
   - The current train confidence is 0.5278, which is lower than some of the previous iterations (e.g., 0.6083, 0.5944). This indicates that the current rules are less reliable in predicting the outcome compared to some of the previous rules.
   - To improve confidence, it might be beneficial to refine the rules by focusing on more specific conditions or combinations of functional groups that have shown higher confidence in past iterations.

2. **Lift**:
   - The current train lift is 1.0527, which is close to 1. This suggests that the rules are not significantly better than random chance in predicting the outcome. In previous iterations, some rules had a lift as high as 1.2237, indicating a stronger association.
   - To enhance lift, consider identifying and incorporating conditions that have a more substantial impact on the outcome. This could involve exploring interactions between different functional groups or structural features that have not been fully captured by the current rules.

3. **Leverage**:
   - The current train leverage is 0.0037, which is relatively low. While positive, it indicates only a slight improvement over what would be expected by chance.
   - Increasing leverage could involve focusing on rules that involve more frequent or impactful modifiers, as these might provide a stronger association with the desired outcome.

4. **Support**:
   - The current train support is 0.0324, which is lower than some previous iterations. While support is not the primary focus, ensuring that the rules apply to a reasonable portion of the dataset is important for generalizability.
   - Consider broadening the conditions slightly to capture a larger subset of the data without sacrificing too much specificity.

**Suggestions for Improvement**:
- **Refinement of Rules**: Re-evaluate the current rules to identify any that might be too broad or too narrow. Adjusting the specificity of the conditions could help improve both confidence and lift.
- **Exploration of New Combinations**: Investigate new combinations of functional groups or structural features that have not been previously considered. This could uncover more impactful rules.
- **Data Analysis**: Conduct a deeper analysis of the dataset to identify any patterns or trends that have not been fully leveraged in the current rules. This might involve using data visualization or clustering techniques.
- **Iterative Testing**: Continue iterating on the rules, testing small changes to see their impact on the metrics. This iterative approach can help fine-tune the rules to achieve better performance.

Overall, while the current rules show some positive aspects, there is room for improvement, particularly in terms of confidence and lift. By focusing on refining the rules and exploring new combinations, it may be possible to enhance the predictive power of the rules.

Traditional Commenter Message:
### Performance Evaluation of Current Rules

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
   - The current rules have shown some effectiveness, as indicated by the validation accuracy of 0.6857, which is an improvement from some of the previous iterations. However, the accuracy is still not consistently high across all iterations, suggesting that the rules may not be fully capturing the complexity of the data.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment:**
   - The fluctuating validation accuracies across iterations (ranging from 0.5143 to 0.6857) suggest potential issues with overfitting or underfitting. The rules may be too specific to certain data points, leading to overfitting, or too general, leading to underfitting.

3. **Discrepancies Analysis:**
   - For molecules where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low, rules with high positive SHAP values (e.g., Rule 13) may be problematic. Conversely, for molecules where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, rules with high negative SHAP values (e.g., Rule 8) may need adjustment.

4. **Accuracy Improvements:**
   - The improvement in validation accuracy to 0.6857 suggests that there is potential for further refinement of the rules. However, the inconsistency in accuracy across iterations indicates that the current rules may not be robust enough.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**
   - SHAP analysis highlights specific rules that contribute significantly to the predictions. For instance, Rule 13 often has a high positive SHAP value for overestimated loadings, indicating it may need refinement. Similarly, Rule 8, with high negative SHAP values for underestimated loadings, suggests it may require adjustment.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Overestimated Loading Rules:**
   - **Rule 13**: Consider revising the conditions under which branched aliphatic chains with amino groups are considered to result in low yield. The steric hindrance effect may need to be balanced with other factors such as electronic effects.

2. **Adjust Underestimated Loading Rules:**
   - **Rule 8**: Re-evaluate the impact of indole groups. While they provide π-π interactions, the overall coordination environment should be considered to ensure accurate predictions.

3. **Improve Generalization:**
   - Introduce more nuanced rules that consider combinations of functional groups and their spatial arrangements. This could help in capturing more complex interactions that are not currently addressed.

4. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - Use insights from SHAP analysis to iteratively test and refine rules. For example, rules with consistently high SHAP values (positive or negative) should be prioritized for adjustment.

5. **Incorporate Additional Features:**
   - Consider incorporating additional molecular features or descriptors that may capture aspects of the catalyst-modifier interaction not currently addressed by the existing rules.

By focusing on these areas, the rules can be refined to improve both the accuracy and robustness of the predictions, ultimately leading to better generalization across different datasets.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents (e.g., -OH, -NH2) tend to result in a high yield. These groups enhance coordination with the metal center, stabilizing the catalyst. Examples include 4-aminobenzoic acid and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with an amino group (-NH2) and a linear aliphatic chain of 4 to 6 carbons, without additional electron-withdrawing groups, tend to result in a high yield. The amino group enhances coordination, while the aliphatic chain provides steric effects that favor the reaction. Examples include 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a hydroxyl group (-OH) and an aromatic ring with additional electron-donating groups tend to result in a high yield. The hydroxyl group participates in hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst structure. Examples include 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (-O-) and no additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The flexibility and decreased rigidity of the catalyst structure negatively impact the reaction. Examples include 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing a sulfanyl group (-SH) with a short aliphatic chain (up to 3 carbons) tend to result in a high yield. The sulfanyl group provides strong coordination with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a nitro group (-NO2) on an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group stabilizes the metal center, enhancing the reaction. An example is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the trifluoromethyl group destabilizes the metal center, reducing catalytic activity. An example is 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing an indole group tend to result in a high yield. The indole group provides π-π interactions and additional coordination sites, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. An example is (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring tend to result in a high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring coordinates with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing a formyl group (-CHO) on an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield. The formyl group introduces steric hindrance or electronic effects that destabilize the metal center. Examples include 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring and electron-withdrawing groups such as sulfonyl (-SO2-) or carbonyl (-C=O) groups tend to result in a low yield. These groups may destabilize the metal center. Examples include 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring and electron-donating groups such as methoxy (-OCH3) or ethoxy (-OC2H5) tend to result in a high yield. These groups enhance the electron density on the aromatic ring, stabilizing the metal center. An example is 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a branched aliphatic chain containing an amino group (-NH2) tend to result in a low yield. The branching may introduce steric hindrance that affects coordination with the metal center. An example is (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with electron-withdrawing substituents tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature reduces the electron density on the nitrogen, affecting coordination. An example is 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbons) and no additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The long chain may introduce steric hindrance and reduce effective coordination. An example is octanoic acid.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: Refine Rule 13 by considering the electronic effects of the amino group in branched aliphatic chains. Introduce conditions that account for the balance between steric hindrance and electronic effects, possibly by incorporating descriptors that quantify these effects.

- **Advice 2**: Adjust Rule 8 to better capture the coordination environment of indole groups. Consider the spatial arrangement and potential interactions with other functional groups in the molecule, which may influence the overall yield.

- **Advice 3**: Develop new rules that consider combinations of functional groups and their spatial arrangements. This could involve creating rules that account for synergistic or antagonistic effects between different functional groups.

- **Advice 4**: Use SHAP analysis to identify rules with consistently high SHAP values and prioritize them for refinement. This iterative approach can help in fine-tuning the rules to improve prediction accuracy.

- **Advice 5**: Incorporate additional molecular descriptors that capture aspects of the catalyst-modifier interaction not currently addressed. This could include features related to molecular geometry, electronic distribution, or solvation effects.

- **Advice 6**: Validate the refined rules with a broader dataset to ensure they generalize well across different scenarios. This can help in identifying any remaining overfitting or underfitting issues.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with an amino group (-NH2) and a linear aliphatic chain of 4 to 6 carbons, without additional electron-withdrawing groups, tend to result in a high yield. The amino group enhances coordination, while the aliphatic chain provides steric effects that favor the reaction. Examples include 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a hydroxyl group (-OH) and an aromatic ring with additional electron-donating groups tend to result in a high yield. The hydroxyl group participates in hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst structure. Examples include 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (-O-) and no additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The flexibility and decreased rigidity of the catalyst structure negatively impact the reaction. Examples include 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing a sulfanyl group (-SH) with a short aliphatic chain (up to 3 carbons) tend to result in a high yield. The sulfanyl group provides strong coordination with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a nitro group (-NO2) on an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group stabilizes the metal center, enhancing the reaction. An example is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the trifluoromethyl group destabilizes the metal center, reducing catalytic activity. An example is 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing an indole group tend to result in a high yield. The indole group provides π-π interactions and additional coordination sites, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. An example is (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring tend to result in a high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring coordinates with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing a formyl group (-CHO) on an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield. The formyl group introduces steric hindrance or electronic effects that destabilize the metal center. Examples include 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring and electron-withdrawing groups such as sulfonyl (-SO2-) or carbonyl (-C=O) groups tend to result in a low yield. These groups may destabilize the metal center. Examples include 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring and electron-donating groups such as methoxy (-OCH3) or ethoxy (-OC2H5) tend to result in a high yield. These groups enhance the electron density on the aromatic ring, stabilizing the metal center. An example is 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a branched aliphatic chain containing an amino group (-NH2) tend to result in a low yield. The branching may introduce steric hindrance that affects coordination with the metal center. An example is (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with electron-withdrawing substituents tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature reduces the electron density on the nitrogen, affecting coordination. An example is 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbons) and no additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The long chain may introduce steric hindrance and reduce effective coordination. An example is octanoic acid.

** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern should include both the carboxylic acid group and an aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents. The current SMARTS pattern '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]' only captures the carboxylic acid group. Consider adding a pattern for the aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents like '[c][OX2H]' or '[c][NX3H2]'.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Rule 2 requires a linear aliphatic chain of 4 to 6 carbons with an amino group. The current SMARTS '[NX3H2]', '[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]' does not ensure the absence of additional electron-withdrawing groups. Consider refining the SMARTS to ensure the chain is linear and free of such groups.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: Rule 3's SMARTS '[OX2H]', '[c][OX2H]' should ensure the presence of an aromatic ring with additional electron-donating groups. The current pattern may not fully capture this requirement. Consider adding patterns for electron-donating groups on the aromatic ring.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Rule 4's SMARTS '[OX2][C;X4][OX2]' should be checked to ensure it captures multiple ether linkages without additional functional groups. The current pattern may not fully capture the absence of other groups.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: Rule 5's SMARTS '[SX2H]', '[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]' should ensure the presence of a short aliphatic chain (up to 3 carbons). The current pattern may not restrict the chain length appropriately.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Rule 6's SMARTS '[c][NX3+](=O)[O-]' should ensure the nitro group is on an aromatic ring. The current pattern may not fully capture this requirement.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: Rule 7's SMARTS '[CX4](F)(F)F' correctly captures the trifluoromethyl group, but ensure it is applied in the context of the entire molecule to predict low yield.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Rule 8's SMARTS 'c1c[nH]c2c1cccc2' correctly captures the indole group. Ensure it is applied in the context of the entire molecule to predict high yield.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: Rule 9's SMARTS 'c1ccncc1' correctly captures the pyridine ring. Ensure it is applied in the context of the entire molecule to predict high yield.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Rule 10's SMARTS '[c][CX3H]=O' should ensure the formyl group is on an aromatic ring. The current pattern may not fully capture this requirement.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: Rule 11's SMARTS '[c][SX4](=O)(=O)' should ensure the presence of electron-withdrawing groups such as sulfonyl or carbonyl on an aromatic ring. The current pattern may not fully capture this requirement.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: Rule 12's SMARTS '[c][OX2][C;X4][OX2]' should ensure the presence of electron-donating groups such as methoxy or ethoxy on an aromatic ring. The current pattern may not fully capture this requirement.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: Rule 13's SMARTS '[NX3H2]', '[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]' should ensure the presence of a branched aliphatic chain with an amino group. The current pattern may not fully capture this requirement.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: Rule 14's SMARTS 'c1ccncc1', '[c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]' should ensure the pyridine ring has electron-withdrawing substituents. The current pattern may not fully capture this requirement.

- ** Suggestion 15 **: Rule 15's SMARTS '[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]' should ensure the presence of a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbons) with no additional functional groups. The current pattern may not fully capture this requirement.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents (e.g., -OH, -NH2) tend to result in a high yield. These groups enhance coordination with the metal center, stabilizing the catalyst. Examples include 4-aminobenzoic acid and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with an amino group (-NH2) and a linear aliphatic chain of 4 to 6 carbons, without additional electron-withdrawing groups, tend to result in a high yield. The amino group enhances coordination, while the aliphatic chain provides steric effects that favor the reaction. Examples include 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a hydroxyl group (-OH) and an aromatic ring with additional electron-donating groups tend to result in a high yield. The hydroxyl group participates in hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst structure. Examples include 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (-O-) and no additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The flexibility and decreased rigidity of the catalyst structure negatively impact the reaction. Examples include 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing a sulfanyl group (-SH) with a short aliphatic chain (up to 3 carbons) tend to result in a high yield. The sulfanyl group provides strong coordination with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a nitro group (-NO2) on an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group stabilizes the metal center, enhancing the reaction. An example is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the trifluoromethyl group destabilizes the metal center, reducing catalytic activity. An example is 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing an indole group tend to result in a high yield. The indole group provides π-π interactions and additional coordination sites, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. An example is (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring tend to result in a high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring coordinates with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing a formyl group (-CHO) on an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield. The formyl group introduces steric hindrance or electronic effects that destabilize the metal center. Examples include 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring and electron-withdrawing groups such as sulfonyl (-SO2-) or carbonyl (-C=O) groups tend to result in a low yield. These groups may destabilize the metal center. Examples include 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring and electron-donating groups such as methoxy (-OCH3) or ethoxy (-OC2H5) tend to result in a high yield. These groups enhance the electron density on the aromatic ring, stabilizing the metal center. An example is 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a branched aliphatic chain containing an amino group (-NH2) tend to result in a low yield. The branching may introduce steric hindrance that affects coordination with the metal center. An example is (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with electron-withdrawing substituents tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature reduces the electron density on the nitrogen, affecting coordination. An example is 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbons) and no additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The long chain may introduce steric hindrance and reduce effective coordination. An example is octanoic acid.

Matrix Checker Message:
Upon reviewing the feature matrix and the rules, it appears that there are discrepancies between the rules and the feature matrix. Here are the detailed observations and suggestions:

** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern `['[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]', '[c][OX2H]', '[c][NX3H2]']` does not fully capture the requirement of having both a carboxylic acid group and an aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents. The SMARTS should be adjusted to ensure both features are present in the same molecule.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Rule 2's SMARTS `['[NX3H2]', '[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]']` should be refined to ensure the amino group is part of a linear aliphatic chain of 4 to 6 carbons. The current pattern may not enforce the linearity or the specific chain length.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: Rule 3's SMARTS `['[OX2H]', '[c][OX2H]']` should be expanded to include additional electron-donating groups on the aromatic ring, as specified in the rule.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Rule 4's SMARTS `['[OX2][C;X4][OX2]']` does not account for the absence of additional functional groups. The pattern should be adjusted to ensure no other functional groups are present.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: Rule 5's SMARTS `['[SX2H]', '[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]']` should be refined to ensure the sulfanyl group is part of a short aliphatic chain (up to 3 carbons).

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Rule 6's SMARTS `['[c][NX3+](=O)[O-]']` correctly identifies the nitro group on an aromatic ring, but ensure it matches the specific context of the rule.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: Rule 7's SMARTS `['[CX4](F)(F)F']` correctly identifies the trifluoromethyl group, but ensure it matches the specific context of the rule.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Rule 8's SMARTS `['c1c[nH]c2c1cccc2']` correctly identifies the indole group, but ensure it matches the specific context of the rule.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: Rule 9's SMARTS `['c1ccncc1']` correctly identifies the pyridine ring, but ensure it matches the specific context of the rule.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Rule 10's SMARTS `['[c][CX3H]=O']` should be refined to ensure the formyl group is on an aromatic ring, as specified in the rule.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: Rule 11's SMARTS `['[c][SX4](=O)(=O)']` should be refined to ensure the presence of electron-withdrawing groups such as sulfonyl or carbonyl groups on an aromatic ring.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: Rule 12's SMARTS `['[c][OX2][C;X4][OX2]']` should be refined to ensure the presence of electron-donating groups such as methoxy or ethoxy on an aromatic ring.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: Rule 13's SMARTS `['[NX3H2]', '[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]']` should be refined to ensure the amino group is part of a branched aliphatic chain.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: Rule 14's SMARTS `['c1ccncc1', '[c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]']` should be refined to ensure the pyridine ring has electron-withdrawing substituents.

- ** Suggestion 15 **: Rule 15's SMARTS `['[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]']` should be refined to ensure the aliphatic chain is long (more than 6 carbons) and has no additional functional groups.

** End of Suggestions **

The transformation from language rules to the numeric feature matrix is not fully effective, as the SMARTS patterns do not accurately capture the structural descriptions of the rules. Adjustments to the SMARTS patterns are necessary to ensure they align with the natural language rules.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents (e.g., -OH, -NH2) tend to result in a high yield. These groups enhance coordination with the metal center, stabilizing the catalyst. Examples include 4-aminobenzoic acid and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with an amino group (-NH2) and a linear aliphatic chain of 4 to 6 carbons, without additional electron-withdrawing groups, tend to result in a high yield. The amino group enhances coordination, while the aliphatic chain provides steric effects that favor the reaction. Examples include 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a hydroxyl group (-OH) and an aromatic ring with additional electron-donating groups tend to result in a high yield. The hydroxyl group participates in hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst structure. Examples include 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (-O-) and no additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The flexibility and decreased rigidity of the catalyst structure negatively impact the reaction. Examples include 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing a sulfanyl group (-SH) with a short aliphatic chain (up to 3 carbons) tend to result in a high yield. The sulfanyl group provides strong coordination with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a nitro group (-NO2) on an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group stabilizes the metal center, enhancing the reaction. An example is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the trifluoromethyl group destabilizes the metal center, reducing catalytic activity. An example is 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing an indole group tend to result in a high yield. The indole group provides π-π interactions and additional coordination sites, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. An example is (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring tend to result in a high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring coordinates with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing a formyl group (-CHO) on an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield. The formyl group introduces steric hindrance or electronic effects that destabilize the metal center. Examples include 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring and electron-withdrawing groups such as sulfonyl (-SO2-) or carbonyl (-C=O) groups tend to result in a low yield. These groups may destabilize the metal center. Examples include 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring and electron-donating groups such as methoxy (-OCH3) or ethoxy (-OC2H5) tend to result in a high yield. These groups enhance the electron density on the aromatic ring, stabilizing the metal center. An example is 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a branched aliphatic chain containing an amino group (-NH2) tend to result in a low yield. The branching may introduce steric hindrance that affects coordination with the metal center. An example is (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with electron-withdrawing substituents tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature reduces the electron density on the nitrogen, affecting coordination. An example is 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbons) and no additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The long chain may introduce steric hindrance and reduce effective coordination. An example is octanoic acid.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern `['[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]', '[c][OX2H]', '[c][NX3H2]']` does not fully capture the requirement of having both a carboxylic acid group and an aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents. Consider using a SMARTS pattern that specifically looks for a carboxylic acid group attached to an aromatic ring with electron-donating groups like `-OH` or `-NH2`.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Rule 2's SMARTS pattern `['[NX3H2]', '[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]']` should be refined to ensure it captures the presence of an amino group and a linear aliphatic chain of 4 to 6 carbons. The current pattern may not accurately reflect the linearity and specific length of the aliphatic chain.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For Rule 3, the SMARTS pattern `['[OX2H]', '[c][OX2H]']` should be adjusted to ensure it captures the presence of a hydroxyl group on an aromatic ring with additional electron-donating groups. The current pattern may not fully capture the requirement of additional electron-donating groups.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Rule 4's SMARTS pattern `['[OX2][C;X4][OX2]']` should be revised to specifically look for multiple ether linkages without additional functional groups. The current pattern may not accurately capture the absence of other functional groups.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: For Rule 5, the SMARTS pattern `['[SX2H]', '[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]']` should be refined to ensure it captures a sulfanyl group with a short aliphatic chain (up to 3 carbons). The current pattern may not accurately reflect the specific length of the aliphatic chain.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Rule 6's SMARTS pattern `['[c][NX3+](=O)[O-]']` should be checked to ensure it captures the presence of a nitro group on an aromatic ring. The current pattern may not fully capture the requirement of the nitro group being on an aromatic ring.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: For Rule 7, the SMARTS pattern `['[CX4](F)(F)F']` should be verified to ensure it captures the presence of a trifluoromethyl group. The current pattern seems correct, but ensure it is applied in the context of the entire molecule.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Rule 8's SMARTS pattern `['c1c[nH]c2c1cccc2']` should be checked to ensure it captures the presence of an indole group. The current pattern seems correct, but ensure it is applied in the context of the entire molecule.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: For Rule 9, the SMARTS pattern `['c1ccncc1']` should be verified to ensure it captures the presence of a pyridine ring. The current pattern seems correct, but ensure it is applied in the context of the entire molecule.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Rule 10's SMARTS pattern `['[c][CX3H]=O']` should be checked to ensure it captures the presence of a formyl group on an aromatic ring. The current pattern may not fully capture the requirement of the formyl group being on an aromatic ring.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: For Rule 11, the SMARTS pattern `['[c][SX4](=O)(=O)']` should be revised to ensure it captures the presence of an aromatic ring with electron-withdrawing groups such as sulfonyl or carbonyl groups. The current pattern may not fully capture the requirement of these specific groups.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: Rule 12's SMARTS pattern `['[c][OX2][C;X4][OX2]']` should be checked to ensure it captures the presence of an aromatic ring with electron-donating groups such as methoxy or ethoxy. The current pattern may not fully capture the requirement of these specific groups.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: For Rule 13, the SMARTS pattern `['[NX3H2]', '[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]']` should be refined to ensure it captures a branched aliphatic chain containing an amino group. The current pattern may not accurately reflect the branching requirement.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: Rule 14's SMARTS pattern `['c1ccncc1', '[c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]']` should be revised to ensure it captures a pyridine ring with electron-withdrawing substituents. The current pattern may not fully capture the requirement of these specific substituents.

- ** Suggestion 15 **: For Rule 15, the SMARTS pattern `['[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]']` should be refined to ensure it captures a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbons) with no additional functional groups. The current pattern may not accurately reflect the specific length and absence of functional groups.

Metric Commenter Message:
Based on the current metrics and comparing them to the previous reference metrics, here are some observations and comments on the performance of the current rules:

1. **Confidence**: 
   - The current train confidence is 0.5589, which is slightly lower than some of the higher confidence values observed in the previous iterations (e.g., 0.6083, 0.5944). This suggests that the current rules are moderately reliable in predicting high yield outcomes but could be improved to increase the confidence level.

2. **Lift**: 
   - The current train lift is 1.1131, which is slightly above 1. This indicates that the rules provide some predictive power beyond random chance, but the lift is not significantly high. In previous iterations, we observed lifts as high as 1.2237, suggesting that there is room for improvement in making the rules more impactful.

3. **Leverage**: 
   - The current train leverage is 0.0038, which is positive, indicating a stronger association than expected by chance. However, this value is relatively low compared to some previous iterations (e.g., 0.0093), suggesting that the rules are not capturing as much additional support as they could.

4. **Support**: 
   - The current train support is 0.0305, which is lower than some previous iterations (e.g., 0.0486). This indicates that the rules apply to a smaller portion of the dataset, which might limit their generalizability.

**Suggestions for Improvement**:
- **Refine Rule Conditions**: Consider refining the conditions of the rules to capture more specific interactions or combinations of functional groups that might lead to higher yields. This could help increase both confidence and lift.
  
- **Explore Additional Features**: Investigate additional chemical features or interactions that might not have been considered yet. This could involve looking at synergistic effects between different functional groups or considering the spatial arrangement of atoms.

- **Optimize Rule Complexity**: Balance the complexity of the rules to ensure they are not too specific (which could reduce support) or too general (which could reduce confidence and lift). This might involve adjusting the number of conditions or the specificity of the functional groups included in the rules.

- **Iterate and Validate**: Continue iterating on the rules and validate them against a test set to ensure that improvements in training metrics translate to better generalization.

Overall, while the current rules show some predictive capability, there is potential to enhance their performance by focusing on increasing confidence and lift, which are crucial for making the rules more actionable and reliable.

Traditional Commenter Message:
### Performance Evaluation of Current Rules

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
   - The current rules have shown some effectiveness, as indicated by the validation accuracy of 0.6857, which is an improvement from some of the previous iterations where accuracy was as low as 0.5143. However, the accuracy is still not consistently high across all iterations, suggesting that the rules may not be fully capturing the complexity of the data.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment:**
   - The fluctuation in validation accuracy across different iterations suggests potential issues with overfitting or underfitting. The rules might be too specific to certain patterns in the training data, leading to overfitting, or they might be too general, failing to capture important nuances, leading to underfitting.

3. **Discrepancies Analysis:**
   - For molecules where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low, rules with high positive SHAP values (e.g., Rule 7, Rule 10, Rule 13) might be contributing to overestimation. Conversely, for molecules where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, rules with high negative SHAP values (e.g., Rule 13, Rule 15) might be contributing to underestimation.

4. **Accuracy Improvements:**
   - The improvement in accuracy from earlier iterations suggests that the rules are moving in the right direction, but there is still room for refinement. The current accuracy indicates that the rules are capturing some relevant features but may need further tuning to improve predictive performance.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**
   - SHAP analysis highlights specific rules that consistently contribute to incorrect predictions. For instance, Rule 13 often has a high positive SHAP value for overestimated loadings, indicating it might be too lenient or broad. Similarly, Rule 15 often has a high negative SHAP value for underestimated loadings, suggesting it might be too restrictive.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Overestimated Loading Rules:**
   - **Rule 7 (Trifluoromethyl group):** Consider revising the conditions under which this rule applies, as it might be overestimating the impact of trifluoromethyl groups on loading.
   - **Rule 10 (Formyl group):** Re-evaluate the impact of formyl groups on aromatic rings, as this rule might be contributing to overestimation in certain contexts.

2. **Adjust Underestimated Loading Rules:**
   - **Rule 13 (Branched aliphatic chain):** This rule might be too restrictive. Consider allowing for exceptions where branching does not significantly hinder coordination.
   - **Rule 15 (Long aliphatic chain):** Reassess the impact of chain length, as this rule might be underestimating the potential for effective coordination in some cases.

3. **Improve Generalization:**
   - Introduce more nuanced rules that consider the interplay between different functional groups and their collective impact on loading. This could help address both overfitting and underfitting by capturing more complex patterns.

4. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - Use insights from SHAP analysis to iteratively test and refine rules. For example, if a rule consistently shows high SHAP values for incorrect predictions, experiment with modifying or splitting the rule to better capture the underlying chemistry.

5. **Incorporate Additional Features:**
   - Consider incorporating additional features or modifying existing ones to capture more subtle effects, such as steric hindrance or electronic interactions, which might not be fully accounted for in the current rules.

By addressing these areas, the rules can be refined to improve both the accuracy and generalization of the model, leading to more reliable predictions of modifier loading on catalysts.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents (e.g., -OH, -NH2) tend to result in a high yield. These groups enhance coordination with the metal center, stabilizing the catalyst. Examples include 4-aminobenzoic acid and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with an amino group (-NH2) and a linear aliphatic chain of 4 to 6 carbons, without additional electron-withdrawing groups, tend to result in a high yield. The amino group enhances coordination, while the aliphatic chain provides steric effects that favor the reaction. Examples include 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a hydroxyl group (-OH) and an aromatic ring with additional electron-donating groups tend to result in a high yield. The hydroxyl group participates in hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst structure. Examples include 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (-O-) and no additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The flexibility and decreased rigidity of the catalyst structure negatively impact the reaction. Examples include 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing a sulfanyl group (-SH) with a short aliphatic chain (up to 3 carbons) tend to result in a high yield. The sulfanyl group provides strong coordination with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a nitro group (-NO2) on an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group stabilizes the metal center, enhancing the reaction. An example is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the trifluoromethyl group destabilizes the metal center, reducing catalytic activity. An example is 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing an indole group tend to result in a high yield. The indole group provides π-π interactions and additional coordination sites, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. An example is (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring tend to result in a high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring coordinates with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing a formyl group (-CHO) on an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield. The formyl group introduces steric hindrance or electronic effects that destabilize the metal center. Examples include 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring and electron-withdrawing groups such as sulfonyl (-SO2-) or carbonyl (-C=O) groups tend to result in a low yield. These groups may destabilize the metal center. Examples include 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring and electron-donating groups such as methoxy (-OCH3) or ethoxy (-OC2H5) tend to result in a high yield. These groups enhance the electron density on the aromatic ring, stabilizing the metal center. An example is 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a branched aliphatic chain containing an amino group (-NH2) tend to result in a low yield. The branching may introduce steric hindrance that affects coordination with the metal center. An example is (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with electron-withdrawing substituents tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature reduces the electron density on the nitrogen, affecting coordination. An example is 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbons) and no additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The long chain may introduce steric hindrance and reduce effective coordination. An example is octanoic acid.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: Reassess Rule 7 regarding the trifluoromethyl group. Consider the specific context or additional functional groups that might mitigate the destabilizing effect of the trifluoromethyl group. This could involve identifying scenarios where the trifluoromethyl group does not lead to low yield, possibly due to compensatory stabilizing interactions.

- **Advice 2**: Re-evaluate Rule 10 concerning formyl groups on aromatic rings. Investigate if there are specific structural contexts or additional functional groups that can counteract the negative impact of formyl groups, allowing for exceptions where formyl groups do not lead to low yield.

- **Advice 3**: For Rule 13, which deals with branched aliphatic chains, explore the possibility of exceptions where branching does not significantly hinder coordination. This could involve identifying specific branching patterns or additional functional groups that facilitate effective coordination despite branching.

- **Advice 4**: Reassess Rule 15 regarding long aliphatic chains. Consider the impact of chain length in combination with other functional groups that might enhance coordination or reduce steric hindrance, allowing for exceptions where long chains do not lead to low yield.

- **Advice 5**: Develop more nuanced rules that consider the interplay between different functional groups. This could involve creating compound rules that account for the collective impact of multiple functional groups on modifier loading and yield, thereby improving generalization.

- **Advice 6**: Use SHAP analysis to iteratively refine rules. Focus on rules with high SHAP values for incorrect predictions, and experiment with modifying or splitting these rules to better capture the underlying chemical interactions.

- **Advice 7**: Incorporate additional features into the rules, such as steric hindrance or electronic interactions, which might not be fully captured by the current rules. This could involve using computational chemistry tools to model these effects and integrate them into the rule set.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents (e.g., -OH, -NH2) tend to result in a high yield. These groups enhance coordination with the metal center, stabilizing the catalyst. Examples include 4-aminobenzoic acid and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with an amino group (-NH2) and a linear aliphatic chain of 4 to 6 carbons, without additional electron-withdrawing groups, tend to result in a high yield. The amino group enhances coordination, while the aliphatic chain provides steric effects that favor the reaction. Examples include 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a hydroxyl group (-OH) and an aromatic ring with additional electron-donating groups tend to result in a high yield. The hydroxyl group participates in hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst structure. Examples include 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (-O-) and no additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The flexibility and decreased rigidity of the catalyst structure negatively impact the reaction. Examples include 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing a sulfanyl group (-SH) with a short aliphatic chain (up to 3 carbons) tend to result in a high yield. The sulfanyl group provides strong coordination with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a nitro group (-NO2) on an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group stabilizes the metal center, enhancing the reaction. An example is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) and additional electron-donating groups on the aromatic ring can result in a high yield. The electron-donating groups may counteract the destabilizing effect of the trifluoromethyl group. An example is 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing an indole group tend to result in a high yield. The indole group provides π-π interactions and additional coordination sites, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. An example is (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring tend to result in a high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring coordinates with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing a formyl group (-CHO) on an aromatic ring with additional electron-donating groups may result in a high yield. The electron-donating groups can mitigate the negative impact of the formyl group. An example is 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring and electron-withdrawing groups such as sulfonyl (-SO2-) or carbonyl (-C=O) groups tend to result in a low yield. These groups may destabilize the metal center. Examples include 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a branched aliphatic chain containing an amino group (-NH2) and additional electron-donating groups may result in a high yield. The electron-donating groups can enhance coordination despite the branching. An example is (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbons) and additional electron-donating groups can result in a high yield. The electron-donating groups may enhance coordination and reduce steric hindrance. An example is 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with electron-withdrawing substituents tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature reduces the electron density on the nitrogen, affecting coordination. An example is 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring and electron-donating groups such as methoxy (-OCH3) or ethoxy (-OC2H5) tend to result in a high yield. These groups enhance the electron density on the aromatic ring, stabilizing the metal center. An example is 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern `['[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]', '[c][OX2H]', '[c][NX3H2]']` does not fully capture the requirement of having both a carboxylic acid group and an aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents. Consider using a SMARTS pattern that explicitly checks for both features in the same molecule.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Rule 2's SMARTS pattern `['[NX3H2]', '[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]']` should be refined to ensure that the amino group is part of a linear aliphatic chain of 4 to 6 carbons. The current pattern may not accurately capture this structural requirement.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For Rule 3, the SMARTS `['[OX2H]', '[c][OX2H]']` should be adjusted to ensure that the hydroxyl group is on an aromatic ring with additional electron-donating groups. The current pattern may not enforce the presence of additional electron-donating groups.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: For Rule 7, the SMARTS `['[CX4](F)(F)F', '[c][OX2H]']` should be refined to ensure the presence of a trifluoromethyl group and additional electron-donating groups on the aromatic ring. The current pattern may not enforce both features.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Rule 8's SMARTS `['c1c[nH]c2c1cccc2']` should be checked to ensure it captures the indole group correctly. The current pattern seems appropriate but should be verified against examples.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: For Rule 9, the SMARTS `['c1ccncc1']` should be checked to ensure it captures the pyridine ring correctly. The current pattern seems appropriate but should be verified against examples.

** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern `['[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]', '[c][OX2H]', '[c][NX3H2]']` does not fully capture the requirement of having both a carboxylic acid group and an aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents. Consider using a SMARTS pattern that specifically looks for a carboxylic acid group attached to an aromatic ring with electron-donating groups like `-OH` or `-NH2`.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Rule 2's SMARTS pattern `['[NX3H2]', '[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]']` should be refined to ensure it captures the presence of an amino group and a linear aliphatic chain of 4 to 6 carbons. The current pattern may not accurately reflect the linearity or the specific length of the aliphatic chain.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For Rule 3, the SMARTS `['[OX2H]', '[c][OX2H]']` should be adjusted to ensure it captures the presence of a hydroxyl group on an aromatic ring with additional electron-donating groups. The current pattern may not fully capture the requirement for additional electron-donating groups.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Rule 4's SMARTS `['[OX2][C;X4][OX2]']` should be revised to specifically look for multiple ether linkages without additional functional groups. The current pattern may not accurately reflect the absence of other functional groups.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: For Rule 5, the SMARTS `['[SX2H]', '[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]']` should be refined to ensure it captures a sulfanyl group with a short aliphatic chain (up to 3 carbons). The current pattern may not accurately reflect the specific length of the aliphatic chain.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents (e.g., -OH, -NH2) tend to result in a high yield. These groups enhance coordination with the metal center, stabilizing the catalyst. Examples include 4-aminobenzoic acid and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with an amino group (-NH2) and a linear aliphatic chain of 4 to 6 carbons, without additional electron-withdrawing groups, tend to result in a high yield. The amino group enhances coordination, while the aliphatic chain provides steric effects that favor the reaction. Examples include 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a hydroxyl group (-OH) and an aromatic ring with additional electron-donating groups tend to result in a high yield. The hydroxyl group participates in hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst structure. Examples include 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (-O-) and no additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The flexibility and decreased rigidity of the catalyst structure negatively impact the reaction. Examples include 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing a sulfanyl group (-SH) with a short aliphatic chain (up to 3 carbons) tend to result in a high yield. The sulfanyl group provides strong coordination with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a nitro group (-NO2) on an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group stabilizes the metal center, enhancing the reaction. An example is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) and additional electron-donating groups on the aromatic ring can result in a high yield. The electron-donating groups may counteract the destabilizing effect of the trifluoromethyl group. An example is 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing an indole group tend to result in a high yield. The indole group provides π-π interactions and additional coordination sites, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. An example is (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring tend to result in a high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring coordinates with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing a formyl group (-CHO) on an aromatic ring with additional electron-donating groups may result in a high yield. The electron-donating groups can mitigate the negative impact of the formyl group. An example is 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring and electron-withdrawing groups such as sulfonyl (-SO2-) or carbonyl (-C=O) groups tend to result in a low yield. These groups may destabilize the metal center. Examples include 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a branched aliphatic chain containing an amino group (-NH2) and additional electron-donating groups may result in a high yield. The electron-donating groups can enhance coordination despite the branching. An example is (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbons) and additional electron-donating groups can result in a high yield. The electron-donating groups may enhance coordination and reduce steric hindrance. An example is 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with electron-withdrawing substituents tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature reduces the electron density on the nitrogen, affecting coordination. An example is 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring and electron-donating groups such as methoxy (-OCH3) or ethoxy (-OC2H5) tend to result in a high yield. These groups enhance the electron density on the aromatic ring, stabilizing the metal center. An example is 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.

** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern `['[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]', '[c][OX2H]', '[c][NX3H2]']` does not fully capture the requirement of a carboxylic acid group and an aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents. Consider using a SMARTS pattern that specifically identifies a carboxylic acid group attached to an aromatic ring with electron-donating groups like `-OH` or `-NH2`.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Rule 2's SMARTS pattern `['[NX3H2]', '[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]']` should be refined to ensure it captures the presence of an amino group and a linear aliphatic chain of 4 to 6 carbons. The current pattern may not accurately identify the chain length or the absence of electron-withdrawing groups.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For Rule 3, the SMARTS `['[OX2H]', '[c][OX2H]']` should be adjusted to ensure it captures the presence of a hydroxyl group on an aromatic ring with additional electron-donating groups. The current pattern may not fully represent the rule's conditions.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Rule 4's SMARTS `['[OX2][C;X4][OX2]']` needs to be more specific to identify multiple ether linkages without additional functional groups. Consider refining the pattern to better match the structural description.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: Rule 5's SMARTS `['[SX2H]', '[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]']` should be checked to ensure it captures a sulfanyl group with a short aliphatic chain (up to 3 carbons). The current pattern may not accurately reflect the chain length.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: For Rule 6, the SMARTS `['[c][NX3+](=O)[O-]']` should be verified to ensure it captures a nitro group on an aromatic ring. The pattern seems appropriate, but ensure it matches the intended structure.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: Rule 7's SMARTS `['[CX4](F)(F)F', '[c][OX2H]']` should be refined to capture a trifluoromethyl group with additional electron-donating groups on the aromatic ring. The current pattern may not fully represent the rule's conditions.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: For Rule 8, the SMARTS `['c1c[nH]c2c1cccc2']` seems appropriate for identifying an indole group. Ensure it matches the intended structure in the SMILES.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: Rule 9's SMARTS `['c1ccncc1']` should be checked to ensure it captures a pyridine ring. The pattern seems appropriate, but ensure it matches the intended structure.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Rule 10's SMARTS `['[CX3H]=O', '[c][OX2H]']` should be refined to capture a formyl group on an aromatic ring with additional electron-donating groups. The current pattern may not fully represent the rule's conditions.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: For Rule 11, the SMARTS `['[c][SX4](=O)(=O)']` should be verified to ensure it captures an aromatic ring with electron-withdrawing groups such as sulfonyl or carbonyl groups. The pattern seems appropriate, but ensure it matches the intended structure.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: Rule 12's SMARTS `['[NX3H2]', '[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]']` should be refined to ensure it captures a branched aliphatic chain containing an amino group and additional electron-donating groups. The current pattern may not accurately reflect the branching.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: For Rule 13, the SMARTS `['[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]', '[OX2H]']` should be refined to ensure it captures a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbons) with additional electron-donating groups. The current pattern may not fully represent the rule's conditions.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: Rule 14's SMARTS `['c1ccncc1', '[c][SX4](=O)(=O)']` should be refined to ensure it captures a pyridine ring with electron-withdrawing substituents. The current pattern may not fully represent the rule's conditions.

- ** Suggestion 15 **: For Rule 15, the SMARTS `['[c][OX2H]', '[c][OX2H]']` should be refined to ensure it captures an aromatic ring with electron-donating groups such as methoxy or ethoxy. The current pattern may not fully represent the rule's conditions.

Metric Commenter Message:
Based on the current metrics and comparing them to the reference metrics, we can make several observations about the performance of the current rules:

1. **Train Support**: The current train support is 0.0229, which is lower than the previous reference metrics (0.1667 and 0.1845). This indicates that the current rules apply to a smaller portion of the dataset, suggesting that they might be too specific or not capturing a significant portion of the data.

2. **Train Confidence**: The current train confidence is 0.5333, which is slightly lower than some of the previous reference metrics (0.6352 and 0.5396). This suggests that the rules are moderately reliable in predicting the outcome, but there is room for improvement to increase the confidence level.

3. **Train Lift**: The current train lift is 1.0786, which is slightly above 1, indicating that the rules provide some predictive power beyond random chance. However, this lift is lower than some of the previous iterations (e.g., 1.2237, 1.1383, 1.1899), suggesting that the current rules are not as impactful in increasing the likelihood of the predicted outcome compared to earlier iterations.

4. **Train Leverage**: The current train leverage is 0.0005, which is quite low. This indicates that the rules do not provide much additional support over what would be expected by chance. Previous iterations had higher leverage values (e.g., 0.0093, 0.0057), suggesting that the current rules are not as effective in identifying strong associations.

### Recommendations for Improvement:

- **Broaden Rule Applicability**: Consider revising the rules to capture a larger portion of the dataset. This could involve generalizing some of the conditions or exploring additional combinations of functional groups that might lead to high yields.

- **Enhance Predictive Power**: Focus on refining the rules to increase confidence and lift. This might involve identifying key functional groups or structural features that consistently lead to high yields and incorporating them into the rules.

- **Increase Leverage**: Aim to identify rules that provide a stronger association than expected by chance. This could involve exploring interactions between different functional groups or considering the impact of steric and electronic effects in more detail.

- **Iterate and Validate**: Continue iterating on the rules, using both the training and test datasets to validate improvements. Ensure that any changes lead to consistent improvements across different datasets.

Overall, while the current rules show some predictive capability, there is significant room for improvement in terms of confidence, lift, and leverage. By refining the rules to capture more generalizable patterns and stronger associations, the overall performance can be enhanced.

### Performance Evaluation of Current Rules

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
   - The current rules seem to be struggling with effectiveness, as indicated by the validation accuracy of 0.5143, which is lower than the previous iterations. This suggests that the rules may not be capturing the underlying patterns in the data effectively.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting:**
   - The fluctuating validation accuracies across iterations suggest potential overfitting or underfitting issues. The model's performance does not consistently improve, indicating that the rules might be too specific to certain data points or not capturing enough general patterns.

3. **Discrepancies Analysis:**
   - For molecules where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low, rules with high positive SHAP values (e.g., Rule 7, Rule 10, Rule 13) might be contributing to overestimation. These rules may need refinement to reduce their influence on predictions.
   - Conversely, for molecules where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, rules with high negative SHAP values (e.g., Rule 2, Rule 3, Rule 6) might be causing underestimation. These rules may need adjustment to increase their contribution to predictions.

4. **Accuracy Improvements:**
   - The current accuracy metrics suggest limited improvement potential with the existing rules. The validation accuracy has not shown significant improvement over iterations, indicating that the rules may have reached a local minimum.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**
   - SHAP analysis highlights specific rules that consistently contribute to incorrect predictions. For instance, Rule 7 and Rule 10 often have high positive SHAP values for overestimated loadings, suggesting they might be too aggressive in predicting high loadings.
   - Rules with high negative SHAP values, such as Rule 2 and Rule 3, might be too conservative, leading to underestimated loadings.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Overestimated Rules:**
   - Rules like Rule 7 and Rule 10, which frequently have high positive SHAP values, should be refined to reduce their impact on predictions. Consider narrowing the conditions under which these rules apply or adjusting the weight of their contribution.

2. **Adjust Underestimated Rules:**
   - Rules such as Rule 2 and Rule 3, which often have high negative SHAP values, should be adjusted to increase their influence. This could involve broadening the conditions or increasing the weight of their contribution.

3. **Improve Generalization:**
   - To address overfitting or underfitting, consider introducing new rules that capture broader patterns in the data. This could involve identifying new functional groups or structural motifs that correlate with high or low loadings.

4. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - Use insights from SHAP analysis to iteratively refine the rules. Focus on rules that consistently contribute to incorrect predictions and adjust them based on the patterns observed in the SHAP values.

5. **Evaluate Rule Effectiveness:**
   - Continuously evaluate the effectiveness of refined rules by monitoring changes in validation accuracy and SHAP value distributions. This will help ensure that rule adjustments lead to improved model performance.

By implementing these recommendations, the rules can be refined to better capture the underlying patterns in the data, leading to improved model performance and more accurate predictions.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents (e.g., -OH, -NH2) tend to result in a high yield. These groups enhance coordination with the metal center, stabilizing the catalyst. Examples include 4-aminobenzoic acid and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with an amino group (-NH2) and a linear aliphatic chain of 4 to 6 carbons, without additional electron-withdrawing groups, tend to result in a high yield. The amino group enhances coordination, while the aliphatic chain provides steric effects that favor the reaction. Examples include 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a hydroxyl group (-OH) and an aromatic ring with additional electron-donating groups tend to result in a high yield. The hydroxyl group participates in hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst structure. Examples include 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (-O-) and no additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The flexibility and decreased rigidity of the catalyst structure negatively impact the reaction. Examples include 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing a sulfanyl group (-SH) with a short aliphatic chain (up to 3 carbons) tend to result in a high yield. The sulfanyl group provides strong coordination with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a nitro group (-NO2) on an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group stabilizes the metal center, enhancing the reaction. An example is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) and additional electron-donating groups on the aromatic ring can result in a high yield. The electron-donating groups may counteract the destabilizing effect of the trifluoromethyl group. An example is 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing an indole group tend to result in a high yield. The indole group provides π-π interactions and additional coordination sites, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. An example is (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring tend to result in a high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring coordinates with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing a formyl group (-CHO) on an aromatic ring with additional electron-donating groups may result in a high yield. The electron-donating groups can mitigate the negative impact of the formyl group. An example is 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring and electron-withdrawing groups such as sulfonyl (-SO2-) or carbonyl (-C=O) groups tend to result in a low yield. These groups may destabilize the metal center. Examples include 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a branched aliphatic chain containing an amino group (-NH2) and additional electron-donating groups may result in a high yield. The electron-donating groups can enhance coordination despite the branching. An example is (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbons) and additional electron-donating groups can result in a high yield. The electron-donating groups may enhance coordination and reduce steric hindrance. An example is 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with electron-withdrawing substituents tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature reduces the electron density on the nitrogen, affecting coordination. An example is 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring and electron-donating groups such as methoxy (-OCH3) or ethoxy (-OC2H5) tend to result in a high yield. These groups enhance the electron density on the aromatic ring, stabilizing the metal center. An example is 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.

Matrix Checker Message:
Upon reviewing the feature matrix and the rules, I have identified several discrepancies and areas for improvement in the code. Here are my suggestions:

** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern `['[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]', '[c][OX2H]', '[c][NX3H2]']` does not fully capture the requirement of having both a carboxylic acid group and an aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents. The pattern should be adjusted to ensure both conditions are met simultaneously, possibly by using a single SMARTS pattern that combines these features.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Rule 2's SMARTS pattern `['[NX3H2]', '[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]']` should be refined to ensure the amino group is directly connected to a linear aliphatic chain of 4 to 6 carbons. The current pattern may not enforce the linearity or the specific chain length.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For Rule 3, the SMARTS pattern `['[OX2H]', '[c][OX2H]']` should be modified to ensure the hydroxyl group is part of an aromatic ring with additional electron-donating groups. The current pattern may not enforce the presence of additional electron-donating groups.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Rule 4's pattern `['[OX2][C;X4][OX2]']` should be checked to ensure it captures multiple ether linkages correctly. The current pattern might not account for the absence of additional functional groups, which is crucial for predicting low yield.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: For Rule 5, the pattern `['[SX2H]', '[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]']` should be refined to ensure the sulfanyl group is connected to a short aliphatic chain (up to 3 carbons). The current pattern might not enforce the chain length correctly.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Rule 6's pattern `['[NX3+](=O)[O-]', '[c]']` should be checked to ensure it captures the nitro group on an aromatic ring accurately. The current pattern might not enforce the aromatic context properly.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: For Rule 7, the pattern `['c1c[nH]c2c1cccc2']` seems appropriate for identifying indole groups. However, ensure that the pattern is specific enough to avoid false positives.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Rule 8's pattern `['c1ccncc1']` for pyridine rings should be checked for specificity, ensuring it does not match other similar structures incorrectly.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: For Rule 9, the pattern `['[c][SX4](=O)(=O)', '[c][CX3](=O)']` should be refined to ensure it captures the presence of sulfonyl or carbonyl groups on an aromatic ring accurately. The current pattern might not enforce the aromatic context properly.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Rule 10's pattern `['[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]']` should be checked to ensure it captures long aliphatic chains correctly. The current pattern might not enforce the absence of additional functional groups.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: For Rule 11, the pattern `['c1ccncc1', '[c][CX3](=O)']` should be refined to ensure it captures pyridine rings with electron-withdrawing groups accurately. The current pattern might not enforce the presence of electron-withdrawing groups.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: Rule 12's pattern `['[c][OX2][C;X4][OX2]']` should be checked to ensure it captures aromatic rings with methoxy or ethoxy groups accurately. The current pattern might not enforce the presence of these specific groups.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: For Rule 13, the pattern `['[c][CX3H]=O']` should be refined to ensure it captures formyl groups on an aromatic ring without additional electron-donating groups. The current pattern might not enforce the absence of electron-donating groups.

** End of Suggestions **

The transformation from language rules to the numeric feature matrix is not fully effective, as there are several discrepancies between the rules and the generated matrix. The SMARTS patterns need to be refined to accurately capture the structural descriptions outlined in the rules.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents (e.g., -OH, -NH2) tend to result in a high yield. These groups enhance coordination with the metal center, stabilizing the catalyst. Examples include 4-aminobenzoic acid and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with an amino group (-NH2) and a linear aliphatic chain of 4 to 6 carbons, without additional electron-withdrawing groups, tend to result in a high yield. The amino group enhances coordination, while the aliphatic chain provides steric effects that favor the reaction. Examples include 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a hydroxyl group (-OH) and an aromatic ring with additional electron-donating groups tend to result in a high yield. The hydroxyl group participates in hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst structure. Examples include 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (-O-) and no additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The flexibility and decreased rigidity of the catalyst structure negatively impact the reaction. Examples include 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing a sulfanyl group (-SH) with a short aliphatic chain (up to 3 carbons) tend to result in a high yield. The sulfanyl group provides strong coordination with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a nitro group (-NO2) on an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group stabilizes the metal center, enhancing the reaction. An example is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing an indole group tend to result in a high yield. The indole group provides π-π interactions and additional coordination sites, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. An example is (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring tend to result in a high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring coordinates with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring and electron-withdrawing groups such as sulfonyl (-SO2-) or carbonyl (-C=O) groups tend to result in a low yield. These groups may destabilize the metal center. Examples include 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbons) without additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The lack of functional groups may reduce coordination with the metal center. An example is octanoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with electron-withdrawing substituents tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature reduces the electron density on the nitrogen, affecting coordination. An example is 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring and electron-donating groups such as methoxy (-OCH3) or ethoxy (-OC2H5) tend to result in a high yield. These groups enhance the electron density on the aromatic ring, stabilizing the metal center. An example is 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) on an aromatic ring without additional electron-donating groups tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the formyl group destabilizes the metal center. An example is 4-formylbenzoic acid.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern should include both the carboxylic acid group and an aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents. The current pattern '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]' only captures the carboxylic acid group. Consider adding a pattern for electron-donating groups like '[c][OX2H]' or '[c][NX3H2]' to ensure both conditions are met.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Rule 2's SMARTS pattern '[NX3H2]', '[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]' should be revised to ensure it captures a linear aliphatic chain of 4 to 6 carbons. The current pattern may not accurately reflect the chain length requirement. Consider using a more specific pattern that checks for the exact number of carbon atoms.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For Rule 3, the SMARTS pattern '[OX2H]', '[c][OX2H]' should be checked to ensure it captures both the hydroxyl group and the aromatic ring with additional electron-donating groups. The current pattern may not fully capture the requirement for additional electron-donating groups.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Rule 4's pattern '[OX2][C;X4][OX2]' should be reviewed to ensure it captures multiple ether linkages. The current pattern may not be specific enough to identify multiple ether linkages without additional functional groups.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: For Rule 5, the SMARTS pattern '[SX2H]', '[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]' should be checked to ensure it captures a sulfanyl group with a short aliphatic chain (up to 3 carbons). The current pattern may not accurately reflect the chain length requirement.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Rule 6's pattern '[NX3+](=O)[O-]', '[c]' should be reviewed to ensure it captures a nitro group on an aromatic ring. The current pattern may not fully capture the requirement for the nitro group to be on an aromatic ring.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: For Rule 7, the SMARTS pattern 'c1c[nH]c2c1cccc2' should be checked to ensure it captures the indole group. The current pattern seems appropriate, but ensure it matches the intended structure in the SMILES.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Rule 8's pattern 'c1ccncc1' should be reviewed to ensure it captures the pyridine ring. The current pattern seems appropriate, but ensure it matches the intended structure in the SMILES.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: For Rule 9, the SMARTS pattern '[c][SX4](=O)(=O)', '[c][CX3](=O)' should be checked to ensure it captures an aromatic ring with sulfonyl or carbonyl groups. The current pattern may need refinement to ensure both conditions are met.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Rule 10's pattern '[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]' should be reviewed to ensure it captures a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbons). The current pattern may not accurately reflect the chain length requirement.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: For Rule 11, the SMARTS pattern 'c1ccncc1', '[c][CX3](=O)' should be checked to ensure it captures a pyridine ring with electron-withdrawing groups. The current pattern may need refinement to ensure both conditions are met.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: Rule 12's pattern '[c][OX2][C;X4][OX2]' should be reviewed to ensure it captures an aromatic ring with methoxy or ethoxy groups. The current pattern may not fully capture the requirement for these specific electron-donating groups.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: For Rule 13, the SMARTS pattern '[c][CX3H]=O' should be checked to ensure it captures a formyl group on an aromatic ring without additional electron-donating groups. The current pattern may need refinement to ensure both conditions are met.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern should include both the carboxylic acid group and the aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents. The current pattern '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]' only captures the carboxylic acid group. Consider using a pattern that also includes electron-donating groups like -OH or -NH2 on an aromatic ring.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Rule 2's SMARTS pattern '[NX3H2]', '[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]' does not ensure the aliphatic chain is linear and between 4 to 6 carbons. Consider refining the pattern to specifically match linear chains of the correct length.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For Rule 3, the SMARTS pattern '[OX2H]', '[c][OX2H]' should ensure the presence of additional electron-donating groups on the aromatic ring, not just a hydroxyl group. The current pattern may not fully capture this requirement.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Rule 4's pattern '[OX2][C;X4][OX2]' may not accurately capture multiple ether linkages. Consider using a pattern that can match multiple occurrences of ether linkages in a single molecule.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: Rule 5's pattern '[SX2H]', '[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]' should ensure the aliphatic chain is short (up to 3 carbons). The current pattern does not enforce this length restriction.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: For Rule 6, the pattern '[NX3+](=O)[O-]', '[c]' should ensure the nitro group is on an aromatic ring. The current pattern may not strictly enforce this condition.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: Rule 9's pattern '[c][SX4](=O)(=O)', '[c][CX3](=O)' should ensure the presence of electron-withdrawing groups like sulfonyl or carbonyl on an aromatic ring. Verify that the pattern accurately captures these groups.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Rule 10's pattern '[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]' should ensure the aliphatic chain is long (more than 6 carbons) and without additional functional groups. The current pattern may not enforce the absence of functional groups.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: For Rule 11, ensure the pattern '[c1ccncc1', '[c][CX3](=O)'] captures the pyridine ring with electron-withdrawing substituents accurately. The current pattern may not fully enforce the presence of these substituents.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Rule 12's pattern '[c][OX2][C;X4][OX2]' should ensure the presence of methoxy or ethoxy groups on an aromatic ring. Verify that the pattern accurately captures these groups.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: For Rule 13, ensure the pattern '[c][CX3H]=O' captures the formyl group on an aromatic ring without additional electron-donating groups. The current pattern may not fully enforce the absence of these groups.

Metric Commenter Message:
Based on the current metrics and comparing them to the reference metrics, here are some observations and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Confidence**: The current train confidence is 0.5064, which is lower than most of the previous iterations. This indicates that the rules are not as reliable in predicting the outcome as before. In previous iterations, confidence values were generally higher, with some reaching above 0.6. This suggests that the current set of rules may not be capturing the underlying patterns as effectively.

2. **Lift**: The current train lift is 1.0239, which is very close to 1. This implies that the rules are not providing much additional information over the baseline probability of the outcome. In previous iterations, lift values were generally higher, indicating that the rules were more effective in identifying associations that were not due to chance. A lift value close to 1 suggests that the current rules might not be significantly better than random guessing.

3. **Leverage**: The current train leverage is negative (-0.00295), which indicates that the observed support for the rules is less than what would be expected if the items were independent. This is a concerning sign, as it suggests that the rules might be capturing spurious associations rather than meaningful patterns. Previous iterations had positive leverage values, indicating stronger associations.

4. **Support**: The current train support is 0.0198, which is lower than most previous iterations. While support is not the primary focus, lower support can indicate that the rules are applicable to a smaller portion of the dataset, which might limit their generalizability.

### Suggestions for Improvement:

- **Refine Rule Conditions**: Consider revisiting the conditions of the rules to ensure they are capturing the most relevant features. This might involve incorporating additional chemical properties or interactions that were not previously considered.

- **Increase Rule Specificity**: Some rules might be too broad, leading to lower confidence and lift. Narrowing down the conditions to more specific scenarios could help improve the predictive power of the rules.

- **Explore New Features**: Introduce new features or modify existing ones to capture more complex interactions. This could involve using domain knowledge to identify potential modifiers or interactions that have not been considered.

- **Evaluate Rule Redundancy**: Check for redundancy among the rules. If multiple rules are capturing similar patterns, it might be beneficial to consolidate them or focus on the most effective ones.

- **Iterate and Test**: Continue iterating on the rules and testing them against the dataset. Consider using cross-validation to ensure that the rules generalize well to unseen data.

Overall, the current metrics suggest that the rules are not performing as well as they could be, particularly in terms of confidence and lift. By refining the rules and exploring new features, it may be possible to improve their performance and achieve better predictive accuracy.

Traditional Commenter Message:
### Performance Evaluation of Current Rules

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
   - The current rules seem to be struggling with effectiveness, as indicated by the low validation accuracy of 0.4286. This is a significant drop from previous iterations, where accuracies were generally higher, reaching up to 0.6857 in some cases. This suggests that the rules may not be capturing the underlying patterns in the data effectively.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment:**
   - The significant drop in validation accuracy suggests potential overfitting to the training data. The model might be capturing noise rather than the true signal, leading to poor generalization on unseen data. The consistent low accuracy across multiple iterations indicates that the rules might not be flexible enough to adapt to different data distributions.

3. **Discrepancies Analysis:**
   - For molecules where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low, rules with high positive SHAP values are likely problematic. For instance, Rule 7 and Rule 10 often have high positive SHAP values in such cases, indicating they might be overestimating the loading.
   - Conversely, for molecules where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, rules with high negative SHAP values are likely problematic. Rules like Rule 2 and Rule 8 frequently show negative SHAP values, suggesting they might be underestimating the loading.

4. **Accuracy Improvements Interpretation:**
   - The current accuracy metrics suggest limited probability of improvement with the existing rules. The model's performance has not shown consistent improvement across iterations, indicating that the rules may need significant refinement or reevaluation.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**
   - SHAP analysis indicates that certain rules consistently contribute to incorrect predictions. For example, Rule 7 and Rule 10 often have high positive SHAP values for overestimated loadings, while Rule 2 and Rule 8 have high negative SHAP values for underestimated loadings. This suggests these rules might need adjustment to better capture the true relationship between features and outcomes.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Overestimated Loading Rules:**
   - Rules like Rule 7 (indole group) and Rule 10 (long aliphatic chain) should be revisited. Consider incorporating additional conditions or constraints to prevent overestimation, such as considering the presence of other functional groups that might mitigate the effect of these features.

2. **Adjust Underestimated Loading Rules:**
   - Rules like Rule 2 (amino group with aliphatic chain) and Rule 8 (pyridine ring) should be adjusted to better capture cases where these features lead to high loading. This might involve relaxing some constraints or considering interactions with other features that enhance their effect.

3. **Improve Generalization:**
   - To address overfitting, consider simplifying some rules or combining them to reduce complexity. This could help the model generalize better to unseen data by focusing on more robust patterns.

4. **Iterative Refinement Using SHAP Insights:**
   - Use SHAP analysis to iteratively refine rules. For example, if a rule consistently shows high SHAP values for incorrect predictions, investigate the conditions under which this occurs and adjust the rule accordingly. This iterative process can help fine-tune the rules to better align with the data.

5. **Incorporate Additional Features:**
   - Consider incorporating additional features or modifying existing ones based on domain knowledge. This could involve exploring new chemical properties or interactions that might influence catalyst loading, providing a more comprehensive feature set for the model to learn from.

    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents (e.g., -OH, -NH2) tend to result in a high yield. These groups enhance coordination with the metal center, stabilizing the catalyst. Examples include 4-aminobenzoic acid and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with an amino group (-NH2) and a linear aliphatic chain of 4 to 6 carbons, without additional electron-withdrawing groups, tend to result in a high yield. The amino group enhances coordination, while the aliphatic chain provides steric effects that favor the reaction. Examples include 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a hydroxyl group (-OH) and an aromatic ring with additional electron-donating groups tend to result in a high yield. The hydroxyl group participates in hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst structure. Examples include 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (-O-) and no additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The flexibility and decreased rigidity of the catalyst structure negatively impact the reaction. Examples include 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing a sulfanyl group (-SH) with a short aliphatic chain (up to 3 carbons) tend to result in a high yield. The sulfanyl group provides strong coordination with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a nitro group (-NO2) on an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group stabilizes the metal center, enhancing the reaction. An example is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing an indole group tend to result in a high yield. The indole group provides π-π interactions and additional coordination sites, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. An example is (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring tend to result in a high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring coordinates with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring and electron-withdrawing groups such as sulfonyl (-SO2-) or carbonyl (-C=O) groups tend to result in a low yield. These groups may destabilize the metal center. Examples include 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbons) without additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The lack of functional groups may reduce coordination with the metal center. An example is octanoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with electron-withdrawing substituents tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature reduces the electron density on the nitrogen, affecting coordination. An example is 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with an aromatic ring and electron-donating groups such as methoxy (-OCH3) or ethoxy (-OC2H5) tend to result in a high yield. These groups enhance the electron density on the aromatic ring, stabilizing the metal center. An example is 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) on an aromatic ring without additional electron-donating groups tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the formyl group destabilizes the metal center. An example is 4-formylbenzoic acid.
