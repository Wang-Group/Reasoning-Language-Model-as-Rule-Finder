**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both an amino group (-NH2) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) tend to result in a high yield. This rule covers compounds like (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, 5-aminopentanoic acid, and 4-aminobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid group and an additional electron-withdrawing group (such as -NO2 or -Br) tend to result in a high yield. This includes compounds like 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid and 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a high yield. This rule applies to compounds like pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) without additional electron-withdrawing groups tend to result in a high yield. This includes compounds like (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a single carbonyl group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group, without additional aromatic or heterocyclic rings, tend to result in a low yield. This includes compounds like 4-oxoheptanedioic acid and 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with ether linkages (e.g., -O-CH2-CH2-O-) and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a low yield. This applies to compounds like 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a low yield. This includes compounds like 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with an indole ring and an amino acid moiety tend to result in a high yield. This applies to compounds like (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group (e.g., -SH or -S-) and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a high yield. This includes compounds like 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with an acetamido group (-NHCOCH3) and an amino acid moiety tend to result in a low yield. This applies to compounds like (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield. This includes compounds like 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid and 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a hydroxyphenyl group attached to a linear aliphatic chain tend to result in a low yield. This applies to compounds like 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid and 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a benzofuran ring and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a high yield. This includes compounds like 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group (-OH) on an aromatic ring and an aliphatic chain with a carbonyl group tend to result in a low yield. This applies to compounds like 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a pyrazole ring and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a high yield. This includes compounds like 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid.
