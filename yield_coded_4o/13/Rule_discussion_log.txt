- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group (COOH) and an amino group (NH2) tend to result in a high yield. This is likely due to the ability of these groups to coordinate with the metal centers, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. Examples include (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid and 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group attached to a carboxylic acid (e.g., benzoic acid derivatives) generally lead to a high yield if they also contain additional functional groups like amino or hydroxy groups. This suggests that the aromatic ring may facilitate π-π interactions, while the additional groups enhance coordination. Examples include 4-aminobenzoic acid and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a sulfanyl group (SH) and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a high yield. The thiol group can form strong interactions with metal centers, potentially stabilizing the catalyst. An example is 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups (polyols) and a carboxylic acid group generally lead to a high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups can enhance solubility and coordination with the metal centers. An example is (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (NO2) on an aromatic ring can lead to a high yield. This may be due to the increased acidity and coordination ability of the carboxylic acid group. An example is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with long aliphatic chains without additional functional groups (e.g., octanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. This might be due to their ability to enhance the hydrophobic environment around the catalyst, improving its activity.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains tend to result in a low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing nature of fluorine may reduce the coordination ability of the carboxylic acid group. An example is 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with methoxy groups (OCH3) attached to an aliphatic chain or an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield. This could be due to steric hindrance or reduced coordination ability. An example is 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a formyl group (CHO) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield. The formyl group may interfere with the coordination of the carboxylic acid group. Examples include 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid and 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can enhance coordination with metal centers. An example is pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.
