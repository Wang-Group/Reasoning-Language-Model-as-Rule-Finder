**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both a carboxylic acid group (COOH) and an amino group (NH2) tend to result in a high yield. These groups can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity. Examples include (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid and 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group attached to a carboxylic acid and additional functional groups like amino or hydroxy groups generally lead to a high yield. The aromatic ring may facilitate π-π interactions, while additional groups enhance coordination. Examples include 4-aminobenzoic acid and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a sulfanyl group (SH) and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a high yield. The thiol group can form strong interactions with metal centers, potentially stabilizing the catalyst. An example is 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups (polyols) and a carboxylic acid group generally lead to a high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups can enhance solubility and coordination with metal centers. An example is (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can enhance coordination with metal centers. An example is pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains tend to result in a low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing nature of fluorine may reduce the coordination ability of the carboxylic acid group. An example is 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with methoxy groups (OCH3) attached to an aliphatic chain or an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield. This could be due to steric hindrance or reduced coordination ability. An example is 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a formyl group (CHO) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield. The formyl group may interfere with the coordination of the carboxylic acid group. Examples include 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid and 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with long aliphatic chains without additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The lack of polar or coordinating groups may reduce interaction with the catalyst. An example is octanoic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with an indole ring and an amino acid moiety tend to result in a high yield. The indole ring can provide π-π interactions, and the amino acid moiety can enhance coordination. An example is (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a benzofuran ring and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a high yield. The benzofuran ring can facilitate π-π interactions, enhancing the catalyst's reactivity. An example is 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a dimethoxyphenyl group tend to result in a high yield. The methoxy groups on the phenyl ring can enhance electron density and coordination ability. An example is 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a hydroxyl group on an aliphatic chain tend to result in a low yield. The presence of these groups may not provide sufficient coordination or interaction with the catalyst. An example is 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and an aliphatic chain tend to result in a high yield. The pyridine ring can enhance coordination with metal centers, and the aliphatic chain can provide flexibility. An example is 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a nitro group (NO2) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. The nitro group can enhance electron density and coordination ability. An example is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.
