- **Rule 1**: If the molecular modifier contains an amino acid structure (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid), the yield is likely to be high. This is due to the presence of both amino and carboxylic acid groups, which can enhance coordination with the metal center.

- **Rule 2**: If the molecular modifier contains a phenyl group with an electron-withdrawing substituent such as a nitro group (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid), the yield is likely to be high. Electron-withdrawing groups can stabilize the metal complex, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 3**: If the molecular modifier contains a pyridine ring (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, pyridine-3-carboxylic acid), the yield is likely to be high. Pyridine can act as a ligand, coordinating with the metal center and potentially stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: If the molecular modifier contains a sulfanyl group (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid), the yield is likely to be high. Sulfanyl groups can form strong interactions with metal centers, potentially enhancing catalytic performance.

- **Rule 5**: If the molecular modifier contains a methoxy group in a polyether chain (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid), the yield is likely to be low. The presence of bulky ether chains may hinder effective coordination with the metal center.

- **Rule 6**: If the molecular modifier contains a trifluoromethyl group (e.g., 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid), the yield is likely to be low. The strong electron-withdrawing nature of trifluoromethyl groups can destabilize the metal complex.

- **Rule 7**: If the molecular modifier contains a benzofuranone structure (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid), the yield is likely to be high. The rigid aromatic structure can facilitate effective coordination with the metal center.

- **Rule 8**: If the molecular modifier contains a simple aliphatic chain with no additional functional groups (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid), the yield is likely to be low. Lack of functional groups may result in poor coordination with the metal center.

- **Rule 9**: If the molecular modifier contains a formyl group on a phenyl ring (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid), the yield is likely to be low. The formyl group can act as an electron-withdrawing group, potentially destabilizing the metal complex.

- **Rule 10**: If the molecular modifier contains multiple hydroxyl groups (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), the yield is likely to be high. Hydroxyl groups can form hydrogen bonds and coordinate with the metal center, enhancing stability.

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: If the molecular modifier contains both amino and carboxylic acid groups, the yield is likely to be high. These groups enhance coordination with the metal center, as seen in amino acids like (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid and (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid.

- **Rule 2**: If the molecular modifier contains a phenyl group with an electron-withdrawing substituent such as a nitro or bromomethyl group, the yield is likely to be high. These groups stabilize the metal complex, enhancing catalytic activity, as observed with 4-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: If the molecular modifier contains a pyridine ring, the yield is likely to be high. Pyridine acts as a ligand, coordinating with the metal center and stabilizing the catalyst, as seen in pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 4**: If the molecular modifier contains multiple hydroxyl groups, the yield is likely to be high. Hydroxyl groups form hydrogen bonds and coordinate with the metal center, enhancing stability, as observed with (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: If the molecular modifier contains a sulfanyl group (thiol) in a short aliphatic chain, the yield is likely to be high. Thiol groups provide strong coordination with metal centers, as seen in 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: If the molecular modifier contains a trifluoromethyl group without additional coordinating groups, the yield is likely to be low. The electron-withdrawing nature of trifluoromethyl groups can destabilize the metal complex, as observed with 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: If the molecular modifier contains a simple aliphatic chain longer than six carbons with no additional functional groups, the yield is likely to be low. Lack of functional groups results in poor coordination with the metal center, as observed with octanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: If the molecular modifier contains a phenyl group with a formyl group and lacks other coordinating groups, the yield is likely to be low. The formyl group acts as an electron-withdrawing group, potentially destabilizing the metal complex, as seen in 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: If the molecular modifier contains a phenyl group with a methyl substituent and lacks other electron-withdrawing groups, the yield is likely to be low. The methyl group increases steric hindrance, reducing effective coordination, as seen in 4-methylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 10**: If the molecular modifier contains a methoxy group in a polyether chain, the yield is likely to be low. Bulky ether chains may hinder effective coordination with the metal center, as seen in 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 11**: If the molecular modifier contains a phenyl group with a hydroxyl substituent and no additional electron-withdrawing groups, the yield is likely to be low. The hydroxyl group can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds, reducing its availability for coordination, as seen in 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: If the molecular modifier contains a phenyl group with a sulfanyl group, the yield is likely to be low. The sulfanyl group can form strong intramolecular interactions, reducing its availability for coordination, as seen in 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: If the molecular modifier contains a phenyl group with a carboxylic acid group and lacks other electron-withdrawing groups, the yield is likely to be low. The carboxylic acid group can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds, reducing its availability for coordination, as seen in 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: If the molecular modifier contains a phenyl group with a hydroxyl group and an additional electron-withdrawing group, the yield is likely to be high. The electron-withdrawing group can enhance the coordination ability of the hydroxyl group, as seen in 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: If the molecular modifier contains an indole ring, the yield is likely to be high. The indole ring can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing the stability of the catalyst, as seen in (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.
