**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both a carboxylic acid group (COOH) and an amino group (NH2) tend to result in a high yield. This is supported by examples such as (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid and (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid group (e.g., benzoic acid derivatives) generally lead to a high yield, especially when additional electron-donating groups are present, such as hydroxyl (OH) or amino (NH2) groups. Examples include 4-aminobenzoic acid and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring attached to a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a low yield unless additional electron-donating groups are present. For instance, 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid results in a low yield, while pyridine-3-carboxylic acid results in a high yield.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group (SH) tend to result in a high yield, as seen in 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid and 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with multiple methoxy groups (OCH3) tend to result in a low yield, as seen in 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid and 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a formyl group (CHO) attached to a phenyl ring tend to result in a low yield, as observed in 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with an indole group tend to result in a high yield, as seen in (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a trifluoroacetyl group (CF3CO) tend to result in a low yield, as seen in 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group (OH) on a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbons) tend to result in a low yield, as seen in 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a benzofuranone structure tend to result in a high yield, as seen in 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a nitro group (NO2) attached to a phenyl ring tend to result in a high yield, as seen in 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with an acetamido group (CH3CONH) and an amino group (NH2) on the same molecule tend to result in a low yield, as seen in (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a pyrazole ring attached to a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a high yield, as seen in 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group (OH) on a phenyl ring without additional electron-withdrawing groups tend to result in a high yield, as seen in 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbons) without any functional groups tend to result in a low yield, as seen in octanoic acid.
