- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both an amino group (-NH2) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) tend to result in a high yield. This is supported by compounds like (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid and 5-aminopentanoic acid. Ensure the SMARTS pattern captures variations in chain length and branching.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group attached to a carboxylic acid group, especially when additional electron-donating groups like hydroxyl (-OH) are present, tend to result in a high yield. Examples include 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid. Consider the influence of electron-withdrawing groups like nitro (-NO2) or halogens.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a sulfur group (e.g., sulfanyl, -SH) in combination with a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a high yield. This is seen in compounds like 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid. Evaluate the impact of sulfur's position within the molecule.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a high yield. An example is pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups (polyols) and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a high yield. An example is (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing a nitro group (-NO2) attached to a phenyl ring with a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a high yield. An example is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to a phenyl ring with a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a low yield. Examples include 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) attached to a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a low yield. An example is 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid. Consider the position and surrounding environment of the trifluoromethyl group.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with an ether linkage (e.g., methoxy, -OCH3) and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a low yield. An example is 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with an acetamido group (-NHCOCH3) and an amino group tend to result in a low yield. An example is (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid. Refine the conditions by examining the impact of the acetamido group in different structural contexts.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers containing both amino and hydroxyl groups along with a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a high yield. An example is 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a benzofuranone structure and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a high yield. An example is 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and an additional functional group such as an amino or hydroxyl group tend to result in a high yield. An example is 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a phenyl group and an acyl group (e.g., ketone or aldehyde) tend to result in a low yield. An example is 4-oxoheptanedioic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbons) and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a low yield. An example is octanoic acid. Consider different chain lengths to better capture their specific effects on yield.
