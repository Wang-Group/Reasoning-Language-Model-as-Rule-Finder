**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both an amino group (-NH2) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) tend to result in a high yield. This is supported by compounds like (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid and 5-aminopentanoic acid. The presence of additional hydroxyl groups (-OH) can further enhance the yield, as seen in (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group attached to a carboxylic acid group (-C6H4-COOH) and additional electron-withdrawing groups (such as -Br or -NO2) tend to result in a high yield. Examples include 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid and 4-nitrobenzoic acid. This effect is enhanced by the presence of additional electron-withdrawing groups like -CF3.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring attached to a carboxylic acid group (-C5H4N-COOH) tend to result in a high yield. Examples include pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid. The presence of additional electron-donating groups such as -OH can further enhance the yield.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group (-SH) attached to a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a high yield, as observed in 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid. The presence of additional polar groups can enhance this effect.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a benzofuranone structure tend to result in a high yield, as seen in 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid. This effect is particularly pronounced when additional electron-donating groups are present.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to a benzoic acid structure tend to result in a low yield, as seen in 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid and 4-formylbenzoic acid. However, the presence of strong electron-donating groups can mitigate this effect.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a methoxy group (-OCH3) attached to an ether chain tend to result in a low yield, as seen in 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid. This effect is particularly pronounced in the absence of other polar groups.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a trifluoroacetyl group (-CF3CO-) tend to result in a low yield, as observed in 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid. However, the presence of additional electron-donating groups can mitigate this effect.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a phenyl group attached to an amino acid backbone tend to result in a low yield, as seen in (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid. This effect is particularly pronounced when additional bulky groups are present.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain and a terminal hydroxyl group (-OH) tend to result in a low yield, as seen in 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid. However, the presence of additional polar groups can mitigate this effect.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a benzene ring and an electron-withdrawing group (such as -NO2) tend to result in a high yield, as seen in 4-nitrobenzoic acid. Other electron-withdrawing groups like -CF3 can also contribute to high yields.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group (-OH) on a phenyl ring tend to result in a low yield, as seen in 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid and 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid. The presence of additional electron-withdrawing groups can enhance this effect.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and a formyl group (-CHO) tend to result in a low yield, as seen in 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid. The presence of additional electron-donating groups can mitigate this effect.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a benzene ring and a sulfanyl group (-SH) tend to result in a low yield, as seen in 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid. However, the presence of additional electron-withdrawing groups can mitigate this effect.
