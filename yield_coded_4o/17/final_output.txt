- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to a benzoic acid structure tend to result in a low yield, as seen in 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid and 4-formylbenzoic acid. However, if additional electron-donating groups are present, this effect may be mitigated.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a methoxy group (-OCH3) attached to an ether chain tend to result in a low yield, as seen in 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a trifluoroacetyl group (-CF3CO-) tend to result in a low yield, as observed in 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a phenyl group attached to an amino acid backbone tend to result in a low yield, as seen in (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain and a terminal hydroxyl group (-OH) tend to result in a low yield, as seen in 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid. However, if additional polar groups are present, this effect may be mitigated.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a benzene ring and an electron-withdrawing group (such as -NO2) tend to result in a high yield, as seen in 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and an additional electron-donating group (such as -OH) tend to result in a high yield, as seen in pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a simple aliphatic chain (e.g., octanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield, suggesting that simple structures without additional functional groups can be beneficial. However, this rule should be applied cautiously, considering the overall molecular context.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to a hydroxybenzoic acid structure tend to result in a low yield, as seen in 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid. This effect is particularly pronounced in the absence of other electron-donating groups.

Additionally, the presence of hydroxyl groups (-OH) can further enhance the yield, as seen in (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group attached to a carboxylic acid group (-C6H4-COOH) and additional electron-withdrawing groups (such as -Br or -NO2) tend to result in a high yield. Examples include 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid and 4-nitrobenzoic acid. Other electron-withdrawing groups like -CF3 can also contribute to high yields.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring attached to a carboxylic acid group (-C5H4N-COOH) tend to result in a high yield. Examples include pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid. The presence of additional electron-donating groups such as -OH can further enhance the yield.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group (-SH) attached to a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a high yield, as observed in 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid. The presence of additional polar groups can enhance this effect.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a benzofuranone structure tend to result in a high yield, as seen in 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid. This effect is particularly pronounced when additional electron-donating groups are present.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to a benzoic acid structure tend to result in a low yield, as seen in 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid and 4-formylbenzoic acid. However, the presence of strong electron-donating groups can mitigate this effect.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a methoxy group (-OCH3) attached to an ether chain tend to result in a low yield, as seen in 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid. This effect is particularly pronounced in the absence of other polar groups.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain and a terminal hydroxyl group (-OH) tend to result in a low yield, as seen in 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid. However, the presence of additional polar groups can mitigate this effect.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a benzene ring and an electron-withdrawing group (such as -NO2) tend to result in a high yield, as seen in 4-nitrobenzoic acid. Other electron-withdrawing groups like -CF3 can also contribute to high yields.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both an amino group (-NH2) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) tend to result in a high yield. This is supported by compounds like (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid and 5-aminopentanoic acid. Additionally, the presence of hydroxyl groups (-OH) can further enhance the yield, as seen in (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group attached to a carboxylic acid group (-C6H4-COOH) and additional electron-withdrawing groups (such as -Br or -NO2) tend to result in a high yield. Examples include 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid and 4-nitrobenzoic acid. Other electron-withdrawing groups like -CF3 can also contribute to high yields.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring attached to a carboxylic acid group (-C5H4N-COOH) tend to result in a high yield. Examples include pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid. The presence of additional electron-donating groups such as -OH can further enhance the yield.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group (-SH) attached to a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a high yield, as observed in 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid. The presence of additional polar groups can enhance this effect.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a benzofuranone structure tend to result in a high yield, as seen in 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid. This effect is particularly pronounced when additional electron-donating groups are present.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to a benzoic acid structure tend to result in a low yield, as seen in 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid and 4-formylbenzoic acid. However, the presence of strong electron-donating groups can mitigate this effect.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a methoxy group (-OCH3) attached to an ether chain tend to result in a low yield, as seen in 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid. This effect is particularly pronounced in the absence of other polar groups.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a trifluoroacetyl group (-CF3CO-) tend to result in a low yield, as observed in 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid. However, the presence of additional electron-donating groups can mitigate this effect.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a phenyl group attached to an amino acid backbone tend to result in a low yield, as seen in (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid. This effect is particularly pronounced when additional bulky groups are present.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain and a terminal hydroxyl group (-OH) tend to result in a low yield, as seen in 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid. However, the presence of additional polar groups can mitigate this effect.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a benzene ring and an electron-withdrawing group (such as -NO2) tend to result in a high yield, as seen in 4-nitrobenzoic acid. Other electron-withdrawing groups like -CF3 can also contribute to high yields.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a simple aliphatic chain (e.g., octanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield, suggesting that simple structures without additional functional groups can be beneficial. However, this rule should be applied cautiously, considering the overall molecular context and the presence of polar groups.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group (-OH) on a phenyl ring tend to result in a low yield, as seen in 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid and 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid. The presence of additional electron-withdrawing groups can enhance this effect.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and a formyl group (-CHO) tend to result in a low yield, as seen in 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid. The presence of additional electron-donating groups can mitigate this effect.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a benzene ring and a sulfanyl group (-SH) tend to result in a low yield, as seen in 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid. However, the presence of additional electron-withdrawing groups can mitigate this effect.
