**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an amino group (-NH2) tend to result in high yield. This is likely due to the ability of these groups to coordinate with metal centers, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. Examples: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid group tend to result in low yield. The presence of a bulky aromatic ring may hinder the effective coordination with the metal center. Examples: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, 4-methylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure, tend to result in high yield. These groups can form multiple hydrogen bonds, potentially stabilizing the catalyst structure. Example: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group (e.g., sulfanyl) and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield. The sulfur atom may provide additional coordination sites or influence the electronic properties of the catalyst. Examples: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid, 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (-NO2) on an aromatic ring tend to result in high yield. These groups can alter the electronic environment, potentially enhancing the catalytic activity. Example: 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with long aliphatic chains (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The hydrophobic nature and steric bulk of long chains may interfere with effective catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring tend to result in variable yields, but when combined with additional functional groups like carboxylic acids, they tend to result in high yield. This may be due to the pyridine's ability to coordinate with metal centers. Example: pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in low yield. The formyl group may not provide effective coordination or stabilization. Examples: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (e.g., polyether chains) tend to result in low yield. The flexibility and potential steric hindrance of these chains may reduce effective interaction with the catalyst. Example: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern `['[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]', '[NX3;H2]']` should be checked to ensure it captures both the carboxylic acid and amino group in the same molecule. Consider using a single SMARTS pattern that captures both groups in proximity, such as `[$([CX3](=O)[OX2H1]),$([NX3;H2])]`.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: For Rule 2, the SMARTS pattern `['[c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]']` may not fully capture the requirement of a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid. Ensure the pattern specifically matches a phenyl group, such as `['c1ccccc1C(=O)O']`.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: Rule 3's SMARTS pattern `['[OX2H][C@H]([OX2H])[C@H]([OX2H])[C@H]([OX2H])[C@H]([OX2H])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]']` is very specific and may not match all sugar-like structures. Consider simplifying the pattern to capture the general presence of multiple hydroxyl groups, such as `['[OX2H][C@H]([OX2H])[C@H]([OX2H])[C@H]([OX2H])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]']`.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: For Rule 4, the SMARTS pattern `['[SX2][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]']` should be verified to ensure it captures sulfur-containing groups effectively. Consider expanding the pattern to include other sulfur-containing functional groups if necessary.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: Rule 5's SMARTS pattern `['[c][NX3+](=O)[O-]']` should be checked to ensure it captures nitro groups on aromatic rings accurately. Consider using a more specific pattern like `['[c][N+](=O)[O-]']`.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: For Rule 6, the SMARTS pattern `['[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]']` may not effectively capture long aliphatic chains. Consider using a pattern that captures a minimum chain length, such as `['CCCCCCCC']`.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: Rule 7's SMARTS pattern `['[n][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]']` should be checked to ensure it captures pyridine rings with carboxylic acids accurately. Consider using a more specific pattern like `['c1ccncc1C(=O)O']`.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: For Rule 8, the SMARTS pattern `['[c][CX3H]=O']` should be verified to ensure it captures formyl groups on aromatic rings accurately. Consider using a more specific pattern like `['c1ccccc1C=O']`.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: Rule 9's SMARTS pattern `['[OX2][CX4][OX2][CX4][OX2]']` should be checked to ensure it captures multiple ether linkages effectively. Consider using a pattern that captures the general presence of polyether chains, such as `['[OX2][CX4][OX2]']`.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Ensure that the SMARTS patterns are tested against a diverse set of molecules to verify their accuracy and coverage. This can help identify any gaps or mismatches in the current patterns.

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern `[$([CX3](=O)[OX2H1]),$([NX3;H2])]` may not accurately capture the presence of both a carboxylic acid and an amino group in the same molecule. Consider using separate SMARTS patterns for carboxylic acid `[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` and amino group `[NX3;H2]` and ensure both are present in the molecule.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: For Rule 2, the SMARTS pattern `c1ccccc1C(=O)O` may not be specific enough to capture the phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid. Ensure that the pattern specifically checks for a direct connection between the phenyl group and the carboxylic acid.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For Rule 3, the SMARTS pattern `[OX2H][C@H]([OX2H])[C@H]([OX2H])[C@H]([OX2H])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` is very specific and may not match all sugar-like structures. Consider using a more general pattern that captures multiple hydroxyl groups in a sugar-like configuration.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an amino group (-NH2) tend to result in high yield. This is likely due to the ability of these groups to coordinate with metal centers, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. Examples: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid group tend to result in low yield. The presence of a bulky aromatic ring may hinder the effective coordination with the metal center. Examples: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, 4-methylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure, tend to result in high yield. These groups can form multiple hydrogen bonds, potentially stabilizing the catalyst structure. Example: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group (e.g., sulfanyl) and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield. The sulfur atom may provide additional coordination sites or influence the electronic properties of the catalyst. Examples: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid, 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (-NO2) on an aromatic ring tend to result in high yield. These groups can alter the electronic environment, potentially enhancing the catalytic activity. Example: 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with long aliphatic chains (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The hydrophobic nature and steric bulk of long chains may interfere with effective catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring tend to result in variable yields, but when combined with additional functional groups like carboxylic acids, they tend to result in high yield. This may be due to the pyridine's ability to coordinate with metal centers. Example: pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in low yield. The formyl group may not provide effective coordination or stabilization. Examples: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (e.g., polyether chains) tend to result in low yield. The flexibility and potential steric hindrance of these chains may reduce effective interaction with the catalyst. Example: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern `['[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]', '[NX3;H2]']` should be checked to ensure it captures both the carboxylic acid and amino group in the same molecule. Consider using a single SMARTS pattern that combines both features, such as `[$([CX3](=O)[OX2H1]),$([NX3;H2])]`.
- ** Suggestion 2 **: For Rule 2, the SMARTS pattern `['c1ccccc1C(=O)O']` may not capture all phenyl groups directly attached to a carboxylic acid. Consider using a more general pattern like `['c1ccccc1C(=O)[OX2H1]']` to ensure it matches the intended structure.
- ** Suggestion 3 **: For Rule 3, the SMARTS pattern `['[OX2H][C@H]([OX2H])[C@H]([OX2H])[C@H]([OX2H])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]']` is very specific. Consider using a more general pattern for sugar-like structures with multiple hydroxyl groups, such as `['[OX2H][C@H]([OX2H])[C@H]([OX2H])[C@H]([OX2H])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]']` but with flexibility in stereochemistry.
- ** Suggestion 4 **: For Rule 4, the SMARTS pattern `['[SX2][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]']` should be checked to ensure it captures sulfur-containing groups effectively. Consider using a more general pattern like `['[SX2][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]']` to ensure it matches the intended structure.
- ** Suggestion 5 **: For Rule 5, the SMARTS pattern `['[c][N+](=O)[O-]']` should be checked to ensure it captures nitro groups on aromatic rings effectively. Consider using a more general pattern like `['[c][N+](=O)[O-]']` to ensure it matches the intended structure.
- ** Suggestion 6 **: For Rule 6, the SMARTS pattern `['CCCCCCCC']` may not capture all long aliphatic chains. Consider using a more general pattern like `['C{8,}']` to ensure it matches any long aliphatic chain.
- ** Suggestion 7 **: For Rule 7, the SMARTS pattern `['c1ccncc1C(=O)O']` should be checked to ensure it captures pyridine rings with carboxylic acids effectively. Consider using a more general pattern like `['c1ccncc1C(=O)[OX2H1]']` to ensure it matches the intended structure.
- ** Suggestion 8 **: For Rule 8, the SMARTS pattern `['c1ccccc1C=O']` should be checked to ensure it captures formyl groups on aromatic rings effectively. Consider using a more general pattern like `['c1ccccc1C=O']` to ensure it matches the intended structure.
- ** Suggestion 9 **: For Rule 9, the SMARTS pattern `['[OX2][CX4][OX2]']` should be checked to ensure it captures multiple ether linkages effectively. Consider using a more general pattern like `['[OX2][CX4][OX2]']` to ensure it matches the intended structure.
- ** Suggestion 10 **: Ensure that the SMARTS patterns are tested against a diverse set of molecules to verify their accuracy and coverage. This can help identify any gaps or mismatches in the current patterns.

Metric Calculator Message:

    Train support: 0.06031746031746032
    Train confidence: 0.6310606060606061
    Train lift: 1.2675158447217272

    -------------------------------------------------------

    
---------------------------------------------------------------
Metric Commenter Message:
Based on the current metrics, we can make several observations about the performance of the rules:

1. **Train Support**: The current train support is 0.0603, which is lower than the previous train support values of 0.1667 and 0.1845. This indicates that the current rules apply to a smaller portion of the training data compared to the previous rules. While this might suggest that the rules are more specific, it could also mean that they are not capturing as many relevant instances as before.

2. **Train Confidence**: The current train confidence is 0.6311, which is slightly lower than the previous highest train confidence of 0.6352 but higher than the other previous value of 0.5396. This suggests that the current rules are still relatively reliable in predicting the outcome when the conditions are met, although there is a slight decrease from the highest previous confidence.

3. **Train Lift**: The current train lift is 1.2675, which is an improvement over the previous lifts of 1.2048 and 1.0559. A lift greater than 1 indicates that the rule is useful and that the presence of the rule condition increases the likelihood of the rule prediction. The increase in lift suggests that the current rules are more effective in identifying associations that are not due to chance.

4. **Train Leverage**: The current train leverage is 0.0076, which is positive and an improvement over the previous negative leverage values (-0.0041 and -0.0339). Positive leverage indicates that the rules are capturing associations that are stronger than what would be expected by chance, which is a positive development.

**Comments and Suggestions for Improvement:**

- **Focus on Increasing Support**: The current rules have a lower support value, indicating that they apply to a smaller subset of the data. It may be beneficial to explore additional or alternative conditions that could increase the applicability of the rules without sacrificing too much confidence or lift.

- **Maintain or Improve Confidence**: While the confidence is relatively high, maintaining or slightly improving it could enhance the reliability of the rules. This might involve refining the conditions to ensure they are capturing the most relevant instances.

- **Continue to Enhance Lift**: The increase in lift is a positive sign, indicating that the rules are identifying meaningful associations. Further analysis could focus on understanding which specific conditions contribute most to this lift and whether they can be emphasized or expanded.

- **Leverage Positive Trends**: The shift to positive leverage is encouraging, suggesting that the rules are capturing genuine associations. Continuing to refine the rules to maintain or increase leverage could further strengthen the model.

Overall, the current iteration shows improvements in lift and leverage, indicating progress in identifying meaningful associations. However, efforts should be made to increase support and maintain or improve confidence to ensure the rules are both broadly applicable and reliable. Further iterations could focus on exploring additional conditions or combinations of conditions that might enhance these metrics.

ML Commenter Message:
### Performance Evaluation of Current Rules

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
   - The current validation accuracy of 0.6 is significantly lower than the previous reference accuracies, which were consistently around 0.76. This suggests that the current rules may not be effectively capturing the underlying patterns in the data.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment:**
   - The drop in validation accuracy indicates potential underfitting, where the model is not complex enough to capture the data's nuances. The rules may not be comprehensive or detailed enough to account for the variability in the dataset.

3. **Discrepancies Analysis:**
   - For molecules where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low, Rule 2 often has a high positive SHAP value, suggesting it might be overestimating the loading. Conversely, for molecules where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, Rule 2 also frequently has a high negative SHAP value, indicating it might be underestimating the loading in other contexts.

4. **Accuracy Improvements:**
   - The current accuracy metrics suggest that there is room for improvement. The consistent discrepancy between predicted and experimental values indicates that the rules need refinement to better align predictions with actual outcomes.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**
   - SHAP analysis highlights Rule 2 as a significant contributor to prediction errors. This rule, which involves modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid group, may need to be re-evaluated or split into more specific sub-rules to better capture the nuances of different molecular structures.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Rule 2:**
   - Given its significant impact on both overestimated and underestimated loadings, Rule 2 should be refined. Consider breaking it down into more specific sub-rules that account for different types of phenyl group interactions or additional functional groups that may alter its effect.

2. **Adjust Rules with High Negative SHAP Values:**
   - Rules that consistently show high negative SHAP values for underestimated loadings should be adjusted. For instance, Rule 5, which involves electron-withdrawing groups, might need to be expanded to consider the context of these groups within different molecular frameworks.

3. **Improve Generalization:**
   - To address potential underfitting, consider incorporating additional features or rules that capture more complex interactions. This could involve exploring new molecular descriptors or leveraging domain knowledge to identify additional relevant chemical properties.

4. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - Use insights from SHAP analysis to iteratively refine the rules. Focus on rules that frequently contribute to prediction errors and test modifications to these rules in subsequent iterations to evaluate their impact on accuracy.

5. **Incorporate Additional Data:**
   - If possible, incorporate more diverse data into the training set to improve the model's ability to generalize across different types of molecules. This could help in capturing a wider range of chemical interactions and improve the robustness of the rules.

By focusing on these areas, the rules can be refined to better capture the complexities of the data, potentially leading to improved accuracy and more reliable predictions.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an amino group (-NH2) tend to result in high yield. This is likely due to the ability of these groups to coordinate with metal centers, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. Examples: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid group tend to result in low yield. The presence of a bulky aromatic ring may hinder the effective coordination with the metal center. Examples: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, 4-methylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure, tend to result in high yield. These groups can form multiple hydrogen bonds, potentially stabilizing the catalyst structure. Example: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group (e.g., sulfanyl) and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield. The sulfur atom may provide additional coordination sites or influence the electronic properties of the catalyst. Examples: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid, 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (-NO2) on an aromatic ring tend to result in high yield. These groups can alter the electronic environment, potentially enhancing the catalytic activity. Example: 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with long aliphatic chains (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The hydrophobic nature and steric bulk of long chains may interfere with effective catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring tend to result in variable yields, but when combined with additional functional groups like carboxylic acids, they tend to result in high yield. This may be due to the pyridine's ability to coordinate with metal centers. Example: pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in low yield. The formyl group may not provide effective coordination or stabilization. Examples: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (e.g., polyether chains) tend to result in low yield. The flexibility and potential steric hindrance of these chains may reduce effective interaction with the catalyst. Example: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an amino group (-NH2) tend to result in high yield. This combination likely enhances coordination with metal centers, improving catalyst stability and reactivity. Examples: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid group and an electron-donating group (e.g., methyl) tend to result in low yield. The steric hindrance and electronic effects may hinder effective coordination. Examples: 4-methylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure, tend to result in high yield. These groups can form multiple hydrogen bonds, potentially stabilizing the catalyst structure. Example: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group (e.g., sulfanyl) and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield. The sulfur atom may provide additional coordination sites or influence the electronic properties of the catalyst. Examples: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (-NO2) on an aromatic ring tend to result in high yield. These groups can alter the electronic environment, potentially enhancing the catalytic activity. Example: 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with long aliphatic chains (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The hydrophobic nature and steric bulk of long chains may interfere with effective catalyst interaction.

** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern `['[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]', '[NX3;H2]']` is correct for identifying carboxylic acid and amino groups. However, ensure that both groups are present in the same molecule, as the current implementation may not enforce this.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: For Rule 2, the SMARTS pattern `['[c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]', '[c][C;X4][C;X4]']` should be revised. The pattern should ensure that the phenyl group is directly attached to the carboxylic acid and that there is an electron-donating group like methyl. Consider using a pattern like `['[c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]', '[c][CH3]']`.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For Rule 3, the SMARTS pattern `['[OX2H][C;R5,R6][OX2H]']` may not fully capture sugar-like structures. Consider using a more specific pattern that captures multiple hydroxyl groups in a cyclic structure, such as `['[C@H]([OH])[C@H]([OH])[C@H]([OH])[C@H]([OH])[C@H]([OH])']`.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: For Rule 4, the SMARTS pattern `['[SX2][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]']` is generally correct, but ensure that the sulfur group is appropriately matched with the carboxylic acid in the same molecule.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: For Rule 5, the SMARTS pattern `['[c][NX3+](=O)[O-]']` correctly identifies nitro groups on aromatic rings. Ensure that the aromatic context is correctly captured.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: For Rule 6, the SMARTS pattern `['[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]']` should be revised to ensure it captures long aliphatic chains more effectively. Consider using a pattern like `['[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4]']` to capture longer chains.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: For Rule 7, the SMARTS pattern `['[n][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]']` is correct for identifying pyridine with carboxylic acid. Ensure the pyridine ring is correctly matched.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: For Rule 8, the SMARTS pattern `['[c][CX3H]=O']` is correct for identifying formyl groups on aromatic rings. Ensure the aromatic context is correctly captured.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: For Rule 9, the SMARTS pattern `['[OX2][C;X4][OX2][C;X4][OX2]']` should be revised to better capture multiple ether linkages. Consider using a pattern like `['[OX2][C;X4][OX2][C;X4][OX2][C;X4]']`.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: For Rule 10, the SMARTS pattern `['[c][OX2H]']` is correct for identifying hydroxyl groups on aromatic rings. Ensure the aromatic context is correctly captured.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: For Rule 11, the SMARTS pattern `['[CX4](F)(F)F']` is correct for identifying trifluoromethyl groups. Ensure the context of the aromatic ring is considered if necessary.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: For Rule 12, the SMARTS pattern `['[n][NX3;H2]']` should be revised to ensure it captures pyridine with an amino group. Consider using a pattern like `['[n][NX3;H2]']` with additional context for the pyridine ring.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: For Rule 13, the SMARTS pattern `['[c][nH]']` is correct for identifying indole groups. Ensure the aromatic context is correctly captured.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: For Rule 14, the SMARTS pattern `['[c][CH2Br]']` is correct for identifying bromomethyl groups on aromatic rings. Ensure the aromatic context is correctly captured.

- ** Suggestion 15 **: For Rule 15, the SMARTS pattern `['[c][OX2H][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]']` should be revised to ensure it captures hydroxyl and carboxylic acid groups on phenyl rings. Consider using a pattern like `['[c][OX2H][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]']` with additional context for the phenyl ring.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an amino group (-NH2) tend to result in high yield. This combination likely enhances coordination with metal centers, improving catalyst stability and reactivity. Examples: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid group and an electron-donating group (e.g., methyl) tend to result in low yield. The steric hindrance and electronic effects may hinder effective coordination. Examples: 4-methylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure, tend to result in high yield. These groups can form multiple hydrogen bonds, potentially stabilizing the catalyst structure. Example: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group (e.g., sulfanyl) and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield. The sulfur atom may provide additional coordination sites or influence the electronic properties of the catalyst. Examples: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (-NO2) on an aromatic ring tend to result in high yield. These groups can alter the electronic environment, potentially enhancing the catalytic activity. Example: 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with long aliphatic chains (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The hydrophobic nature and steric bulk of long chains may interfere with effective catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with additional functional groups like carboxylic acids tend to result in high yield. The pyridine's ability to coordinate with metal centers may enhance reactivity. Example: pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in low yield. The formyl group may not provide effective coordination or stabilization. Examples: 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (e.g., polyether chains) tend to result in low yield. The flexibility and potential steric hindrance of these chains may reduce effective interaction with the catalyst. Example: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on an aromatic ring, without additional electron-withdrawing groups, tend to result in low yield. The hydroxyl group alone may not provide sufficient coordination or electronic influence. Example: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing nature of this group may destabilize the catalyst interaction. Example: 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and an amino group tend to result in high yield. The combination of pyridine's coordination ability and the amino group's potential for hydrogen bonding may enhance catalyst performance. Example: 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with an indole group tend to result in high yield. The indole's aromaticity and potential for π-stacking interactions may stabilize the catalyst. Example: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a bromomethyl group attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in high yield. The bromine atom may enhance coordination through halogen bonding. Example: 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a phenyl ring and an additional carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield. The combination of hydrogen bonding and potential coordination sites may stabilize the catalyst. Example: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Metric Commenter Message:
Based on the current metrics and comparing them to the previous metrics, here are some observations and comments on the performance of the current rules:

1. **Train Support**: The train support has decreased from 0.0603 in the previous iteration to 0.0305 in the current iteration. This indicates that the proportion of records for which the entire rule is true has decreased. While this might suggest a more specific rule set, it could also mean that the rules are becoming too narrow and not capturing enough of the dataset.

2. **Train Confidence**: The train confidence has slightly decreased from 0.6311 to 0.6136. This suggests a minor reduction in the accuracy of the rules in predicting the outcome when the conditions are met. Although the decrease is not substantial, it indicates that the rules might be losing some predictive power.

3. **Train Lift**: The train lift has decreased from 1.2675 to 1.2287. Lift measures how much more likely the outcome is given the rule conditions compared to the general population. A lift greater than 1 is still good, indicating that the rules are providing useful information, but the decrease suggests that the rules are becoming less impactful in distinguishing the outcome compared to the baseline probability.

4. **Train Leverage**: The train leverage has decreased from 0.0076 to 0.0060. Leverage indicates the additional support the rule receives over what would be expected by chance. The decrease in leverage suggests that the rules are providing less additional information than before, which could mean that the rules are becoming less effective at identifying non-random associations.

### Recommendations for Improvement:

- **Broaden Rule Conditions**: Consider revisiting the rule conditions to ensure they are not too specific. Broader conditions might help increase support and confidence by capturing more relevant data points.

- **Refine Rule Definitions**: Analyze the current rules to identify any that might be too restrictive or not contributing significantly to the overall model. Simplifying or combining similar rules could help improve performance.

- **Focus on High-Impact Modifiers**: Prioritize rules that involve chemical groups or structures known to have a significant impact on catalytic performance. This could help improve lift and leverage by focusing on more influential factors.

- **Iterate and Validate**: Continue iterating on the rules, using cross-validation to ensure that changes lead to improvements in both training and test metrics. This will help avoid overfitting and ensure that the rules generalize well to new data.

Overall, while the current rules are still providing useful insights (as indicated by a lift greater than 1), there is room for improvement to enhance their predictive power and applicability.

### Performance Evaluation of Current Rules

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
   - The current rules seem to be struggling with effectiveness, as indicated by the drop in validation accuracy from previous iterations (0.76) to the current iteration (0.5714). This suggests that the rules may not be capturing the underlying patterns in the data effectively.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting:**
   - The significant drop in validation accuracy suggests potential underfitting. The model may not be complex enough to capture the nuances of the data, or the rules may not be comprehensive enough to cover the variability in the dataset.

3. **Discrepancies Analysis:**
   - For molecules where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low, rules with high positive SHAP values (e.g., Rule 1, Rule 2, Rule 8) may be problematic. These rules might be overestimating the impact of certain features.
   - Conversely, for molecules where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, rules with high negative SHAP values (e.g., Rule 1, Rule 5, Rule 13) may be underestimating the impact of certain features.

4. **Accuracy Improvements:**
   - The current accuracy metrics suggest that there is room for improvement. The drop in accuracy indicates that the current rules may not be capturing the complexity of the data, and there is potential for refining the rules to improve performance.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**
   - SHAP analysis indicates that certain rules may be contributing to incorrect predictions. For instance, Rule 1 and Rule 2 often have high positive SHAP values for overestimated loadings, suggesting these rules might be too aggressive in predicting high loading.
   - Rules with consistently high negative SHAP values for underestimated loadings, such as Rule 5 and Rule 13, may need to be adjusted to better capture the conditions that lead to high experimental loadings.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Rules with High Positive SHAP Values:**
   - Re-evaluate Rule 1 and Rule 2, which often contribute to overestimated loadings. Consider adding conditions or constraints to these rules to prevent overestimation.

2. **Adjust Rules with High Negative SHAP Values:**
   - Modify Rule 5 and Rule 13 to better account for scenarios where the experimental loading is high. This could involve relaxing some constraints or incorporating additional features that might influence high loading.

3. **Improve Generalization:**
   - To address potential underfitting, consider expanding the feature set or introducing new rules that capture additional chemical properties or interactions that are currently not considered.

4. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - Use insights from SHAP analysis to iteratively refine the rules. For example, if a rule consistently shows a high SHAP value for incorrect predictions, investigate the underlying assumptions of that rule and adjust accordingly.

5. **Incorporate Additional Data:**
   - If possible, incorporate more diverse data to help the model learn a broader range of patterns, which could improve generalization and reduce the risk of underfitting.

By focusing on these areas, the rules can be refined to better capture the complexities of the data, potentially leading to improved accuracy and more reliable predictions.

    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an amino group (-NH2) tend to result in high yield. This combination likely enhances coordination with metal centers, improving catalyst stability and reactivity. Examples: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid group and an electron-donating group (e.g., methyl) tend to result in low yield. The steric hindrance and electronic effects may hinder effective coordination. Examples: 4-methylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure, tend to result in high yield. These groups can form multiple hydrogen bonds, potentially stabilizing the catalyst structure. Example: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group (e.g., sulfanyl) and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield. The sulfur atom may provide additional coordination sites or influence the electronic properties of the catalyst. Examples: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (-NO2) on an aromatic ring tend to result in high yield. These groups can alter the electronic environment, potentially enhancing the catalytic activity. Example: 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with long aliphatic chains (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The hydrophobic nature and steric bulk of long chains may interfere with effective catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with additional functional groups like carboxylic acids tend to result in high yield. The pyridine's ability to coordinate with metal centers may enhance reactivity. Example: pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in low yield. The formyl group may not provide effective coordination or stabilization. Examples: 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (e.g., polyether chains) tend to result in low yield. The flexibility and potential steric hindrance of these chains may reduce effective interaction with the catalyst. Example: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on an aromatic ring, without additional electron-withdrawing groups, tend to result in low yield. The hydroxyl group alone may not provide sufficient coordination or electronic influence. Example: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing nature of this group may destabilize the catalyst interaction. Example: 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and an amino group tend to result in high yield. The combination of pyridine's coordination ability and the amino group's potential for hydrogen bonding may enhance catalyst performance. Example: 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with an indole group tend to result in high yield. The indole's aromaticity and potential for π-stacking interactions may stabilize the catalyst. Example: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a bromomethyl group attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in high yield. The bromine atom may enhance coordination through halogen bonding. Example: 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a phenyl ring and an additional carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield. The combination of hydrogen bonding and potential coordination sites may stabilize the catalyst. Example: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with an indole group tend to result in high yield. The indole's aromaticity and potential for π-stacking interactions may stabilize the catalyst. Example: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a bromomethyl group attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in high yield. The bromine atom may enhance coordination through halogen bonding. Example: 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a phenyl ring and an additional carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield. The combination of hydrogen bonding and potential coordination sites may stabilize the catalyst. Example: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an amino group (-NH2) tend to result in high yield. This combination likely enhances coordination with metal centers, improving catalyst stability and reactivity. Examples: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid group and an electron-donating group (e.g., methyl) tend to result in low yield. The steric hindrance and electronic effects may hinder effective coordination. Examples: 4-methylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure, tend to result in high yield. These groups can form multiple hydrogen bonds, potentially stabilizing the catalyst structure. Example: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group (e.g., sulfanyl) and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield. The sulfur atom may provide additional coordination sites or influence the electronic properties of the catalyst. Examples: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (-NO2) on an aromatic ring tend to result in high yield. These groups can alter the electronic environment, potentially enhancing the catalytic activity. Example: 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with long aliphatic chains (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The hydrophobic nature and steric bulk of long chains may interfere with effective catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with additional functional groups like carboxylic acids tend to result in high yield. The pyridine's ability to coordinate with metal centers may enhance reactivity. Example: pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in low yield. The formyl group may not provide effective coordination or stabilization. Examples: 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (e.g., polyether chains) tend to result in low yield. The flexibility and potential steric hindrance of these chains may reduce effective interaction with the catalyst. Example: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on an aromatic ring, without additional electron-withdrawing groups, tend to result in low yield. The hydroxyl group alone may not provide sufficient coordination or electronic influence. Example: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing nature of this group may destabilize the catalyst interaction. Example: 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and an amino group tend to result in high yield. The combination of pyridine's coordination ability and the amino group's potential for hydrogen bonding may enhance catalyst performance. Example: 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with an indole group tend to result in high yield. The indole's aromaticity and potential for π-stacking interactions may stabilize the catalyst. Example: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a bromomethyl group attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in high yield. The bromine atom may enhance coordination through halogen bonding. Example: 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a phenyl ring and an additional carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield. The combination of hydrogen bonding and potential coordination sites may stabilize the catalyst. Example: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Metric Commenter Message:
Based on the current rule metrics, we can make several observations regarding the performance of the rules, particularly focusing on confidence and lift:

1. **Confidence**: The current train confidence is 0.6106, which is slightly lower than the previous iteration's confidence values of 0.6311 and 0.6136. This indicates a slight decrease in the proportion of records where the rule predictions are true given the rule conditions. While the confidence is still relatively high, the decrease suggests that the rules might be slightly less reliable in predicting outcomes compared to the previous iteration.

2. **Lift**: The current train lift is 1.2247, which is slightly lower than the previous iteration's lift values of 1.2675 and 1.2287. Lift measures the effectiveness of a rule in comparison to random chance. A lift greater than 1 indicates that the rule is useful, but the slight decrease suggests that the current rules are marginally less effective in improving prediction accuracy over the baseline probability.

3. **Leverage**: The current train leverage is 0.0057, which is lower than the previous iteration's leverage values of 0.0076 and 0.0060. Leverage indicates the additional support the rule receives over what would be expected by chance. The decrease in leverage suggests that the current rules are providing less additional support than before, indicating a potential weakening in the association strength.

4. **Support**: The current train support is 0.0419, which is lower than the previous iteration's support values of 0.0603 and 0.0305. This indicates that the current rules apply to a smaller proportion of the dataset, which might suggest that the rules are becoming more specific.

### Recommendations for Improvement:

- **Refinement of Rules**: Consider revisiting the rules to identify any potential redundancies or overly specific conditions that might be reducing their general applicability. Simplifying or generalizing some rules could help increase support and confidence.

- **Exploration of New Features**: Investigate additional features or combinations of features that might enhance the predictive power of the rules. This could involve exploring new chemical groups or interactions that have not been considered.

- **Balancing Specificity and Generality**: Strive to balance the specificity and generality of the rules. Highly specific rules may have high confidence but low support, while overly general rules may have high support but low confidence. Finding a middle ground could improve overall performance.

- **Iterative Testing and Validation**: Continue iterating on the rules and validate them against test data to ensure that improvements in training metrics translate to better generalization and performance on unseen data.

Overall, while the current rules show reasonable performance, there is room for improvement, particularly in enhancing the confidence and lift metrics to ensure the rules are both reliable and effective in making predictions.

### Performance Evaluation of Current Rules

#### 1. Evaluate Effectiveness:
The current rules have shown some improvement in validation accuracy, moving from 0.5714 to 0.6571. This suggests that the rules are becoming more effective in capturing the underlying patterns in the data. However, the accuracy is still below the initial reference accuracies, indicating room for further improvement.

#### 2. Assess Overfitting/Underfitting:
The increase in validation accuracy suggests that the model is not overfitting to the training data. However, the relatively low accuracy compared to the reference metrics indicates potential underfitting, where the model may not be capturing all the relevant features or interactions.

#### 3. Analyze Discrepancies:
- **Overestimated Loadings**: For molecules where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low, rules with high positive SHAP values should be scrutinized. For example, Rule 3 and Rule 8 often have high positive SHAP values in such cases, suggesting they might be contributing to overestimation.
- **Underestimated Loadings**: For molecules where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, rules with high negative SHAP values should be examined. Rule 13 frequently shows negative SHAP values in these cases, indicating it might be contributing to underestimation.

#### 4. Interpret Accuracy Improvements:
The improvement in validation accuracy suggests that the current rules are moving in the right direction. However, the accuracy is still not at the level of the reference metrics, indicating that further refinement is needed to reach a local minimum.

#### 5. Derive Insights from SHAP Analysis:
- **Rule 3**: This rule often has high positive SHAP values for overestimated loadings. It might be too broadly defined, capturing cases where multiple hydroxyl groups do not necessarily lead to high yield.
- **Rule 8**: This rule also shows high positive SHAP values in overestimated cases. The formyl group's impact might be more context-dependent than currently accounted for.
- **Rule 13**: This rule shows high negative SHAP values in underestimated cases. The indole group's influence might be more significant than currently captured, suggesting a need for refinement.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Rule 3**: Consider adding more specific conditions or exceptions to Rule 3 to prevent overestimation. For instance, the presence of other functional groups or steric hindrance might affect the rule's applicability.

2. **Adjust Rule 8**: Re-evaluate the impact of the formyl group in different molecular contexts. It might be beneficial to incorporate additional factors that influence the formyl group's effect on yield.

3. **Enhance Rule 13**: Given its frequent negative SHAP values in underestimated cases, Rule 13 could be expanded to include additional interactions or conditions that enhance the indole group's positive impact.

4. **Generalization Improvements**: To address potential underfitting, consider incorporating additional features or interactions that capture more complex relationships in the data. This could involve exploring new functional groups or molecular structures not currently covered by the rules.

5. **Iterative Refinement**: Use insights from SHAP analysis to iteratively refine the rules. Focus on rules with consistently high SHAP values (positive or negative) and adjust them to better align with experimental outcomes.

By implementing these recommendations, the rules can be further refined to improve both the accuracy and generalization of the model, ultimately leading to better alignment with experimental data.

### Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimization

#### Current Rule Performance:
- The current rules have shown some improvement in validation accuracy, moving from 0.5714 to 0.6571, indicating better pattern capture.
- However, the accuracy is still below initial reference metrics, suggesting potential underfitting and room for further improvement.

#### Key Observations:
- **Confidence and Lift**: Both metrics have slightly decreased, indicating a marginal reduction in rule reliability and effectiveness.
- **Support and Leverage**: The current rules apply to a smaller dataset proportion, suggesting increased specificity but potentially reduced general applicability.

#### SHAP Analysis Insights:
- **Overestimated Loadings**: Rules like Rule 3 and Rule 8 often contribute to overestimation, indicating they might be too broadly defined.
- **Underestimated Loadings**: Rule 13 frequently shows negative SHAP values in underestimated cases, suggesting it might not fully capture the indole group's influence.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Rule 3**: Add specific conditions or exceptions to prevent overestimation, considering other functional groups or steric hindrance.

2. **Adjust Rule 8**: Re-evaluate the formyl group's impact in different contexts, incorporating additional factors that influence its effect on yield.

3. **Enhance Rule 13**: Expand the rule to include additional interactions or conditions that enhance the indole group's positive impact.

4. **Generalization Improvements**: Incorporate additional features or interactions to capture more complex relationships, addressing potential underfitting.

5. **Iterative Refinement**: Use SHAP analysis insights to iteratively refine rules, focusing on those with consistently high SHAP values.

### Possibility for Further Optimization

There is a clear possibility for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. The current metrics and SHAP analysis suggest that the rules can be refined to improve both accuracy and generalization, aligning better with experimental data.

    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an amino group (-NH2) tend to result in high yield. This combination likely enhances coordination with metal centers, improving catalyst stability and reactivity. Examples: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid group and an electron-donating group (e.g., methyl) tend to result in low yield. The steric hindrance and electronic effects may hinder effective coordination. Examples: 4-methylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure, tend to result in high yield. These groups can form multiple hydrogen bonds, potentially stabilizing the catalyst structure. Example: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group (e.g., sulfanyl) and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield. The sulfur atom may provide additional coordination sites or influence the electronic properties of the catalyst. Examples: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (-NO2) on an aromatic ring tend to result in high yield. These groups can alter the electronic environment, potentially enhancing the catalytic activity. Example: 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with long aliphatic chains (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The hydrophobic nature and steric bulk of long chains may interfere with effective catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with additional functional groups like carboxylic acids tend to result in high yield. The pyridine's ability to coordinate with metal centers may enhance reactivity. Example: pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in low yield. The formyl group may not provide effective coordination or stabilization. Examples: 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (e.g., polyether chains) tend to result in low yield. The flexibility and potential steric hindrance of these chains may reduce effective interaction with the catalyst. Example: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on an aromatic ring, without additional electron-withdrawing groups, tend to result in low yield. The hydroxyl group alone may not provide sufficient coordination or electronic influence. Example: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing nature of this group may destabilize the catalyst interaction. Example: 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and an amino group tend to result in high yield. The combination of pyridine's coordination ability and the amino group's potential for hydrogen bonding may enhance catalyst performance. Example: 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with an indole group tend to result in high yield. The indole's aromaticity and potential for π-stacking interactions may stabilize the catalyst. Example: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a bromomethyl group attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in high yield. The bromine atom may enhance coordination through halogen bonding. Example: 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a phenyl ring and an additional carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield. The combination of hydrogen bonding and potential coordination sites may stabilize the catalyst. Example: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Advice 1**: Refine Rule 3 by specifying the types of sugar-like structures that are effective. Consider adding conditions related to steric hindrance or the presence of other functional groups that might interfere with the catalyst's stability.

- **Advice 2**: Adjust Rule 8 by analyzing the context in which the formyl group is present. Consider the influence of adjacent groups or the overall molecular structure that might affect the formyl group's coordination ability.

- **Advice 3**: Enhance Rule 13 by incorporating additional interactions that the indole group might participate in, such as π-stacking or hydrogen bonding with specific functional groups. This could help capture the full potential of the indole group in stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Advice 4**: Introduce new rules or modify existing ones to account for complex interactions between multiple functional groups. This could involve creating rules that consider combinations of groups rather than single functional groups in isolation.

- **Advice 5**: Use SHAP analysis to identify rules that consistently show high SHAP values and refine them iteratively. Focus on understanding why certain rules contribute to overestimation or underestimation and adjust them accordingly.

- **Advice 6**: Consider the introduction of rules that account for the spatial arrangement of functional groups, as steric effects can significantly influence the yield. This might involve using 3D molecular descriptors or spatial considerations in rule formulation.

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an amino group (-NH2) tend to result in high yield. This combination likely enhances coordination with metal centers, improving catalyst stability and reactivity. Examples: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid group and an electron-donating group (e.g., methyl) tend to result in low yield. The steric hindrance and electronic effects may hinder effective coordination. Examples: 4-methylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure, tend to result in high yield. These groups can form multiple hydrogen bonds, potentially stabilizing the catalyst structure. Example: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group (e.g., sulfanyl) and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield. The sulfur atom may provide additional coordination sites or influence the electronic properties of the catalyst. Examples: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (-NO2) on an aromatic ring tend to result in high yield. These groups can alter the electronic environment, potentially enhancing the catalytic activity. Example: 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with long aliphatic chains (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The hydrophobic nature and steric bulk of long chains may interfere with effective catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with additional functional groups like carboxylic acids tend to result in high yield. The pyridine's ability to coordinate with metal centers may enhance reactivity. Example: pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in low yield. The formyl group may not provide effective coordination or stabilization. Examples: 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (e.g., polyether chains) tend to result in low yield. The flexibility and potential steric hindrance of these chains may reduce effective interaction with the catalyst. Example: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on an aromatic ring, without additional electron-withdrawing groups, tend to result in low yield. The hydroxyl group alone may not provide sufficient coordination or electronic influence. Example: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing nature of this group may destabilize the catalyst interaction. Example: 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and an amino group tend to result in high yield. The combination of pyridine's coordination ability and the amino group's potential for hydrogen bonding may enhance catalyst performance. Example: 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with an indole group tend to result in high yield. The indole's aromaticity and potential for π-stacking interactions may stabilize the catalyst. Example: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a bromomethyl group attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in high yield. The bromine atom may enhance coordination through halogen bonding. Example: 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a phenyl ring and an additional carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield. The combination of hydrogen bonding and potential coordination sites may stabilize the catalyst. Example: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern `['[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]', '[NX3;H2]']` should be checked to ensure it captures both a carboxylic acid group and an amino group in the same molecule. The current pattern may not enforce the presence of both groups in the same molecule, leading to incorrect matches.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an amino group (-NH2) tend to result in high yield. This combination likely enhances coordination with metal centers, improving catalyst stability and reactivity. Examples: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid group and an electron-donating group (e.g., methyl) tend to result in low yield. The steric hindrance and electronic effects may hinder effective coordination. Examples: 4-methylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure, tend to result in high yield. These groups can form multiple hydrogen bonds, potentially stabilizing the catalyst structure. Example: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group (e.g., sulfanyl) and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield. The sulfur atom may provide additional coordination sites or influence the electronic properties of the catalyst. Examples: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (-NO2) on an aromatic ring tend to result in high yield. These groups can alter the electronic environment, potentially enhancing the catalytic activity. Example: 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with long aliphatic chains (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The hydrophobic nature and steric bulk of long chains may interfere with effective catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with additional functional groups like carboxylic acids tend to result in high yield. The pyridine's ability to coordinate with metal centers may enhance reactivity. Example: pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in low yield. The formyl group may not provide effective coordination or stabilization. Examples: 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (e.g., polyether chains) tend to result in low yield. The flexibility and potential steric hindrance of these chains may reduce effective interaction with the catalyst. Example: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on an aromatic ring, without additional electron-withdrawing groups, tend to result in low yield. The hydroxyl group alone may not provide sufficient coordination or electronic influence. Example: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing nature of this group may destabilize the catalyst interaction. Example: 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and an amino group tend to result in high yield. The combination of pyridine's coordination ability and the amino group's potential for hydrogen bonding may enhance catalyst performance. Example: 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with an indole group tend to result in high yield. The indole's aromaticity and potential for π-stacking interactions may stabilize the catalyst. Example: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a bromomethyl group attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in high yield. The bromine atom may enhance coordination through halogen bonding. Example: 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a phenyl ring and an additional carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield. The combination of hydrogen bonding and potential coordination sites may stabilize the catalyst. Example: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

Matrix Checker Message:
To evaluate the effectiveness of the transformation from language rules to a numeric feature matrix, let's go through each rule and the corresponding SMARTS patterns in the code, comparing them with the feature matrix.

1. **Rule 1**: The SMARTS pattern `['[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]', '[NX3;H2]']` correctly identifies a carboxylic acid and an amino group. The feature matrix shows 1s for SMILES 1, 4, 5, 6, 16, 33, 34, 35, and 36, which aligns with the rule description. However, SMILES 2 and 4 should also match Rule 1, but only SMILES 2 is marked correctly. SMILES 4 is marked as 1, which is correct.

2. **Rule 2**: The SMARTS pattern `['[c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]', '[c][C]']` is intended to match a phenyl group with a carboxylic acid and an electron-donating group. The feature matrix shows -1s for SMILES 0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 12, 14, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, and 33. This seems excessive and may indicate a broad match. The SMARTS pattern might be too general, capturing more than intended.

3. **Rule 3**: The SMARTS pattern `['[OX2H][C][C][C][C][C][OX2H]']` is meant to identify multiple hydroxyl groups in a sugar-like structure. The feature matrix shows -1 for SMILES 10, which is correct. However, SMILES 7 should match Rule 3 but is marked as 0.

4. **Rule 4**: The SMARTS pattern `['[SX2][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]']` correctly identifies a sulfur-containing group and a carboxylic acid. The feature matrix shows 1 for SMILES 11 and 24, which aligns with the rule description.

5. **Rule 5**: The SMARTS pattern `['[c][NX3+](=O)[O-]']` is intended to match a nitro group on an aromatic ring. The feature matrix shows 1 for SMILES 22, which is correct.

6. **Rule 6**: The SMARTS pattern `['[C][C][C][C][C][C][C][C]']` is meant to identify long aliphatic chains. The feature matrix shows -1 for SMILES 6, 30, and 35, which aligns with the rule description.

7. **Rule 7**: The SMARTS pattern `['[n][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]']` correctly identifies a pyridine ring with a carboxylic acid. The feature matrix shows 1 for SMILES 13 and 25, which aligns with the rule description.

8. **Rule 8**: The SMARTS pattern `['[c][CX3H]=O']` is intended to match a formyl group on an aromatic ring. The feature matrix shows -1 for SMILES 19 and 20, which is correct.

9. **Rule 9**: The SMARTS pattern `['[C][O][C][O][C]']` is meant to identify multiple ether linkages. The feature matrix shows -1 for SMILES 12, which is correct.

10. **Rule 10**: The SMARTS pattern `['[c][OX2H]']` is intended to match a hydroxyl group on an aromatic ring. The feature matrix shows -1 for SMILES 8, 28, and 31, which aligns with the rule description.

11. **Rule 11**: The SMARTS pattern `['[CX4](F)(F)F']` correctly identifies a trifluoromethyl group. The feature matrix shows -1 for SMILES 15 and 29, which aligns with the rule description.

12. **Rule 12**: The SMARTS pattern `['[n][NX3;H2]']` is intended to match a pyridine ring and an amino group. The feature matrix shows 1 for SMILES 17, which is correct.

13. **Rule 13**: The SMARTS pattern `['[c][nH]']` correctly identifies an indole group. The feature matrix shows 1 for SMILES 16 and 18, which aligns with the rule description.

14. **Rule 14**: The SMARTS pattern `['[c][CH2Br]']` is intended to match a bromomethyl group on an aromatic ring. The feature matrix shows 1 for SMILES 2, which is correct.

15. **Rule 15**: The SMARTS pattern `['[c][OX2H][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]']` is meant to identify a hydroxyl group on a phenyl ring and a carboxylic acid. The feature matrix shows 1 for SMILES 14, which aligns with the rule description.

** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 2, refine the SMARTS pattern to more specifically capture the presence of an electron-donating group directly attached to the phenyl group, as the current pattern may be too broad.
- ** Suggestion 2 **: For Rule 3, adjust the SMARTS pattern to better capture sugar-like structures, as it seems to miss some relevant SMILES.
- ** Suggestion 3 **: Review the SMARTS patterns for each rule to ensure they are not overly broad or too specific, leading to incorrect matches or misses.
- ** Suggestion 4 **: Consider adding more specific substructure patterns for rules that involve complex functional group interactions, such as Rule 1 and Rule 3.

    Train confidence: 0.6106060606060607

Metric Commenter Message:
Based on the current rule metrics and comparing them to the previous metrics, here are some observations and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Confidence**:
   - The current train confidence is 0.6106, which is slightly lower than the highest confidence observed in the previous iterations (0.6311). This indicates a slight decrease in the reliability of the rules to predict the outcome when the conditions are met.
   - To improve confidence, it might be beneficial to refine the conditions of the rules to better capture the underlying patterns that lead to high yield. This could involve more precise definitions of functional groups or combinations that are more strongly associated with the desired outcome.

2. **Lift**:
   - The current train lift is 1.2171, which is an improvement over some of the previous iterations but still not the highest observed (1.2675). A lift greater than 1 indicates that the rule is useful, but there is room for improvement.
   - To increase lift, focus on identifying rule conditions that significantly increase the probability of the prediction compared to the baseline probability. This might involve exploring interactions between different functional groups or structural features that have not been fully captured by the current rules.

3. **Leverage**:
   - The current train leverage is 0.0055, which is lower than some previous values (e.g., 0.0076). Leverage indicates the additional support the rule receives over what would be expected by chance.
   - Increasing leverage could involve identifying more unique or less common combinations of features that are strongly associated with high yield, thus providing a clearer distinction from random associations.

4. **Support**:
   - The current train support is 0.0419, which is relatively low compared to some previous values. While support is not the primary focus, it is important to ensure that the rules apply to a reasonable portion of the dataset to be practically useful.
   - Consider broadening the scope of some rules to include more examples, as long as it does not significantly compromise confidence and lift.

**Suggestions for Improvement**:
- **Refinement of Rules**: Re-evaluate the chemical rationale behind each rule to ensure that the conditions are both chemically plausible and statistically significant. This might involve consulting domain experts or using additional data sources to validate the rules.
- **Exploration of New Features**: Consider incorporating additional chemical features or descriptors that might capture important aspects of the modifiers that are currently not being considered.
- **Rule Combination**: Explore the possibility of combining certain rules or conditions to capture more complex interactions that could lead to higher yield.
- **Iterative Testing**: Continue iterating on the rules, using cross-validation to ensure that improvements in metrics are consistent across different subsets of the data.

Overall, while the current rules show some promise, there is potential for further optimization to enhance their predictive power and applicability.

### Performance Evaluation of Current Rules

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
   - The current rules have shown some effectiveness, as indicated by the improvement in validation accuracy from 0.5714 to 0.6571. However, the accuracy is still below the previous reference accuracies, which were consistently around 0.76 for validation and 0.75 for test sets. This suggests that while the rules are capturing some patterns, they are not yet optimal.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment:**
   - The fluctuation in validation accuracy across iterations suggests potential underfitting. The model may not be capturing the complexity of the data adequately, as indicated by the lower accuracy compared to the reference metrics. The rules might be too simplistic or not comprehensive enough to capture the nuances in the data.

3. **Discrepancies Analysis:**
   - For molecules where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low, rules with high positive SHAP values (e.g., Rule 3, Rule 8, Rule 11) might be overestimating the loading. Conversely, for molecules where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, rules with high negative SHAP values (e.g., Rule 3, Rule 8, Rule 11) might be underestimating the loading.

4. **Accuracy Improvements:**
   - The improvement in validation accuracy from 0.5714 to 0.6571 suggests that there is potential for further improvement. However, the current rules may need refinement to achieve accuracies closer to the reference metrics.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**
   - The SHAP analysis indicates that certain rules (e.g., Rule 3, Rule 8, Rule 11) have a significant impact on the predictions. These rules should be closely examined and refined to improve their accuracy and generalization.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Overestimated Rules:**
   - Rules with high positive SHAP values for overestimated loadings, such as Rule 3 (multiple hydroxyl groups) and Rule 8 (formyl group on aromatic ring), should be refined. Consider adding conditions or exceptions to these rules to prevent overestimation.

2. **Adjust Underestimated Rules:**
   - Rules with high negative SHAP values for underestimated loadings, such as Rule 3 and Rule 8, should be adjusted. Explore additional features or interactions that might be missing from these rules to improve their accuracy.

3. **Improve Generalization:**
   - To address potential underfitting, consider expanding the feature set or incorporating additional rules that capture more complex interactions. This could involve exploring new chemical features or interactions that are not currently covered by the existing rules.

4. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - Use insights from the SHAP analysis to iteratively refine the rules. Focus on rules that consistently show high SHAP values, either positive or negative, and explore ways to improve their specificity and accuracy.

5. **Evaluate Rule Effectiveness:**
   - Continuously evaluate the effectiveness of the rules by monitoring changes in validation and test accuracies. Use these metrics to guide further refinements and ensure that the rules are moving towards optimal performance.

By implementing these recommendations, the current rules can be refined to improve their accuracy and generalization, ultimately leading to better performance in predicting the loading of modifiers on catalysts.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an amino group (-NH2) tend to result in high yield. This combination likely enhances coordination with metal centers, improving catalyst stability and reactivity. Examples: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid group and an electron-donating group (e.g., methyl) tend to result in low yield. The steric hindrance and electronic effects may hinder effective coordination. Examples: 4-methylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure, tend to result in high yield. These groups can form multiple hydrogen bonds, potentially stabilizing the catalyst structure. Example: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group (e.g., sulfanyl) and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield. The sulfur atom may provide additional coordination sites or influence the electronic properties of the catalyst. Examples: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (-NO2) on an aromatic ring tend to result in high yield. These groups can alter the electronic environment, potentially enhancing the catalytic activity. Example: 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with long aliphatic chains (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The hydrophobic nature and steric bulk of long chains may interfere with effective catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with additional functional groups like carboxylic acids tend to result in high yield. The pyridine's ability to coordinate with metal centers may enhance reactivity. Example: pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in low yield. The formyl group may not provide effective coordination or stabilization. Examples: 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (e.g., polyether chains) tend to result in low yield. The flexibility and potential steric hindrance of these chains may reduce effective interaction with the catalyst. Example: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on an aromatic ring, without additional electron-withdrawing groups, tend to result in low yield. The hydroxyl group alone may not provide sufficient coordination or electronic influence. Example: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing nature of this group may destabilize the catalyst interaction. Example: 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and an amino group tend to result in high yield. The combination of pyridine's coordination ability and the amino group's potential for hydrogen bonding may enhance catalyst performance. Example: 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with an indole group tend to result in high yield. The indole's aromaticity and potential for π-stacking interactions may stabilize the catalyst. Example: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a bromomethyl group attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in high yield. The bromine atom may enhance coordination through halogen bonding. Example: 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a phenyl ring and an additional carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield. The combination of hydrogen bonding and potential coordination sites may stabilize the catalyst. Example: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- ** Advice 1 **: Refine Rule 3 by specifying the types of sugar-like structures that are most effective. Consider adding conditions related to the number of hydroxyl groups or their specific arrangement to prevent overestimation.

- ** Advice 2 **: For Rule 8, which currently predicts low yield for modifiers with a formyl group, consider adding exceptions for cases where additional stabilizing groups are present. This could help address underestimation issues.

- ** Advice 3 **: Introduce a new rule or modify existing ones to account for the impact of molecular size and steric effects more comprehensively. This could help capture interactions that are currently missed, addressing potential underfitting.

- ** Advice 4 **: Expand Rule 11 to include specific conditions under which trifluoromethyl groups might not lead to low yield, such as when paired with other electron-donating groups that could balance the electronic effects.

- ** Advice 5 **: Use SHAP analysis to identify modifiers that consistently lead to high or low yields but are not covered by existing rules. Develop new rules or modify existing ones to include these cases, improving generalization.

- ** Advice 6 **: Continuously validate the rules against new data and adjust them iteratively. This iterative process should focus on rules with high SHAP values, ensuring they are neither too broad nor too narrow.

- ** Advice 7 **: Consider incorporating machine learning models to identify complex patterns and interactions that are not easily captured by simple rules. This could complement the rule-based approach and improve accuracy.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in low yield unless additional stabilizing groups such as amino or hydroxyl groups are present. Examples: 4-formylbenzoic acid (low yield), 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (low yield).

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (e.g., polyether chains) tend to result in low yield. The flexibility and potential steric hindrance of these chains may reduce effective interaction with the catalyst. Example: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on an aromatic ring, without additional electron-withdrawing groups, tend to result in low yield. The hydroxyl group alone may not provide sufficient coordination or electronic influence. Example: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in low yield unless paired with other electron-donating groups that could balance the electronic effects. Example: 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and an amino group tend to result in high yield. The combination of pyridine's coordination ability and the amino group's potential for hydrogen bonding may enhance catalyst performance. Example: 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with an indole group tend to result in high yield. The indole's aromaticity and potential for π-stacking interactions may stabilize the catalyst. Example: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a bromomethyl group attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in high yield. The bromine atom may enhance coordination through halogen bonding. Example: 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a phenyl ring and an additional carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield. The combination of hydrogen bonding and potential coordination sites may stabilize the catalyst. Example: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an amino group (-NH2) tend to result in high yield. This combination likely enhances coordination with metal centers, improving catalyst stability and reactivity. Examples: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid group and an electron-donating group (e.g., methyl) tend to result in low yield. The steric hindrance and electronic effects may hinder effective coordination. Examples: 4-methylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure with at least four hydroxyl groups, tend to result in high yield. These groups can form multiple hydrogen bonds, potentially stabilizing the catalyst structure. Example: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group (e.g., sulfanyl) and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield. The sulfur atom may provide additional coordination sites or influence the electronic properties of the catalyst. Examples: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (-NO2) on an aromatic ring tend to result in high yield. These groups can alter the electronic environment, potentially enhancing the catalytic activity. Example: 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with long aliphatic chains (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The hydrophobic nature and steric bulk of long chains may interfere with effective catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with additional functional groups like carboxylic acids tend to result in high yield. The pyridine's ability to coordinate with metal centers may enhance reactivity. Example: pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in low yield unless additional stabilizing groups such as amino or hydroxyl groups are present. Examples: 4-formylbenzoic acid (low yield), 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (low yield).

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (e.g., polyether chains) tend to result in low yield. The flexibility and potential steric hindrance of these chains may reduce effective interaction with the catalyst. Example: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on an aromatic ring, without additional electron-withdrawing groups, tend to result in low yield. The hydroxyl group alone may not provide sufficient coordination or electronic influence. Example: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in low yield unless paired with other electron-donating groups that could balance the electronic effects. Example: 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and an amino group tend to result in high yield. The combination of pyridine's coordination ability and the amino group's potential for hydrogen bonding may enhance catalyst performance. Example: 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with an indole group tend to result in high yield. The indole's aromaticity and potential for π-stacking interactions may stabilize the catalyst. Example: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a bromomethyl group attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in high yield. The bromine atom may enhance coordination through halogen bonding. Example: 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a phenyl ring and an additional carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield. The combination of hydrogen bonding and potential coordination sites may stabilize the catalyst. Example: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid group and an electron-donating group (e.g., methyl) tend to result in low yield. The steric hindrance and electronic effects may hinder effective coordination. Examples: 4-methylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure with at least four hydroxyl groups, tend to result in high yield. These groups can form multiple hydrogen bonds, potentially stabilizing the catalyst structure. Example: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group (e.g., sulfanyl) and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield. The sulfur atom may provide additional coordination sites or influence the electronic properties of the catalyst. Examples: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (-NO2) on an aromatic ring tend to result in high yield. These groups can alter the electronic environment, potentially enhancing the catalytic activity. Example: 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with long aliphatic chains (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The hydrophobic nature and steric bulk of long chains may interfere with effective catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with additional functional groups like carboxylic acids tend to result in high yield. The pyridine's ability to coordinate with metal centers may enhance reactivity. Example: pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in low yield unless additional stabilizing groups such as amino or hydroxyl groups are present. Examples: 4-formylbenzoic acid (low yield), 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (low yield).

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (e.g., polyether chains) tend to result in low yield. The flexibility and potential steric hindrance of these chains may reduce effective interaction with the catalyst. Example: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on an aromatic ring, without additional electron-withdrawing groups, tend to result in low yield. The hydroxyl group alone may not provide sufficient coordination or electronic influence. Example: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in low yield unless paired with other electron-donating groups that could balance the electronic effects. Example: 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and an amino group tend to result in high yield. The combination of pyridine's coordination ability and the amino group's potential for hydrogen bonding may enhance catalyst performance. Example: 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with an indole group tend to result in high yield. The indole's aromaticity and potential for π-stacking interactions may stabilize the catalyst. Example: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a bromomethyl group attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in high yield. The bromine atom may enhance coordination through halogen bonding. Example: 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a phenyl ring and an additional carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield. The combination of hydrogen bonding and potential coordination sites may stabilize the catalyst. Example: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

Matrix Checker Message:
To evaluate the effectiveness of the transformation from language rules to a numeric feature matrix, let's go through each rule and the corresponding SMARTS patterns in the code, comparing them with the feature matrix.

**Rule 1**: Modifiers with both a carboxylic acid group and an amino group should result in high yield (1). The SMARTS pattern `[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` and `[NX3;H2]` seems correct for identifying carboxylic acid and amino groups. The feature matrix correctly identifies SMILES 1, 4, 5, 6, 15, 33, 34, and 35 as matching Rule 1.

**Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid group and an electron-donating group should result in low yield (-1). The SMARTS pattern `[c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` and `[c][C;X4]` seems to be incorrect. The feature matrix only identifies SMILES 3 and 24 as matching Rule 2, which may not be accurate.

**Rule 3**: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups in a sugar-like structure should result in high yield (1). The SMARTS pattern `[OX2H][C][C][C][C][C][OX2H]` seems to be too specific. The feature matrix identifies SMILES 2 and 11 as matching Rule 3, but SMILES 11 is marked as -1, which is incorrect.

**Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group and a carboxylic acid group should result in high yield (1). The SMARTS pattern `[SX2][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` seems correct. The feature matrix does not identify any SMILES as matching Rule 4, which may be incorrect.

**Rule 5**: Modifiers with a nitro group on an aromatic ring should result in high yield (1). The SMARTS pattern `[c][NX3+](=O)[O-]` seems correct. The feature matrix correctly identifies SMILES 22 as matching Rule 5.

**Rule 6**: Modifiers with long aliphatic chains should result in low yield (-1). The SMARTS pattern `[C][C][C][C][C][C][C][C]` seems correct. The feature matrix correctly identifies SMILES 7 and 36 as matching Rule 6.

**Rule 7**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and a carboxylic acid should result in high yield (1). The SMARTS pattern `[n][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` seems correct. The feature matrix does not identify any SMILES as matching Rule 7, which may be incorrect.

**Rule 8**: Modifiers with a formyl group on an aromatic ring should result in low yield (-1). The SMARTS pattern `[c][CX3H]=O` seems correct. The feature matrix correctly identifies SMILES 20 and 21 as matching Rule 8.

**Rule 9**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages should result in low yield (-1). The SMARTS pattern `[C][O][C][O][C]` seems correct. The feature matrix correctly identifies SMILES 13 as matching Rule 9.

**Rule 10**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on an aromatic ring should result in low yield (-1). The SMARTS pattern `[c][OX2H]` seems correct. The feature matrix correctly identifies SMILES 9, 28, and 32 as matching Rule 10.

**Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group should result in low yield (-1). The SMARTS pattern `[c][CX4](F)(F)F` seems correct. The feature matrix does not identify any SMILES as matching Rule 11, which may be incorrect.

**Rule 12**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and an amino group should result in high yield (1). The SMARTS pattern `[n][NX3;H2]` seems incorrect. The feature matrix does not identify any SMILES as matching Rule 12, which may be incorrect.

**Rule 13**: Modifiers with an indole group should result in high yield (1). The SMARTS pattern `[c][nH]` seems correct. The feature matrix correctly identifies SMILES 10, 17, and 18 as matching Rule 13.

**Rule 14**: Modifiers with a bromomethyl group on an aromatic ring should result in high yield (1). The SMARTS pattern `[c][CH2Br]` seems correct. The feature matrix correctly identifies SMILES 3 as matching Rule 14.

**Rule 15**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a phenyl ring and an additional carboxylic acid group should result in high yield (1). The SMARTS pattern `[c][OX2H][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` seems correct. The feature matrix does not identify any SMILES as matching Rule 15, which may be incorrect.

** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: Review and correct the SMARTS pattern for Rule 2 to accurately capture the presence of a phenyl group with a carboxylic acid and an electron-donating group.
- ** Suggestion 2 **: Adjust the SMARTS pattern for Rule 3 to be less specific, allowing for the identification of sugar-like structures with multiple hydroxyl groups.
- ** Suggestion 3 **: Verify the SMARTS pattern for Rule 4 to ensure it captures sulfur-containing groups with carboxylic acids.
- ** Suggestion 4 **: Re-evaluate the SMARTS pattern for Rule 7 to ensure it captures pyridine rings with carboxylic acids.
- ** Suggestion 5 **: Check the SMARTS pattern for Rule 11 to ensure it captures trifluoromethyl groups on aromatic rings.
- ** Suggestion 6 **: Correct the SMARTS pattern for Rule 12 to accurately identify pyridine rings with amino groups.
- ** Suggestion 7 **: Ensure that the SMARTS pattern for Rule 15 captures the combination of hydroxyl and carboxylic acid groups on phenyl rings.

Metric Commenter Message:
Based on the current metrics and comparing them to the reference metrics, here are some observations and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Confidence**: 
   - The current train confidence is 0.5136, which is lower than the previous iteration's confidence values (ranging from 0.6106 to 0.6310). This indicates a decrease in the reliability of the rules to predict the outcome correctly. A confidence level above 0.6 is generally more desirable, as seen in the previous iterations.

2. **Lift**:
   - The current train lift is 1.0304, which is very close to 1. This suggests that the rules are not providing much additional predictive power over random chance. In previous iterations, the lift values were higher (ranging from 1.2171 to 1.2675), indicating that the rules were more effective in distinguishing between high and low yield outcomes.

3. **Leverage**:
   - The current train leverage is 0.0011, which is quite low. This suggests that the rules are not providing much additional support over what would be expected by chance. Previous iterations had slightly higher leverage values, indicating a stronger association between the rule conditions and predictions.

4. **Support**:
   - The current train support is 0.0267, which is lower than the previous iterations (ranging from 0.0305 to 0.0603). This indicates that the rules are applicable to a smaller portion of the dataset, which might limit their generalizability.

### Recommendations for Improvement:

1. **Refine Rule Conditions**:
   - Consider revisiting the conditions of the rules to ensure they are capturing the most relevant features that contribute to high or low yield. This might involve incorporating additional chemical properties or interactions that were not previously considered.

2. **Increase Rule Specificity**:
   - Focus on creating more specific rules that target subsets of the data with higher confidence and lift. This might involve breaking down complex rules into simpler, more targeted ones.

3. **Explore New Features**:
   - Investigate additional chemical features or interactions that could be influencing the yield. This could involve exploring different functional groups, steric effects, or electronic properties that have not been considered.

4. **Iterative Testing and Validation**:
   - Continue iterating on the rules and validate them against a separate test set to ensure they generalize well beyond the training data. This can help identify overfitting and improve the robustness of the rules.

5. **Incorporate Domain Expertise**:
   - Collaborate with domain experts to gain insights into potential chemical interactions or properties that might not be immediately obvious from the data alone. This can help in formulating more effective rules.

By focusing on these areas, the rules can be refined to improve their predictive power, as indicated by higher confidence and lift values, while maintaining or increasing support and leverage.

### Performance Evaluation of Current Rules

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
   - The current rules have shown some improvement in validation accuracy, reaching 0.6571, which is an improvement from the previous lower accuracies (e.g., 0.5714 and 0.6). This suggests that the rules are becoming more effective in capturing the underlying patterns in the data.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment:**
   - The consistent improvement in validation accuracy without a significant drop in performance suggests that the model is not overfitting. However, the relatively low accuracy indicates potential underfitting, suggesting that the rules may not be capturing all the necessary features or interactions.

3. **Discrepancies Analysis:**
   - For molecules where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low, Rule 3 often has a high positive SHAP value, indicating it might be overestimating the loading. Conversely, for molecules where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, Rule 3 also shows negative SHAP values, suggesting it might be underestimating the loading in some cases.

4. **Accuracy Improvements:**
   - The increase in validation accuracy from previous iterations suggests that the rules are improving. However, the accuracy is still below optimal, indicating room for further refinement.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**
   - SHAP analysis indicates that Rule 3, which involves modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups, is influential in both overestimating and underestimating loadings. This suggests that the rule might need refinement to better capture the conditions under which these modifiers lead to high or low loadings.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Rule 3:**
   - Given its significant impact on SHAP values, Rule 3 should be refined to better distinguish between cases where multiple hydroxyl groups lead to high versus low loadings. Consider incorporating additional conditions or interactions with other functional groups that might influence the outcome.

2. **Adjust Rules with High Negative SHAP Values:**
   - For molecules where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, rules with high negative SHAP values should be examined. This includes Rule 5 and Rule 8, which might need adjustments to better capture the conditions leading to high loadings.

3. **Improve Generalization:**
   - To address potential underfitting, consider expanding the feature set or incorporating additional rules that capture more complex interactions. This could involve exploring new functional groups or structural motifs that might influence catalyst loading.

4. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - Use insights from SHAP analysis to iteratively refine the rules. Focus on rules that consistently show high SHAP values (positive or negative) and explore ways to adjust them to better align with experimental outcomes.

5. **Incorporate Additional Data:**
   - If possible, incorporate additional data or features that might provide more context or information about the modifiers and their interactions with catalysts. This could help improve the model's ability to generalize and capture more nuanced patterns.

By focusing on these areas, the rules can be refined to improve both the accuracy and generalization of the model, leading to better predictions of catalyst loading.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an amino group (-NH2) tend to result in high yield. This combination likely enhances coordination with metal centers, improving catalyst stability and reactivity. Examples: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid group and an electron-donating group (e.g., methyl) tend to result in low yield. The steric hindrance and electronic effects may hinder effective coordination. Examples: 4-methylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure with at least four hydroxyl groups, tend to result in high yield. These groups can form multiple hydrogen bonds, potentially stabilizing the catalyst structure. Example: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group (e.g., sulfanyl) and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield. The sulfur atom may provide additional coordination sites or influence the electronic properties of the catalyst. Examples: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (-NO2) on an aromatic ring tend to result in high yield. These groups can alter the electronic environment, potentially enhancing the catalytic activity. Example: 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with long aliphatic chains (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The hydrophobic nature and steric bulk of long chains may interfere with effective catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with additional functional groups like carboxylic acids tend to result in high yield. The pyridine's ability to coordinate with metal centers may enhance reactivity. Example: pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in low yield unless additional stabilizing groups such as amino or hydroxyl groups are present. Examples: 4-formylbenzoic acid (low yield), 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (low yield).

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (e.g., polyether chains) tend to result in low yield. The flexibility and potential steric hindrance of these chains may reduce effective interaction with the catalyst. Example: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on an aromatic ring, without additional electron-withdrawing groups, tend to result in low yield. The hydroxyl group alone may not provide sufficient coordination or electronic influence. Example: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in low yield unless paired with other electron-donating groups that could balance the electronic effects. Example: 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and an amino group tend to result in high yield. The combination of pyridine's coordination ability and the amino group's potential for hydrogen bonding may enhance catalyst performance. Example: 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with an indole group tend to result in high yield. The indole's aromaticity and potential for π-stacking interactions may stabilize the catalyst. Example: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a bromomethyl group attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in high yield. The bromine atom may enhance coordination through halogen bonding. Example: 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a phenyl ring and an additional carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield. The combination of hydrogen bonding and potential coordination sites may stabilize the catalyst. Example: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Advice 1**: Increase the dataset size to provide more examples for each rule. This will help in validating the rules with broader coverage and ensure that the rules are not based on limited data points.

- **Advice 2**: For rules with low coverage, such as Rule 2, consider exploring additional modifiers with similar structural features to confirm the rule's validity or adjust the rule based on new findings.

- **Advice 3**: For rules that are supported by only one or two data points, such as Rules 4, 5, 6, and others, actively seek out or synthesize new compounds that fit these criteria to test and potentially expand the rule's applicability.

- **Advice 4**: Consider integrating computational chemistry methods to predict the potential yield of modifiers not yet tested. This can help in identifying promising candidates for experimental validation and rule refinement.

- **Advice 5**: Re-evaluate the rules periodically as new data becomes available. This will ensure that the rules remain relevant and accurate as the dataset grows and new insights are gained.

- **Advice 6**: Collaborate with synthetic chemists to design experiments that specifically test the boundaries of the current rules, particularly those with moderate to low coverage, to refine and improve them.

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an amino group (-NH2) tend to result in high yield. This combination likely enhances coordination with metal centers, improving catalyst stability and reactivity. Examples: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid group and an electron-donating group (e.g., methyl) tend to result in low yield. The steric hindrance and electronic effects may hinder effective coordination. Examples: 4-methylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure with at least four hydroxyl groups, tend to result in high yield. These groups can form multiple hydrogen bonds, potentially stabilizing the catalyst structure. Example: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group (e.g., sulfanyl) and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield. The sulfur atom may provide additional coordination sites or influence the electronic properties of the catalyst. Examples: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (-NO2) on an aromatic ring tend to result in high yield. These groups can alter the electronic environment, potentially enhancing the catalytic activity. Example: 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with long aliphatic chains (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The hydrophobic nature and steric bulk of long chains may interfere with effective catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with additional functional groups like carboxylic acids tend to result in high yield. The pyridine's ability to coordinate with metal centers may enhance reactivity. Example: pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in low yield unless additional stabilizing groups such as amino or hydroxyl groups are present. Examples: 4-formylbenzoic acid (low yield), 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (low yield).

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (e.g., polyether chains) tend to result in low yield. The flexibility and potential steric hindrance of these chains may reduce effective interaction with the catalyst. Example: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on an aromatic ring, without additional electron-withdrawing groups, tend to result in low yield. The hydroxyl group alone may not provide sufficient coordination or electronic influence. Example: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in low yield unless paired with other electron-donating groups that could balance the electronic effects. Example: 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and an amino group tend to result in high yield. The combination of pyridine's coordination ability and the amino group's potential for hydrogen bonding may enhance catalyst performance. Example: 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with an indole group tend to result in high yield. The indole's aromaticity and potential for π-stacking interactions may stabilize the catalyst. Example: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a bromomethyl group attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in high yield. The bromine atom may enhance coordination through halogen bonding. Example: 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a phenyl ring and an additional carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield. The combination of hydrogen bonding and potential coordination sites may stabilize the catalyst. Example: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern `['[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]', '[NX3H2]']` should be checked to ensure it captures both a carboxylic acid group and an amino group in the same molecule. The current pattern may not ensure both groups are present in the same molecule. Consider using a single SMARTS pattern that captures both functionalities in proximity.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: For Rule 2, the SMARTS pattern `['[c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]', '[c][C]']` may not accurately capture the presence of a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid group with an electron-donating group. The pattern should be refined to ensure the electron-donating group is directly attached to the phenyl ring.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For Rule 3, the SMARTS pattern `['[OX2H][C][OX2H][C][OX2H][C][OX2H]']` should be revised to ensure it captures a sugar-like structure with at least four hydroxyl groups. The current pattern may not accurately reflect the sugar-like structure requirement.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: For Rule 4, the SMARTS pattern `['[SX2][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]']` should be checked to ensure it captures sulfur-containing groups effectively. Consider refining the pattern to include common sulfur-containing groups like sulfanyl.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: For Rule 5, the SMARTS pattern `['[c][NX3+](=O)[O-]']` should be verified to ensure it captures nitro groups on aromatic rings accurately. The pattern should be refined to ensure it matches the nitro group directly attached to an aromatic ring.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: For Rule 6, the SMARTS pattern `['[C][C][C][C][C][C][C][C]']` should be checked to ensure it captures long aliphatic chains effectively. Consider using a more flexible pattern that captures varying lengths of aliphatic chains.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: For Rule 7, the SMARTS pattern `['[n][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]']` should be verified to ensure it captures pyridine rings with carboxylic acids accurately. The pattern should ensure the carboxylic acid is directly attached to the pyridine ring.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: For Rule 8, the SMARTS pattern `['[c][CX3H]=O']` should be checked to ensure it captures formyl groups on aromatic rings accurately. The pattern should ensure the formyl group is directly attached to the aromatic ring.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: For Rule 9, the SMARTS pattern `['[C][O][C][O][C]']` should be revised to ensure it captures multiple ether linkages effectively. Consider using a pattern that captures a series of ether linkages rather than a fixed number.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: For Rule 10, the SMARTS pattern `['[c][OX2H]']` should be checked to ensure it captures hydroxyl groups on aromatic rings accurately. The pattern should ensure the hydroxyl group is directly attached to the aromatic ring.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: For Rule 11, the SMARTS pattern `['[c][CX4](F)(F)F']` should be verified to ensure it captures trifluoromethyl groups accurately. The pattern should ensure the trifluoromethyl group is directly attached to an aromatic ring.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: For Rule 12, the SMARTS pattern `['[n][NX3H2]']` should be checked to ensure it captures pyridine rings with amino groups accurately. The pattern should ensure the amino group is directly attached to the pyridine ring.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: For Rule 13, the SMARTS pattern `['[c][nH]']` should be verified to ensure it captures indole groups accurately. The pattern should ensure the indole structure is correctly identified.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: For Rule 14, the SMARTS pattern `['[c][CH2Br]']` should be checked to ensure it captures bromomethyl groups on aromatic rings accurately. The pattern should ensure the bromomethyl group is directly attached to the aromatic ring.

- ** Suggestion 15 **: For Rule 15, the SMARTS pattern `['[c][OX2H][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]']` should be verified to ensure it captures hydroxyl groups on phenyl rings with carboxylic acids accurately. The pattern should ensure both groups are present in the same molecule.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an amino group (-NH2) tend to result in high yield. This combination likely enhances coordination with metal centers, improving catalyst stability and reactivity. Examples: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid group and an electron-donating group (e.g., methyl) tend to result in low yield. The steric hindrance and electronic effects may hinder effective coordination. Examples: 4-methylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure with at least four hydroxyl groups, tend to result in high yield. These groups can form multiple hydrogen bonds, potentially stabilizing the catalyst structure. Example: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group (e.g., sulfanyl) and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield. The sulfur atom may provide additional coordination sites or influence the electronic properties of the catalyst. Examples: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (-NO2) on an aromatic ring tend to result in high yield. These groups can alter the electronic environment, potentially enhancing the catalytic activity. Example: 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with long aliphatic chains (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The hydrophobic nature and steric bulk of long chains may interfere with effective catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with additional functional groups like carboxylic acids tend to result in high yield. The pyridine's ability to coordinate with metal centers may enhance reactivity. Example: pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in low yield unless additional stabilizing groups such as amino or hydroxyl groups are present. Examples: 4-formylbenzoic acid (low yield), 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (low yield).

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (e.g., polyether chains) tend to result in low yield. The flexibility and potential steric hindrance of these chains may reduce effective interaction with the catalyst. Example: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on an aromatic ring, without additional electron-withdrawing groups, tend to result in low yield. The hydroxyl group alone may not provide sufficient coordination or electronic influence. Example: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in low yield unless paired with other electron-donating groups that could balance the electronic effects. Example: 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and an amino group tend to result in high yield. The combination of pyridine's coordination ability and the amino group's potential for hydrogen bonding may enhance catalyst performance. Example: 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with an indole group tend to result in high yield. The indole's aromaticity and potential for π-stacking interactions may stabilize the catalyst. Example: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a bromomethyl group attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in high yield. The bromine atom may enhance coordination through halogen bonding. Example: 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a phenyl ring and an additional carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield. The combination of hydrogen bonding and potential coordination sites may stabilize the catalyst. Example: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

Metric Commenter Message:
Based on the current rule metrics and comparing them to the previous metrics, here are some observations and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Confidence**: 
   - The current train confidence is 0.5439, which is slightly higher than the test confidence of the previous rules (0.4639) but lower than the train confidence of the previous rules (0.6352). This indicates that the current rules have a moderate level of reliability in predicting outcomes. However, there is room for improvement to increase the confidence level closer to or above the previous train confidence.

2. **Lift**:
   - The current train lift is 1.0912, which is an improvement over the test lift of the previous rules (0.6889) but still lower than the train lift of the previous rules (1.2048). A lift greater than 1 indicates that the rule is better than random guessing, but the current lift suggests that the rules are only marginally better. Efforts should be made to increase the lift to ensure that the rules provide a significant improvement over random predictions.

3. **Leverage**:
   - The current train leverage is 0.0019, which is positive but quite low. This suggests that the rules are not providing much additional support over what would be expected by chance. Increasing leverage would indicate stronger associations between the conditions and predictions.

4. **Support**:
   - The current train support is 0.0343, which is lower than the previous train support (0.1667). This suggests that the current rules apply to a smaller portion of the dataset. While high support is not always necessary, it is important to ensure that the rules are applicable to a meaningful portion of the data.

**Suggestions for Improvement**:
- **Refine Rule Conditions**: Consider refining the conditions of the rules to better capture the underlying patterns in the data. This could involve adding or removing conditions to increase the specificity and relevance of the rules.
- **Explore Additional Features**: Investigate additional features or modifiers that could be included in the rules to enhance their predictive power. This could involve exploring different chemical groups or structural features that may influence yield.
- **Optimize Rule Combinations**: Experiment with different combinations of rules to see if certain combinations yield higher confidence and lift. This could involve creating composite rules that combine multiple conditions.
- **Iterate and Validate**: Continue iterating on the rules and validate them against a separate test set to ensure that improvements in metrics are not due to overfitting. Regular validation will help ensure that the rules generalize well to new data.

Overall, while the current rules show some improvement over the previous test metrics, there is still room for enhancement, particularly in terms of confidence and lift. By refining the rules and exploring additional features, it may be possible to achieve better predictive performance.

ML Commenter Message:
### Performance Evaluation of Current Rules

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
   - The current rules seem to have mixed effectiveness. The validation accuracy has fluctuated between 0.57 and 0.66, which is lower than the previous reference accuracies of 0.76. This suggests that the current rules may not be capturing the underlying patterns as effectively as needed.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting:**
   - The model appears to be underfitting, as indicated by the lower validation accuracies compared to the reference metrics. This suggests that the rules may not be complex enough to capture the nuances of the data, or they might be missing critical features.

3. **Discrepancies Analysis:**
   - For molecules where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low, rules with high positive SHAP values (e.g., Rule 3, Rule 8) might be contributing to overestimation. Conversely, for molecules where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, rules with high negative SHAP values (e.g., Rule 13) might be contributing to underestimation.

4. **Accuracy Improvements:**
   - The current accuracy metrics suggest limited improvement potential with the existing rules. The validation accuracy has not shown significant improvement over iterations, indicating that the current set of rules may have reached a local minimum.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**
   - SHAP analysis indicates that certain rules (e.g., Rule 3, Rule 8, Rule 13) have a significant impact on the predictions. These rules should be closely examined and potentially refined to improve model performance. The SHAP values suggest that these rules might be too influential, leading to overestimation or underestimation in certain cases.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Overestimated Rules:**
   - **Rule 3**: Consider adding conditions to limit its applicability, such as requiring additional stabilizing groups or specific structural features that enhance coordination.
   - **Rule 8**: Re-evaluate the conditions under which formyl groups lead to low yield. Consider interactions with other functional groups that might mitigate the negative impact.

2. **Adjust Underestimated Rules:**
   - **Rule 13**: Investigate the conditions under which indole groups lead to high yield. Consider additional structural features or interactions that might enhance the rule's applicability.

3. **Improve Generalization:**
   - Introduce new rules or modify existing ones to capture more complex interactions, such as synergistic effects between multiple functional groups.
   - Consider incorporating additional features or descriptors that capture the electronic and steric environment more comprehensively.

4. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - Use insights from SHAP analysis to iteratively refine the rules. Focus on rules with high SHAP values and assess their impact on predictions. Adjust these rules to better align with experimental observations.

5. **Incorporate Domain Knowledge:**
   - Leverage domain expertise to identify potential new rules or modify existing ones. Consider the chemical and physical properties that might influence catalyst performance and incorporate these into the rule set.

By addressing these areas, the rules can be refined to improve model performance, reduce discrepancies between predicted and experimental values, and enhance the generalization capability of the model.

    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an amino group (-NH2) tend to result in high yield. This combination likely enhances coordination with metal centers, improving catalyst stability and reactivity. Examples: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid group and an electron-donating group (e.g., methyl) tend to result in low yield. The steric hindrance and electronic effects may hinder effective coordination. Examples: 4-methylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure with at least four hydroxyl groups, tend to result in high yield. These groups can form multiple hydrogen bonds, potentially stabilizing the catalyst structure. Example: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group (e.g., sulfanyl) and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield. The sulfur atom may provide additional coordination sites or influence the electronic properties of the catalyst. Examples: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (-NO2) on an aromatic ring tend to result in high yield. These groups can alter the electronic environment, potentially enhancing the catalytic activity. Example: 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with long aliphatic chains (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The hydrophobic nature and steric bulk of long chains may interfere with effective catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with additional functional groups like carboxylic acids tend to result in high yield. The pyridine's ability to coordinate with metal centers may enhance reactivity. Example: pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in low yield unless additional stabilizing groups such as amino or hydroxyl groups are present. Examples: 4-formylbenzoic acid (low yield), 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (low yield).

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (e.g., polyether chains) tend to result in low yield. The flexibility and potential steric hindrance of these chains may reduce effective interaction with the catalyst. Example: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on an aromatic ring, without additional electron-withdrawing groups, tend to result in low yield. The hydroxyl group alone may not provide sufficient coordination or electronic influence. Example: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in low yield unless paired with other electron-donating groups that could balance the electronic effects. Example: 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and an amino group tend to result in high yield. The combination of pyridine's coordination ability and the amino group's potential for hydrogen bonding may enhance catalyst performance. Example: 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with an indole group tend to result in high yield. The indole's aromaticity and potential for π-stacking interactions may stabilize the catalyst. Example: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a bromomethyl group attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in high yield. The bromine atom may enhance coordination through halogen bonding. Example: 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a phenyl ring and an additional carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield. The combination of hydrogen bonding and potential coordination sites may stabilize the catalyst. Example: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an amino group (-NH2) tend to result in high yield. This combination likely enhances coordination with metal centers, improving catalyst stability and reactivity. Examples: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid group and an electron-donating group (e.g., methyl) tend to result in low yield. The steric hindrance and electronic effects may hinder effective coordination. Examples: 4-methylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure with at least four hydroxyl groups, tend to result in high yield. These groups can form multiple hydrogen bonds, potentially stabilizing the catalyst structure. Example: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group (e.g., sulfanyl) and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield. The sulfur atom may provide additional coordination sites or influence the electronic properties of the catalyst. Examples: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (-NO2) on an aromatic ring tend to result in high yield. These groups can alter the electronic environment, potentially enhancing the catalytic activity. Example: 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with long aliphatic chains (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The hydrophobic nature and steric bulk of long chains may interfere with effective catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with additional functional groups like carboxylic acids tend to result in high yield. The pyridine's ability to coordinate with metal centers may enhance reactivity. Example: pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in low yield unless additional stabilizing groups such as amino or hydroxyl groups are present. Examples: 4-formylbenzoic acid (low yield), 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (low yield).

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (e.g., polyether chains) tend to result in low yield. The flexibility and potential steric hindrance of these chains may reduce effective interaction with the catalyst. Example: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on an aromatic ring, without additional electron-withdrawing groups, tend to result in low yield. The hydroxyl group alone may not provide sufficient coordination or electronic influence. Example: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in low yield unless paired with other electron-donating groups that could balance the electronic effects. Example: 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and an amino group tend to result in high yield. The combination of pyridine's coordination ability and the amino group's potential for hydrogen bonding may enhance catalyst performance. Example: 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with an indole group tend to result in high yield. The indole's aromaticity and potential for π-stacking interactions may stabilize the catalyst. Example: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a bromomethyl group attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in high yield. The bromine atom may enhance coordination through halogen bonding. Example: 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a phenyl ring and an additional carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield. The combination of hydrogen bonding and potential coordination sites may stabilize the catalyst. Example: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

    Train confidence: 0.546969696969697

Metric Commenter Message:
Based on the current rule metrics and comparing them to the previous metrics, here are some observations and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Confidence**: 
   - The current train confidence is 0.5469, which is slightly higher than some of the previous iterations (e.g., 0.5136 and 0.5439) but lower than the highest observed confidence of 0.6310. This indicates that the current rules are moderately reliable in predicting outcomes, but there is room for improvement to increase the confidence level further.

2. **Lift**: 
   - The current train lift is 1.0989, which is an improvement over some previous iterations (e.g., 1.0304 and 1.0911) but still not as high as the best lift observed (1.2675). A lift greater than 1 indicates that the rule is better than random guessing, but the closer the lift is to 1, the less impactful the rule is. Therefore, while the current lift is acceptable, it suggests that the rules could be refined to better capture the underlying patterns in the data.

3. **Leverage**: 
   - The current train leverage is 0.0031, which is positive, indicating a stronger association than expected by chance. However, it is relatively low compared to the highest leverage observed (0.0076). This suggests that while the rules are capturing some meaningful associations, they might not be capturing the most significant patterns.

4. **Support**: 
   - The current train support is 0.0247, which is lower than most previous iterations. This indicates that the rules apply to a smaller subset of the data, which might limit their generalizability. Increasing support could help in making the rules more applicable to a broader range of data.

**Suggestions for Improvement**:
- **Refine Rule Conditions**: Consider revisiting the conditions of the rules to ensure they are capturing the most relevant features. This might involve combining or modifying existing conditions to better align with high-confidence and high-lift scenarios.
  
- **Explore Additional Features**: Investigate whether there are additional features or interactions between features that could be incorporated into the rules to improve their predictive power.

- **Focus on High-Lift Rules**: Prioritize refining rules that have shown higher lift in previous iterations, as these are likely to have a more significant impact on improving the overall model performance.

- **Balance Between Support and Confidence**: Aim to find a balance between support and confidence. While high confidence is desirable, ensuring that the rules apply to a reasonable portion of the data (support) is also important for generalizability.

- **Iterative Testing and Validation**: Continue with iterative testing and validation to ensure that any changes made to the rules lead to improvements in both training and test metrics, particularly focusing on lift and confidence.

By focusing on these areas, the rules can be refined to improve their overall performance, making them more reliable and applicable to a wider range of scenarios.

### Performance Evaluation of Current Rules

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
   - The current rules are not highly effective, as indicated by the validation accuracy of 0.6, which is lower than the previous reference accuracies (0.76). This suggests that the rules may not be capturing the underlying patterns in the data effectively.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting:**
   - The consistent validation accuracy of 0.6 across iterations suggests potential underfitting. The model may not be complex enough to capture the nuances of the data, or the rules may not be sufficiently detailed or accurate.

3. **Discrepancies Analysis:**
   - For molecules where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low, rules with high positive SHAP values (e.g., Rule 3, Rule 8) may be problematic. These rules might be overestimating the impact of certain features.
   - Conversely, for molecules where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, rules with high negative SHAP values (e.g., Rule 13) may be underestimating the impact of certain features.

4. **Accuracy Improvements:**
   - The current accuracy metrics suggest limited improvement potential with the existing rules. The model's performance has plateaued, indicating that the current set of rules may have reached a local minimum.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**
   - SHAP analysis indicates that certain rules (e.g., Rule 13) consistently have high negative SHAP values for underestimated loadings, suggesting these rules may need refinement.
   - Rules with high positive SHAP values for overestimated loadings (e.g., Rule 3, Rule 8) should be scrutinized to ensure they are not overly optimistic in their predictions.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Overestimated Rules:**
   - Re-evaluate Rule 3 and Rule 8, which have high positive SHAP values for overestimated loadings. Consider adding conditions or constraints to these rules to prevent overestimation.

2. **Adjust Underestimated Rules:**
   - Modify Rule 13, which has high negative SHAP values for underestimated loadings. This rule may need to be broadened or adjusted to better capture the conditions under which high loading occurs.

3. **Improve Generalization:**
   - Introduce additional rules or modify existing ones to capture more complex interactions between features. This could help address underfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize.

4. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - Use insights from SHAP analysis to iteratively refine the rules. Focus on rules that consistently show high SHAP values (positive or negative) and adjust them based on the patterns observed in the data.

5. **Incorporate Additional Features:**
   - Consider incorporating new features or modifying existing ones to better capture the chemical properties influencing catalyst loading. This could involve exploring additional chemical groups or interactions not currently covered by the rules.

By implementing these recommendations, the model's performance can potentially be improved, leading to more accurate predictions and better alignment with experimental results.

### Summary and Directions for Optimization

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
   - The current rules are moderately effective, with a validation accuracy of 0.6, which is lower than previous reference accuracies. This suggests that the rules may not be capturing the underlying patterns in the data effectively.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting:**
   - The consistent validation accuracy across iterations suggests potential underfitting. The model may not be complex enough to capture the nuances of the data, or the rules may not be sufficiently detailed or accurate.

### Possibility for Further Optimization

There is potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. By refining the rules based on SHAP analysis and exploring additional features, the model's performance can be improved, leading to more accurate predictions and better alignment with experimental results.

    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an amino group (-NH2) tend to result in high yield. This combination likely enhances coordination with metal centers, improving catalyst stability and reactivity. Examples: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid group and an electron-donating group (e.g., methyl) tend to result in low yield. The steric hindrance and electronic effects may hinder effective coordination. Examples: 4-methylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure with at least four hydroxyl groups, tend to result in high yield. These groups can form multiple hydrogen bonds, potentially stabilizing the catalyst structure. Example: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group (e.g., sulfanyl) and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield. The sulfur atom may provide additional coordination sites or influence the electronic properties of the catalyst. Examples: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (-NO2) on an aromatic ring tend to result in high yield. These groups can alter the electronic environment, potentially enhancing the catalytic activity. Example: 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with long aliphatic chains (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The hydrophobic nature and steric bulk of long chains may interfere with effective catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with additional functional groups like carboxylic acids tend to result in high yield. The pyridine's ability to coordinate with metal centers may enhance reactivity. Example: pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in low yield unless additional stabilizing groups such as amino or hydroxyl groups are present. Examples: 4-formylbenzoic acid (low yield), 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (low yield).

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (e.g., polyether chains) tend to result in low yield. The flexibility and potential steric hindrance of these chains may reduce effective interaction with the catalyst. Example: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on an aromatic ring, without additional electron-withdrawing groups, tend to result in low yield. The hydroxyl group alone may not provide sufficient coordination or electronic influence. Example: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in low yield unless paired with other electron-donating groups that could balance the electronic effects. Example: 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and an amino group tend to result in high yield. The combination of pyridine's coordination ability and the amino group's potential for hydrogen bonding may enhance catalyst performance. Example: 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with an indole group tend to result in high yield. The indole's aromaticity and potential for π-stacking interactions may stabilize the catalyst. Example: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a bromomethyl group attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in high yield. The bromine atom may enhance coordination through halogen bonding. Example: 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a phenyl ring and an additional carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield. The combination of hydrogen bonding and potential coordination sites may stabilize the catalyst. Example: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.
