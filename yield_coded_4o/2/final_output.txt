    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both amino and carboxylic acid groups in a linear chain (e.g., 2-aminopentanedioic acid, 2-aminobutanedioic acid) tend to result in a high yield. This combination likely enhances interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid) generally lead to a high yield. The aromatic ring may provide stability or facilitate interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, pyridine-3-carboxylic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring may coordinate with the metal center, enhancing the catalytic activity.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group in a short chain (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The thiol group may act as a ligand or stabilizing agent.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The fused aromatic structure may stabilize the catalyst or transition state.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with an indole structure (e.g., (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The indole ring may provide additional stabilization through π-π interactions.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group in proximity to a carboxylic acid (e.g., 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The hydroxyl group may interfere with the reaction or catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid) generally result in a low yield. The presence of multiple ether groups might disrupt the interaction with the catalyst or substrate.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a formyl group attached to an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the formyl group may reduce the reactivity of the modifier.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (e.g., 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the trifluoromethyl group may hinder the reaction process.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a methoxy group attached to an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The methoxy group may enhance the electron density of the aromatic ring, facilitating the reaction.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and an adjacent aromatic ring (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The steric hindrance or electronic effects may reduce the modifier's effectiveness.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (e.g., octanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The long chain may introduce steric hindrance or reduce the interaction with the catalyst.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both amino and carboxylic acid groups in a linear chain (e.g., 2-aminopentanedioic acid, 2-aminobutanedioic acid) tend to result in a high yield. This combination likely enhances interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid) generally lead to a high yield. The aromatic ring may provide stability or facilitate interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, pyridine-3-carboxylic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring may coordinate with the metal center, enhancing the catalytic activity.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group in a short chain (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The thiol group may act as a ligand or stabilizing agent.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The fused aromatic structure may stabilize the catalyst or transition state.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with an indole structure (e.g., (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The indole ring may provide additional stabilization through π-π interactions.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group in proximity to a carboxylic acid (e.g., 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The hydroxyl group may interfere with the reaction or catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid) generally result in a low yield. The presence of multiple ether groups might disrupt the interaction with the catalyst or substrate.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a formyl group attached to an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the formyl group may reduce the reactivity of the modifier.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (e.g., 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the trifluoromethyl group may hinder the reaction process.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a methoxy group attached to an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The methoxy group may enhance the electron density of the aromatic ring, facilitating the reaction.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and an adjacent aromatic ring (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The steric hindrance or electronic effects may reduce the modifier's effectiveness.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (e.g., octanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The long chain may introduce steric hindrance or reduce the interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxyphenyl group (e.g., 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The hydroxy group may cause steric hindrance or disrupt the interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with an acetamido group in a linear chain (e.g., (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The acetamido group may introduce steric hindrance or alter the electronic environment unfavorably.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both amino and carboxylic acid groups in a linear chain (e.g., 2-aminopentanedioic acid, 2-aminobutanedioic acid) tend to result in a high yield. This combination likely enhances interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid) generally lead to a high yield. The aromatic ring may provide stability or facilitate interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring may coordinate with the metal center, enhancing the catalytic activity. However, if the pyridine ring is part of a larger, sterically hindered structure (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid), the yield may be low.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group in a short chain (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The thiol group may act as a ligand or stabilizing agent.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The fused aromatic structure may stabilize the catalyst or transition state.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with an indole structure (e.g., (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The indole ring may provide additional stabilization through π-π interactions.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group in proximity to a carboxylic acid (e.g., 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. However, if the hydroxyl group is on a longer aliphatic chain (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid), the yield may be low due to steric hindrance.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid) generally result in a low yield. The presence of multiple ether groups might disrupt the interaction with the catalyst or substrate.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a formyl group attached to an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the formyl group may reduce the reactivity of the modifier.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (e.g., 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the trifluoromethyl group may hinder the reaction process.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a methoxy group attached to an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The methoxy group may enhance the electron density of the aromatic ring, facilitating the reaction.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and an adjacent aromatic ring (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The steric hindrance or electronic effects may reduce the modifier's effectiveness.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (e.g., octanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The long chain may introduce steric hindrance or reduce the interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxyphenyl group (e.g., 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The hydroxy group may cause steric hindrance or disrupt the interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with an acetamido group in a linear chain (e.g., (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The acetamido group may introduce steric hindrance or alter the electronic environment unfavorably.
