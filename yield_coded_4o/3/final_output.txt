    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both an amino group (-NH2) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) tend to result in a high yield. This is likely due to the ability of these groups to coordinate with the metal center, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. Examples include (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid and 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid group (e.g., benzoic acid derivatives) generally lead to a high yield, especially if they also contain additional electron-donating groups like hydroxyl (-OH) or amino (-NH2). This could be due to the increased electron density aiding in metal coordination. Examples include 4-aminobenzoic acid and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing sulfur groups such as thiol (-SH) or sulfanyl groups tend to result in a high yield. The sulfur atom can provide strong coordination to the metal center, enhancing the catalyst's performance. Examples include 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups, such as sugar derivatives, tend to result in a high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups can form strong hydrogen bonds and coordinate with the metal center, stabilizing the catalyst. An example is (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (-NO2) or trifluoromethyl (-CF3) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield. These groups can decrease the electron density on the aromatic ring, reducing its ability to coordinate effectively with the metal center. Examples include 4-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with long aliphatic chains without additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The lack of polar or coordinating groups means these modifiers do not effectively stabilize the metal center. Examples include octanoic acid and 7-aminoheptanoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring tend to result in a high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing the catalyst's reactivity. Examples include pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a combination of an aromatic ring and a ketone group tend to result in a high yield. The ketone group can act as a good electron donor, enhancing the coordination with the metal center. An example is 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield. The formyl group can withdraw electron density from the aromatic ring, reducing its ability to coordinate effectively with the metal center. Examples include 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a methoxy group (-OCH3) attached to an aliphatic chain tend to result in a low yield. The methoxy group may not provide sufficient electron density or coordination capability to stabilize the metal center. An example is 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both an amino group (-NH2) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) tend to result in a high yield. These groups can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. Examples include (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid and 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid group, especially if they also contain additional electron-donating groups like hydroxyl (-OH) or amino (-NH2), generally lead to a high yield. This could be due to the increased electron density aiding in metal coordination. Examples include 4-aminobenzoic acid and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing sulfur groups such as thiol (-SH) or sulfanyl groups tend to result in a high yield. The sulfur atom can provide strong coordination to the metal center, enhancing the catalyst's performance. Examples include 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups, such as sugar derivatives, tend to result in a high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups can form strong hydrogen bonds and coordinate with the metal center, stabilizing the catalyst. An example is (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (-NO2) or trifluoromethyl (-CF3) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield. These groups can decrease the electron density on the aromatic ring, reducing its ability to coordinate effectively with the metal center. Examples include 4-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with long aliphatic chains without additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The lack of polar or coordinating groups means these modifiers do not effectively stabilize the metal center. Examples include octanoic acid and 7-aminoheptanoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring tend to result in a high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing the catalyst's reactivity. Examples include pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a combination of an aromatic ring and a ketone group tend to result in a high yield. The ketone group can act as a good electron donor, enhancing the coordination with the metal center. An example is 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield. The formyl group can withdraw electron density from the aromatic ring, reducing its ability to coordinate effectively with the metal center. Examples include 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a methoxy group (-OCH3) attached to an aliphatic chain tend to result in a low yield. The methoxy group may not provide sufficient electron density or coordination capability to stabilize the metal center. An example is 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with an indole moiety tend to result in a high yield. The indole structure can provide a planar aromatic system with potential for Ï€-stacking and coordination with the metal center. An example is (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a pyrazole ring tend to result in a high yield. The nitrogen atoms in the pyrazole ring can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing the catalyst's reactivity. An example is 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a benzofuran moiety tend to result in a high yield. The benzofuran structure can provide a planar aromatic system with potential for Ï€-stacking and coordination with the metal center. An example is 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a high yield. The combination of the nitrogen in the pyridine ring and the carboxylic acid group can enhance coordination with the metal center. An example is 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a combination of an aromatic ring and a hydroxyl group tend to result in a high yield. The hydroxyl group can act as a good electron donor, enhancing the coordination with the metal center. An example is 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both an amino group (-NH2) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) tend to result in a high yield. These groups can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. Examples include (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid and 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid group, especially if they also contain additional electron-donating groups like hydroxyl (-OH) or amino (-NH2), generally lead to a high yield. This could be due to the increased electron density aiding in metal coordination. Examples include 4-aminobenzoic acid and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing sulfur groups such as thiol (-SH) or sulfanyl groups tend to result in a high yield. The sulfur atom can provide strong coordination to the metal center, enhancing the catalyst's performance. Examples include 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups, such as sugar derivatives, tend to result in a high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups can form strong hydrogen bonds and coordinate with the metal center, stabilizing the catalyst. An example is (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (-NO2) or trifluoromethyl (-CF3) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield. These groups can decrease the electron density on the aromatic ring, reducing its ability to coordinate effectively with the metal center. Examples include 4-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with long aliphatic chains without additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The lack of polar or coordinating groups means these modifiers do not effectively stabilize the metal center. Examples include octanoic acid and 7-aminoheptanoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring tend to result in a high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing the catalyst's reactivity. Examples include pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a combination of an aromatic ring and a ketone group tend to result in a high yield. The ketone group can act as a good electron donor, enhancing the coordination with the metal center. An example is 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield. The formyl group can withdraw electron density from the aromatic ring, reducing its ability to coordinate effectively with the metal center. Examples include 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a methoxy group (-OCH3) attached to an aliphatic chain tend to result in a low yield. The methoxy group may not provide sufficient electron density or coordination capability to stabilize the metal center. An example is 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with an indole moiety tend to result in a high yield. The indole structure can provide a planar aromatic system with potential for Ï€-stacking and coordination with the metal center. An example is (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a pyrazole ring tend to result in a high yield. The nitrogen atoms in the pyrazole ring can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing the catalyst's reactivity. An example is 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a benzofuran moiety tend to result in a high yield. The benzofuran structure can provide a planar aromatic system with potential for Ï€-stacking and coordination with the metal center. An example is 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a high yield. The combination of the nitrogen in the pyridine ring and the carboxylic acid group can enhance coordination with the metal center. An example is 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a combination of an aromatic ring and a hydroxyl group tend to result in a high yield. The hydroxyl group can act as a good electron donor, enhancing the coordination with the metal center. An example is 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both an amino group (-NH2) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) tend to result in a high yield. These groups can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. Examples include (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid and 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid group, especially if they also contain additional electron-donating groups like hydroxyl (-OH) or amino (-NH2), generally lead to a high yield. This could be due to the increased electron density aiding in metal coordination. Examples include 4-aminobenzoic acid and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing sulfur groups such as thiol (-SH) or sulfanyl groups tend to result in a high yield. The sulfur atom can provide strong coordination to the metal center, enhancing the catalyst's performance. Examples include 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups, such as sugar derivatives, tend to result in a high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups can form strong hydrogen bonds and coordinate with the metal center, stabilizing the catalyst. An example is (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (-NO2) or trifluoromethyl (-CF3) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield. These groups can decrease the electron density on the aromatic ring, reducing its ability to coordinate effectively with the metal center. Examples include 4-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with long aliphatic chains without additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The lack of polar or coordinating groups means these modifiers do not effectively stabilize the metal center. Examples include octanoic acid and 7-aminoheptanoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring tend to result in a high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing the catalyst's reactivity. Examples include pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a combination of an aromatic ring and a ketone group tend to result in a high yield. The ketone group can act as a good electron donor, enhancing the coordination with the metal center. An example is 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield. The formyl group can withdraw electron density from the aromatic ring, reducing its ability to coordinate effectively with the metal center. Examples include 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a methoxy group (-OCH3) attached to an aliphatic chain tend to result in a low yield. The methoxy group may not provide sufficient electron density or coordination capability to stabilize the metal center. An example is 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with an indole moiety tend to result in a high yield. The indole structure can provide a planar aromatic system with potential for Ï€-stacking and coordination with the metal center. An example is (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a pyrazole ring tend to result in a high yield. The nitrogen atoms in the pyrazole ring can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing the catalyst's reactivity. An example is 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a benzofuran moiety tend to result in a high yield. The benzofuran structure can provide a planar aromatic system with potential for Ï€-stacking and coordination with the metal center. An example is 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a high yield. The combination of the nitrogen in the pyridine ring and the carboxylic acid group can enhance coordination with the metal center. An example is 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a combination of an aromatic ring and a hydroxyl group tend to result in a high yield. The hydroxyl group can act as a good electron donor, enhancing the coordination with the metal center. An example is 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with an indole moiety tend to result in a high yield. The indole structure can provide a planar aromatic system with potential for Ï€-stacking and coordination with the metal center. An example is (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a pyrazole ring tend to result in a high yield. The nitrogen atoms in the pyrazole ring can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing the catalyst's reactivity. An example is 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a benzofuran moiety tend to result in a high yield. The benzofuran structure can provide a planar aromatic system with potential for Ï€-stacking and coordination with the metal center. An example is 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a high yield. The combination of the nitrogen in the pyridine ring and the carboxylic acid group can enhance coordination with the metal center. An example is 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a combination of an aromatic ring and a hydroxyl group tend to result in a high yield. The hydroxyl group can act as a good electron donor, enhancing the coordination with the metal center. An example is 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both an amino group (-NH2) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) tend to result in a high yield. These groups can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. Examples include (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid and 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid group, especially if they also contain additional electron-donating groups like hydroxyl (-OH) or amino (-NH2), generally lead to a high yield. This could be due to the increased electron density aiding in metal coordination. Examples include 4-aminobenzoic acid and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing sulfur groups such as thiol (-SH) or sulfanyl groups tend to result in a high yield. The sulfur atom can provide strong coordination to the metal center, enhancing the catalyst's performance. Examples include 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups, such as sugar derivatives, tend to result in a high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups can form strong hydrogen bonds and coordinate with the metal center, stabilizing the catalyst. An example is (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (-NO2) or trifluoromethyl (-CF3) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield. These groups can decrease the electron density on the aromatic ring, reducing its ability to coordinate effectively with the metal center. Examples include 4-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with long aliphatic chains without additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. The lack of polar or coordinating groups means these modifiers do not effectively stabilize the metal center. Examples include octanoic acid and 7-aminoheptanoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring tend to result in a high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing the catalyst's reactivity. Examples include pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a combination of an aromatic ring and a ketone group tend to result in a high yield. The ketone group can act as a good electron donor, enhancing the coordination with the metal center. An example is 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield. The formyl group can withdraw electron density from the aromatic ring, reducing its ability to coordinate effectively with the metal center. Examples include 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a methoxy group (-OCH3) attached to an aliphatic chain tend to result in a low yield. The methoxy group may not provide sufficient electron density or coordination capability to stabilize the metal center. An example is 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.
