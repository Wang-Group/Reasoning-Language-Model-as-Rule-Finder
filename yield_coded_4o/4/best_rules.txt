**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group (COOH) and an amino group (NH2) tend to result in a high yield. This rule covers compounds like (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid and (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group (C6H5) and a hydroxyl group (OH) tend to result in a high yield. This rule includes compounds such as 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a sulfanyl group (SH) and a carboxylic acid group (COOH) tend to result in a high yield. This rule covers compounds like 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring tend to result in a high yield. This rule includes compounds such as pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing a formyl group (CHO) tend to result in a low yield. This rule covers compounds like 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid and 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (e.g., -O-CH2-CH2-O-) tend to result in a low yield. This rule includes compounds such as 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing a nitro group (NO2) tend to result in a high yield. This rule includes compounds like 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a fluorinated alkyl chain tend to result in a low yield. This rule covers compounds like 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a benzofuranone structure tend to result in a high yield. This rule includes compounds like 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with an indole structure tend to result in a high yield. This rule includes compounds like (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.
