    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. This is likely due to the ability of the aromatic ring to stabilize the catalyst structure through π-π interactions.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group adjacent to an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid) are associated with high yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the carboxylic acid may enhance the reactivity of the catalyst.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), tend to lead to high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups can facilitate hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) are associated with high yield. The presence of sulfur may contribute to the electron-donating ability, enhancing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) generally result in high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing a trifluoromethyl group (e.g., 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing nature of the trifluoromethyl group may destabilize the catalyst or reduce its reactivity.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a methoxy group adjacent to an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid) tend to result in high yield. The methoxy group can donate electrons through resonance, potentially enhancing catalyst stability.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a formyl group (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The formyl group may act as an electron-withdrawing group, reducing the effectiveness of the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a simple aliphatic chain and no additional functional groups (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of functional groups may limit interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group combined with an electron-donating group (e.g., methoxy) on an aromatic ring may result in a balanced yield. The electron-donating group can mitigate the electron-withdrawing effect of the trifluoromethyl group.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a formyl group combined with an electron-donating group (e.g., amino) on an aromatic ring may result in a balanced yield. The electron-donating group can mitigate the electron-withdrawing effect of the formyl group.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a simple aliphatic chain and no additional functional groups (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of functional groups may limit interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups on the same aromatic ring (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid with an additional methoxy group) can lead to high yield due to the stabilization of the catalyst through balanced electronic effects.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. The benzofuran ring can provide additional π-π interactions and electron delocalization, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with an aromatic ring and specific stereochemistry (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The stereochemistry and aromatic ring can enhance π-π interactions and stabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group adjacent to an aromatic ring, especially with electron-withdrawing substituents like nitro or bromo groups (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid), are associated with high yield. These substituents can enhance the reactivity of the catalyst through electron-withdrawing effects.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups in sugar-like structures, considering different stereoisomers (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), tend to lead to high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups facilitate hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group or thioether (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) are associated with high yield. The sulfur-containing groups contribute to electron-donating ability, enhancing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) generally result in high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a methoxy group adjacent to an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid) tend to result in high yield. The methoxy group can donate electrons through resonance, potentially enhancing catalyst stability.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. The benzofuran ring can provide additional π-π interactions and electron delocalization, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a simple aliphatic chain and no additional functional groups (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of functional groups may limit interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a formyl group on an aromatic ring without any electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the formyl group may destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with an ether linkage combined with an electron-withdrawing group (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid) tend to result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing effect may reduce the catalyst's reactivity.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group without compensating electron-donating groups (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) are associated with low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing effect can destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on a long aliphatic chain (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The isolated hydroxy group may not sufficiently interact with the catalyst to enhance yield.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a methyl group on an aromatic ring without additional electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of significant electron-donating effects may limit catalyst stabilization.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a pyridine ring in the same molecule (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The combination of these groups may lead to competitive binding or destabilization of the catalyst.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on an aromatic ring and a formyl group (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing formyl group may counteract the potential stabilizing effect of the hydroxy group.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with an aromatic ring and specific stereochemistry (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The stereochemistry and aromatic ring can enhance π-π interactions and stabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group adjacent to an aromatic ring, especially with electron-withdrawing substituents like nitro or bromo groups (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid), are associated with high yield. These substituents can enhance the reactivity of the catalyst through electron-withdrawing effects.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups in sugar-like structures, considering different stereoisomers (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), tend to lead to high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups facilitate hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group or thioether (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) are associated with high yield. The sulfur-containing groups contribute to electron-donating ability, enhancing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and additional electron-donating groups at ortho or para positions (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) generally result in high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially stabilizing the catalyst, especially when electron-donating groups are present.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a methoxy group adjacent to an aromatic ring, particularly when multiple methoxy groups are present and positioned ortho or para to each other (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), tend to result in high yield. The methoxy groups can donate electrons through resonance, potentially enhancing catalyst stability.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. The benzofuran ring can provide additional π-π interactions and electron delocalization, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a simple aliphatic chain and no additional functional groups (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of functional groups may limit interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a formyl group on an aromatic ring without any electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the formyl group may destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with an ether linkage combined with an electron-withdrawing group, especially when the ether linkage is extensive (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid), tend to result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing effect may reduce the catalyst's reactivity.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group without compensating electron-donating groups (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) are associated with low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing effect can destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on a long aliphatic chain (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The isolated hydroxy group may not sufficiently interact with the catalyst to enhance yield.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a methyl group on an aromatic ring without additional electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of significant electron-donating effects may limit catalyst stabilization.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on an aromatic ring and a formyl group (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing formyl group may counteract the potential stabilizing effect of the hydroxy group.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a pyridine ring in the same molecule, especially when no additional stabilizing groups are present (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid), tend to result in low yield. The combination of these groups may lead to competitive binding or destabilization of the catalyst.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with an aromatic ring and specific stereochemistry (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The stereochemistry and aromatic ring can enhance π-π interactions and stabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group adjacent to an aromatic ring, especially with electron-withdrawing substituents like nitro or bromo groups (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid), are associated with high yield. These substituents can enhance the reactivity of the catalyst through electron-withdrawing effects.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups in sugar-like structures, considering different stereoisomers (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), tend to lead to high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups facilitate hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group or thioether (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) are associated with high yield. The sulfur-containing groups contribute to electron-donating ability, enhancing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and additional electron-donating groups at ortho or para positions (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) generally result in high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially stabilizing the catalyst, especially when electron-donating groups are present.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a methoxy group adjacent to an aromatic ring, particularly when multiple methoxy groups are present and positioned ortho or para to each other (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), tend to result in high yield. The methoxy groups can donate electrons through resonance, potentially enhancing catalyst stability.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. The benzofuran ring can provide additional π-π interactions and electron delocalization, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a simple aliphatic chain and no additional functional groups (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of functional groups may limit interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a formyl group on an aromatic ring without any electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the formyl group may destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with an ether linkage combined with an electron-withdrawing group, especially when the ether linkage is extensive (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid), tend to result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing effect may reduce the catalyst's reactivity.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group without compensating electron-donating groups (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) are associated with low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing effect can destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on a long aliphatic chain (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The isolated hydroxy group may not sufficiently interact with the catalyst to enhance yield.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a methyl group on an aromatic ring without additional electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of significant electron-donating effects may limit catalyst stabilization.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on an aromatic ring and a formyl group (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing formyl group may counteract the potential stabilizing effect of the hydroxy group.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a pyridine ring in the same molecule, especially when no additional stabilizing groups are present (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid), tend to result in low yield. The combination of these groups may lead to competitive binding or destabilization of the catalyst.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with an aromatic ring and specific stereochemistry (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The stereochemistry and aromatic ring can enhance π-π interactions and stabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group directly adjacent to an aromatic ring with electron-withdrawing substituents like nitro or bromo groups (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid) are associated with high yield. These substituents can enhance the reactivity of the catalyst through electron-withdrawing effects.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups in sugar-like structures with specific stereochemistry (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid) tend to lead to high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups facilitate hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group or thioether (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) are associated with high yield. The sulfur-containing groups contribute to electron-donating ability, enhancing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and additional electron-donating groups at ortho or para positions (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) generally result in high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially stabilizing the catalyst, especially when electron-donating groups are present.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a methoxy group adjacent to an aromatic ring, particularly when multiple methoxy groups are present and positioned ortho or para to each other (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), tend to result in high yield. The methoxy groups can donate electrons through resonance, potentially enhancing catalyst stability.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. The benzofuran ring can provide additional π-π interactions and electron delocalization, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a simple aliphatic chain and no additional functional groups (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of functional groups may limit interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a formyl group on an aromatic ring without any electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the formyl group may destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with an ether linkage combined with an electron-withdrawing group, especially when the ether linkage is extensive (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid), tend to result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing effect may reduce the catalyst's reactivity.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group without compensating electron-donating groups (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) are associated with low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing effect can destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on a long aliphatic chain (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The isolated hydroxy group may not sufficiently interact with the catalyst to enhance yield.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a methyl group on an aromatic ring without additional electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of significant electron-donating effects may limit catalyst stabilization.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on an aromatic ring and a formyl group (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing formyl group may counteract the potential stabilizing effect of the hydroxy group.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a pyridine ring in the same molecule, especially when no additional stabilizing groups are present (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid), tend to result in low yield. The combination of these groups may lead to competitive binding or destabilization of the catalyst.
