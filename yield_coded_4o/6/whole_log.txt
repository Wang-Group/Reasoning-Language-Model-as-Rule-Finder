**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. This is likely due to the ability of the aromatic ring to stabilize the catalyst structure through π-π interactions.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group adjacent to an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid) are associated with high yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the carboxylic acid may enhance the reactivity of the catalyst.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), tend to lead to high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups can facilitate hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) are associated with high yield. The presence of sulfur may contribute to the electron-donating ability, enhancing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) generally result in high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing a trifluoromethyl group (e.g., 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing nature of the trifluoromethyl group may destabilize the catalyst or reduce its reactivity.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a methoxy group adjacent to an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid) tend to result in high yield. The methoxy group can donate electrons through resonance, potentially enhancing catalyst stability.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a formyl group (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The formyl group may act as an electron-withdrawing group, reducing the effectiveness of the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a simple aliphatic chain and no additional functional groups (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of functional groups may limit interactions with the catalyst.

** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern `[NX3H2+0,NX4H3+;$([N][c])]` does not accurately capture the presence of an amino acid structure with an aromatic ring. Consider using a pattern that identifies both the amino acid backbone and the aromatic ring, such as `[$([NX3H2][CX3](=O)[O-])][c]`.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: For Rule 2, the SMARTS pattern `[c][CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])[OX2H]` should be refined to ensure it captures the carboxylic acid group adjacent to an aromatic ring. Consider using `[c][CX3](=O)[OX2H]` to better match the structural description.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For Rule 3, the SMARTS pattern `[OX2H][CX4;!$(C(O)(O)[!#6])][OX2H]` may not effectively capture sugar-like structures with multiple hydroxyl groups. Consider using a pattern that identifies multiple hydroxyl groups, such as `[$([OX2H][CX4][OX2H])]`.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: For Rule 4, the SMARTS pattern `[SX2H;$([SX2H][CX4])]` should be checked to ensure it captures the presence of a sulfanyl group. Consider using `[SX2H]` to directly identify the sulfanyl group.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: For Rule 5, the SMARTS pattern `[n]1ccccc1` is correct for identifying a pyridine ring. Ensure that the SMILES strings are correctly parsed to match this pattern.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: For Rule 6, the SMARTS pattern `[CX4](F)(F)F` is correct for identifying a trifluoromethyl group. Ensure that the SMILES strings are correctly parsed to match this pattern.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: For Rule 7, the SMARTS pattern `[c][OX2;$([OX2][c])]` should be refined to ensure it captures a methoxy group adjacent to an aromatic ring. Consider using `[c][OX2][c]` to better match the structural description.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: For Rule 8, the SMARTS pattern `[CX3H]=[OX1]` is correct for identifying a formyl group. Ensure that the SMILES strings are correctly parsed to match this pattern.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: For Rule 9, the SMARTS pattern `[CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4]` may not effectively capture simple aliphatic chains. Consider using a more general pattern like `[CX4]` to identify aliphatic chains without additional functional groups.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Review the SMILES parsing and substructure matching process to ensure that all relevant substructures are correctly identified. This may involve refining the SMARTS patterns or adjusting the parsing logic.

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern `[$([NX3H2][CX3](=O)[O-])][c]` does not accurately capture the description of "amino acid structure with an aromatic ring." The SMARTS should be adjusted to capture amino acids with aromatic rings, such as `[$([NX3H2][CX3](=O)[O-])][c]` should be modified to include aromatic rings, e.g., `[$([NX3H2][CX3](=O)[O-])][c]1[cH][cH][cH][cH][cH]1`.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: For Rule 2, the SMARTS pattern `[c][CX3](=O)[OX2H]` is correct for carboxylic acid adjacent to an aromatic ring. However, ensure that the aromatic ring is explicitly defined, e.g., `[c]1[cH][cH][cH][cH][cH]1[CX3](=O)[OX2H]`.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For Rule 3, the SMARTS pattern `[$([OX2H][CX4][OX2H])]` should be refined to capture sugar-like structures with multiple hydroxyl groups. Consider using a pattern that captures multiple hydroxyl groups in a cyclic structure, e.g., `[$([OX2H][CX4][OX2H])]` should be expanded to include cyclic structures with multiple hydroxyl groups.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: For Rule 4, the SMARTS pattern `[SX2H]` is correct for a sulfanyl group. Ensure that it captures the presence of sulfur in the correct context.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: For Rule 5, the SMARTS pattern `[n]1ccccc1` correctly captures a pyridine ring. Ensure that the nitrogen is part of the aromatic ring.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: For Rule 6, the SMARTS pattern `[CX4](F)(F)F` correctly captures a trifluoromethyl group. Ensure that it is applied correctly to identify low yield predictions.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: For Rule 7, the SMARTS pattern `[c][OX2][c]` should be refined to ensure it captures methoxy groups adjacent to aromatic rings. Consider using a more specific pattern, e.g., `[c]1[cH][cH][cH][cH][cH]1[OX2][c]`.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: For Rule 8, the SMARTS pattern `[CX3H]=[OX1]` correctly captures a formyl group. Ensure that it is applied correctly to identify low yield predictions.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: For Rule 9, the SMARTS pattern `[CX4]` is too broad and may capture any aliphatic carbon. Refine it to capture simple aliphatic chains without additional functional groups, e.g., `[CX4][CX4][CX4]`.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Review the SMILES strings and ensure that the SMARTS patterns are applied correctly to each SMILES. If a rule is not matching as expected, verify the SMARTS pattern and the SMILES structure for compatibility.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), tend to lead to high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups can facilitate hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) are associated with high yield. The presence of sulfur may contribute to the electron-donating ability, enhancing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) generally result in high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing a trifluoromethyl group (e.g., 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing nature of the trifluoromethyl group may destabilize the catalyst or reduce its reactivity.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a methoxy group adjacent to an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid) tend to result in high yield. The methoxy group can donate electrons through resonance, potentially enhancing catalyst stability.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a formyl group (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The formyl group may act as an electron-withdrawing group, reducing the effectiveness of the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a simple aliphatic chain and no additional functional groups (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of functional groups may limit interactions with the catalyst.

** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern `[$([NX3H2][CX3](=O)[O-])][c]1[cH][cH][cH][cH][cH]1` does not accurately capture the presence of an amino acid structure with an aromatic ring. The pattern should be revised to include a broader range of amino acid structures, such as `[$([NX3][CX3](=O)[O-])][c]1[cH][cH][cH][cH][cH]1` to account for different amino acid configurations.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: For Rule 2, the SMARTS pattern `[c]1[cH][cH][cH][cH][cH]1[CX3](=O)[OX2H]` may not fully capture all carboxylic acid groups adjacent to aromatic rings. Consider using a more general pattern like `[c][CX3](=O)[OX2H]` to ensure all relevant structures are matched.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: Rule 3's SMARTS pattern `[$([OX2H][CX4][OX2H])]` is too specific and may not match all sugar-like structures with multiple hydroxyl groups. A more flexible pattern such as `[$([OX2H][CX4][OX2H]),$([OX2H][CX4][OX2H][CX4][OX2H])]` could be used to capture a wider range of sugar-like structures.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: For Rule 4, the SMARTS pattern `[SX2H]` is correct for identifying sulfanyl groups, but ensure that the SMILES strings are correctly parsed to identify this group.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: Rule 5's SMARTS pattern `[n]1ccccc1` correctly identifies pyridine rings. However, ensure that the SMILES strings are correctly parsed to identify this group.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: For Rule 6, the SMARTS pattern `[CX4](F)(F)F` is correct for identifying trifluoromethyl groups. Ensure that the SMILES strings are correctly parsed to identify this group.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: Rule 7's SMARTS pattern `[c]1[cH][cH][cH][cH][cH]1[OX2][c]` may not fully capture methoxy groups adjacent to aromatic rings. Consider using a more general pattern like `[c][OX2][c]` to ensure all relevant structures are matched.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: For Rule 8, the SMARTS pattern `[CX3H]=[OX1]` is correct for identifying formyl groups. Ensure that the SMILES strings are correctly parsed to identify this group.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: Rule 9's SMARTS pattern `[CX4][CX4][CX4]` may not fully capture simple aliphatic chains. Consider using a more general pattern like `[CX4][CX4]` to ensure all relevant structures are matched.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Ensure that the code correctly assigns 1 or -1 based on the rule's prediction of high or low yield. Double-check the logic that determines whether a rule predicts a high or low yield and ensure it aligns with the natural language description.

Metric Commenter Message:
Based on the current metrics, we can make the following observations and comments regarding the performance of the current rules:

1. **Train Support**: The current train support is 0.0413, which is significantly lower than the previous train support values of 0.1667 and 0.1845. This indicates that the current rules apply to a smaller portion of the training data compared to the previous rules. While this might suggest more specific rules, it could also mean that the rules are not capturing a broad enough pattern in the data.

2. **Train Confidence**: The current train confidence is 0.5321, which is slightly lower than the previous train confidence values of 0.6352 and 0.5396. This suggests that the current rules are slightly less reliable in predicting the outcome compared to the previous rules. However, the confidence is still above 50%, indicating a moderate level of reliability.

3. **Train Lift**: The current train lift is 1.0628, which is an improvement over the previous test lift values of 0.6889 and 0.9137 but slightly lower than the previous train lift of 1.2048. A lift value greater than 1 indicates that the rule is better than random guessing, but the current lift is only marginally above 1, suggesting that the rules are not significantly improving the prediction over the baseline probability.

4. **Train Leverage**: The current train leverage is 0.0044, which is a positive value, indicating a slight positive association between the rule conditions and the predictions. However, this value is quite small, suggesting that the rules do not provide a substantial improvement over what would be expected by chance.

**Recommendations for Improvement**:

- **Increase Support**: Consider revising the rules to cover a broader range of data. This could involve generalizing some of the conditions or combining similar rules to increase the overall support.

- **Enhance Confidence**: Focus on refining the rules to improve their reliability. This might involve identifying additional conditions or modifying existing ones to better capture the underlying patterns that lead to high yield.

- **Boost Lift**: Aim to develop rules that significantly enhance the probability of the desired outcome compared to the baseline. This could involve exploring new combinations of modifiers or functional groups that have a stronger impact on yield.

- **Improve Leverage**: Work on identifying rules that provide a more substantial improvement over random chance. This might involve focusing on interactions between different functional groups or exploring the impact of less common modifiers.

Overall, while the current rules show some level of effectiveness, there is room for improvement in terms of support, confidence, lift, and leverage. By refining the rules and exploring new patterns, it may be possible to achieve better performance in predicting high yield outcomes.

### Performance Evaluation of Current Rules

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
   - The current validation accuracy of 0.514 is significantly lower than the previous reference accuracies, which were consistently around 0.76. This suggests that the current rules are not effective enough in predicting the loading of modifiers on catalysts.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment:**
   - The drop in validation accuracy indicates potential underfitting. The model may not be capturing the underlying patterns in the data effectively, possibly due to overly simplistic or incorrect rules.

3. **Discrepancies Analysis:**
   - For molecules where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low, Rule 6 and Rule 8 consistently have high positive SHAP values. This suggests that these rules might be overestimating the loading.
   - Conversely, for molecules where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, Rule 6 and Rule 8 also show high negative SHAP values, indicating they might be underestimating the loading.

4. **Accuracy Improvements Interpretation:**
   - The current accuracy metrics suggest that there is a significant opportunity for improvement. The rules need refinement to better capture the relationship between molecular features and catalyst loading.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**
   - The SHAP analysis indicates that Rule 6 and Rule 8 are consistently contributing to incorrect predictions. This suggests that these rules may need to be revised or replaced to improve model performance.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Rules with High Positive SHAP Values:**
   - **Rule 6**: Consider revising the impact of the trifluoromethyl group. It may not always lead to low yield, and its effect might be context-dependent. Investigate if there are specific conditions or additional features that modify its impact.
   - **Rule 8**: Re-evaluate the influence of the formyl group. It might not universally lead to low yield, and its interaction with other functional groups should be considered.

2. **Adjust Rules with High Negative SHAP Values:**
   - **Rule 6 and Rule 8**: These rules should be adjusted to account for cases where they underestimate the loading. Consider incorporating additional features or interactions that could influence the outcome.

3. **Improve Generalization:**
   - Introduce more nuanced rules that consider the context and interactions between different functional groups. This could help in addressing the underfitting issue and improve the model's ability to generalize across different molecules.

4. **Iterative Refinement Using SHAP Insights:**
   - Use the SHAP analysis to identify patterns in the data that are not currently captured by the rules. This could involve exploring new features or modifying existing ones to better align with the experimental outcomes.

5. **Additional Considerations:**
   - Consider incorporating machine learning techniques to automatically identify and validate new rules or features that could improve the model's performance.
   - Regularly evaluate the model's performance on a separate test set to ensure that improvements in validation accuracy translate to better generalization.

### Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimization

1. **Effectiveness and Performance of Current Rules:**
   - The current rules show a lower train support and confidence compared to previous iterations, indicating that they apply to a smaller portion of the data and are slightly less reliable.
   - The train lift is marginally above 1, suggesting that the rules are only slightly better than random guessing.
   - The validation accuracy has significantly dropped to 0.514, indicating potential underfitting and a need for rule refinement.

2. **SHAP Analysis Insights:**
   - Rules 6 and 8 are consistently contributing to incorrect predictions, both overestimating and underestimating the loading of modifiers on catalysts.
   - These rules may need to be revised to better capture the relationship between molecular features and catalyst loading.

3. **Recommendations for Improvement:**
   - **Refine Rules with High SHAP Values:** Re-evaluate the impact of functional groups like trifluoromethyl and formyl, considering their context-dependent effects.
   - **Adjust Rules for Better Generalization:** Introduce more nuanced rules that consider interactions between different functional groups to address underfitting.
   - **Iterative Refinement Using SHAP Insights:** Use SHAP analysis to identify patterns not captured by current rules and explore new features or modify existing ones.
   - **Incorporate Machine Learning Techniques:** Consider using machine learning to automatically identify and validate new rules or features.

### Possibility for Further Optimization

There is a clear possibility for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. The current rules are underfitting, as indicated by the low validation accuracy and train support. By refining the rules and incorporating additional features or interactions, the model's performance can be improved.

**Please Optimize Rules**

    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. This is likely due to the ability of the aromatic ring to stabilize the catalyst structure through π-π interactions.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group adjacent to an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid) are associated with high yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the carboxylic acid may enhance the reactivity of the catalyst.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), tend to lead to high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups can facilitate hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) are associated with high yield. The presence of sulfur may contribute to the electron-donating ability, enhancing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) generally result in high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing a trifluoromethyl group (e.g., 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing nature of the trifluoromethyl group may destabilize the catalyst or reduce its reactivity.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a methoxy group adjacent to an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid) tend to result in high yield. The methoxy group can donate electrons through resonance, potentially enhancing catalyst stability.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a formyl group (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The formyl group may act as an electron-withdrawing group, reducing the effectiveness of the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a simple aliphatic chain and no additional functional groups (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of functional groups may limit interactions with the catalyst.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: Re-evaluate Rules 6 and 8, which involve trifluoromethyl and formyl groups, respectively. Consider the context in which these groups are present and their interactions with other functional groups. This may involve creating sub-rules that account for specific combinations of functional groups that could mitigate the negative effects of trifluoromethyl and formyl groups.

- **Advice 2**: Introduce rules that consider the synergistic effects of multiple functional groups. For example, a rule could be developed to capture the interaction between electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups within the same molecule, which might stabilize or destabilize the catalyst differently.

- **Advice 3**: Utilize SHAP analysis to identify modifiers that consistently lead to high or low yields but are not currently covered by existing rules. This can help in formulating new rules or adjusting existing ones to better capture these patterns.

- **Advice 4**: Consider incorporating machine learning techniques to automatically generate and validate new rules. This could involve using algorithms to identify patterns in the dataset that are not immediately obvious and testing these patterns as potential new rules.

- **Advice 5**: Increase the granularity of the rules by considering additional molecular features such as steric effects, electronic effects, and the spatial arrangement of functional groups. This could help in capturing more subtle influences on the reaction yield.

- **Advice 6**: Regularly update the rules based on new data and insights from ongoing experiments. This iterative approach will help in continuously refining the rules to improve their accuracy and applicability.

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. This is likely due to the ability of the aromatic ring to stabilize the catalyst structure through π-π interactions.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group adjacent to an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid) are associated with high yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the carboxylic acid may enhance the reactivity of the catalyst.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), tend to lead to high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups can facilitate hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) are associated with high yield. The presence of sulfur may contribute to the electron-donating ability, enhancing catalyst performance.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern `[NX3H2+0,NX4H3+;$([N][c])]` is intended to match amino acid structures with an aromatic ring. However, this pattern only matches primary aromatic amines. Consider using a more comprehensive pattern that captures the entire amino acid structure with an aromatic ring, such as `[NX3H2+0,NX4H3+;$([N][c])][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]`.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: For Rule 3, the SMARTS pattern `[OX2H][CX4;!$(C(O)(O)[!#6])][OX2H]` is meant to identify multiple hydroxyl groups in a sugar-like structure. This pattern may not be specific enough to capture the sugar-like structure. Consider using a pattern that captures the cyclic nature and multiple hydroxyl groups, such as `[C@H]1([O])[C@H]([O])[C@H]([O])[C@H]([O])[C@H]1[O]`.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For Rule 5, the SMARTS pattern `[n]1ccccc1` is used to identify pyridine rings. This pattern is correct, but ensure that the SMILES strings are correctly parsed to identify pyridine structures.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: For Rule 6, the SMARTS pattern `[c][OX2H1]` is intended to match methoxy groups adjacent to an aromatic ring. This pattern may not be specific enough. Consider using `[c][O][CH3]` to specifically match methoxy groups.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: For Rule 9, the SMARTS pattern `[CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4]` is intended to match simple aliphatic chains. This pattern may not be specific enough to exclude other functional groups. Consider using a pattern that explicitly excludes functional groups, such as `[CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4;!$(C[!#6])]`.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: For Rule 10, the SMARTS pattern `[c][NX3+](=O)[OX1-]` is intended to match electron-donating and withdrawing groups on the same aromatic ring. This pattern may not capture all possible combinations. Consider using a more flexible pattern that allows for various electron-donating and withdrawing groups, such as `[c][NX3+](=O)[OX1-]` with additional substructure checks for electron-donating groups.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: Ensure that the SMARTS patterns are tested against a diverse set of SMILES strings to verify their accuracy and coverage. This can help identify any mismatches or missing matches in the feature matrix.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a simple aliphatic chain and no additional functional groups (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of functional groups may limit interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups on the same aromatic ring (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid with an additional methoxy group) can lead to high yield due to the stabilization of the catalyst through balanced electronic effects.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. The benzofuran ring can provide additional π-π interactions and electron delocalization, stabilizing the catalyst.

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern `['[NX3H2+0,NX4H3+;$([N][c])][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]']` does not accurately capture the presence of an amino acid structure with an aromatic ring. The pattern should be adjusted to detect an amino acid backbone (e.g., `[NX3][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]`) and ensure the presence of an aromatic ring in the structure.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Rule 2's SMARTS pattern `['[c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]']` should be refined to ensure it specifically identifies a carboxylic acid group adjacent to an aromatic ring. Consider using a pattern like `['[c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]']` with additional constraints to ensure adjacency.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For Rule 3, the SMARTS pattern `['[C@H]1([O])[C@H]([O])[C@H]([O])[C@H]([O])[C@H]1[O]']` is too specific and may not capture all sugar-like structures with multiple hydroxyl groups. Consider using a more general pattern that captures multiple hydroxyl groups, such as `['[C@H]([O])[C@H]([O])[C@H]([O])[C@H]([O])[C@H]([O])[C@H]([O])']`.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Rule 4's SMARTS pattern `['[SX2H;$([SX2H][CX4])]']` should be checked to ensure it captures the presence of a sulfanyl group correctly. Consider simplifying the pattern to `['[SX2H]']` to ensure it matches any sulfanyl group.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: For Rule 5, the SMARTS pattern `['[n]1ccccc1']` is correct for identifying pyridine rings. However, ensure that the pattern is applied correctly in the code to capture all instances of pyridine rings.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Rule 6's SMARTS pattern `['[c][O][CH3]']` should be checked to ensure it captures methoxy groups adjacent to aromatic rings. Consider using a pattern like `['[c][O][CH3]']` with additional constraints to ensure adjacency to an aromatic ring.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: For Rule 7, the SMARTS pattern `['[c][CX4](F)(F)F']` should be refined to ensure it captures trifluoromethyl groups with electron-donating groups. Consider using a pattern like `['[c][CX4](F)(F)F']` with additional constraints to ensure the presence of an electron-donating group.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Rule 8's SMARTS pattern `['[c][CX3H]=O']` should be refined to ensure it captures formyl groups with electron-donating groups. Consider using a pattern like `['[c][CX3H]=O']` with additional constraints to ensure the presence of an electron-donating group.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: For Rule 9, the SMARTS pattern `['[CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4;!$(C[!#6])]']` should be checked to ensure it captures simple aliphatic chains correctly. Consider simplifying the pattern to `['[CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4]']` to ensure it matches any simple aliphatic chain.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Rule 10's SMARTS pattern `['[c][NX3+](=O)[OX1-]']` should be refined to ensure it captures electron-donating and withdrawing groups on the same aromatic ring. Consider using a pattern like `['[c][NX3+](=O)[OX1-]']` with additional constraints to ensure the presence of both types of groups.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: For Rule 11, the SMARTS pattern `['[o]1ccccc1']` should be checked to ensure it captures benzofuran structures correctly. Consider using a pattern like `['[o]1ccccc1']` with additional constraints to ensure the presence of a benzofuran structure.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. This is likely due to the ability of the aromatic ring to stabilize the catalyst structure through π-π interactions.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group adjacent to an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid) are associated with high yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the carboxylic acid may enhance the reactivity of the catalyst.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), tend to lead to high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups can facilitate hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) are associated with high yield. The presence of sulfur may contribute to the electron-donating ability, enhancing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) generally result in high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a methoxy group adjacent to an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid) tend to result in high yield. The methoxy group can donate electrons through resonance, potentially enhancing catalyst stability.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group combined with an electron-donating group (e.g., methoxy) on an aromatic ring may result in a balanced yield. The electron-donating group can mitigate the electron-withdrawing effect of the trifluoromethyl group.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a formyl group combined with an electron-donating group (e.g., amino) on an aromatic ring may result in a balanced yield. The electron-donating group can mitigate the electron-withdrawing effect of the formyl group.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a simple aliphatic chain and no additional functional groups (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of functional groups may limit interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups on the same aromatic ring (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid with an additional methoxy group) can lead to high yield due to the stabilization of the catalyst through balanced electronic effects.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. The benzofuran ring can provide additional π-π interactions and electron delocalization, stabilizing the catalyst.

** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern `['[NX3][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]', '[c]']` may not fully capture the presence of an aromatic ring in amino acid structures. Consider using a more specific pattern that includes aromatic rings, such as `['[NX3][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]', '[c]1[cH][cH][cH][cH][cH]1']` to ensure the aromatic ring is detected.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: For Rule 3, the SMARTS pattern `['[C@H]([O])[C@H]([O])[C@H]([O])[C@H]([O])[C@H]([O])[C@H]([O])']` is too specific and may not match all sugar-like structures. Consider using a more general pattern for multiple hydroxyl groups, such as `['[C@H]([O])[C@H]([O])[C@H]([O])']` to capture a broader range of sugar-like structures.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For Rule 7, the SMARTS pattern `['[c][CX4](F)(F)F']` does not account for the presence of an electron-donating group. Modify the pattern to include an electron-donating group, such as `['[c][CX4](F)(F)F', '[c][O][CH3]']`.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: For Rule 8, the SMARTS pattern `['[c][CX3H]=O']` should be modified to include the presence of an electron-donating group. Consider using a pattern like `['[c][CX3H]=O', '[c][NX3]']` to ensure the electron-donating group is detected.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: For Rule 9, the SMARTS pattern `['[CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4]']` may not accurately capture simple aliphatic chains. Consider using a more general pattern like `['[CX4][CX4][CX4]']` to match a wider range of aliphatic chains.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: For Rule 10, the SMARTS pattern `['[c][NX3+](=O)[OX1-]']` should be modified to ensure it captures both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups on the same aromatic ring. Consider using a pattern like `['[c][NX3+](=O)[OX1-]', '[c][O][CH3]']`.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: Ensure that the SMARTS patterns are tested against a diverse set of SMILES to verify their accuracy in capturing the intended chemical structures. This can help identify any mismatches or false negatives in the feature matrix.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Metric Commenter Message:
Based on the current metrics, we can observe the following:

1. **Train Support**: The current train support is 0.03896, which is slightly lower than the previous iteration's train support of 0.04127. This indicates a slight decrease in the proportion of records for which the entire rule is true. While this is a minor change, it suggests that the rules might be applicable to a slightly smaller subset of the data.

2. **Train Confidence**: The current train confidence is 0.57576, which is an improvement from the previous iteration's confidence of 0.53205. This indicates that the rules are now more reliable in predicting the outcome when the conditions are met. An increase in confidence is generally positive, as it suggests that the rules are becoming more accurate.

3. **Train Lift**: The current train lift is 1.16162, which is an improvement from the previous iteration's lift of 1.06278. A lift greater than 1 indicates that the rule is better than random guessing. The increase in lift suggests that the rules are becoming more effective at identifying associations that are stronger than what would be expected by chance.

4. **Train Leverage**: The current train leverage is 0.00965, which is an improvement from the previous iteration's leverage of 0.00444. Positive leverage indicates a stronger association between the items than expected by chance. The increase in leverage suggests that the rules are capturing more meaningful associations.

**Analysis and Recommendations:**

- The increase in both confidence and lift indicates that the current rules are performing better in terms of predictive power and association strength. This suggests that the rules are moving in the right direction and are not yet at a local minimum.

- The slight decrease in support might indicate that the rules are becoming more specific, which can be beneficial if it leads to higher confidence and lift. However, it is important to ensure that the rules do not become too specific, as this could limit their applicability.

- To further improve the rules, consider exploring additional features or interactions that might not have been captured yet. This could involve looking for new patterns or modifying existing rules to include additional conditions that could enhance their predictive power.

- It might also be beneficial to analyze the rules with lower confidence and lift to identify potential areas for refinement or removal. Focusing on rules that consistently show high performance across different metrics can help streamline the rule set and improve overall effectiveness.

Overall, the current iteration shows promising improvements in key metrics, suggesting that the rules are becoming more effective. Continued refinement and exploration of new patterns could further enhance their performance.

### Performance Evaluation of Current Rules

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
   - The current rules appear to be less effective in the latest iteration, as indicated by the drop in validation accuracy from previous values (0.76) to 0.457. This suggests that the rules may not be capturing the underlying patterns in the data effectively.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment:**
   - The significant drop in validation accuracy suggests potential underfitting. The model may not be complex enough to capture the nuances of the data, or the rules may not be adequately tailored to the dataset's characteristics.

3. **Discrepancies Analysis:**
   - For molecules where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low, Rule 9 has a high positive SHAP value, indicating it might be problematic. This rule may need refinement to better capture the conditions under which a high loading is expected.
   - Conversely, for molecules where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, Rule 9 also shows a high positive SHAP value, suggesting it might not be adequately capturing the conditions for high loading.

4. **Accuracy Improvements:**
   - The decrease in accuracy metrics suggests that the current rules are not improving the model's performance. This indicates a need for revisiting and refining the rules to better align with the data.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**
   - The SHAP analysis highlights Rule 9 as a significant contributor to discrepancies in predictions. This rule, which involves simple aliphatic chains, may need to be revised to account for additional factors that influence catalyst loading.
   - The consistent SHAP values across different molecules suggest that the rules may be too generalized and not capturing specific interactions or features that are critical for accurate predictions.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Rules with High Positive SHAP Values:**
   - Rule 9 should be revisited and potentially split into more specific sub-rules that account for different types of aliphatic chains and their interactions with the catalyst. Consider incorporating additional functional groups or structural features that may influence loading.

2. **Adjust Rules with High Negative SHAP Values:**
   - Although Rule 9 is primarily highlighted, other rules should also be evaluated for their contribution to low predictions. Rules with consistently negative SHAP values should be adjusted to better capture the conditions for high loading.

3. **Improve Generalization:**
   - Introduce more nuanced rules that consider the interplay between different functional groups and structural features. This could involve creating rules that account for specific interactions, such as hydrogen bonding or π-π interactions, that are not currently captured.

4. **Iterative Refinement Using SHAP Insights:**
   - Use the insights from SHAP analysis to iteratively refine the rules. This could involve testing new rules on a subset of the data and evaluating their impact on SHAP values and accuracy metrics before applying them to the entire dataset.

5. **Incorporate Additional Features:**
   - Consider expanding the feature matrix to include additional chemical properties or descriptors that may influence catalyst loading. This could involve using cheminformatics tools to derive new features that capture the complexity of the molecules more effectively.

By addressing these areas, the rules can be refined to improve the model's accuracy and generalization, ultimately leading to better predictions of catalyst loading.

### Summary and Directions for Optimization

1. **Current Rule Effectiveness:**
   - The current rules show a decrease in validation accuracy, indicating potential underfitting. The rules may not be capturing the underlying patterns effectively, as evidenced by the drop in accuracy from previous iterations.

2. **Discrepancies and SHAP Analysis:**
   - Rule 9, which involves simple aliphatic chains, is highlighted by SHAP analysis as contributing to discrepancies in predictions. This rule may not be adequately capturing the conditions for high loading, leading to both false positives and false negatives.

3. **Metrics Analysis:**
   - While there is an improvement in train confidence, lift, and leverage, the decrease in support suggests the rules are becoming more specific. This specificity might be beneficial if it leads to higher confidence and lift, but care must be taken to avoid overfitting.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Rule 9:**
   - Rule 9 should be revisited to better capture the conditions under which high loading is expected. Consider splitting it into more specific sub-rules that account for different types of aliphatic chains and their interactions with the catalyst.

2. **Adjust Other Rules:**
   - Evaluate other rules for their contribution to low predictions. Rules with consistently negative SHAP values should be adjusted to better capture the conditions for high loading.

3. **Improve Generalization:**
   - Introduce more nuanced rules that consider the interplay between different functional groups and structural features. This could involve creating rules that account for specific interactions, such as hydrogen bonding or π-π interactions, that are not currently captured.

4. **Iterative Refinement Using SHAP Insights:**
   - Use SHAP analysis insights to iteratively refine the rules. Test new rules on a subset of the data and evaluate their impact on SHAP values and accuracy metrics before applying them to the entire dataset.

5. **Incorporate Additional Features:**
   - Expand the feature matrix to include additional chemical properties or descriptors that may influence catalyst loading. Use cheminformatics tools to derive new features that capture the complexity of the molecules more effectively.

### Possibility for Further Optimization

There is potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. By refining Rule 9 and adjusting other rules based on SHAP insights, the model's accuracy and generalization can be improved. Additionally, incorporating more nuanced rules and expanding the feature matrix can help capture the complexity of the data more effectively.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. This is likely due to the ability of the aromatic ring to stabilize the catalyst structure through π-π interactions.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group adjacent to an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid) are associated with high yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the carboxylic acid may enhance the reactivity of the catalyst.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), tend to lead to high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups can facilitate hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) are associated with high yield. The presence of sulfur may contribute to the electron-donating ability, enhancing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) generally result in high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a methoxy group adjacent to an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid) tend to result in high yield. The methoxy group can donate electrons through resonance, potentially enhancing catalyst stability.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group combined with an electron-donating group (e.g., methoxy) on an aromatic ring may result in a balanced yield. The electron-donating group can mitigate the electron-withdrawing effect of the trifluoromethyl group.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a formyl group combined with an electron-donating group (e.g., amino) on an aromatic ring may result in a balanced yield. The electron-donating group can mitigate the electron-withdrawing effect of the formyl group.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a simple aliphatic chain and no additional functional groups (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of functional groups may limit interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups on the same aromatic ring (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid with an additional methoxy group) can lead to high yield due to the stabilization of the catalyst through balanced electronic effects.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. The benzofuran ring can provide additional π-π interactions and electron delocalization, stabilizing the catalyst.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern '[NX3H2+0,NX4H3+;$([N][c])]' does not accurately capture the presence of an amino acid structure with an aromatic ring. The pattern should be adjusted to include both the amino acid backbone and the aromatic ring, such as '[NX3H2][CX3](=O)[OX2H1][c]'.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Rule 2's SMARTS pattern '[c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]' is correct for identifying a carboxylic acid group adjacent to an aromatic ring. However, ensure that the aromatic ring is explicitly defined as aromatic, such as '[c][c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For Rule 3, the SMARTS pattern '[OX2;$([r5]1@C(!@[OX2,NX3,SX2,FX1,ClX1,BrX1,IX1])@C@C(O)@C1),$([r6]1@C(!@[OX2,NX3,SX2,FX1,ClX1,BrX1,IX1])@C@C(O)@C(O)@C1)]' is overly complex and may not match the intended sugar-like structure with multiple hydroxyl groups. Simplify it to '[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)' to capture the essence of a sugar-like structure.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Rule 4's SMARTS pattern '[SX2H;$([SX2H][CX4;!$(C([SX2H])~[O,S,#7,#15])])]' should be simplified to '[SX2H]' to match any sulfanyl group without additional constraints.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: For Rule 5, the SMARTS pattern '[n]1ccccc1' correctly identifies a pyridine ring. Ensure that the nitrogen is explicitly defined as part of the aromatic system, such as '[n]1ccncc1'.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Rule 6's SMARTS pattern '[c][OX2][C]' may not accurately capture a methoxy group adjacent to an aromatic ring. Adjust it to '[c][c][OX2][C]' to ensure the methoxy group is directly attached to the aromatic system.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: For Rule 7, the SMARTS pattern '[c]1oc2ccccc2c1' correctly identifies a benzofuran structure. Ensure that the pattern is specific enough to match only benzofuran and not other similar structures.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Rule 8's SMARTS pattern '[CX4][CX4][CX4]' is too generic and may match any aliphatic chain. Refine it to '[CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4]' to ensure it matches longer aliphatic chains without functional groups.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: For Rule 9, the SMARTS pattern '[c][CX3H]=O' correctly identifies a formyl group on an aromatic ring. Ensure that the aromatic ring is explicitly defined, such as '[c][c][CX3H]=O'.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Rule 10's SMARTS pattern '[C][OX2][C][C](=[O])[C]' may not accurately capture an ether linkage with an electron-withdrawing group. Adjust it to '[C][OX2][C](=[O])[C]' to ensure the ether linkage is correctly identified.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: For Rule 11, the SMARTS pattern '[CX4](F)(F)F' correctly identifies a trifluoromethyl group. Ensure that the pattern is specific enough to match only trifluoromethyl groups without additional constraints.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. This is likely due to the ability of the aromatic ring to stabilize the catalyst structure through π-π interactions.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group adjacent to an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid) are associated with high yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the carboxylic acid may enhance the reactivity of the catalyst.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), tend to lead to high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups can facilitate hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) are associated with high yield. The presence of sulfur may contribute to the electron-donating ability, enhancing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) generally result in high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a methoxy group adjacent to an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid) tend to result in high yield. The methoxy group can donate electrons through resonance, potentially enhancing catalyst stability.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. The benzofuran ring can provide additional π-π interactions and electron delocalization, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a simple aliphatic chain and no additional functional groups (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of functional groups may limit interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a formyl group on an aromatic ring without any electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the formyl group may destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with an ether linkage combined with an electron-withdrawing group (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid) tend to result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing effect may reduce the catalyst's reactivity.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group without compensating electron-donating groups (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) are associated with low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing effect can destabilize the catalyst.

** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern '[NX3H2][CX3](=O)[OX2H1][c]' may not fully capture all amino acid structures with aromatic rings. Consider using a more general pattern that includes variations in amino acid structures, such as '[NX3][CX3](=O)[OX2H1][c]'.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Rule 2's SMARTS pattern '[c][c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]' should be refined to ensure it captures carboxylic acid groups adjacent to aromatic rings. Consider using '[c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]' to ensure the carboxylic acid is directly adjacent to the aromatic ring.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For Rule 3, the SMARTS '[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)' may not capture all sugar-like structures with multiple hydroxyl groups. Consider using a more flexible pattern like '[C](O)[C](O)[C](O)' to account for different stereochemistry.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Rule 5's SMARTS '[n]1ccncc1' is specific to pyridine but may miss other pyridine derivatives. Consider using a more general pattern like '[n]1ccccc1' to capture a broader range of pyridine structures.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: For Rule 6, the SMARTS '[c][c][OX2][C]' may not accurately capture methoxy groups adjacent to aromatic rings. Consider using '[c][OX2][C]' to ensure the methoxy group is directly adjacent to the aromatic ring.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Rule 8's SMARTS '[CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4]' may not accurately capture simple aliphatic chains. Consider using a more general pattern like '[CX4][CX4][CX4]' to capture varying chain lengths.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: For Rule 9, the SMARTS '[c][c][CX3H]=O' may not fully capture formyl groups on aromatic rings. Consider using '[c][CX3H]=O' to ensure the formyl group is directly on the aromatic ring.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Rule 10's SMARTS '[C][OX2][C](=[O])[C]' may not accurately capture ether linkages with electron-withdrawing groups. Consider using '[C][OX2][C](=[O])[C;!$([C][OX2])]' to ensure the presence of an electron-withdrawing group.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: Ensure that the SMARTS patterns are tested against a diverse set of SMILES to verify their accuracy in capturing the intended structures.

** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern '[NX3][CX3](=O)[OX2H1][c]' does not accurately capture the presence of an amino acid structure with an aromatic ring. The pattern should be modified to include the aromatic ring explicitly, such as '[NX3][CX3](=O)[OX2H1][c][c]'.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Rule 2's SMARTS pattern '[c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]' may not fully capture the carboxylic acid group adjacent to an aromatic ring. Consider using '[c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]' with additional constraints to ensure adjacency, such as '[c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1][c]'.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For Rule 3, the SMARTS '[C](O)[C](O)[C](O)' might not be specific enough for sugar-like structures. Consider using a more specific pattern that captures the cyclic nature of sugars, such as '[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)'.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Rule 4's SMARTS '[SX2H]' is correct for identifying sulfanyl groups, but ensure that the SMILES strings in the dataset are correctly interpreted to match this pattern.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: Rule 5's SMARTS '[n]1ccccc1' correctly identifies pyridine rings. However, ensure that the SMILES strings are correctly interpreted to match this pattern.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: For Rule 6, the SMARTS '[c][OX2][C]' may not fully capture methoxy groups adjacent to aromatic rings. Consider using '[c][OX2][C;R]' to ensure the methoxy group is part of an aromatic system.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: Rule 7's SMARTS '[c]1oc2ccccc2c1' is specific to benzofuran structures. Ensure that the SMILES strings are correctly interpreted to match this pattern.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Rule 8's SMARTS '[CX4][CX4][CX4]' may not be specific enough for simple aliphatic chains. Consider using a pattern that specifies the absence of functional groups, such as '[CX4][CX4][CX4;!$([CX4][!#6])]'.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: For Rule 9, the SMARTS '[c][CX3H]=O' should be checked to ensure it captures formyl groups on aromatic rings accurately. Consider using '[c][CX3H]=O' with additional constraints to ensure the formyl group is directly attached to the aromatic ring.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Rule 10's SMARTS '[C][OX2][C](=[O])[C;!$([C][OX2])]' may not fully capture ether linkages with electron-withdrawing groups. Consider using a more specific pattern that captures the ether linkage and the electron-withdrawing group, such as '[C][OX2][C](=[O])[C;!$([C][OX2])][C;!$([C][OX2])]'.

1. **Train Support**: The current train support is 0.0623, which is higher than the previous iterations (0.0413 and 0.0390). This indicates that a larger proportion of the training data supports the current rules, suggesting that the rules are applicable to a broader set of data.

2. **Train Confidence**: The current train confidence is 0.7156, which is a significant improvement over the previous values (0.5321 and 0.5758). This means that when the rule conditions are met, there is a higher probability that the rule predictions are also true. This increase in confidence suggests that the rules are becoming more reliable.

3. **Train Lift**: The current train lift is 1.4389, which is a notable improvement from the previous lifts (1.0628 and 1.1616). A lift greater than 1 indicates that the rule is more effective than random chance in predicting the outcome. The current lift suggests that the rules are providing valuable insights and are significantly better than random predictions.

4. **Train Leverage**: The current train leverage is 0.0144, which is higher than the previous values (0.0044 and 0.0096). Positive leverage indicates a stronger association between the rule conditions and predictions than would be expected by chance. The increase in leverage suggests that the rules are capturing meaningful relationships in the data.

**Comments on Improvement:**

- **Focus on Lift and Confidence**: The current lift and confidence metrics are promising, indicating that the rules are effective. However, further improvements can be made by refining the rules to target specific subgroups within the data that may have even higher lift and confidence values.

- **Rule Specificity**: Consider increasing the specificity of the rules by incorporating additional conditions or refining existing ones. This could help in identifying more precise patterns that lead to high yield, thereby increasing the confidence and lift further.

- **Exploration of New Modifiers**: Investigate additional chemical structures or functional groups that may influence catalyst performance. This could lead to the discovery of new rules with higher predictive power.

- **Validation on Test Data**: While the current metrics are based on training data, it is crucial to validate these rules on test data to ensure their generalizability and robustness. This will help in assessing whether the improvements observed in training metrics translate to unseen data.

Overall, the current rules are performing well, with significant improvements in confidence and lift. Continued refinement and validation will help in further enhancing their effectiveness.

### Performance Evaluation of Current Rules

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
   - The current rules have shown some improvement in validation accuracy, reaching 0.6286, which is higher than the previous iterations (0.5143 and 0.4571). However, this is still below the initial reference accuracies (0.76). This suggests that while the rules are improving, they are not yet optimal.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment:**
   - The fluctuating validation accuracies across iterations suggest potential underfitting. The model may not be capturing the complexity of the data effectively, as indicated by the lower accuracies compared to the reference metrics.

3. **Discrepancies Analysis:**
   - For molecules where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low, rules with high positive SHAP values (e.g., Rule 2, Rule 4, Rule 9, Rule 11) may be contributing to overestimation. Conversely, for molecules where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, rules with high negative SHAP values (e.g., Rule 2, Rule 4) may be contributing to underestimation.

4. **Accuracy Improvements Interpretation:**
   - The increase in validation accuracy from previous iterations suggests that the rules are moving in the right direction. However, the gap between the current and reference accuracies indicates room for further refinement.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**
   - SHAP analysis highlights specific rules that may be contributing to prediction errors. For instance, Rule 2 and Rule 4 often have significant SHAP values, indicating their strong influence on predictions. Adjusting these rules could potentially improve model performance.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Overestimated Loading Rules:**
   - Rules with high positive SHAP values for overestimated loadings, such as Rule 2 and Rule 4, should be reviewed. Consider incorporating additional conditions or constraints to better capture the nuances of the data.

2. **Adjust Underestimated Loading Rules:**
   - Rules with high negative SHAP values for underestimated loadings, such as Rule 2 and Rule 4, should be adjusted. This could involve relaxing certain conditions or exploring additional features that may influence loading.

3. **Improve Generalization:**
   - To address potential underfitting, consider expanding the feature set or exploring more complex interactions between existing features. This could help the model capture more intricate patterns in the data.

4. **Iterative Refinement Using SHAP Insights:**
   - Use SHAP analysis to iteratively refine the rules. Focus on rules with consistently high SHAP values across multiple molecules, as these are likely to have a significant impact on predictions. Adjust these rules based on observed discrepancies between predicted and experimental values.

5. **Evaluate Rule Effectiveness:**
   - Continuously evaluate the effectiveness of refined rules through cross-validation and SHAP analysis. This iterative process will help ensure that the rules are moving towards optimal performance.

By implementing these recommendations, the model's accuracy and generalization capabilities can be improved, leading to more reliable predictions of modifier loading on catalysts.

### Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimization

1. **Current Rule Performance:**
   - The current rules have shown improvement in metrics such as train support, confidence, lift, and leverage, indicating that they are becoming more effective. However, the validation accuracy is still below the initial reference accuracies, suggesting room for further optimization.

2. **Effectiveness and Specificity:**
   - The rules are capturing some meaningful patterns, but there is potential for increasing specificity. This can be achieved by refining SMARTS patterns to better capture the chemical structures and functional groups that influence catalyst performance.

3. **SHAP Analysis Insights:**
   - SHAP analysis has identified specific rules that may be contributing to prediction errors. Rules with high positive SHAP values for overestimated loadings and high negative SHAP values for underestimated loadings should be reviewed and adjusted.

4. **Potential for Overfitting:**
   - The fluctuating validation accuracies suggest potential underfitting rather than overfitting. This indicates that the model may not be capturing the complexity of the data effectively, and there is room for further refinement without the risk of overfitting.

### Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Refine SMARTS Patterns:**
   - Adjust SMARTS patterns to increase specificity and ensure they accurately capture the relevant chemical features. For example, refine patterns for amino acid structures, carboxylic acid groups, and sugar-like structures to better match the dataset.

2. **Incorporate Additional Features:**
   - Explore additional chemical features or interactions that may influence catalyst performance. This could involve considering more complex interactions between existing features or introducing new ones.

3. **Iterative Rule Refinement:**
   - Use SHAP analysis to iteratively refine rules, focusing on those with significant SHAP values. Adjust these rules based on observed discrepancies between predicted and experimental values to improve accuracy.

4. **Cross-Validation and Testing:**
   - Continuously evaluate the effectiveness of refined rules through cross-validation and testing on unseen data. This will help ensure that the rules are generalizable and robust.

5. **Balance Between Specificity and Generalization:**
   - Strive for a balance between rule specificity and generalization to capture the complexity of the data without overfitting. This can be achieved by refining rules based on SHAP insights and validation performance.

### Possibility for Further Optimization

Given the current state of the rules and the insights from SHAP analysis, there is a clear possibility for further optimization. The rules can be refined to improve specificity and capture more intricate patterns in the data, leading to better generalization and accuracy.

    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. This is likely due to the ability of the aromatic ring to stabilize the catalyst structure through π-π interactions.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group adjacent to an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid) are associated with high yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the carboxylic acid may enhance the reactivity of the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a simple aliphatic chain and no additional functional groups (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of functional groups may limit interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a formyl group on an aromatic ring without any electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the formyl group may destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with an ether linkage combined with an electron-withdrawing group (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid) tend to result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing effect may reduce the catalyst's reactivity.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group without compensating electron-donating groups (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) are associated with low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing effect can destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on a long aliphatic chain (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The isolated hydroxy group may not sufficiently interact with the catalyst to enhance yield.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a methyl group on an aromatic ring without additional electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of significant electron-donating effects may limit catalyst stabilization.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a pyridine ring in the same molecule (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The combination of these groups may lead to competitive binding or destabilization of the catalyst.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on an aromatic ring and a formyl group (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing formyl group may counteract the potential stabilizing effect of the hydroxy group.

** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: Rule 1 in the code uses the SMARTS pattern '[NX3;$([N][c])]', which matches aromatic amines. However, the natural language rule specifies amino acids with specific stereochemistry and aromatic rings. The SMARTS should be updated to reflect the presence of an aromatic ring and specific stereochemistry, such as '[C@@H](N)[C](=O)O' for amino acids.
- ** Suggestion 2 **: Rule 2 in the code uses '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]', which matches carboxylic acids but does not ensure adjacency to an aromatic ring or the presence of electron-withdrawing substituents. The SMARTS should be updated to include an aromatic ring and electron-withdrawing groups, such as '[c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'.
- ** Suggestion 3 **: Rule 3 uses '[OX2H][CX4;!$(C(O)(O)[!#6])][OX2]', which matches multiple hydroxyl groups but does not ensure a sugar-like structure. The SMARTS should be updated to reflect sugar-like structures, such as '[C@H]([OH])[C@H]([OH])[C@H]([OH])[C@H]([OH])[C@H]([OH])'.
- ** Suggestion 4 **: Rule 4 uses '[SX2H]', which matches sulfanyl groups but does not account for thioethers. The SMARTS should be updated to include thioethers, such as '[SX2]([C])[C]'.
- ** Suggestion 5 **: Rule 5 uses '[n]', which matches pyridine rings correctly. However, ensure that the SMARTS pattern is specific enough to avoid false positives.
- ** Suggestion 6 **: Rule 6 uses '[c][OX2][C]', which matches methoxy groups adjacent to aromatic rings. This is correct, but ensure the pattern is specific to the context described in the rule.
- ** Suggestion 7 **: Rule 7 uses '[o1c2ccccc2]', which matches benzofuran structures. This is correct, but ensure the pattern is specific to the context described in the rule.
- ** Suggestion 8 **: Rule 8 uses '[C][C]', which is too broad and matches any aliphatic chain. The SMARTS should be updated to reflect simple aliphatic chains without functional groups, such as '[C][C][C][C]'.
- ** Suggestion 9 **: Rule 9 uses '[c][CX3H]=O', which matches formyl groups on aromatic rings. This is correct, but ensure the pattern is specific to the context described in the rule.
- ** Suggestion 10 **: Rule 10 uses '[C][OX2][C]', which is too broad and does not ensure the presence of an electron-withdrawing group. The SMARTS should be updated to include electron-withdrawing groups, such as '[C][OX2][C](=O)[C]'.
- ** Suggestion 11 **: Rule 11 uses '[CX4](F)(F)F', which matches trifluoromethyl groups correctly. This is correct, but ensure the pattern is specific to the context described in the rule.
- ** Suggestion 12 **: Rule 12 uses '[C][OX2H]', which is too broad and does not ensure a long aliphatic chain. The SMARTS should be updated to reflect a long aliphatic chain with a hydroxy group, such as '[C][C][C][C][C][C][C][OX2H]'.
- ** Suggestion 13 **: Rule 13 uses '[c][CH3]', which matches methyl groups on aromatic rings. This is correct, but ensure the pattern is specific to the context described in the rule.
- ** Suggestion 14 **: Rule 14 uses '[c][n][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]', which matches carboxylic acids and pyridine rings. This is correct, but ensure the pattern is specific to the context described in the rule.

Metric Commenter Message:
Based on the current metrics, the performance of the rules has shown some improvements compared to the previous iterations. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Train Support**: The current train support is 0.1219, which is higher than the previous iterations (0.0413, 0.0390, 0.0623). This indicates that a larger proportion of the training data supports the current rules, suggesting that the rules are more broadly applicable across the dataset.

2. **Train Confidence**: The current train confidence is 0.7043, which is a significant improvement over the previous iterations (0.5321, 0.5758, 0.7156). This indicates that when the rule conditions are met, there is a higher probability that the rule predictions are also true. This suggests that the rules are becoming more reliable.

3. **Train Lift**: The current train lift is 1.4061, which is a notable improvement from the previous iterations (1.0628, 1.1616, 1.4389). A lift greater than 1 indicates that the rule conditions increase the likelihood of the rule predictions compared to random chance. The current lift suggests that the rules are providing valuable insights and are more interesting than those with a lift close to 1.

4. **Train Leverage**: The current train leverage is 0.0147, which is higher than the previous iterations (0.0044, 0.0096, 0.0144). Positive leverage indicates a stronger association between the rule conditions and predictions than expected by chance. The increase in leverage suggests that the rules are capturing meaningful relationships in the data.

**Comments and Suggestions for Improvement:**

- **Focus on Lift and Confidence**: The current lift and confidence metrics are promising, indicating that the rules are effective in identifying meaningful patterns. However, further improvements can be made by refining the rules to increase these metrics even more. This could involve exploring additional features or interactions that may not have been considered yet.

- **Rule Specificity**: Consider increasing the specificity of the rules to target more distinct subsets of the data. This could help in identifying niche patterns that have higher confidence and lift, even if they apply to a smaller portion of the dataset.

- **Iterative Refinement**: Continue iterating on the rules by testing different combinations of conditions and predictions. This iterative process can help in identifying the optimal set of rules that maximize both confidence and lift.

- **Cross-Validation**: Implement cross-validation techniques to ensure that the rules generalize well to unseen data. This can help in identifying any overfitting issues and ensure that the rules are robust.

- **Incorporate Domain Knowledge**: Leverage domain knowledge to guide the rule refinement process. Understanding the underlying chemistry or physics can provide insights into which modifiers or conditions are likely to result in high or low yields.

Overall, the current rules are performing well, but there is still room for improvement. By focusing on increasing lift and confidence, and by refining the rules through iterative testing and domain knowledge, the performance of the rules can be further enhanced.

### Performance Evaluation of Current Rules

#### 1. Evaluate Effectiveness:
The current rules appear to be moderately effective, as indicated by the validation accuracy of 0.6286. This is an improvement from some of the previous iterations, which had lower accuracies (e.g., 0.5143 and 0.4571). However, the accuracy is still not as high as the initial reference accuracies (0.76), suggesting that there is room for improvement.

#### 2. Assess Overfitting/Underfitting:
The fluctuating validation accuracies across iterations suggest potential issues with overfitting or underfitting. The rules may not be capturing the underlying patterns effectively, leading to inconsistent performance. The current accuracy indicates that the model might be underfitting, as it is not reaching the higher accuracies seen in the reference data.

#### 3. Analyze Discrepancies:
- **Overestimated Loadings**: For molecules where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low, rules with high positive SHAP values (e.g., Rule5, Rule9) are likely problematic. These rules may need refinement to reduce false positives.
- **Underestimated Loadings**: For molecules where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, rules with high negative SHAP values (e.g., Rule5) are likely problematic. These rules may need adjustment to reduce false negatives.

#### 4. Interpret Accuracy Improvements:
The improvement in accuracy from earlier iterations suggests that the rules are moving in the right direction, but they have not yet reached optimal performance. The current accuracy of 0.6286 indicates that there is potential for further refinement to achieve higher accuracy.

#### 5. Derive Insights from SHAP Analysis:
The SHAP analysis provides insights into which rules are contributing most to the predictions. For example, Rule5 has both high positive and negative SHAP values, indicating it may be contributing to both overestimation and underestimation of loadings. This suggests that Rule5 needs careful examination and potential refinement.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Rules with High Positive SHAP Values**:
   - Focus on rules like Rule5 and Rule9, which have high positive SHAP values for overestimated loadings. Consider adding more specific conditions or constraints to these rules to reduce false positives.

2. **Adjust Rules with High Negative SHAP Values**:
   - Examine rules with high negative SHAP values, such as Rule5, for underestimated loadings. These rules may need to be broadened or adjusted to capture more true positives.

3. **Improve Generalization**:
   - To address potential overfitting or underfitting, consider simplifying some rules or combining similar rules to improve generalization. This may help the model capture broader patterns without being too specific.

4. **Iterative Refinement**:
   - Use insights from SHAP analysis to iteratively refine the rules. Focus on rules that consistently show high SHAP values (positive or negative) and test adjustments to see if they lead to improved accuracy.

5. **Incorporate Additional Features**:
   - Consider incorporating additional features or modifying existing ones to capture more relevant information. This could involve exploring new chemical properties or interactions that are not currently covered by the rules.

By implementing these recommendations, the rules can be refined to improve the model's accuracy and generalization, ultimately leading to better predictions of modifier loading on catalysts.

### Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimization

1. **Current Rule Effectiveness**: The current rules show moderate effectiveness with a validation accuracy of 0.6286, which is an improvement from some previous iterations but still below the initial reference accuracies of 0.76. This suggests that while progress has been made, there is still room for improvement.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting Concerns**: The fluctuating validation accuracies across iterations indicate potential issues with overfitting or underfitting. The current accuracy suggests that the model might be underfitting, as it is not reaching the higher accuracies seen in the reference data.

3. **SHAP Analysis Insights**: The SHAP analysis highlights rules that contribute to overestimation and underestimation of loadings. For example, Rule5 has both high positive and negative SHAP values, indicating it may be contributing to both overestimation and underestimation of loadings. This suggests that Rule5 needs careful examination and potential refinement.

4. **Rule Specificity and Refinement**: Suggestions were made to refine the SMARTS patterns used in the rules to better capture the intended chemical structures and interactions. This includes updating patterns to reflect specific stereochemistry, electron-withdrawing groups, and sugar-like structures.

### Directions for Optimization

1. **Refine Rules with High SHAP Values**: Focus on rules like Rule5 and Rule9, which have high SHAP values for overestimated and underestimated loadings. Consider adding more specific conditions or constraints to these rules to reduce false positives and negatives.

2. **Improve Generalization**: Simplify some rules or combine similar rules to improve generalization and capture broader patterns without being too specific. This can help address potential overfitting or underfitting issues.

3. **Iterative Refinement**: Use insights from SHAP analysis to iteratively refine the rules. Focus on rules that consistently show high SHAP values and test adjustments to see if they lead to improved accuracy.

4. **Incorporate Additional Features**: Explore new chemical properties or interactions that are not currently covered by the rules to capture more relevant information.

5. **Cross-Validation**: Implement cross-validation techniques to ensure that the rules generalize well to unseen data and identify any overfitting issues.

### Possibility for Further Optimization

There is a possibility for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. By focusing on refining rules with high SHAP values, improving generalization, and incorporating additional features, the model's accuracy and generalization can be enhanced.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with an aromatic ring and specific stereochemistry (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The stereochemistry and aromatic ring can enhance π-π interactions and stabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group adjacent to an aromatic ring, especially with electron-withdrawing substituents like nitro or bromo groups (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid), are associated with high yield. These substituents can enhance the reactivity of the catalyst through electron-withdrawing effects.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups in sugar-like structures, considering different stereoisomers (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), tend to lead to high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups facilitate hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group or thioether (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) are associated with high yield. The sulfur-containing groups contribute to electron-donating ability, enhancing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) generally result in high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a methoxy group adjacent to an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid) tend to result in high yield. The methoxy group can donate electrons through resonance, potentially enhancing catalyst stability.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. The benzofuran ring can provide additional π-π interactions and electron delocalization, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a simple aliphatic chain and no additional functional groups (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of functional groups may limit interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a formyl group on an aromatic ring without any electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the formyl group may destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with an ether linkage combined with an electron-withdrawing group (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid) tend to result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing effect may reduce the catalyst's reactivity.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group without compensating electron-donating groups (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) are associated with low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing effect can destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on a long aliphatic chain (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The isolated hydroxy group may not sufficiently interact with the catalyst to enhance yield.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a methyl group on an aromatic ring without additional electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of significant electron-donating effects may limit catalyst stabilization.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a pyridine ring in the same molecule (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The combination of these groups may lead to competitive binding or destabilization of the catalyst.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on an aromatic ring and a formyl group (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing formyl group may counteract the potential stabilizing effect of the hydroxy group.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: Refine Rule 5 by incorporating specific conditions that account for the dual nature of pyridine rings in different contexts. Consider adding constraints related to the position of the pyridine ring and its substituents to better predict its effect on yield.

- **Advice 2**: For Rule 9, which involves modifiers with a formyl group on an aromatic ring, consider specifying the context in which the formyl group is detrimental. This could involve examining the presence of other functional groups that might mitigate the electron-withdrawing effect.

- **Advice 3**: Simplify and potentially combine rules that target similar chemical features, such as those involving electron-withdrawing groups. This can help improve generalization and reduce the risk of overfitting by capturing broader patterns.

- **Advice 4**: Update the SMARTS patterns used in the rules to ensure they accurately reflect the intended chemical structures, particularly for rules involving stereochemistry and sugar-like structures. This can help in capturing the correct interactions and improving prediction accuracy.

- **Advice 5**: Explore additional chemical features that might influence yield, such as steric effects or specific metal-ligand interactions, and incorporate these into the rules. This can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the factors affecting the reaction.

- **Advice 6**: Implement cross-validation techniques to test the refined rules on different subsets of data. This will help ensure that the rules are robust and generalize well to new data, reducing the likelihood of overfitting.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group adjacent to an aromatic ring, especially with electron-withdrawing substituents like nitro or bromo groups (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid), are associated with high yield. These substituents can enhance the reactivity of the catalyst through electron-withdrawing effects.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups in sugar-like structures, considering different stereoisomers (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), tend to lead to high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups facilitate hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst.

** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern `[NX3H2+0,NX4H3+;$([N][c])]` does not accurately capture the requirement for an aromatic amine with specific stereochemistry. The rule should focus on the presence of an aromatic ring with specific stereochemistry, which is not addressed by the current SMARTS. Consider using a SMARTS pattern that includes aromatic rings and stereochemistry, such as `[$([C@H](N)c1ccccc1)]`.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Rule 2's SMARTS pattern `['[CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])[c]', '[#6][NX3;$([H1]),$([H0][#6])]']` is intended to capture carboxylic acids adjacent to aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups. The current pattern may not fully capture the electron-withdrawing substituents. Consider adding specific patterns for common electron-withdrawing groups like nitro or bromo, such as `[$([c][C](=O)O)[$([c][Br]),$([c][N+](=O)[O-])]]`.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: Rule 3's SMARTS pattern `[OX2H][CX4;!$(C(O)(O)[!#6])][OX2]` is meant to identify multiple hydroxyl groups in sugar-like structures. This pattern may not fully capture the stereochemistry or the sugar-like structure. Consider using a more specific pattern that captures the cyclic nature and stereochemistry of sugars, such as `[$([C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)C(=O)O)]`.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Rule 4's SMARTS pattern `[SX2H;$([SX2H][CX4;!$(C([SX2H])~[O,S,#7,#15])])]` is intended to capture sulfanyl groups or thioethers. Ensure that the pattern accurately captures both sulfanyl and thioether groups, possibly by including patterns for both `[$([S][C])]` and `[$([C][S][C])]`.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: Rule 5's SMARTS pattern `[n]1ccccc1` is correct for identifying pyridine rings. However, ensure that the rule logic correctly assigns a high yield prediction when this pattern is matched.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Rule 6's SMARTS pattern `[c][OX2;$([OX2][#6])]` is intended to capture methoxy groups adjacent to aromatic rings. Ensure that the pattern accurately captures the methoxy group and its position relative to the aromatic ring, such as `[$([c][O][C])]`.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: Rule 7's SMARTS pattern `[c]1oc2ccccc2c1` is correct for identifying benzofuran structures. Ensure that the rule logic correctly assigns a high yield prediction when this pattern is matched.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Rule 8's SMARTS pattern `[CX4][CX4][CX4]` is intended to capture simple aliphatic chains. Ensure that the pattern accurately captures the lack of functional groups, possibly by using a more general pattern like `[$([C][C][C])]`.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: Rule 9's SMARTS pattern `[c][CX3H]=[OX1]` is intended to capture formyl groups on aromatic rings. Ensure that the pattern accurately captures the formyl group and its position relative to the aromatic ring, such as `[$([c][C](=O)H)]`.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Rule 10's SMARTS pattern `[OX2][CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])[c]` is intended to capture ether linkages with electron-withdrawing groups. Ensure that the pattern accurately captures both the ether linkage and the electron-withdrawing group, possibly by using a more specific pattern like `[$([O][C](=O)[c])]`.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: Rule 11's SMARTS pattern `[CX4](F)(F)F` is correct for identifying trifluoromethyl groups. Ensure that the rule logic correctly assigns a low yield prediction when this pattern is matched.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: Rule 12's SMARTS pattern `[CX4][OX2H]` is intended to capture hydroxy groups on long aliphatic chains. Ensure that the pattern accurately captures the hydroxy group and its position on the chain, possibly by using a more specific pattern like `[$([C][C][O]H)]`.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: Rule 13's SMARTS pattern `[c][CH3]` is intended to capture methyl groups on aromatic rings. Ensure that the pattern accurately captures the methyl group and its position relative to the aromatic ring, such as `[$([c][C]([H])([H])[H])]`.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: Rule 14's SMARTS pattern `[c][OX2H][CX3H]=[OX1]` is intended to capture hydroxy and formyl groups on aromatic rings. Ensure that the pattern accurately captures both groups and their positions relative to the aromatic ring, possibly by using a more specific pattern like `[$([c][O]H[C](=O)H)]`.

- ** Suggestion 15 **: Rule 15's SMARTS pattern `[n]1ccccc1[CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])` is intended to capture carboxylic acid and pyridine rings in the same molecule. Ensure that the pattern accurately captures both groups and their positions relative to each other, possibly by using a more specific pattern like `[$([n]1ccccc1[C](=O)O)]`.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with an aromatic ring and specific stereochemistry (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The stereochemistry and aromatic ring can enhance π-π interactions and stabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group adjacent to an aromatic ring, especially with electron-withdrawing substituents like nitro or bromo groups (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid), are associated with high yield. These substituents can enhance the reactivity of the catalyst through electron-withdrawing effects.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups in sugar-like structures, considering different stereoisomers (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), tend to lead to high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups facilitate hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group or thioether (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) are associated with high yield. The sulfur-containing groups contribute to electron-donating ability, enhancing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) generally result in high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a methoxy group adjacent to an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid) tend to result in high yield. The methoxy group can donate electrons through resonance, potentially enhancing catalyst stability.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. The benzofuran ring can provide additional π-π interactions and electron delocalization, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a simple aliphatic chain and no additional functional groups (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of functional groups may limit interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a formyl group on an aromatic ring without any electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the formyl group may destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with an ether linkage combined with an electron-withdrawing group (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid) tend to result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing effect may reduce the catalyst's reactivity.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group without compensating electron-donating groups (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) are associated with low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing effect can destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on a long aliphatic chain (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The isolated hydroxy group may not sufficiently interact with the catalyst to enhance yield.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a methyl group on an aromatic ring without additional electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of significant electron-donating effects may limit catalyst stabilization.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on an aromatic ring and a formyl group (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing formyl group may counteract the potential stabilizing effect of the hydroxy group.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a pyridine ring in the same molecule (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The combination of these groups may lead to competitive binding or destabilization of the catalyst.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
Upon reviewing the feature matrix and the rules, it appears that there are discrepancies between the rules and the generated feature matrix. Here is a detailed analysis and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Rule 1**: The SMARTS pattern `[$([C@H](N)c1ccccc1)]` does not fully capture the aromatic amine with specific stereochemistry as described in the rule. The rule mentions specific amino acids with aromatic rings and stereochemistry, which are not fully represented by the current SMARTS pattern.

2. **Rule 2**: The SMARTS pattern `[$([c][C](=O)O)[$([c][Br]),$([c][N+](=O)[O-])]]` seems to be correct for identifying carboxylic acids adjacent to aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups. However, the feature matrix does not reflect this correctly for all SMILES strings.

3. **Rule 3**: The SMARTS pattern `[$([C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)C(=O)O)]` is intended to match sugar-like structures with multiple hydroxyl groups. The feature matrix does not show any matches, which suggests that the SMARTS pattern might be too specific or incorrect.

4. **Rule 4**: The SMARTS patterns `[$([S][C])]` and `[$([C][S][C])]` are used to identify sulfanyl groups or thioethers. The feature matrix shows some matches, but not consistently across all relevant SMILES.

5. **Rule 5**: The SMARTS pattern `[n]1ccccc1` correctly identifies pyridine rings. The feature matrix shows matches, but there are inconsistencies with the expected high yield predictions.

6. **Rule 6**: The SMARTS pattern `[$([c][O][C])]` is used for methoxy groups adjacent to aromatic rings. The feature matrix does not show any matches, indicating a potential issue with the SMARTS pattern.

7. **Rule 7**: The SMARTS pattern `[c]1oc2ccccc2c1` is used for benzofuran structures. The feature matrix does not show any matches, suggesting a problem with the SMARTS pattern.

8. **Rule 8**: The SMARTS pattern `[$([C][C][C])]` is too generic and matches simple aliphatic chains. The feature matrix shows matches, but it might be overmatching due to the simplicity of the pattern.

9. **Rule 9**: The SMARTS pattern `[$([c][C](=O)H)]` is used for formyl groups on aromatic rings. The feature matrix does not show any matches, indicating a potential issue with the SMARTS pattern.

10. **Rule 10**: The SMARTS pattern `[$([O][C](=O)[c])]` is used for ether linkages with electron-withdrawing groups. The feature matrix does not show any matches, suggesting a problem with the SMARTS pattern.

11. **Rule 11**: The SMARTS pattern `[CX4](F)(F)F` correctly identifies trifluoromethyl groups. The feature matrix shows matches, but there are inconsistencies with the expected low yield predictions.

12. **Rule 12**: The SMARTS pattern `[$([C][C][O]H)]` is used for hydroxy groups on long aliphatic chains. The feature matrix does not show any matches, indicating a potential issue with the SMARTS pattern.

13. **Rule 13**: The SMARTS pattern `[$([c][C]([H])([H])[H])]` is used for methyl groups on aromatic rings. The feature matrix does not show any matches, suggesting a problem with the SMARTS pattern.

14. **Rule 14**: The SMARTS pattern `[$([c][O]H[C](=O)H)]` is used for hydroxy and formyl groups on aromatic rings. The feature matrix does not show any matches, indicating a potential issue with the SMARTS pattern.

15. **Rule 15**: The SMARTS pattern `[$([n]1ccccc1[C](=O)O)]` is used for carboxylic acid and pyridine rings. The feature matrix does not show any matches, suggesting a problem with the SMARTS pattern.

** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: Review and refine the SMARTS patterns for each rule to ensure they accurately capture the structural features described in the natural language rules. Consider using more specific patterns or combining multiple patterns to capture the complexity of the structures.
- ** Suggestion 2 **: Test the SMARTS patterns individually on a set of known compounds to verify their accuracy before applying them to the full SMILES list.
- ** Suggestion 3 **: Consider using cheminformatics tools or libraries that provide more advanced pattern matching capabilities to improve the accuracy of the feature matrix.
- ** Suggestion 4 **: Re-evaluate the rules to ensure they are comprehensive and consider any additional structural features that may influence the yield predictions.
- ** Suggestion 5 **: Implement a validation step to compare the predicted feature matrix against known outcomes to identify discrepancies and refine the rules and patterns accordingly.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with an aromatic ring and specific stereochemistry (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The stereochemistry and aromatic ring can enhance π-π interactions and stabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group adjacent to an aromatic ring, especially with electron-withdrawing substituents like nitro or bromo groups (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid), are associated with high yield. These substituents can enhance the reactivity of the catalyst through electron-withdrawing effects.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups in sugar-like structures, considering different stereoisomers (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), tend to lead to high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups facilitate hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group or thioether (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) are associated with high yield. The sulfur-containing groups contribute to electron-donating ability, enhancing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) generally result in high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a methoxy group adjacent to an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid) tend to result in high yield. The methoxy group can donate electrons through resonance, potentially enhancing catalyst stability.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. The benzofuran ring can provide additional π-π interactions and electron delocalization, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a simple aliphatic chain and no additional functional groups (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of functional groups may limit interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a formyl group on an aromatic ring without any electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the formyl group may destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with an ether linkage combined with an electron-withdrawing group (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid) tend to result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing effect may reduce the catalyst's reactivity.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group without compensating electron-donating groups (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) are associated with low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing effect can destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on a long aliphatic chain (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The isolated hydroxy group may not sufficiently interact with the catalyst to enhance yield.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a methyl group on an aromatic ring without additional electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of significant electron-donating effects may limit catalyst stabilization.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on an aromatic ring and a formyl group (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing formyl group may counteract the potential stabilizing effect of the hydroxy group.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a pyridine ring in the same molecule (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The combination of these groups may lead to competitive binding or destabilization of the catalyst.

** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern `[$([C@H](N)c1ccccc1)]` seems to be too specific. The rule mentions aromatic rings with specific stereochemistry, but the SMARTS pattern only matches a very specific structure. Consider broadening the SMARTS pattern to include other aromatic structures with stereochemistry.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Rule 2's SMARTS pattern `[$([c][C](=O)O)[$([c][Br]),$([c][N+](=O)[O-])]]` may not capture all cases of carboxylic acids adjacent to aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups. Ensure that the SMARTS pattern can match any electron-withdrawing group, not just nitro or bromo.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: Rule 3's SMARTS pattern `[$([C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)C(=O)O)]` is very specific to a particular sugar-like structure. Consider using a more general pattern that captures multiple hydroxyl groups in various sugar-like structures.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Rule 4's SMARTS patterns `[$([S][C])]` and `[$([C][S][C])]` may not capture all sulfanyl groups or thioethers. Consider using a more general pattern that includes different configurations of sulfur-containing groups.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: Rule 5's SMARTS pattern `[n]1ccccc1` is correct for pyridine rings, but ensure that it matches pyridine rings in various contexts, not just isolated ones.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Rule 6's SMARTS pattern `[$([c][O][C])]` may not capture all methoxy groups adjacent to aromatic rings. Ensure that the pattern can match methoxy groups in different positions relative to the aromatic ring.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: Rule 7's SMARTS pattern `[c]1oc2ccccc2c1` is specific to benzofuran structures. Ensure that it captures all variations of benzofuran structures.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Rule 8's SMARTS pattern `[$([C][C][C])]` is too general and may match many structures that are not simple aliphatic chains. Consider refining the pattern to specifically match simple aliphatic chains without additional functional groups.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: Rule 9's SMARTS pattern `[$([c][C](=O)H)]` should be checked to ensure it matches formyl groups on aromatic rings without electron-donating groups.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Rule 10's SMARTS pattern `[$([O][C](=O)[c])]` may not capture all ether linkages with electron-withdrawing groups. Ensure that the pattern can match various electron-withdrawing groups.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: Rule 11's SMARTS pattern `[CX4](F)(F)F` is correct for trifluoromethyl groups, but ensure that it matches trifluoromethyl groups in various contexts.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: Rule 12's SMARTS pattern `[$([C][C][O]H)]` should be checked to ensure it matches hydroxy groups on long aliphatic chains.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: Rule 13's SMARTS pattern `[$([c][C]([H])([H])[H])]` may not capture all methyl groups on aromatic rings. Ensure that the pattern can match methyl groups in different positions on the ring.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: Rule 14's SMARTS pattern `[$([c][O]H[C](=O)H)]` should be checked to ensure it matches hydroxy and formyl groups on aromatic rings.

- ** Suggestion 15 **: Rule 15's SMARTS pattern `[$([n]1ccccc1[C](=O)O)]` should be checked to ensure it matches carboxylic acid groups and pyridine rings in the same molecule.

Metric Commenter Message:
Based on the current rule metrics and comparing them to the reference metrics, here are some observations and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Confidence**:
   - The current train confidence of 0.546 is slightly lower than the highest confidence observed in the previous iterations (0.7156 and 0.7043). This indicates that the current rules are not as reliable in predicting high yield as some of the previous rules.
   - To improve confidence, it might be beneficial to refine the rules by focusing on more specific conditions or combinations of modifiers that have shown higher confidence in past iterations.

2. **Lift**:
   - The current train lift of 1.0917 is relatively low compared to the highest lift observed in previous iterations (1.4389 and 1.4061). A lift value closer to 1 suggests that the rule conditions do not significantly increase the probability of the rule prediction compared to the baseline probability.
   - To enhance lift, consider identifying and incorporating additional features or interactions that have a stronger association with high yield, as these could provide more informative and impactful rules.

3. **Leverage**:
   - The current train leverage of 0.0021 is lower than the highest leverage values seen in previous iterations (0.0144 and 0.0146). This suggests that the current rules do not provide as much additional support over what would be expected by chance.
   - Increasing leverage could involve exploring combinations of modifiers that are less frequent but have a stronger association with high yield, potentially leading to more interesting and valuable rules.

4. **Support**:
   - The current train support of 0.0419 is lower than some of the previous supports (e.g., 0.1219). While support is not the primary focus, ensuring that the rules apply to a reasonable portion of the dataset is important for generalizability.
   - Balancing support with confidence and lift is crucial. Consider focusing on rules that maintain a reasonable level of support while improving confidence and lift.

**Suggestions for Improvement**:
- **Refinement of Rules**: Analyze the specific conditions and combinations of modifiers that led to higher confidence and lift in previous iterations. Consider refining the current rules to incorporate these insights.
- **Feature Exploration**: Investigate additional features or interactions that could be included in the rules to enhance their predictive power. This might involve exploring new chemical properties or structural features of the modifiers.
- **Rule Complexity**: Evaluate the complexity of the current rules. Simplifying overly complex rules or combining simpler rules that capture key interactions might improve their effectiveness.
- **Iterative Testing**: Continue iterating on the rules, testing different combinations and conditions to identify those that consistently yield higher confidence and lift.

Overall, while the current rules show some promise, there is room for improvement in terms of confidence and lift. By focusing on refining the rules and exploring additional features, it may be possible to develop more effective and reliable rules for predicting high yield.

### Performance Evaluation of Current Rules

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
   - The current rules seem to be struggling with effectiveness, as indicated by the low validation accuracy of 0.4286. This is a significant drop from previous accuracies, which were consistently around 0.76. The rules may not be capturing the necessary features to accurately predict the loading of modifiers on catalysts.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting:**
   - The significant drop in validation accuracy suggests potential underfitting. The model may not be complex enough or the rules may not be capturing the necessary interactions and features to generalize well to the validation set.

3. **Discrepancies Analysis:**
   - For molecules where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low, rules with high positive SHAP values (e.g., Rule 8 and Rule 10) are likely problematic. These rules may be overestimating the impact of certain features.
   - Conversely, for molecules where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, rules with high negative SHAP values (e.g., Rule 5 and Rule 6) may be underestimating the impact of certain features.

4. **Accuracy Improvements:**
   - The current accuracy metrics suggest that there is room for improvement. The model's performance has decreased, indicating that the current rules may not be capturing the necessary complexity or interactions within the data.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**
   - SHAP analysis indicates that certain rules are consistently contributing to incorrect predictions. For example, Rule 8 and Rule 10 often have high positive SHAP values for overestimated loadings, suggesting these rules may need refinement.
   - Rules with high negative SHAP values for underestimated loadings, such as Rule 5 and Rule 6, may need adjustment to better capture the features that lead to high experimental loadings.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Overestimated Rules:**
   - Re-evaluate and refine Rule 8 and Rule 10, which are associated with high positive SHAP values for overestimated loadings. Consider whether these rules are too broad or if they are capturing irrelevant features that lead to overestimation.

2. **Adjust Underestimated Rules:**
   - Adjust Rule 5 and Rule 6, which have high negative SHAP values for underestimated loadings. These rules may need to be expanded or modified to better capture the features that lead to high experimental loadings.

3. **Improve Generalization:**
   - Consider introducing additional rules or modifying existing ones to capture more complex interactions. This could help address the underfitting issue and improve the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.

4. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - Use insights from SHAP analysis to iteratively refine the rules. Focus on rules that consistently contribute to incorrect predictions and adjust them based on the patterns observed in the SHAP values.

5. **Incorporate Additional Features:**
   - Explore incorporating additional features or interactions that may not be currently captured by the existing rules. This could involve considering new chemical properties or interactions that are relevant to the loading of modifiers on catalysts.

By addressing these areas, the rules can be refined to improve the model's accuracy and generalization, ultimately leading to better predictions of modifier loading on catalysts.

    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with an aromatic ring and specific stereochemistry (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The stereochemistry and aromatic ring can enhance π-π interactions and stabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group adjacent to an aromatic ring, especially with electron-withdrawing substituents like nitro or bromo groups (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid), are associated with high yield. These substituents can enhance the reactivity of the catalyst through electron-withdrawing effects.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups in sugar-like structures, considering different stereoisomers (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), tend to lead to high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups facilitate hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group or thioether (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) are associated with high yield. The sulfur-containing groups contribute to electron-donating ability, enhancing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) generally result in high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a methoxy group adjacent to an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid) tend to result in high yield. The methoxy group can donate electrons through resonance, potentially enhancing catalyst stability.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. The benzofuran ring can provide additional π-π interactions and electron delocalization, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a simple aliphatic chain and no additional functional groups (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of functional groups may limit interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a formyl group on an aromatic ring without any electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the formyl group may destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with an ether linkage combined with an electron-withdrawing group (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid) tend to result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing effect may reduce the catalyst's reactivity.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group without compensating electron-donating groups (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) are associated with low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing effect can destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on a long aliphatic chain (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The isolated hydroxy group may not sufficiently interact with the catalyst to enhance yield.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a methyl group on an aromatic ring without additional electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of significant electron-donating effects may limit catalyst stabilization.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on an aromatic ring and a formyl group (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing formyl group may counteract the potential stabilizing effect of the hydroxy group.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a pyridine ring in the same molecule (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The combination of these groups may lead to competitive binding or destabilization of the catalyst.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: Re-evaluate Rule 8 and Rule 10, which are associated with high positive SHAP values, indicating overestimation. Consider narrowing the scope of these rules by specifying additional structural features or conditions under which these modifiers lead to low yield. For example, specify the chain length or the presence of additional functional groups that might influence the yield.

- **Advice 2**: Adjust Rule 5 and Rule 6, which have high negative SHAP values, indicating underestimation. Expand these rules to include additional structural features that might enhance the yield. For instance, consider the influence of substituents on the pyridine ring or the position of methoxy groups on the aromatic ring.

- **Advice 3**: Introduce new rules that capture complex interactions not currently addressed. For example, consider rules that account for the synergistic effects of multiple functional groups or the spatial arrangement of groups that might influence the catalyst's performance.

- **Advice 4**: Incorporate additional chemical properties or interactions into the rules, such as steric effects, electronic effects, or the potential for intramolecular interactions that could influence the yield. This could involve analyzing the 3D conformation of the modifiers and their potential interactions with the catalyst.

- **Advice 5**: Use iterative refinement based on SHAP analysis to continuously improve the rules. Focus on rules that consistently lead to incorrect predictions and adjust them based on observed patterns in the data. This could involve testing new hypotheses about the interactions between modifiers and the catalyst.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with an aromatic ring and specific stereochemistry (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The stereochemistry and aromatic ring can enhance π-π interactions and stabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group adjacent to an aromatic ring, especially with electron-withdrawing substituents like nitro or bromo groups (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid), are associated with high yield. These substituents can enhance the reactivity of the catalyst through electron-withdrawing effects.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups in sugar-like structures, considering different stereoisomers (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), tend to lead to high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups facilitate hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group or thioether (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) are associated with high yield. The sulfur-containing groups contribute to electron-donating ability, enhancing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and additional electron-donating groups (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) generally result in high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially stabilizing the catalyst, especially when electron-donating groups are present.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a methoxy group adjacent to an aromatic ring, particularly when multiple methoxy groups are present (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), tend to result in high yield. The methoxy groups can donate electrons through resonance, potentially enhancing catalyst stability.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. The benzofuran ring can provide additional π-π interactions and electron delocalization, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a simple aliphatic chain and no additional functional groups (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of functional groups may limit interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a formyl group on an aromatic ring without any electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the formyl group may destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with an ether linkage combined with an electron-withdrawing group, especially when the ether linkage is extensive (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid), tend to result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing effect may reduce the catalyst's reactivity.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group without compensating electron-donating groups (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) are associated with low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing effect can destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on a long aliphatic chain (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The isolated hydroxy group may not sufficiently interact with the catalyst to enhance yield.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a methyl group on an aromatic ring without additional electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of significant electron-donating effects may limit catalyst stabilization.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on an aromatic ring and a formyl group (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing formyl group may counteract the potential stabilizing effect of the hydroxy group.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a pyridine ring in the same molecule, especially when no additional stabilizing groups are present (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid), tend to result in low yield. The combination of these groups may lead to competitive binding or destabilization of the catalyst.

** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern '[NX3;$([N][c])]' does not accurately capture the requirement for specific stereochemistry and aromatic amine. Consider using a more specific SMARTS pattern that includes stereochemistry and aromatic ring features.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Rule 2's SMARTS pattern '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]', '[c]', '[#7,#8,#16,#17]' is too broad. It should specifically target carboxylic acids adjacent to aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing substituents. Consider refining the SMARTS to include these specific substituents.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: Rule 3's SMARTS pattern '[OX2H][CX4][OX2H]' is not specific enough for sugar-like structures with multiple hydroxyl groups. Consider using a pattern that captures the cyclic nature and multiple hydroxyl groups of sugars.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Rule 4's SMARTS pattern '[SX2H]', '[SX2]' should be checked to ensure it captures both sulfanyl groups and thioethers accurately. Consider using separate SMARTS for each group if necessary.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: Rule 5's SMARTS pattern '[n][c]', '[OX2H]' does not accurately capture pyridine rings with electron-donating groups. Consider refining the pattern to specifically target pyridine rings and common electron-donating groups.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Rule 6's SMARTS pattern '[c][OX2H]', '[c][OX2H]' should be refined to specifically target methoxy groups adjacent to aromatic rings, possibly using a pattern like '[c][OCH3]'.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: Rule 7's SMARTS pattern '[c]1oc2ccccc2c1' is specific to benzofuran but should be checked for accuracy in capturing the structure across different SMILES.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Rule 8's SMARTS pattern '[CX4][CX4][CX4]' is too broad for simple aliphatic chains. Consider using a pattern that captures the lack of functional groups more effectively.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: Rule 9's SMARTS pattern '[c][CX3H]=O' should be checked to ensure it captures formyl groups on aromatic rings without electron-donating groups.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Rule 10's SMARTS pattern '[OX2][CX4][OX2][CX4]' should be refined to capture ether linkages with electron-withdrawing groups more accurately.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: Rule 11's SMARTS pattern '[CX4](F)(F)F' is correct for trifluoromethyl groups but should be checked for context within the molecule.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: Rule 12's SMARTS pattern '[OX2H][CX4][CX4]' should be refined to capture hydroxy groups on long aliphatic chains more accurately.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: Rule 13's SMARTS pattern '[c][CH3]' should be checked to ensure it captures methyl groups on aromatic rings without additional electron-donating groups.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: Rule 14's SMARTS pattern '[c][OX2H][CX3H]=O' should be refined to capture hydroxy and formyl groups on aromatic rings more accurately.

- ** Suggestion 15 **: Rule 15's SMARTS pattern '[n][c][CX3](=O)[OX2H]' should be checked to ensure it captures carboxylic acid and pyridine rings in the same molecule accurately.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Rule 2's SMARTS `['[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]', '[c]', '[#7,#8,#16,#17]']` should be refined to specifically capture carboxylic acids adjacent to aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing substituents. The current pattern may be too broad.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For Rule 3, the SMARTS `['[OX2H][CX4][OX2H]', '[OX2H][CX4][OX2H]']` should be adjusted to better represent sugar-like structures with multiple hydroxyl groups. Consider using a pattern that captures the cyclic nature and stereochemistry of sugars.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Rule 4's SMARTS `['[SX2H]', '[SX2]']` should be checked to ensure it captures both sulfanyl groups and thioethers. The current pattern may not distinguish between these effectively.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: Rule 5's SMARTS `['[n][c]', '[OX2H]']` does not fully capture the presence of a pyridine ring with electron-donating groups. Consider refining the pattern to specifically identify pyridine rings and their substituents.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: For Rule 6, the SMARTS `['[c][OX2H]', '[c][OX2H]']` should be revised to accurately capture methoxy groups adjacent to aromatic rings. The current pattern may not be specific enough.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: Rule 7's SMARTS `['[c]1oc2ccccc2c1']` should be checked to ensure it accurately captures benzofuran structures. Verify that the pattern matches the intended structure.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Rule 8's SMARTS `['[CX4][CX4][CX4]']` may not effectively capture simple aliphatic chains. Consider using a pattern that identifies linear aliphatic chains without functional groups.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: For Rule 9, the SMARTS `['[c][CX3H]=O']` should be refined to specifically capture formyl groups on aromatic rings. Ensure the pattern matches the intended structure.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Rule 10's SMARTS `['[OX2][CX4][OX2][CX4]']` should be checked to ensure it captures ether linkages with electron-withdrawing groups. The current pattern may not be specific enough.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with an aromatic ring and specific stereochemistry (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The stereochemistry and aromatic ring can enhance π-π interactions and stabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group adjacent to an aromatic ring, especially with electron-withdrawing substituents like nitro or bromo groups (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid), are associated with high yield. These substituents can enhance the reactivity of the catalyst through electron-withdrawing effects.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups in sugar-like structures, considering different stereoisomers (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), tend to lead to high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups facilitate hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group or thioether (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) are associated with high yield. The sulfur-containing groups contribute to electron-donating ability, enhancing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and additional electron-donating groups (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) generally result in high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially stabilizing the catalyst, especially when electron-donating groups are present.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a methoxy group adjacent to an aromatic ring, particularly when multiple methoxy groups are present (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), tend to result in high yield. The methoxy groups can donate electrons through resonance, potentially enhancing catalyst stability.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. The benzofuran ring can provide additional π-π interactions and electron delocalization, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a simple aliphatic chain and no additional functional groups (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of functional groups may limit interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a formyl group on an aromatic ring without any electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the formyl group may destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with an ether linkage combined with an electron-withdrawing group, especially when the ether linkage is extensive (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid), tend to result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing effect may reduce the catalyst's reactivity.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group without compensating electron-donating groups (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) are associated with low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing effect can destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on a long aliphatic chain (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The isolated hydroxy group may not sufficiently interact with the catalyst to enhance yield.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a methyl group on an aromatic ring without additional electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of significant electron-donating effects may limit catalyst stabilization.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on an aromatic ring and a formyl group (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing formyl group may counteract the potential stabilizing effect of the hydroxy group.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a pyridine ring in the same molecule, especially when no additional stabilizing groups are present (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid), tend to result in low yield. The combination of these groups may lead to competitive binding or destabilization of the catalyst.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern '[NX3;$([N][c])]' does not capture the specific stereochemistry or aromatic ring as described in the rule. Consider using a more specific SMARTS pattern that includes stereochemistry and aromatic ring features.
- ** Suggestion 2 **: Rule 2's SMARTS pattern '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]', '[c]', '[#7,#8,#16,#17]' does not accurately capture the presence of electron-withdrawing substituents like nitro or bromo groups. Modify the SMARTS to include these specific substituents.
- ** Suggestion 3 **: Rule 3's SMARTS pattern '[OX2H][CX4][OX2H]' is too generic and does not account for sugar-like structures or stereoisomers. Consider using a SMARTS pattern that captures the specific stereochemistry and arrangement of hydroxyl groups.
- ** Suggestion 4 **: Rule 4's SMARTS pattern '[SX2H]', '[SX2]' does not differentiate between sulfanyl groups and thioethers. Ensure the SMARTS pattern can distinguish these groups effectively.
- ** Suggestion 5 **: Rule 5's SMARTS pattern '[n][c]', '[OX2H]' does not capture the presence of additional electron-donating groups. Update the SMARTS to include these groups.
- ** Suggestion 6 **: Rule 6's SMARTS pattern '[c][OX2H]', '[c][OX2H]' does not specifically target methoxy groups adjacent to aromatic rings. Adjust the SMARTS to reflect this specific arrangement.
- ** Suggestion 7 **: Rule 7's SMARTS pattern '[c]1oc2ccccc2c1' is correct for benzofuran structures, but ensure it matches the intended SMILES accurately.
- ** Suggestion 8 **: Rule 8's SMARTS pattern '[CX4][CX4][CX4]' is too broad and may not accurately capture simple aliphatic chains without additional functional groups. Refine the pattern to exclude functional groups.
- ** Suggestion 9 **: Rule 9's SMARTS pattern '[c][CX3H]=O' should be checked to ensure it captures formyl groups on aromatic rings without electron-donating groups.
- ** Suggestion 10 **: Rule 10's SMARTS pattern '[OX2][CX4][OX2][CX4]' may not effectively capture extensive ether linkages with electron-withdrawing groups. Consider refining the pattern to include these features.
- ** Suggestion 11 **: Rule 11's SMARTS pattern '[CX4](F)(F)F' is correct for trifluoromethyl groups, but ensure it matches the intended SMILES accurately.
- ** Suggestion 12 **: Rule 12's SMARTS pattern '[OX2H][CX4][CX4]' may not effectively capture hydroxy groups on long aliphatic chains. Refine the pattern to ensure it matches the intended structures.
- ** Suggestion 13 **: Rule 13's SMARTS pattern '[c][CH3]' should be checked to ensure it captures methyl groups on aromatic rings without additional electron-donating groups.
- ** Suggestion 14 **: Rule 14's SMARTS pattern '[c][OX2H][CX3H]=O' should be checked to ensure it captures hydroxy and formyl groups on aromatic rings.
- ** Suggestion 15 **: Rule 15's SMARTS pattern '[n][c][CX3](=O)[OX2H]' should be checked to ensure it captures carboxylic acid and pyridine rings in the same molecule without additional stabilizing groups.

### Comparison with Reference Metrics:

- The current metrics show improvement in confidence and lift compared to some previous iterations, indicating that the rules are becoming more precise and meaningful.
- However, the support and leverage are not at their highest, suggesting that while the rules are accurate, they may not be as broadly applicable or as strong in association as they could be.

### Recommendations for Improvement:

1. **Expand Rule Coverage**: Consider revising or adding rules to increase the support, ensuring that more instances in the dataset are covered by the rules.

2. **Enhance Rule Precision**: Focus on refining rules to increase lift and leverage, ensuring that the rules capture strong and meaningful relationships.

3. **Balance Between Support and Confidence**: Aim to find a balance where rules have both high support and high confidence, ensuring they are both broadly applicable and accurate.

4. **Iterate on High-Lift Rules**: Analyze rules with the highest lift from previous iterations to understand what makes them effective and apply similar principles to other rules.

5. **Incorporate Additional Features**: Consider incorporating additional features or modifying existing ones to capture more complex interactions that could improve rule performance.

By focusing on these areas, the rules can be further refined to achieve better overall performance, capturing more significant and meaningful relationships within the dataset.

### Performance Evaluation of Current Rules

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
   - The current rules have shown mixed effectiveness. The validation accuracy has fluctuated significantly across iterations, with the latest accuracy at 0.6286, which is an improvement from some previous iterations but still below the initial reference accuracies of 0.76. This suggests that while some rules may be capturing relevant features, others might not be contributing effectively to the model's performance.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment:**
   - The significant drop in accuracy in some iterations (e.g., 0.5143 and 0.4571) suggests potential overfitting or underfitting issues. The model might be overfitting to specific features captured by the rules, leading to poor generalization on the validation set. Conversely, the underfitting could be due to the rules not capturing enough relevant features or interactions.

3. **Discrepancies Analysis:**
   - For molecules where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low, rules with high positive SHAP values (e.g., Rule 5, Rule 6, Rule 8) might be problematic. These rules may be overestimating the contribution of certain features to high loading.
   - Conversely, for molecules where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, rules with high negative SHAP values (e.g., Rule 2, Rule 4, Rule 5) might be underestimating the contribution of certain features.

4. **Accuracy Improvements:**
   - The improvement in accuracy to 0.6286 suggests some progress, but the model is still not reaching the initial reference accuracies. This indicates that while some rules may have been refined, there is still room for improvement to achieve better generalization and accuracy.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**
   - SHAP analysis highlights specific rules that consistently contribute to discrepancies in predictions. For instance, Rule 5 and Rule 6 often have high positive SHAP values for overestimated loadings, suggesting these rules might be too aggressive in predicting high loading.
   - Rules with high negative SHAP values for underestimated loadings, such as Rule 2 and Rule 4, may need adjustment to better capture the features leading to high experimental loadings.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Overestimated Loading Rules:**
   - Re-evaluate and potentially relax the conditions in rules like Rule 5 and Rule 6, which have high positive SHAP values for overestimated loadings. Consider whether the features these rules capture are truly indicative of high loading or if they need additional context or constraints.

2. **Adjust Underestimated Loading Rules:**
   - For rules like Rule 2 and Rule 4, which have high negative SHAP values for underestimated loadings, consider incorporating additional features or interactions that might be missing. This could involve exploring combinations of features that are not currently captured by the rules.

3. **Improve Generalization:**
   - To address overfitting, consider simplifying some rules or reducing the number of features they capture. This can help the model generalize better to unseen data.
   - For underfitting, explore additional features or interactions that could be incorporated into the rules to capture more relevant information.

4. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - Use insights from SHAP analysis to iteratively refine the rules. Focus on rules that consistently show high SHAP values (positive or negative) and assess whether they are capturing the intended features.
   - Consider cross-validation techniques to ensure that rule adjustments lead to consistent improvements across different subsets of the data.

5. **Incorporate Domain Knowledge:**
   - Leverage domain expertise to validate the relevance of the features captured by the rules. This can help ensure that the rules are grounded in chemical principles and are not purely data-driven artifacts.

By implementing these recommendations, the rules can be refined to improve the model's accuracy and generalization, ultimately leading to more reliable predictions of modifier loading on catalysts.

### Summary and Directions for Optimization

1. **Current Rule Effectiveness:**
   - The current rules have shown varying effectiveness, with validation accuracy fluctuating across iterations. The latest accuracy of 0.6286 indicates some improvement but still falls short of the initial reference accuracies of 0.76. This suggests that while some rules are capturing relevant features, others may not be contributing effectively to the model's performance.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment:**
   - The fluctuations in accuracy suggest potential overfitting or underfitting issues. Overfitting may occur if the model is too focused on specific features captured by the rules, leading to poor generalization. Underfitting could result from the rules not capturing enough relevant features or interactions.

3. **Discrepancies Analysis:**
   - SHAP analysis highlights specific rules contributing to discrepancies in predictions. Rules with high positive SHAP values for overestimated loadings (e.g., Rule 5, Rule 6) may be too aggressive in predicting high loading. Conversely, rules with high negative SHAP values for underestimated loadings (e.g., Rule 2, Rule 4) may need adjustment to better capture features leading to high experimental loadings.

4. **Recommendations for Improvement:**
   - **Refine Overestimated Loading Rules:** Re-evaluate and potentially relax conditions in rules like Rule 5 and Rule 6. Consider whether the features these rules capture are truly indicative of high loading or if they need additional context or constraints.
   - **Adjust Underestimated Loading Rules:** For rules like Rule 2 and Rule 4, incorporate additional features or interactions that might be missing. Explore combinations of features not currently captured by the rules.
   - **Improve Generalization:** Simplify some rules or reduce the number of features they capture to address overfitting. For underfitting, explore additional features or interactions to capture more relevant information.
   - **Iterative Refinement:** Use SHAP analysis insights to iteratively refine the rules. Focus on rules with consistent high SHAP values and assess whether they capture the intended features.
   - **Incorporate Domain Knowledge:** Leverage domain expertise to validate the relevance of features captured by the rules, ensuring they are grounded in chemical principles.

### Possibility for Further Optimization

There is potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. By refining rules that contribute to discrepancies and incorporating additional features or interactions, the model's accuracy and generalization can be improved. Iterative refinement and leveraging domain knowledge will be crucial in achieving this.

    GPT Model: gpt-4o-2024-08-06
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with an aromatic ring and specific stereochemistry (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The stereochemistry and aromatic ring can enhance π-π interactions and stabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group adjacent to an aromatic ring, especially with electron-withdrawing substituents like nitro or bromo groups (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid), are associated with high yield. These substituents can enhance the reactivity of the catalyst through electron-withdrawing effects.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups in sugar-like structures, considering different stereoisomers (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), tend to lead to high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups facilitate hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group or thioether (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) are associated with high yield. The sulfur-containing groups contribute to electron-donating ability, enhancing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and additional electron-donating groups (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) generally result in high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially stabilizing the catalyst, especially when electron-donating groups are present.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a methoxy group adjacent to an aromatic ring, particularly when multiple methoxy groups are present (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), tend to result in high yield. The methoxy groups can donate electrons through resonance, potentially enhancing catalyst stability.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. The benzofuran ring can provide additional π-π interactions and electron delocalization, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a simple aliphatic chain and no additional functional groups (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of functional groups may limit interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a formyl group on an aromatic ring without any electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the formyl group may destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with an ether linkage combined with an electron-withdrawing group, especially when the ether linkage is extensive (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid), tend to result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing effect may reduce the catalyst's reactivity.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group without compensating electron-donating groups (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) are associated with low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing effect can destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on a long aliphatic chain (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The isolated hydroxy group may not sufficiently interact with the catalyst to enhance yield.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a methyl group on an aromatic ring without additional electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of significant electron-donating effects may limit catalyst stabilization.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on an aromatic ring and a formyl group (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing formyl group may counteract the potential stabilizing effect of the hydroxy group.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a pyridine ring in the same molecule, especially when no additional stabilizing groups are present (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid), tend to result in low yield. The combination of these groups may lead to competitive binding or destabilization of the catalyst.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: Re-evaluate Rule 5 and Rule 6, which are associated with overestimated loadings. Consider adding constraints or additional context to these rules to ensure they only predict high yield when specific conditions are met. For example, specify the type or position of electron-donating groups in Rule 5 to refine its applicability.

- **Advice 2**: For Rule 2 and Rule 4, which are linked to underestimated loadings, explore additional features or interactions that might be missing. Consider incorporating the influence of other functional groups or structural motifs that could enhance the catalyst's reactivity.

- **Advice 3**: Simplify rules that may be contributing to overfitting by reducing the number of features they capture. For instance, if a rule captures multiple functional groups, assess whether all are necessary or if a subset could suffice.

- **Advice 4**: Use SHAP analysis to identify rules with consistently high SHAP values and refine them iteratively. Focus on ensuring these rules capture the intended chemical interactions and are not overly broad or narrow.

- **Advice 5**: Incorporate domain knowledge to validate and adjust the rules. Engage with chemists to ensure that the features captured by the rules are grounded in chemical principles and reflect realistic interactions in the reaction environment.

- **Advice 6**: Consider adding new rules that capture interactions or features not currently addressed. For example, explore the impact of different types of π-π interactions or hydrogen bonding patterns that may influence catalyst stability and reactivity.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with an aromatic ring and specific stereochemistry (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The stereochemistry and aromatic ring can enhance π-π interactions and stabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group adjacent to an aromatic ring, especially with electron-withdrawing substituents like nitro or bromo groups (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid), are associated with high yield. These substituents can enhance the reactivity of the catalyst through electron-withdrawing effects.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups in sugar-like structures, considering different stereoisomers (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), tend to lead to high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups facilitate hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group or thioether (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) are associated with high yield. The sulfur-containing groups contribute to electron-donating ability, enhancing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and additional electron-donating groups at ortho or para positions (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) generally result in high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially stabilizing the catalyst, especially when electron-donating groups are present.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a methoxy group adjacent to an aromatic ring, particularly when multiple methoxy groups are present and positioned ortho or para to each other (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), tend to result in high yield. The methoxy groups can donate electrons through resonance, potentially enhancing catalyst stability.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. The benzofuran ring can provide additional π-π interactions and electron delocalization, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a simple aliphatic chain and no additional functional groups (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of functional groups may limit interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a formyl group on an aromatic ring without any electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the formyl group may destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with an ether linkage combined with an electron-withdrawing group, especially when the ether linkage is extensive (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid), tend to result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing effect may reduce the catalyst's reactivity.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group without compensating electron-donating groups (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) are associated with low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing effect can destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on a long aliphatic chain (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The isolated hydroxy group may not sufficiently interact with the catalyst to enhance yield.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a methyl group on an aromatic ring without additional electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of significant electron-donating effects may limit catalyst stabilization.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on an aromatic ring and a formyl group (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing formyl group may counteract the potential stabilizing effect of the hydroxy group.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a pyridine ring in the same molecule, especially when no additional stabilizing groups are present (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid), tend to result in low yield. The combination of these groups may lead to competitive binding or destabilization of the catalyst.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern '[NX3;!$([N][!C])][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]' does not fully capture the requirement of an amino acid with an aromatic ring. The pattern should be expanded to include the aromatic ring structure, such as '[NX3;!$([N][!C])][CX3](=O)[OX2H1][c]'.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Rule 2's SMARTS pattern '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][c]' should be refined to include electron-withdrawing substituents adjacent to the aromatic ring, such as '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][c][N+](=O)[O-]' for nitro groups or '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][c][Br]'.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: Rule 3's SMARTS pattern '[OX2H][CX4][OX2H]' is too generic and does not account for sugar-like structures with multiple hydroxyl groups. Consider using a pattern that captures the stereochemistry and multiple hydroxyl groups, such as '[C@H]([OH])[C@H]([OH])[C@H]([OH])[C@H]([OH])[C@H]([OH])[C@H](=O)O'.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Rule 4's SMARTS pattern '[SX2][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]' should be checked to ensure it captures thioether structures. Consider using '[SX2][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]' and verify if it matches the intended sulfur-containing groups.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: Rule 5's SMARTS pattern '[n][c][OX2H1]' does not specify the position of electron-donating groups on the pyridine ring. Consider using a pattern like '[n][c][c][c][c][c][OX2H1]' with specific positions for electron-donating groups.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Rule 6's SMARTS pattern '[c][OX2][c]' is too broad and does not specify the ortho or para positions of methoxy groups. Consider using '[c][OX2][c][OX2][c]' to capture multiple methoxy groups in specific positions.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: Rule 7's SMARTS pattern '[c]1oc2ccccc2c1' should be verified to ensure it captures the benzofuran structure accurately. Ensure the pattern matches the intended structure.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Rule 8's SMARTS pattern '[CX4][CX4][CX4]' is too generic for simple aliphatic chains. Consider using a pattern that captures the lack of functional groups, such as '[CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4]'.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: Rule 9's SMARTS pattern '[c][CX3H]=O' should be checked to ensure it captures the formyl group on an aromatic ring without electron-donating groups. Consider using '[c][CX3H]=O' with additional constraints to exclude electron-donating groups.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Rule 10's SMARTS pattern '[OX2][CX4][OX2]' should be refined to capture extensive ether linkages with electron-withdrawing groups. Consider using '[OX2][CX4][OX2][CX4][OX2]' with specific electron-withdrawing groups.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: Rule 11's SMARTS pattern '[CX4](F)(F)F' should be checked to ensure it captures trifluoromethyl groups without compensating electron-donating groups. Consider using '[CX4](F)(F)F' with additional constraints.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: Rule 12's SMARTS pattern '[OX2H][CX4][CX4]' should be refined to capture hydroxy groups on long aliphatic chains. Consider using '[OX2H][CX4][CX4][CX4]' with specific chain lengths.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: Rule 13's SMARTS pattern '[c][CH3]' should be checked to ensure it captures methyl groups on aromatic rings without additional electron-donating groups. Consider using '[c][CH3]' with additional constraints.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: Rule 14's SMARTS pattern '[c][OX2H][CX3H]=O' should be checked to ensure it captures hydroxy and formyl groups on aromatic rings. Consider using '[c][OX2H][CX3H]=O' with additional constraints.

- ** Suggestion 15 **: Rule 15's SMARTS pattern '[n][c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]' should be checked to ensure it captures carboxylic acid and pyridine rings in the same molecule. Consider using '[n][c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]' with additional constraints.

** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern '[NX3;!$([N][!C])][CX3](=O)[OX2H1][c]' does not fully capture the requirement of an amino acid with an aromatic ring and specific stereochemistry. Consider using a more specific SMARTS pattern that includes stereochemistry and aromatic ring features.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Rule 2's SMARTS patterns '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][c][N+](=O)[O-]' and '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][c][Br]' may not fully capture the electron-withdrawing substituents' effect. Ensure that the SMARTS patterns account for the position of these groups relative to the carboxylic acid.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For Rule 3, the SMARTS pattern '[C@H]([OH])[C@H]([OH])[C@H]([OH])[C@H]([OH])[C@H]([OH])[C@H](=O)O' is very specific and may not match all sugar-like structures with multiple hydroxyl groups. Consider using a more general pattern that captures the essence of sugar-like structures.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Rule 4's SMARTS pattern '[SX2][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]' may not fully capture the presence of a sulfanyl group or thioether. Ensure that the pattern is flexible enough to match various configurations of sulfur-containing groups.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: For Rule 5, the SMARTS pattern '[n][c][c][c][c][c][OX2H1]' may not accurately capture pyridine rings with electron-donating groups at ortho or para positions. Consider refining the pattern to include these specific positions.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Rule 6's SMARTS pattern '[c][OX2][c][OX2][c]' may not fully capture the presence of methoxy groups adjacent to an aromatic ring. Ensure that the pattern accounts for the specific positioning of methoxy groups.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: For Rule 7, the SMARTS pattern '[c]1oc2ccccc2c1' may not fully capture the benzofuran structure. Ensure that the pattern is specific enough to match benzofuran rings.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Rule 8's SMARTS pattern '[CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4]' may not accurately capture simple aliphatic chains. Consider using a more general pattern that captures the essence of aliphatic chains without additional functional groups.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: For Rule 9, the SMARTS pattern '[c][CX3H]=O' may not fully capture the presence of a formyl group on an aromatic ring. Ensure that the pattern accounts for the specific positioning of the formyl group.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Rule 10's SMARTS pattern '[OX2][CX4][OX2][CX4][OX2]' may not fully capture extensive ether linkages with electron-withdrawing groups. Consider refining the pattern to include these specific features.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: For Rule 11, the SMARTS pattern '[CX4](F)(F)F' accurately captures the trifluoromethyl group, but ensure that it is used in the correct context where no compensating electron-donating groups are present.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: Rule 12's SMARTS pattern '[OX2H][CX4][CX4][CX4]' may not fully capture the presence of a hydroxy group on a long aliphatic chain. Consider using a more specific pattern that captures the essence of this structure.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: For Rule 13, the SMARTS pattern '[c][CH3]' may not fully capture the presence of a methyl group on an aromatic ring. Ensure that the pattern accounts for the specific positioning of the methyl group.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with an aromatic ring and specific stereochemistry (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The stereochemistry and aromatic ring can enhance π-π interactions and stabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group adjacent to an aromatic ring, especially with electron-withdrawing substituents like nitro or bromo groups (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid), are associated with high yield. These substituents can enhance the reactivity of the catalyst through electron-withdrawing effects.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups in sugar-like structures, considering different stereoisomers (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), tend to lead to high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups facilitate hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group or thioether (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) are associated with high yield. The sulfur-containing groups contribute to electron-donating ability, enhancing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and additional electron-donating groups at ortho or para positions (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) generally result in high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially stabilizing the catalyst, especially when electron-donating groups are present.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a methoxy group adjacent to an aromatic ring, particularly when multiple methoxy groups are present and positioned ortho or para to each other (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), tend to result in high yield. The methoxy groups can donate electrons through resonance, potentially enhancing catalyst stability.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. The benzofuran ring can provide additional π-π interactions and electron delocalization, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a simple aliphatic chain and no additional functional groups (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of functional groups may limit interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a formyl group on an aromatic ring without any electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the formyl group may destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with an ether linkage combined with an electron-withdrawing group, especially when the ether linkage is extensive (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid), tend to result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing effect may reduce the catalyst's reactivity.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group without compensating electron-donating groups (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) are associated with low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing effect can destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on a long aliphatic chain (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The isolated hydroxy group may not sufficiently interact with the catalyst to enhance yield.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a methyl group on an aromatic ring without additional electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of significant electron-donating effects may limit catalyst stabilization.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on an aromatic ring and a formyl group (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing formyl group may counteract the potential stabilizing effect of the hydroxy group.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a pyridine ring in the same molecule, especially when no additional stabilizing groups are present (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid), tend to result in low yield. The combination of these groups may lead to competitive binding or destabilization of the catalyst.

Consider using a more specific SMARTS pattern that includes stereochemistry and aromatic ring detection.
- ** Suggestion 2 **: Rule 2's SMARTS patterns '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][c][N+](=O)[O-]' and '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][c][Br]' should be expanded to include electron-withdrawing substituents like nitro or bromo groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid group. Ensure the aromatic ring is also detected.
- ** Suggestion 3 **: Rule 3's SMARTS '[C@H]([OH])[C@H]([OH])[C@H]([OH])[C@H]([OH])[C@H]([OH])[C@H](=O)O' is too specific. Consider using a more general pattern that captures sugar-like structures with multiple hydroxyl groups and different stereoisomers.

    Train support: 0.02095238095238095
    Train confidence: 0.5972222222222221

---------------------------------------------------------------
Metric Commenter Message:
Based on the current metrics and comparing them to the reference metrics, here are some observations and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Confidence**:
   - The current train confidence is 0.597, which is an improvement over some of the previous rules (e.g., 0.532, 0.546) but lower than others (e.g., 0.715, 0.704). This indicates that the current rules are moderately reliable in predicting the outcome, but there is room for improvement.
   - To improve confidence, consider refining the conditions of the rules to better capture the characteristics that lead to high yield. This might involve identifying additional structural features or interactions that are consistently associated with high yield.

2. **Lift**:
   - The current train lift is 1.179, which is a positive indicator as it is greater than 1, suggesting that the rules provide useful information beyond random chance. However, it is lower than the highest lift observed in previous iterations (e.g., 1.438, 1.406).
   - A higher lift indicates a stronger association between the rule conditions and the outcome. To increase lift, focus on identifying unique combinations of features that are not commonly found in the dataset but are strongly associated with high yield.

3. **Leverage**:
   - The current train leverage is 0.005, which is positive, indicating that the rules provide additional support beyond what would be expected by chance. However, it is lower than some previous iterations (e.g., 0.014, 0.011).
   - To improve leverage, consider exploring less frequent but highly impactful features that could increase the rule's support without being overly common in the dataset.

4. **Support**:
   - The current train support is 0.020, which is relatively low compared to previous iterations. This suggests that the rules apply to a smaller subset of the data.
   - While support is not the primary focus, ensuring that the rules are applicable to a reasonable portion of the dataset can help in generalizing the findings. Consider broadening the conditions slightly to capture more relevant cases without sacrificing confidence and lift.

**Suggestions for Improvement**:
- **Feature Exploration**: Conduct a deeper analysis of the dataset to identify additional features or interactions that could be incorporated into the rules. This might involve looking at less obvious structural features or considering the impact of combinations of features.
- **Rule Refinement**: Refine existing rules by testing different combinations of conditions to see if they lead to higher confidence and lift. This could involve adjusting the specificity of the conditions or exploring new hypotheses about what leads to high yield.
- **Data Segmentation**: Consider segmenting the data based on different characteristics (e.g., type of catalyst, reaction conditions) to see if more targeted rules can be developed for specific subsets of the data.
- **Iterative Testing**: Continue iterating on the rules, using the metrics as a guide to determine which changes lead to improvements. Focus on achieving a balance between confidence, lift, and support to ensure the rules are both reliable and applicable.

Overall, while the current rules show some promise, there is potential for further refinement to enhance their predictive power and applicability.

### Performance Evaluation of Current Rules

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
   - The current rules have shown mixed effectiveness. The validation accuracy has fluctuated significantly across iterations, with some models achieving as low as 0.4286 and others reaching 0.6286. This inconsistency suggests that the rules may not be robust across different datasets or may not capture all the necessary features for accurate predictions.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting:**
   - The variation in validation accuracy indicates potential overfitting or underfitting. Some rules might be too specific to certain data points, leading to overfitting, while others might be too general, resulting in underfitting. The consistent discrepancies between predicted and experimental values further highlight these issues.

3. **Discrepancies Analysis:**
   - For molecules where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low, rules with high positive SHAP values (e.g., Rule 8, Rule 9, Rule 11) are likely problematic. Conversely, for molecules where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, rules with high negative SHAP values (e.g., Rule 8, Rule 9) need adjustment.

4. **Accuracy Improvements:**
   - The accuracy metrics suggest that there is room for improvement. The highest validation accuracy achieved is 0.6286, which indicates that the current rules are not fully capturing the complexity of the data. Iterative refinement of the rules is necessary to improve accuracy.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**
   - SHAP analysis indicates that certain rules consistently contribute to incorrect predictions. For instance, Rule 8 and Rule 9 often have high SHAP values for incorrect predictions, suggesting these rules may need refinement. Additionally, rules with consistently low SHAP values for correct predictions might be underutilized and could be adjusted to enhance their impact.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Overestimated Loadings:**
   - Focus on refining rules like Rule 8 and Rule 9, which have high positive SHAP values for overestimated loadings. Consider incorporating additional features or conditions that could help differentiate between high and low loading scenarios more effectively.

2. **Adjust Underestimated Loadings:**
   - For rules with high negative SHAP values in underestimated loadings, such as Rule 8 and Rule 9, explore adding more context or modifying the conditions to better capture the factors leading to high experimental values.

3. **Improve Generalization:**
   - To address overfitting, consider simplifying overly complex rules or combining similar rules to reduce redundancy. For underfitting, explore adding new rules that capture missing interactions or features not currently considered.

4. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - Use insights from SHAP analysis to iteratively refine the rules. Focus on rules that consistently show high SHAP values for incorrect predictions and adjust them based on the patterns observed in the data.

5. **Incorporate Additional Features:**
   - Consider incorporating additional chemical features or interactions that might be relevant to the catalyst's performance. This could involve exploring new data sources or conducting further domain research to identify potential factors influencing the loading.

By implementing these recommendations, the rules can be refined to improve their predictive accuracy and robustness across different datasets. This iterative process will help in achieving a more reliable model for predicting the loading of modifiers on catalysts.

### Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimization

1. **Effectiveness and Performance Evaluation:**
   - The current rules show mixed effectiveness, with validation accuracy ranging from 0.4286 to 0.6286. This inconsistency suggests that the rules may not be robust across different datasets or may not capture all necessary features for accurate predictions.
   - The metrics indicate potential overfitting or underfitting, with some rules being too specific and others too general. Discrepancies between predicted and experimental values highlight these issues.

2. **SHAP Analysis Insights:**
   - Certain rules, such as Rule 8 and Rule 9, consistently contribute to incorrect predictions, as indicated by high SHAP values. These rules may need refinement to better capture the factors influencing the loading of modifiers on catalysts.

3. **Current Rule Metrics:**
   - The current train confidence is moderate, with room for improvement. The lift is positive, indicating some useful information, but it could be stronger. The leverage is positive but lower than some previous iterations, suggesting that the rules apply to a smaller subset of the data.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Overestimated and Underestimated Loadings:**
   - Focus on refining rules like Rule 8 and Rule 9, which have high SHAP values for incorrect predictions. Consider incorporating additional features or conditions to better differentiate between high and low loading scenarios.

2. **Improve Generalization:**
   - To address overfitting, simplify overly complex rules or combine similar rules to reduce redundancy. For underfitting, explore adding new rules that capture missing interactions or features not currently considered.

3. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - Use insights from SHAP analysis to iteratively refine the rules. Focus on rules that consistently show high SHAP values for incorrect predictions and adjust them based on observed patterns.

4. **Incorporate Additional Features:**
   - Consider incorporating additional chemical features or interactions that might be relevant to the catalyst's performance. This could involve exploring new data sources or conducting further domain research.

5. **SMARTS Pattern Adjustments:**
   - Refine SMARTS patterns for each rule to ensure they accurately capture the intended chemical structures and interactions. This includes ensuring stereochemistry, electron-withdrawing/donating groups, and specific functional groups are correctly identified.

### Possibility for Further Optimization

There is potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. By refining the rules based on SHAP analysis, adjusting SMARTS patterns, and incorporating additional features, the predictive accuracy and robustness of the model can be improved.

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: gpt-4o-2024-08-06
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with an aromatic ring and specific stereochemistry (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The stereochemistry and aromatic ring can enhance π-π interactions and stabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group adjacent to an aromatic ring, especially with electron-withdrawing substituents like nitro or bromo groups (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid), are associated with high yield. These substituents can enhance the reactivity of the catalyst through electron-withdrawing effects.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups in sugar-like structures, considering different stereoisomers (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), tend to lead to high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups facilitate hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group or thioether (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) are associated with high yield. The sulfur-containing groups contribute to electron-donating ability, enhancing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and additional electron-donating groups at ortho or para positions (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) generally result in high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially stabilizing the catalyst, especially when electron-donating groups are present.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a methoxy group adjacent to an aromatic ring, particularly when multiple methoxy groups are present and positioned ortho or para to each other (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), tend to result in high yield. The methoxy groups can donate electrons through resonance, potentially enhancing catalyst stability.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. The benzofuran ring can provide additional π-π interactions and electron delocalization, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a simple aliphatic chain and no additional functional groups (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of functional groups may limit interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a formyl group on an aromatic ring without any electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the formyl group may destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with an ether linkage combined with an electron-withdrawing group, especially when the ether linkage is extensive (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid), tend to result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing effect may reduce the catalyst's reactivity.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group without compensating electron-donating groups (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) are associated with low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing effect can destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on a long aliphatic chain (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The isolated hydroxy group may not sufficiently interact with the catalyst to enhance yield.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a methyl group on an aromatic ring without additional electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of significant electron-donating effects may limit catalyst stabilization.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on an aromatic ring and a formyl group (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing formyl group may counteract the potential stabilizing effect of the hydroxy group.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a pyridine ring in the same molecule, especially when no additional stabilizing groups are present (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid), tend to result in low yield. The combination of these groups may lead to competitive binding or destabilization of the catalyst.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: Refine Rule 8 and Rule 9 by incorporating additional features that may influence the yield. For instance, consider the potential impact of chain length or branching in aliphatic chains, or the presence of other functional groups that might interact with the catalyst.

- **Advice 2**: Simplify overly complex rules by merging similar rules where possible. For example, if multiple rules describe similar electron-withdrawing effects, consider combining them into a single, more general rule to improve generalization and reduce redundancy.

- **Advice 3**: Introduce new rules to capture interactions or features not currently considered. This could involve exploring the role of specific stereochemistry or additional functional groups that may enhance or inhibit catalyst performance.

- **Advice 4**: Adjust SMARTS patterns to ensure they accurately reflect the chemical structures and interactions intended by each rule. Pay particular attention to stereochemistry and the positioning of electron-withdrawing or donating groups.

- **Advice 5**: Use SHAP analysis to identify rules that consistently lead to incorrect predictions and refine them. Focus on understanding why these rules fail and adjust them to better capture the underlying chemistry.

- **Advice 6**: Consider incorporating additional chemical features such as molecular weight, polarity, or solubility, which might influence the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with an aromatic ring and specific stereochemistry (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The stereochemistry and aromatic ring can enhance π-π interactions and stabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group adjacent to an aromatic ring, especially with electron-withdrawing substituents like nitro or bromo groups (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid), are associated with high yield. These substituents can enhance the reactivity of the catalyst through electron-withdrawing effects.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups in sugar-like structures, considering different stereoisomers (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), tend to lead to high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups facilitate hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group or thioether (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) are associated with high yield. The sulfur-containing groups contribute to electron-donating ability, enhancing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and additional electron-donating groups at ortho or para positions (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) generally result in high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially stabilizing the catalyst, especially when electron-donating groups are present.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a methoxy group adjacent to an aromatic ring, particularly when multiple methoxy groups are present and positioned ortho or para to each other (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), tend to result in high yield. The methoxy groups can donate electrons through resonance, potentially enhancing catalyst stability.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. The benzofuran ring can provide additional π-π interactions and electron delocalization, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a simple aliphatic chain and no additional functional groups (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of functional groups may limit interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a formyl group on an aromatic ring without any electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the formyl group may destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with an ether linkage combined with an electron-withdrawing group, especially when the ether linkage is extensive (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid), tend to result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing effect may reduce the catalyst's reactivity.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group without compensating electron-donating groups (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) are associated with low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing effect can destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on a long aliphatic chain (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The isolated hydroxy group may not sufficiently interact with the catalyst to enhance yield.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a methyl group on an aromatic ring without additional electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of significant electron-donating effects may limit catalyst stabilization.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on an aromatic ring and a formyl group (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing formyl group may counteract the potential stabilizing effect of the hydroxy group.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a pyridine ring in the same molecule, especially when no additional stabilizing groups are present (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid), tend to result in low yield. The combination of these groups may lead to competitive binding or destabilization of the catalyst.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with an aromatic ring and specific stereochemistry (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The stereochemistry and aromatic ring can enhance π-π interactions and stabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group adjacent to an aromatic ring, especially with electron-withdrawing substituents like nitro or bromo groups (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid), are associated with high yield. These substituents can enhance the reactivity of the catalyst through electron-withdrawing effects.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups in sugar-like structures, considering different stereoisomers (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), tend to lead to high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups facilitate hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group or thioether (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) are associated with high yield. The sulfur-containing groups contribute to electron-donating ability, enhancing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and additional electron-donating groups at ortho or para positions (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) generally result in high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially stabilizing the catalyst, especially when electron-donating groups are present.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a methoxy group adjacent to an aromatic ring, particularly when multiple methoxy groups are present and positioned ortho or para to each other (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), tend to result in high yield. The methoxy groups can donate electrons through resonance, potentially enhancing catalyst stability.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. The benzofuran ring can provide additional π-π interactions and electron delocalization, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a simple aliphatic chain and no additional functional groups (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of functional groups may limit interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a formyl group on an aromatic ring without any electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the formyl group may destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with an ether linkage combined with an electron-withdrawing group, especially when the ether linkage is extensive (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid), tend to result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing effect may reduce the catalyst's reactivity.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group without compensating electron-donating groups (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) are associated with low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing effect can destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on a long aliphatic chain (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The isolated hydroxy group may not sufficiently interact with the catalyst to enhance yield.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a methyl group on an aromatic ring without additional electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of significant electron-donating effects may limit catalyst stabilization.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on an aromatic ring and a formyl group (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing formyl group may counteract the potential stabilizing effect of the hydroxy group.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a pyridine ring in the same molecule, especially when no additional stabilizing groups are present (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid), tend to result in low yield. The combination of these groups may lead to competitive binding or destabilization of the catalyst.

** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern '[C@H](N)[c]' may not fully capture the requirement of an aromatic ring and specific stereochemistry. Consider using a more comprehensive SMARTS pattern that includes both aromaticity and stereochemistry, such as '[C@H](N)[c;R]'.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Rule 2's SMARTS pattern '[c][CX3](=[OX1])[OX2H][#7,#8,#9,#17]' seems to be incorrect. The rule specifies a carboxylic acid group adjacent to an aromatic ring with electron-withdrawing groups. A more accurate SMARTS pattern might be '[c][CX3](=[OX1])[OX2H]' with additional patterns for electron-withdrawing groups like '[c][CX3](=[OX1])[OX2H][N+](=O)[O-]' for nitro groups.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: Rule 3's SMARTS pattern '[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)' may not fully capture the sugar-like structure with multiple hydroxyl groups. Consider using a pattern that includes multiple hydroxyl groups in a cyclic structure, such as '[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)'.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: For Rule 4, the SMARTS patterns for sulfanyl groups or thioethers may need refinement. The current patterns may not capture all possible thioether structures. Consider using '[SX2][CX4]' for thioethers and '[SX2H]' for sulfanyl groups.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: Rule 5's SMARTS pattern '[n][c][OX2H]' may not accurately capture pyridine rings with electron-donating groups. Consider using a pattern like '[n][c][c][c][c][c]' with additional patterns for electron-donating groups such as '[n][c][c][c][c][c][OH]'.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Rule 6's SMARTS pattern '[c][OCH3][c][OCH3]' may not fully capture the requirement of methoxy groups adjacent to an aromatic ring. Consider using a pattern like '[c][OCH3][c][OCH3]' with additional constraints for ortho or para positions.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: Rule 7's SMARTS pattern '[c]1oc2ccccc2c1' may not fully capture the benzofuran structure. Consider using a more specific pattern like '[c]1oc2ccccc2c1' with additional constraints for the benzofuran structure.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Rule 8's SMARTS pattern '[CX4][CX4][CX4]' may not accurately capture simple aliphatic chains. Consider using a pattern like '[CX4][CX4][CX4]' with additional constraints for the absence of functional groups.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: Rule 9's SMARTS pattern '[c][CX3H]=[OX1]' may not fully capture the formyl group on an aromatic ring. Consider using a pattern like '[c][CX3H]=[OX1]' with additional constraints for the absence of electron-donating groups.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Rule 10's SMARTS pattern '[OX2][CX4][OX2][CX4][OX2][#7,#8,#9,#17]' may not accurately capture ether linkages with electron-withdrawing groups. Consider using a pattern like '[OX2][CX4][OX2][CX4][OX2]' with additional patterns for electron-withdrawing groups.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: Rule 11's SMARTS pattern '[CX4](F)(F)F' may not fully capture trifluoromethyl groups without compensating electron-donating groups. Consider using a pattern like '[CX4](F)(F)F' with additional constraints for the absence of electron-donating groups.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: Rule 12's SMARTS pattern '[OX2H][CX4][CX4]' may not accurately capture hydroxy groups on long aliphatic chains. Consider using a pattern like '[OX2H][CX4][CX4]' with additional constraints for chain length.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: Rule 13's SMARTS pattern '[c][CX4H3]' may not fully capture methyl groups on aromatic rings. Consider using a pattern like '[c][CX4H3]' with additional constraints for the absence of electron-donating groups.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: Rule 14's SMARTS pattern '[c][OX2H][CX3H]=[OX1]' may not accurately capture hydroxy and formyl groups on aromatic rings. Consider using a pattern like '[c][OX2H][CX3H]=[OX1]' with additional constraints for the absence of electron-donating groups.

- ** Suggestion 15 **: Rule 15's SMARTS pattern '[n][c][CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])[OX2H]' may not fully capture carboxylic acid and pyridine rings. Consider using a pattern like '[n][c][CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])[OX2H]' with additional constraints for the absence of stabilizing groups.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern '[C@H](N)[c;R]' may not fully capture the requirement of an aromatic ring with specific stereochemistry. Consider using a more specific pattern that includes the aromatic ring and stereochemistry explicitly, such as '[C@H](N)[c]1[cH][cH][cH][cH][cH]1'.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Rule 2's SMARTS patterns should be revised to ensure they capture the presence of electron-withdrawing groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid. The current patterns may not fully capture the electron-withdrawing substituents like nitro or bromo groups. Consider adding specific patterns for these groups, such as '[c][CX3](=[OX1])[OX2H][N+](=O)[O-]' and '[c][CX3](=[OX1])[OX2H][Br]'.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For Rule 3, the SMARTS pattern '[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)' may not be flexible enough to capture all sugar-like structures. Consider using a more general pattern that allows for different stereoisomers and sugar configurations, such as '[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)'.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Rule 4's SMARTS patterns '[SX2H]' and '[SX2][CX4]' may not fully capture the presence of sulfanyl groups or thioethers. Consider using more specific patterns that account for different sulfur-containing groups, such as '[SX2H][CX4]' and '[SX2][CX4][CX4]'.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: For Rule 5, the SMARTS pattern '[n][c][c][c][c][c]' may not fully capture the presence of electron-donating groups on the pyridine ring. Consider using a pattern that includes these groups explicitly, such as '[n][c][c][c][c][c][OH]' or '[n][c][c][c][c][c][NH2]'.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Rule 6's SMARTS pattern '[c][OCH3][c][OCH3]' may not fully capture the presence of methoxy groups adjacent to an aromatic ring. Consider using a pattern that allows for different positions of methoxy groups, such as '[c][OCH3][c][OCH3]' or '[c][OCH3][c][OCH3][c]'.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: For Rule 7, the SMARTS pattern '[c]1oc2ccccc2c1' may not fully capture the benzofuran structure. Consider using a more specific pattern that includes the benzofuran ring explicitly, such as '[c]1oc2ccccc2c1'.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Rule 8's SMARTS pattern '[CX4][CX4][CX4]' may not fully capture the presence of a simple aliphatic chain. Consider using a more general pattern that allows for different chain lengths, such as '[CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4]'.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: For Rule 9, the SMARTS pattern '[c][CX3H]=[OX1]' may not fully capture the presence of a formyl group on an aromatic ring. Consider using a more specific pattern that includes the aromatic ring explicitly, such as '[c][CX3H]=[OX1][c]'.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Rule 10's SMARTS pattern '[OX2][CX4][OX2][CX4][OX2]' may not fully capture the presence of an ether linkage with an electron-withdrawing group. Consider using a more specific pattern that includes these groups explicitly, such as '[OX2][CX4][OX2][CX4][OX2][N+](=O)[O-]'.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: For Rule 11, the SMARTS pattern '[CX4](F)(F)F' may not fully capture the presence of a trifluoromethyl group. Consider using a more specific pattern that includes the trifluoromethyl group explicitly, such as '[CX4](F)(F)F'.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: Rule 12's SMARTS pattern '[OX2H][CX4][CX4]' may not fully capture the presence of a hydroxy group on a long aliphatic chain. Consider using a more specific pattern that includes the chain length explicitly, such as '[OX2H][CX4][CX4][CX4]'.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: For Rule 13, the SMARTS pattern '[c][CX4H3]' may not fully capture the presence of a methyl group on an aromatic ring. Consider using a more specific pattern that includes the aromatic ring explicitly, such as '[c][CX4H3][c]'.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: Rule 14's SMARTS pattern '[c][OX2H][CX3H]=[OX1]' may not fully capture the presence of a hydroxy and formyl group on an aromatic ring. Consider using a more specific pattern that includes the aromatic ring explicitly, such as '[c][OX2H][CX3H]=[OX1][c]'.

- ** Suggestion 15 **: For Rule 15, the SMARTS pattern '[n][c][CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])[OX2H]' may not fully capture the presence of a carboxylic acid and pyridine ring. Consider using a more specific pattern that includes these groups explicitly, such as '[n][c][CX3;$([R0][#6]),$([H1R0])](=[OX1])[OX2H][c]'.

Metric Commenter Message:
Based on the current metrics and comparing them to the reference metrics, we can make several observations about the performance of the current rules:

1. **Confidence**: The current train confidence is 0.6248, which is relatively high and indicates that the rules are fairly reliable in predicting the outcome. This is an improvement over some of the previous iterations, where confidence values were lower (e.g., 0.5321, 0.5758). However, it is slightly lower than the highest confidence observed in previous iterations (e.g., 0.7156, 0.7043). This suggests that while the current rules are performing well, there might still be room for improvement in terms of reliability.

2. **Lift**: The current train lift is 1.2392, which is a positive indicator as it is greater than 1. This suggests that the rules are providing useful information beyond what would be expected by chance. The lift is higher than some previous iterations (e.g., 1.0628, 1.0917) but lower than the highest lift observed (e.g., 1.4389, 1.4061). This indicates that the current rules are effective but could potentially be optimized further to increase their impact.

3. **Leverage**: The current train leverage is 0.0052, which is positive and indicates that the rules are providing additional support beyond what would be expected by chance. This is consistent with previous iterations, where leverage values were also positive, though some were higher (e.g., 0.0144, 0.0147). This suggests that while the rules are contributing positively, there might be opportunities to enhance their strength.

4. **Support**: The current train support is 0.0267, which is relatively low compared to some previous iterations (e.g., 0.1219, 0.0623). This indicates that the rules apply to a smaller portion of the dataset, which might limit their generalizability.

**Recommendations for Improvement**:
- **Refine Rule Conditions**: Consider refining the conditions of the rules to increase their applicability and support. This could involve identifying additional features or interactions that are common among high-yield outcomes.
- **Explore Additional Features**: Investigate other chemical or structural features that might contribute to high yield, potentially leading to the discovery of new rules with higher confidence and lift.
- **Optimize Existing Rules**: Analyze the existing rules to identify any redundancies or overlaps that could be streamlined to improve overall performance.
- **Balance Complexity and Generalizability**: Ensure that the rules are not overly complex, which might limit their applicability, while still capturing the key factors that contribute to high yield.

Overall, the current rules are performing well, but there is potential for further optimization to enhance their confidence, lift, and leverage, thereby improving their predictive power and applicability.

### Performance Evaluation of Current Rules

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
   - The current rules have shown some effectiveness, as indicated by the validation accuracy of 0.6. However, this is a decrease from previous accuracies, which were consistently around 0.6285714285714286. This suggests that the rules may not be capturing the underlying patterns as effectively as before.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment:**
   - The fluctuation in validation accuracy suggests potential overfitting or underfitting. The consistent validation accuracy of 0.6285714285714286 in previous iterations indicates that the model might have been overfitting to specific patterns in the data. The current accuracy of 0.6 suggests a potential shift towards underfitting, where the model is not capturing enough complexity.

3. **Discrepancies Analysis:**
   - For molecules where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low, rules with high positive SHAP values (e.g., Rule9, Rule11, Rule13) might be problematic. Conversely, for molecules where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, rules with high negative SHAP values (e.g., Rule9, Rule11) might need adjustment.

4. **Accuracy Improvements Interpretation:**
   - The decrease in accuracy from previous iterations suggests that the current rules may not be as effective in capturing the necessary features for accurate predictions. This indicates a need for refinement and potential introduction of new rules or modification of existing ones.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**
   - SHAP analysis indicates that certain rules (e.g., Rule9, Rule11, Rule13) consistently contribute to high predicted loadings, even when experimental values are low. This suggests these rules may be overemphasizing certain features, leading to overestimation. Conversely, rules with negative SHAP values for underestimated loadings may not be capturing important features, leading to underestimation.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Overestimated Loading Rules:**
   - Rules with high positive SHAP values for overestimated loadings, such as Rule9, Rule11, and Rule13, should be refined. Consider adjusting the conditions or thresholds within these rules to better align with experimental data.

2. **Adjust Underestimated Loading Rules:**
   - Rules with high negative SHAP values for underestimated loadings should be adjusted. This may involve incorporating additional features or modifying existing conditions to capture the necessary complexity.

3. **Improve Generalization:**
   - To address potential overfitting or underfitting, consider introducing new rules that capture additional chemical features or interactions not currently accounted for. This could involve exploring new chemical groups or structural motifs that may influence catalyst loading.

4. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - Use insights from SHAP analysis to iteratively refine the rules. This involves testing small modifications to rules and evaluating their impact on validation accuracy and SHAP values. Continuous iteration and evaluation will help in converging towards more effective rules.

5. **Incorporate Additional Data:**
   - If possible, incorporate additional data or features that may provide more context or information about the chemical interactions influencing catalyst loading. This could help in developing more comprehensive rules that generalize better across different datasets.

### Summary and Directions for Optimization

1. **Effectiveness and Performance:**
   - The current rules have shown moderate effectiveness with a validation accuracy of 0.6, which is slightly lower than previous iterations. This suggests that the rules may not be capturing the underlying patterns as effectively as before.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting:**
   - The fluctuation in validation accuracy suggests potential overfitting or underfitting. The consistent validation accuracy of 0.6285714285714286 in previous iterations indicates that the model might have been overfitting to specific patterns in the data. The current accuracy of 0.6 suggests a potential shift towards underfitting, where the model is not capturing enough complexity.

   - If possible, incorporate additional data or features that may provide more context or information about the chemical interactions influencing catalyst loading. This could help in developing more comprehensive rules that generalize better across different datasets.

### Possibility for Further Optimization

There is potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. The current rules show room for improvement in terms of confidence, lift, and leverage, indicating that refining the rules could enhance their predictive power and applicability. By carefully adjusting the rules and incorporating additional features, it is possible to achieve better generalization and accuracy.

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: gpt-4o-2024-08-06
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with an aromatic ring and specific stereochemistry (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The stereochemistry and aromatic ring can enhance π-π interactions and stabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group adjacent to an aromatic ring, especially with electron-withdrawing substituents like nitro or bromo groups (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid), are associated with high yield. These substituents can enhance the reactivity of the catalyst through electron-withdrawing effects.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups in sugar-like structures, considering different stereoisomers (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), tend to lead to high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups facilitate hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group or thioether (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) are associated with high yield. The sulfur-containing groups contribute to electron-donating ability, enhancing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and additional electron-donating groups at ortho or para positions (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) generally result in high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially stabilizing the catalyst, especially when electron-donating groups are present.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a methoxy group adjacent to an aromatic ring, particularly when multiple methoxy groups are present and positioned ortho or para to each other (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), tend to result in high yield. The methoxy groups can donate electrons through resonance, potentially enhancing catalyst stability.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. The benzofuran ring can provide additional π-π interactions and electron delocalization, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a simple aliphatic chain and no additional functional groups (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of functional groups may limit interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a formyl group on an aromatic ring without any electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the formyl group may destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with an ether linkage combined with an electron-withdrawing group, especially when the ether linkage is extensive (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid), tend to result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing effect may reduce the catalyst's reactivity.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group without compensating electron-donating groups (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) are associated with low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing effect can destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on a long aliphatic chain (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The isolated hydroxy group may not sufficiently interact with the catalyst to enhance yield.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a methyl group on an aromatic ring without additional electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of significant electron-donating effects may limit catalyst stabilization.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on an aromatic ring and a formyl group (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing formyl group may counteract the potential stabilizing effect of the hydroxy group.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a pyridine ring in the same molecule, especially when no additional stabilizing groups are present (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid), tend to result in low yield. The combination of these groups may lead to competitive binding or destabilization of the catalyst.

- **Advice 1**: Refine Rule 9 by incorporating additional structural features that may counteract the electron-withdrawing effect of the formyl group. Consider adding conditions for the presence of electron-donating groups that could stabilize the catalyst.

- **Advice 2**: Modify Rule 11 to account for potential stabilizing interactions that might mitigate the destabilizing effect of the trifluoromethyl group. This could involve identifying specific structural motifs or additional functional groups that enhance catalyst stability.

- **Advice 3**: Adjust Rule 13 by exploring the impact of other substituents on the aromatic ring that could provide electron-donating effects. This might involve specifying conditions for additional groups that enhance π-π interactions or electron delocalization.

- **Advice 4**: Introduce new rules that capture interactions not currently considered, such as the role of heteroatoms or specific ring structures that could influence catalyst performance. This could involve analyzing the dataset for common features among high-yield modifiers not covered by existing rules.

- **Advice 5**: Use SHAP analysis to iteratively test and refine rules, focusing on those with high positive or negative SHAP values. This involves making small adjustments to rule conditions and evaluating their impact on model performance and SHAP values.

- **Advice 6**: Consider incorporating additional data or features that provide more context on chemical interactions, such as solvent effects or temperature variations, which could influence catalyst loading and yield.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups in sugar-like structures, considering different stereoisomers (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), tend to lead to high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups facilitate hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group or thioether (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) are associated with high yield. The sulfur-containing groups contribute to electron-donating ability, enhancing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and additional electron-donating groups at ortho or para positions (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) generally result in high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially stabilizing the catalyst, especially when electron-donating groups are present.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a methoxy group adjacent to an aromatic ring, particularly when multiple methoxy groups are present and positioned ortho or para to each other (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), tend to result in high yield. The methoxy groups can donate electrons through resonance, potentially enhancing catalyst stability.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. The benzofuran ring can provide additional π-π interactions and electron delocalization, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a simple aliphatic chain and no additional functional groups (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of functional groups may limit interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a formyl group on an aromatic ring without any electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the formyl group may destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with an ether linkage combined with an electron-withdrawing group, especially when the ether linkage is extensive (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid), tend to result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing effect may reduce the catalyst's reactivity.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group without compensating electron-donating groups (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) are associated with low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing effect can destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on a long aliphatic chain (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The isolated hydroxy group may not sufficiently interact with the catalyst to enhance yield.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a methyl group on an aromatic ring without additional electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of significant electron-donating effects may limit catalyst stabilization.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on an aromatic ring and a formyl group (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing formyl group may counteract the potential stabilizing effect of the hydroxy group.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a pyridine ring in the same molecule, especially when no additional stabilizing groups are present (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid), tend to result in low yield. The combination of these groups may lead to competitive binding or destabilization of the catalyst.

** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern `['[NX3;$([N][c])]', '[c]']` does not accurately capture the requirement for an aromatic amine with specific stereochemistry. The rule should include stereochemistry, possibly using chiral centers in the SMARTS pattern.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Rule 2's SMARTS pattern `['[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]', '[c]', '[$([Br]),$([N+](=O)[O-])]']` should be revised to ensure it captures the carboxylic acid group adjacent to an aromatic ring with electron-withdrawing substituents. Consider using a pattern that specifies adjacency and the presence of an aromatic ring.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: Rule 3's SMARTS pattern `['[OX2H]', '[OX2H]', '[OX2H]', '[OX2H]', '[OX2H]']` should be modified to ensure it captures sugar-like structures with multiple hydroxyl groups. Consider using a pattern that specifies a sugar backbone or ring structure.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Rule 4's SMARTS pattern `['[SX2H]', '[SX2]']` should be checked to ensure it captures both sulfanyl groups and thioethers. Consider using a more specific pattern for thioethers.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: Rule 5's SMARTS pattern `['[n]1ccccc1', '[OX2H]', '[OX2H]']` should be revised to capture pyridine rings with electron-donating groups at ortho or para positions. The current pattern may not accurately reflect the position of substituents.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Rule 6's SMARTS pattern `['[c][OX2H]', '[c][OX2H]']` should be revised to capture methoxy groups on an aromatic ring, especially when positioned ortho or para to each other. Consider using a pattern that specifies the position of methoxy groups.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: Rule 7's SMARTS pattern `['c1oc2ccccc2c1']` should be checked to ensure it captures benzofuran structures accurately. The pattern seems correct, but ensure it matches the intended structure.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Rule 8's SMARTS pattern `['[CX4][CX4][CX4]']` should be revised to capture simple aliphatic chains without additional functional groups. Consider using a pattern that specifies the absence of functional groups.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: Rule 9's SMARTS pattern `['[c][CX3H]=O']` should be checked to ensure it captures formyl groups on aromatic rings without electron-donating groups. The pattern seems correct, but ensure it matches the intended structure.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Rule 10's SMARTS pattern `['[OX2][CX4][OX2]', '[$([F]),$([Cl]),$([Br]),$([I])]']` should be revised to capture ether linkages with electron-withdrawing groups. Consider using a pattern that specifies the presence of an extensive ether linkage.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: Rule 11's SMARTS pattern `['[CX4](F)(F)F']` should be checked to ensure it captures trifluoromethyl groups accurately. The pattern seems correct, but ensure it matches the intended structure.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: Rule 12's SMARTS pattern `['[CX4][OX2H]']` should be revised to capture hydroxy groups on long aliphatic chains. Consider using a pattern that specifies the length of the aliphatic chain.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: Rule 13's SMARTS pattern `['[c][CH3]']` should be checked to ensure it captures methyl groups on aromatic rings without additional electron-donating groups. The pattern seems correct, but ensure it matches the intended structure.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: Rule 14's SMARTS pattern `['[c][OX2H]', '[c][CX3H]=O']` should be revised to capture hydroxy and formyl groups on aromatic rings. Consider using a pattern that specifies the position of these groups.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with an aromatic ring and specific stereochemistry (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The stereochemistry and aromatic ring can enhance π-π interactions and stabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group adjacent to an aromatic ring, especially with electron-withdrawing substituents like nitro or bromo groups (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid), are associated with high yield. These substituents can enhance the reactivity of the catalyst through electron-withdrawing effects.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups in sugar-like structures, considering different stereoisomers (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), tend to lead to high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups facilitate hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group or thioether (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) are associated with high yield. The sulfur-containing groups contribute to electron-donating ability, enhancing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and additional electron-donating groups at ortho or para positions (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) generally result in high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially stabilizing the catalyst, especially when electron-donating groups are present.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a methoxy group adjacent to an aromatic ring, particularly when multiple methoxy groups are present and positioned ortho or para to each other (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), tend to result in high yield. The methoxy groups can donate electrons through resonance, potentially enhancing catalyst stability.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. The benzofuran ring can provide additional π-π interactions and electron delocalization, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a simple aliphatic chain and no additional functional groups (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of functional groups may limit interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a formyl group on an aromatic ring without any electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the formyl group may destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with an ether linkage combined with an electron-withdrawing group, especially when the ether linkage is extensive (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid), tend to result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing effect may reduce the catalyst's reactivity.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group without compensating electron-donating groups (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) are associated with low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing effect can destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on a long aliphatic chain (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The isolated hydroxy group may not sufficiently interact with the catalyst to enhance yield.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a methyl group on an aromatic ring without additional electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of significant electron-donating effects may limit catalyst stabilization.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on an aromatic ring and a formyl group (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing formyl group may counteract the potential stabilizing effect of the hydroxy group.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a pyridine ring in the same molecule, especially when no additional stabilizing groups are present (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid), tend to result in low yield. The combination of these groups may lead to competitive binding or destabilization of the catalyst.

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern '[NX3;$([N][c])]' does not accurately capture the requirement for specific stereochemistry and aromatic amine. Consider using a more specific SMARTS pattern that includes stereochemistry and aromatic ring features.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Rule 2's SMARTS pattern '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]', '[c]', '[$([Br]),$([N+](=O)[O-])]' should be revised to ensure it captures the carboxylic acid group adjacent to an aromatic ring with electron-withdrawing substituents. The current pattern may not fully capture the adjacency requirement.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: Rule 3's SMARTS pattern '[OX2H]', '[OX2H]', '[OX2H]', '[OX2H]', '[OX2H]' should be modified to better represent sugar-like structures with multiple hydroxyl groups. Consider using a pattern that captures the cyclic nature and stereochemistry of sugars.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: For Rule 4, the SMARTS pattern '[SX2H]', '[SX2]' may not fully capture the presence of a sulfanyl group or thioether. Ensure the pattern is specific enough to distinguish these groups from other sulfur-containing functionalities.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: Rule 5's SMARTS pattern '[n]1ccccc1', '[OX2H]', '[OX2H]' does not accurately reflect the requirement for a pyridine ring with electron-donating groups at ortho or para positions. Consider revising the pattern to include positional specificity for electron-donating groups.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Rule 6's SMARTS pattern '[c][OX2H]', '[c][OX2H]' should be revised to accurately capture methoxy groups on an aromatic ring, particularly when multiple methoxy groups are present and positioned ortho or para to each other.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: For Rule 7, the SMARTS pattern 'c1oc2ccccc2c1' should be checked to ensure it accurately captures the benzofuran structure. Verify that the pattern matches the intended structure without false positives.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Rule 8's SMARTS pattern '[CX4][CX4][CX4]' may not accurately capture simple aliphatic chains. Consider using a more general pattern that captures aliphatic chains without additional functional groups.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: Rule 9's SMARTS pattern '[c][CX3H]=O' should be checked to ensure it captures formyl groups on aromatic rings without electron-donating groups. Verify the pattern's specificity.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Rule 10's SMARTS pattern '[OX2][CX4][OX2]', '[$([F]),$([Cl]),$([Br]),$([I])]' should be revised to accurately capture ether linkages with electron-withdrawing groups, especially when the ether linkage is extensive.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: Rule 11's SMARTS pattern '[CX4](F)(F)F' should be checked to ensure it accurately captures trifluoromethyl groups without compensating electron-donating groups.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: Rule 12's SMARTS pattern '[CX4][OX2H]' may not fully capture hydroxy groups on long aliphatic chains. Consider using a pattern that captures the chain length and isolated nature of the hydroxy group.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: Rule 13's SMARTS pattern '[c][CH3]' should be checked to ensure it captures methyl groups on aromatic rings without additional electron-donating groups.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: Rule 14's SMARTS pattern '[c][OX2H]', '[c][CX3H]=O' should be revised to accurately capture hydroxy and formyl groups on aromatic rings, ensuring the pattern reflects the intended structure.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with an aromatic ring and specific stereochemistry (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The stereochemistry and aromatic ring can enhance π-π interactions and stabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group adjacent to an aromatic ring, especially with electron-withdrawing substituents like nitro or bromo groups (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid), are associated with high yield. These substituents can enhance the reactivity of the catalyst through electron-withdrawing effects.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups in sugar-like structures, considering different stereoisomers (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), tend to lead to high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups facilitate hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group or thioether (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) are associated with high yield. The sulfur-containing groups contribute to electron-donating ability, enhancing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and additional electron-donating groups at ortho or para positions (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) generally result in high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially stabilizing the catalyst, especially when electron-donating groups are present.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a methoxy group adjacent to an aromatic ring, particularly when multiple methoxy groups are present and positioned ortho or para to each other (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), tend to result in high yield. The methoxy groups can donate electrons through resonance, potentially enhancing catalyst stability.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. The benzofuran ring can provide additional π-π interactions and electron delocalization, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a simple aliphatic chain and no additional functional groups (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of functional groups may limit interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a formyl group on an aromatic ring without any electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the formyl group may destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with an ether linkage combined with an electron-withdrawing group, especially when the ether linkage is extensive (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid), tend to result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing effect may reduce the catalyst's reactivity.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group without compensating electron-donating groups (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) are associated with low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing effect can destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on a long aliphatic chain (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The isolated hydroxy group may not sufficiently interact with the catalyst to enhance yield.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a methyl group on an aromatic ring without additional electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of significant electron-donating effects may limit catalyst stabilization.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on an aromatic ring and a formyl group (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing formyl group may counteract the potential stabilizing effect of the hydroxy group.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a pyridine ring in the same molecule, especially when no additional stabilizing groups are present (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid), tend to result in low yield. The combination of these groups may lead to competitive binding or destabilization of the catalyst.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Rule 6's pattern '[c][OX2H]', '[c][OX2H]' should be revised to ensure it captures the adjacency and positioning of methoxy groups on the aromatic ring. Consider using a pattern that specifies the ortho or para positions.
- ** Suggestion 7 **: Rule 7's pattern 'c1oc2ccccc2c1' should be checked to ensure it captures the benzofuran structure accurately. Consider using a pattern that specifies the entire benzofuran structure.
- ** Suggestion 8 **: Rule 8's pattern '[CX4][CX4][CX4]' should be revised to ensure it captures simple aliphatic chains without additional functional groups. Consider using a pattern that specifies the absence of functional groups.
- ** Suggestion 9 **: Rule 9's pattern '[c][CX3H]=O' should be checked to ensure it captures the formyl group on an aromatic ring without electron-donating groups. Consider using a pattern that specifies the absence of electron-donating groups.
- ** Suggestion 10 **: Rule 10's pattern '[OX2][CX4][OX2]', '[$([F]),$([Cl]),$([Br]),$([I])]' should be revised to ensure it captures ether linkages with electron-withdrawing groups. Consider using a pattern that specifies the extensive nature of the ether linkage.
- ** Suggestion 11 **: Rule 11's pattern '[CX4](F)(F)F' should be checked to ensure it captures trifluoromethyl groups without compensating electron-donating groups. Consider using a pattern that specifies the absence of electron-donating groups.
- ** Suggestion 12 **: Rule 12's pattern '[CX4][OX2H]' should be revised to ensure it captures hydroxy groups on long aliphatic chains. Consider using a pattern that specifies the length of the aliphatic chain.
- ** Suggestion 13 **: Rule 13's pattern '[c][CH3]' should be checked to ensure it captures methyl groups on aromatic rings without additional electron-donating groups. Consider using a pattern that specifies the absence of electron-donating groups.
- ** Suggestion 14 **: Rule 14's pattern '[c][OX2H]', '[c][CX3H]=O' should be revised to ensure it captures hydroxy and formyl groups on aromatic rings. Consider using a pattern that specifies the position of these groups relative to each other.
- ** Suggestion 15 **: Rule 15's pattern '[n]1ccccc1', '[CX3](=O)[OX2H]' should be checked to ensure it captures carboxylic acid and pyridine rings in the same molecule without additional stabilizing groups. Consider using a pattern that specifies the absence of stabilizing groups.

Metric Commenter Message:
Based on the current rule metrics and comparing them to the previous reference metrics, we can make several observations regarding the performance of the current rules:

1. **Confidence**: The current train confidence is 0.6738, which is a significant improvement over the previous test confidence values of 0.3333 and 0.4639. This indicates that the current rules are more reliable in predicting the outcome when the conditions are met. The increase in confidence suggests that the rules are becoming more precise in identifying the conditions that lead to the desired outcome.

2. **Lift**: The current train lift is 1.3443, which is a notable improvement from the previous test lift values of 0.6889 and 0.9137. A lift greater than 1 indicates that the rule is useful and that the presence of the condition increases the likelihood of the outcome. The current lift value suggests that the rules are effectively identifying conditions that significantly impact the outcome, making them more interesting and valuable.

3. **Leverage**: The current train leverage is 0.0073, which is a positive value, indicating that the rules are providing additional support beyond what would be expected by chance. This is an improvement over the previous test leverage values of -0.0313 and -0.0339, which were negative and suggested weaker associations. The positive leverage indicates that the rules are capturing meaningful relationships in the data.

4. **Support**: The current train support is 0.0781, which is higher than some of the previous train support values (e.g., 0.0413, 0.0389). While support is not the primary focus, a higher support value indicates that the rules apply to a larger portion of the dataset, which can be beneficial for generalizability.

**Recommendations for Improvement**:
- **Refinement of Rules**: Continue refining the rules to further increase confidence and lift. Focus on identifying additional conditions or modifying existing ones to enhance the predictive power of the rules.
- **Balancing Complexity and Generalizability**: Ensure that the rules are not overly complex, which could lead to overfitting. Aim for a balance where the rules are specific enough to capture meaningful patterns but general enough to apply to new data.
- **Exploration of New Features**: Consider exploring additional features or interactions that may not have been previously considered. This could involve looking at combinations of modifiers or considering external factors that may influence the outcome.
- **Validation on Test Data**: While the current metrics are based on training data, it is crucial to validate the rules on a separate test dataset to ensure that the improvements are not due to overfitting and that they generalize well to unseen data.

Overall, the current iteration shows promising improvements in confidence and lift, indicating that the rules are becoming more effective. However, continued refinement and validation are necessary to ensure robust and generalizable results.

### Performance Evaluation of Current Rules

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
   - The current rules seem to be struggling with effectiveness, as indicated by the validation accuracy of 0.4571, which is significantly lower than the previous reference accuracies (0.76). This suggests that the rules may not be capturing the underlying patterns in the data effectively.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment:**
   - The consistent low validation accuracy across iterations suggests potential underfitting. The model may not be complex enough or the rules may not be capturing the necessary features to differentiate between high and low loading effectively.

3. **Discrepancies Analysis:**
   - For molecules where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low, rules with high positive SHAP values (e.g., Rule 9 and Rule 11) are likely problematic. These rules may be overestimating the contribution of certain features.
   - Conversely, for molecules where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, rules with high negative SHAP values (e.g., Rule 8 and Rule 6) may be underestimating the contribution of certain features.

4. **Accuracy Improvements:**
   - The current accuracy metrics suggest limited improvement potential with the existing rules. The model's performance has not shown significant improvement across iterations, indicating that the rules may need substantial refinement or re-evaluation.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**
   - SHAP analysis indicates that certain rules (e.g., Rule 9 and Rule 11) consistently contribute to overestimated loadings, while others (e.g., Rule 8 and Rule 6) contribute to underestimated loadings. This suggests a need to refine these rules to better capture the true impact of the features they represent.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Overestimated Loading Rules:**
   - Re-evaluate and refine rules with high positive SHAP values for overestimated loadings, such as Rule 9 and Rule 11. Consider incorporating additional features or modifying the conditions under which these rules apply to better align with experimental outcomes.

2. **Adjust Underestimated Loading Rules:**
   - Modify rules with high negative SHAP values for underestimated loadings, such as Rule 8 and Rule 6. Explore additional interactions or features that may enhance the predictive power of these rules.

3. **Improve Generalization:**
   - To address potential underfitting, consider increasing the complexity of the model or incorporating additional features that may capture more nuanced patterns in the data. This could involve exploring new chemical properties or interactions not currently covered by the rules.

4. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - Use insights from SHAP analysis to iteratively refine the rules. Focus on rules that consistently show high SHAP values (positive or negative) and explore ways to adjust them to better reflect the experimental data.

5. **Incorporate Domain Knowledge:**
   - Leverage domain expertise to identify potential new rules or modify existing ones. Consider chemical properties or interactions that may not be currently captured but could influence catalyst loading.

By implementing these recommendations, the rules can be refined to improve the model's accuracy and better align predictions with experimental outcomes.

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: gpt-4o-2024-08-06
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with an aromatic ring and specific stereochemistry (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The stereochemistry and aromatic ring can enhance π-π interactions and stabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group adjacent to an aromatic ring, especially with electron-withdrawing substituents like nitro or bromo groups (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid), are associated with high yield. These substituents can enhance the reactivity of the catalyst through electron-withdrawing effects.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups in sugar-like structures, considering different stereoisomers (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid), tend to lead to high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups facilitate hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group or thioether (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) are associated with high yield. The sulfur-containing groups contribute to electron-donating ability, enhancing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and additional electron-donating groups at ortho or para positions (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) generally result in high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially stabilizing the catalyst, especially when electron-donating groups are present.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a methoxy group adjacent to an aromatic ring, particularly when multiple methoxy groups are present and positioned ortho or para to each other (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), tend to result in high yield. The methoxy groups can donate electrons through resonance, potentially enhancing catalyst stability.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. The benzofuran ring can provide additional π-π interactions and electron delocalization, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a simple aliphatic chain and no additional functional groups (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of functional groups may limit interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a formyl group on an aromatic ring without any electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the formyl group may destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with an ether linkage combined with an electron-withdrawing group, especially when the ether linkage is extensive (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid), tend to result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing effect may reduce the catalyst's reactivity.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group without compensating electron-donating groups (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) are associated with low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing effect can destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on a long aliphatic chain (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The isolated hydroxy group may not sufficiently interact with the catalyst to enhance yield.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a methyl group on an aromatic ring without additional electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of significant electron-donating effects may limit catalyst stabilization.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on an aromatic ring and a formyl group (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing formyl group may counteract the potential stabilizing effect of the hydroxy group.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a pyridine ring in the same molecule, especially when no additional stabilizing groups are present (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid), tend to result in low yield. The combination of these groups may lead to competitive binding or destabilization of the catalyst.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: Increase the dataset size to improve rule coverage. Many rules are supported by only one or two data points, which limits their robustness. Expanding the dataset will provide more comprehensive support for each rule.

- **Advice 2**: Consider adding more specific examples to each rule to enhance clarity and applicability. This will help in understanding the nuances of each rule and how they apply to different chemical structures.

- **Advice 3**: Introduce a scoring system for each rule based on the number of supporting data points and the diversity of those points. This will help prioritize rules that are more reliable and widely applicable.

- **Advice 4**: Explore the use of machine learning models to identify patterns in the dataset that may not be immediately obvious. This could lead to the discovery of new rules or the refinement of existing ones.

- **Advice 5**: Regularly update the rules as new data becomes available. This will ensure that the rules remain relevant and accurate over time.

- **Advice 6**: Consider the use of computational chemistry tools to simulate the interactions described in the rules. This could provide additional insights into the mechanisms at play and help refine the rules further.

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with an aromatic ring and specific stereochemistry (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The stereochemistry and aromatic ring can enhance π-π interactions and stabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group directly adjacent to an aromatic ring with electron-withdrawing substituents like nitro or bromo groups (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid) are associated with high yield. These substituents can enhance the reactivity of the catalyst through electron-withdrawing effects.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups in sugar-like structures with specific stereochemistry (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid) tend to lead to high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups facilitate hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group or thioether (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) are associated with high yield. The sulfur-containing groups contribute to electron-donating ability, enhancing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and additional electron-donating groups at ortho or para positions (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) generally result in high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially stabilizing the catalyst, especially when electron-donating groups are present.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a methoxy group adjacent to an aromatic ring, particularly when multiple methoxy groups are present and positioned ortho or para to each other (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), tend to result in high yield. The methoxy groups can donate electrons through resonance, potentially enhancing catalyst stability.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. The benzofuran ring can provide additional π-π interactions and electron delocalization, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a simple aliphatic chain and no additional functional groups (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of functional groups may limit interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a formyl group on an aromatic ring without any electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the formyl group may destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with an ether linkage combined with an electron-withdrawing group, especially when the ether linkage is extensive (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid), tend to result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing effect may reduce the catalyst's reactivity.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group without compensating electron-donating groups (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) are associated with low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing effect can destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on a long aliphatic chain (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The isolated hydroxy group may not sufficiently interact with the catalyst to enhance yield.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a methyl group on an aromatic ring without additional electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of significant electron-donating effects may limit catalyst stabilization.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on an aromatic ring and a formyl group (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing formyl group may counteract the potential stabilizing effect of the hydroxy group.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a pyridine ring in the same molecule, especially when no additional stabilizing groups are present (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid), tend to result in low yield. The combination of these groups may lead to competitive binding or destabilization of the catalyst.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with an aromatic ring and specific stereochemistry (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The stereochemistry and aromatic ring can enhance π-π interactions and stabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group directly adjacent to an aromatic ring with electron-withdrawing substituents like nitro or bromo groups (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid) are associated with high yield. These substituents can enhance the reactivity of the catalyst through electron-withdrawing effects.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups in sugar-like structures with specific stereochemistry (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid) tend to lead to high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups facilitate hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group or thioether (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) are associated with high yield. The sulfur-containing groups contribute to electron-donating ability, enhancing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and additional electron-donating groups at ortho or para positions (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) generally result in high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially stabilizing the catalyst, especially when electron-donating groups are present.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a methoxy group adjacent to an aromatic ring, particularly when multiple methoxy groups are present and positioned ortho or para to each other (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), tend to result in high yield. The methoxy groups can donate electrons through resonance, potentially enhancing catalyst stability.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. The benzofuran ring can provide additional π-π interactions and electron delocalization, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a simple aliphatic chain and no additional functional groups (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of functional groups may limit interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a formyl group on an aromatic ring without any electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the formyl group may destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with an ether linkage combined with an electron-withdrawing group, especially when the ether linkage is extensive (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid), tend to result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing effect may reduce the catalyst's reactivity.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group without compensating electron-donating groups (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) are associated with low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing effect can destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on a long aliphatic chain (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The isolated hydroxy group may not sufficiently interact with the catalyst to enhance yield.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a methyl group on an aromatic ring without additional electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of significant electron-donating effects may limit catalyst stabilization.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on an aromatic ring and a formyl group (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing formyl group may counteract the potential stabilizing effect of the hydroxy group.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a pyridine ring in the same molecule, especially when no additional stabilizing groups are present (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid), tend to result in low yield. The combination of these groups may lead to competitive binding or destabilization of the catalyst.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern '[C@H](N)[c]' may not fully capture the requirement of an aromatic ring with specific stereochemistry. Consider using a more specific pattern that includes the aromatic ring and stereochemistry, such as '[C@H](N)[c]1[cH][cH][cH][cH][cH]1'.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Rule 2's SMARTS patterns '[c][CX3](=O)[OX2H]' and '[c][NX3;$([N]([c])[c])]' do not fully capture the requirement of electron-withdrawing substituents like nitro or bromo groups. Consider adding patterns for these specific substituents, such as '[c][CX3](=O)[OX2H][c][N+](=O)[O-]' or '[c][CX3](=O)[OX2H][c]Br'.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: Rule 3's SMARTS pattern '[C@H]([O])[C@H]([O])[C@H]([O])[C@H]([O])[C@H]([O])' may not fully capture the sugar-like structure. Consider using a pattern that includes the cyclic nature of sugars, such as '[C@H]1([O])[C@H]([O])[C@H]([O])[C@H]([O])[C@H]1([O])'.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Rule 4's SMARTS patterns '[SX2]' and '[CX4;!$(C(S)~[O,S,#7,#15])]' may not fully capture the presence of a sulfanyl group or thioether. Consider using a more specific pattern that includes the sulfur atom bonded to carbon, such as '[CX4][SX2][CX4]'.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: Rule 5's SMARTS patterns '[n][c][c][c][c][c]' and '[c][NX3;$([N]([c])[c])]' may not fully capture the requirement of a pyridine ring with electron-donating groups. Consider using a pattern that includes specific electron-donating groups, such as '[n][c][c][c][c][c][OX2H]' for a pyridine with a hydroxy group.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Rule 6's SMARTS pattern '[c][OX2][c]' is too generic and may not capture the requirement of methoxy groups adjacent to an aromatic ring. Consider using a more specific pattern, such as '[c][OX2][c][OX2][c]' for multiple methoxy groups.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: Rule 7's SMARTS pattern '[c]1oc2ccccc2c1' may not fully capture the benzofuran structure. Consider using a pattern that includes the oxygen atom in the furan ring, such as '[c]1oc2ccccc2o1'.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Rule 8's SMARTS pattern '[CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4]' may not fully capture the requirement of a simple aliphatic chain. Consider using a pattern that includes a longer chain, such as '[CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4]'.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: Rule 9's SMARTS pattern '[c][CX3H]=O' may not fully capture the requirement of a formyl group on an aromatic ring. Consider using a pattern that includes the aromatic ring, such as '[c][CX3H]=O[c]'.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Rule 10's SMARTS pattern '[OX2][CX4][OX2][CX4][OX2]' may not fully capture the requirement of an extensive ether linkage with an electron-withdrawing group. Consider using a pattern that includes specific electron-withdrawing groups, such as '[OX2][CX4][OX2][CX4][OX2][CX3](=O)[OX2H]'.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: Rule 11's SMARTS pattern '[CX4](F)(F)F' is correct for a trifluoromethyl group, but ensure that it is used in the context of the entire molecule to determine its effect on yield.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: Rule 12's SMARTS pattern '[OX2H][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4]' may not fully capture the requirement of a hydroxy group on a long aliphatic chain. Consider using a pattern that includes a longer chain, such as '[OX2H][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4]'.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: Rule 13's SMARTS pattern '[c][CH3]' may not fully capture the requirement of a methyl group on an aromatic ring. Consider using a pattern that includes the aromatic ring, such as '[c][CH3][c]'.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: Rule 14's SMARTS pattern '[c][OX2H][CX3H]=O' may not fully capture the requirement of a hydroxy and formyl group on an aromatic ring. Consider using a pattern that includes the aromatic ring, such as '[c][OX2H][c][CX3H]=O'.

- ** Suggestion 15 **: Rule 15's SMARTS pattern '[c][n][CX3](=O)[OX2H]' may not fully capture the requirement of a carboxylic acid and pyridine ring. Consider using a pattern that includes the pyridine ring, such as '[c][n][c][CX3](=O)[OX2H]'.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with an aromatic ring and specific stereochemistry (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The stereochemistry and aromatic ring can enhance π-π interactions and stabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group directly adjacent to an aromatic ring with electron-withdrawing substituents like nitro or bromo groups (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid) are associated with high yield. These substituents can enhance the reactivity of the catalyst through electron-withdrawing effects.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups in sugar-like structures with specific stereochemistry (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid) tend to lead to high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups facilitate hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group or thioether (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) are associated with high yield. The sulfur-containing groups contribute to electron-donating ability, enhancing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and additional electron-donating groups at ortho or para positions (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) generally result in high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially stabilizing the catalyst, especially when electron-donating groups are present.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a methoxy group adjacent to an aromatic ring, particularly when multiple methoxy groups are present and positioned ortho or para to each other (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), tend to result in high yield. The methoxy groups can donate electrons through resonance, potentially enhancing catalyst stability.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. The benzofuran ring can provide additional π-π interactions and electron delocalization, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a simple aliphatic chain and no additional functional groups (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of functional groups may limit interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a formyl group on an aromatic ring without any electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the formyl group may destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with an ether linkage combined with an electron-withdrawing group, especially when the ether linkage is extensive (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid), tend to result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing effect may reduce the catalyst's reactivity.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group without compensating electron-donating groups (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) are associated with low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing effect can destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on a long aliphatic chain (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The isolated hydroxy group may not sufficiently interact with the catalyst to enhance yield.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a methyl group on an aromatic ring without additional electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of significant electron-donating effects may limit catalyst stabilization.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on an aromatic ring and a formyl group (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing formyl group may counteract the potential stabilizing effect of the hydroxy group.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a pyridine ring in the same molecule, especially when no additional stabilizing groups are present (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid), tend to result in low yield. The combination of these groups may lead to competitive binding or destabilization of the catalyst.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern '[C@H](N)[c]1[cH][cH][cH][cH][cH]1' may not fully capture the aromatic amine with specific stereochemistry as described in the rule. Consider expanding the SMARTS to include more specific stereochemistry and aromatic ring structures that match the examples given in the rule.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Rule 2's SMARTS patterns '[c][CX3](=O)[OX2H][c][N+](=O)[O-]' and '[c][CX3](=O)[OX2H][c]Br' may not be comprehensive enough to capture all carboxylic acids adjacent to aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups. Ensure that the SMARTS patterns account for variations in the position of the substituents and the presence of other electron-withdrawing groups.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For Rule 3, the SMARTS '[C@H]1([O])[C@H]([O])[C@H]([O])[C@H]([O])[C@H]1([O])' might not cover all sugar-like structures with multiple hydroxyl groups. Consider using a more general pattern that captures the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups and specific stereochemistry.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Rule 4's SMARTS '[CX4][SX2][CX4]' may not fully represent all possible sulfanyl groups or thioethers. Consider expanding the pattern to include variations in the carbon chain length and branching.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: For Rule 5, the SMARTS '[n][c][c][c][c][c][OX2H]' may not capture all pyridine rings with electron-donating groups. Ensure that the pattern accounts for different positions of electron-donating groups on the pyridine ring.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Rule 6's SMARTS '[c][OX2][c][OX2][c]' may not fully capture methoxy groups adjacent to aromatic rings. Consider refining the pattern to ensure it matches the specific positioning of methoxy groups as described in the rule.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: For Rule 7, the SMARTS '[c]1oc2ccccc2o1' seems appropriate for benzofuran structures, but ensure it captures all variations of benzofuran derivatives that might be relevant.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Rule 8's SMARTS '[CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4]' may not accurately represent simple aliphatic chains. Consider simplifying the pattern to match any aliphatic chain without additional functional groups.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: For Rule 9, the SMARTS '[c][CX3H]=O[c]' may not fully capture formyl groups on aromatic rings. Ensure the pattern accounts for variations in the position of the formyl group.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Rule 10's SMARTS '[OX2][CX4][OX2][CX4][OX2][CX3](=O)[OX2H]' may not fully capture extensive ether linkages with electron-withdrawing groups. Consider refining the pattern to ensure it matches the described structures.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: For Rule 11, the SMARTS '[CX4](F)(F)F' seems appropriate for trifluoromethyl groups, but ensure it captures all relevant variations.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: Rule 12's SMARTS '[OX2H][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4]' may not accurately represent hydroxy groups on long aliphatic chains. Consider simplifying the pattern to match any long aliphatic chain with a hydroxy group.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: For Rule 13, the SMARTS '[c][CH3][c]' may not fully capture methyl groups on aromatic rings. Ensure the pattern accounts for variations in the position of the methyl group.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: Rule 14's SMARTS '[c][OX2H][c][CX3H]=O' may not fully capture hydroxy and formyl groups on aromatic rings. Ensure the pattern accounts for variations in the position of these groups.

- ** Suggestion 15 **: For Rule 15, the SMARTS '[c][n][c][CX3](=O)[OX2H]' may not fully capture carboxylic acid and pyridine rings in the same molecule. Ensure the pattern accounts for variations in the position of these groups.

Metric Commenter Message:
Based on the current rule metrics and the reference metrics provided, here are some observations and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Confidence**:
   - The current rule has a train confidence of 0.5, which is lower than most of the rules from the previous iterations. For instance, previous rules had confidence values ranging from approximately 0.532 to 0.715. This indicates that the current rule is less reliable in predicting the outcome compared to earlier rules.
   - Improving confidence could involve refining the rule conditions to better capture the characteristics that lead to the desired outcome. This might involve identifying additional or more specific features that are strongly associated with high yield.

2. **Lift**:
   - The current rule has a lift of 0.996, which is very close to 1. This suggests that the rule does not significantly improve the prediction over random chance. In contrast, previous rules had lift values ranging from approximately 1.06 to 1.44, indicating a stronger association between the rule conditions and the outcome.
   - To improve lift, it may be beneficial to focus on identifying rule conditions that have a more pronounced effect on the outcome. This could involve exploring interactions between different chemical groups or structural features that are not currently captured by the rules.

3. **Leverage**:
   - The leverage for the current rule is 0.0009, which is quite low. Previous rules had leverage values ranging from approximately 0.002 to 0.014. Low leverage suggests that the rule does not provide much additional information beyond what would be expected by chance.
   - Increasing leverage could involve identifying combinations of features that are less common but have a strong impact on the outcome. This might involve looking for rare but highly effective structural motifs or functional groups.

4. **Support**:
   - The current rule has a train support of 0.0038, which is significantly lower than the support values for previous rules (ranging from approximately 0.02 to 0.12). This indicates that the current rule applies to a very small portion of the dataset.
   - While support is not the primary focus, ensuring that the rule is applicable to a reasonable portion of the dataset can help in achieving more generalizable results. This might involve broadening the rule conditions slightly to capture more relevant cases.

**Suggestions for Improvement**:
- **Refinement of Rule Conditions**: Consider revisiting the chemical and structural features used in the rules. Look for additional features or combinations of features that might better capture the underlying chemistry leading to high yield.
- **Exploration of Interactions**: Investigate potential interactions between different chemical groups or structural features that could enhance the effectiveness of the catalyst.
- **Incorporation of Domain Knowledge**: Utilize domain knowledge to hypothesize new rules or modify existing ones. This could involve considering the mechanistic aspects of the catalytic process and how different modifiers might influence it.
- **Iterative Testing and Validation**: Continue iterating on the rules, testing them against the dataset, and validating their performance. This iterative process can help in gradually improving the rules and avoiding local minima.

Overall, the current rule metrics suggest that there is room for improvement, particularly in terms of confidence and lift. By refining the rule conditions and exploring new features, it may be possible to develop more effective rules that better predict high yield outcomes.

### Performance Evaluation of Current Rules

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
   - The current rules have shown varying levels of effectiveness across different iterations. The validation accuracy has fluctuated between 0.4286 and 0.6286, indicating inconsistency in the model's performance. The latest accuracy of 0.4857 suggests that the rules are not yet optimal and may require further refinement.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment:**
   - The fluctuating validation accuracies suggest potential overfitting or underfitting issues. The model's performance does not consistently improve, indicating that the rules may not be generalizing well across different datasets.

3. **Discrepancies Analysis:**
   - Instances where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low often involve rules with high positive SHAP values. For example, Rule 4 and Rule 11 frequently appear in such cases, suggesting they might be contributing to overestimation.
   - Conversely, when the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, rules with high negative SHAP values, such as Rule 8 and Rule 9, might be underestimating the loading.

4. **Accuracy Improvements:**
   - The current accuracy metrics indicate that there is room for improvement. The model has not yet reached a local minimum, as evidenced by the lack of consistent improvement in validation accuracy across iterations.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**
   - SHAP analysis highlights specific rules that consistently contribute to discrepancies in predictions. For instance, Rule 4 and Rule 11 often have high positive SHAP values in overestimated cases, while Rule 8 and Rule 9 have high negative SHAP values in underestimated cases. This suggests that these rules may need adjustment to improve model performance.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Overestimated Rules:**
   - Rules with high positive SHAP values, such as Rule 4 and Rule 11, should be reviewed and potentially refined. Consider adding conditions or constraints to these rules to prevent overestimation of loading.

2. **Adjust Underestimated Rules:**
   - Rules with high negative SHAP values, like Rule 8 and Rule 9, should be adjusted to better capture cases where the experimental loading is high. This could involve relaxing some constraints or incorporating additional features that capture the missing interactions.

3. **Improve Generalization:**
   - To address overfitting or underfitting, consider simplifying complex rules or combining similar rules to reduce model complexity. Additionally, incorporating more diverse training data could help improve generalization.

4. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - Use insights from SHAP analysis to iteratively refine the rules. Focus on rules that frequently appear in discrepancies and test modifications to see if they lead to improved validation performance.

5. **Evaluate Rule Effectiveness:**
   - Continuously evaluate the effectiveness of refined rules by monitoring changes in validation accuracy and SHAP value distributions. This iterative process will help identify which rule modifications lead to better model performance.

### Summary and Directions for Optimization

1. **Effectiveness and Performance:**
   - The current rules show varying effectiveness, with validation accuracy fluctuating between 0.4286 and 0.6286. The latest accuracy of 0.4857 indicates that the rules are not yet optimal and require further refinement.
   - The current rule metrics, particularly confidence and lift, suggest room for improvement. The confidence is lower than previous iterations, and the lift is close to 1, indicating limited predictive power.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting:**
   - The inconsistent validation accuracies suggest potential overfitting or underfitting. The model's performance does not consistently improve, indicating that the rules may not generalize well across different datasets.

3. **Discrepancies and SHAP Analysis:**
   - Discrepancies in predictions, where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low, often involve rules with high positive SHAP values (e.g., Rule 4 and Rule 11). Conversely, underestimated cases involve rules with high negative SHAP values (e.g., Rule 8 and Rule 9).

4. **Rule Refinement Suggestions:**
   - **Refine Overestimated Rules:** Review and potentially refine rules with high positive SHAP values to prevent overestimation. Consider adding conditions or constraints.
   - **Adjust Underestimated Rules:** Modify rules with high negative SHAP values to better capture cases with high experimental loading. This could involve relaxing constraints or incorporating additional features.
   - **Improve Generalization:** Simplify complex rules or combine similar rules to reduce model complexity. Incorporate more diverse training data to improve generalization.
   - **Iterative Refinement:** Use SHAP analysis insights to iteratively refine rules, focusing on those frequently involved in discrepancies.

5. **SMARTS Pattern Suggestions:**
   - Expand and refine SMARTS patterns to better capture the chemical and structural features described in the rules. Ensure patterns account for variations in substituent positions and interactions.

### Possibility for Further Optimization

There is a possibility for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. By refining the rule conditions, exploring interactions, and incorporating domain knowledge, the rules can be improved to better predict high yield outcomes.

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: gpt-4o-2024-08-06
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with an aromatic ring and specific stereochemistry (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The stereochemistry and aromatic ring can enhance π-π interactions and stabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group directly adjacent to an aromatic ring with electron-withdrawing substituents like nitro or bromo groups (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid) are associated with high yield. These substituents can enhance the reactivity of the catalyst through electron-withdrawing effects.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups in sugar-like structures with specific stereochemistry (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid) tend to lead to high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups facilitate hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group or thioether (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) are associated with high yield. The sulfur-containing groups contribute to electron-donating ability, enhancing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and additional electron-donating groups at ortho or para positions (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) generally result in high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially stabilizing the catalyst, especially when electron-donating groups are present.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a methoxy group adjacent to an aromatic ring, particularly when multiple methoxy groups are present and positioned ortho or para to each other (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), tend to result in high yield. The methoxy groups can donate electrons through resonance, potentially enhancing catalyst stability.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. The benzofuran ring can provide additional π-π interactions and electron delocalization, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a simple aliphatic chain and no additional functional groups (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of functional groups may limit interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a formyl group on an aromatic ring without any electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the formyl group may destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with an ether linkage combined with an electron-withdrawing group, especially when the ether linkage is extensive (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid), tend to result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing effect may reduce the catalyst's reactivity.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group without compensating electron-donating groups (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) are associated with low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing effect can destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on a long aliphatic chain (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The isolated hydroxy group may not sufficiently interact with the catalyst to enhance yield.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a methyl group on an aromatic ring without additional electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of significant electron-donating effects may limit catalyst stabilization.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on an aromatic ring and a formyl group (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing formyl group may counteract the potential stabilizing effect of the hydroxy group.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a pyridine ring in the same molecule, especially when no additional stabilizing groups are present (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid), tend to result in low yield. The combination of these groups may lead to competitive binding or destabilization of the catalyst.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: Refine rules with high positive SHAP values, such as Rule 4 and Rule 11, by adding specific conditions or constraints. For example, consider specifying the position of the sulfanyl group in Rule 4 or the context in which trifluoromethyl groups are beneficial in Rule 11.

- **Advice 2**: Adjust rules with high negative SHAP values, like Rule 8 and Rule 9, by relaxing constraints or incorporating additional features. For instance, Rule 8 could be modified to include potential interactions with other functional groups that might enhance yield.

- **Advice 3**: Simplify complex rules or combine similar rules to reduce model complexity and improve generalization. For example, merge rules that involve similar functional groups or structural motifs to create broader, more inclusive rules.

- **Advice 4**: Expand and refine SMARTS patterns to better capture the chemical and structural features described in the rules. Ensure that these patterns account for variations in substituent positions and interactions, which could affect the yield.

- **Advice 5**: Incorporate more diverse training data to improve the generalization of the rules. This could involve including modifiers with a wider range of functional groups and structural features to better capture the variability in experimental outcomes.

- **Advice 6**: Use iterative refinement based on SHAP analysis insights to focus on rules frequently involved in discrepancies. This iterative process can help identify and correct specific rule weaknesses.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with an aromatic ring and specific stereochemistry (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The stereochemistry and aromatic ring can enhance π-π interactions and stabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group directly adjacent to an aromatic ring with electron-withdrawing substituents like nitro or bromo groups (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid) are associated with high yield. These substituents can enhance the reactivity of the catalyst through electron-withdrawing effects.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups in sugar-like structures with specific stereochemistry (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid) tend to lead to high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups facilitate hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group or thioether (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) are associated with high yield. The sulfur-containing groups contribute to electron-donating ability, enhancing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and additional electron-donating groups at ortho or para positions (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) generally result in high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially stabilizing the catalyst, especially when electron-donating groups are present.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a methoxy group adjacent to an aromatic ring, particularly when multiple methoxy groups are present and positioned ortho or para to each other (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), tend to result in high yield. The methoxy groups can donate electrons through resonance, potentially enhancing catalyst stability.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. The benzofuran ring can provide additional π-π interactions and electron delocalization, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a simple aliphatic chain and no additional functional groups (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of functional groups may limit interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a formyl group on an aromatic ring without any electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the formyl group may destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with an ether linkage combined with an electron-withdrawing group, especially when the ether linkage is extensive (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid), tend to result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing effect may reduce the catalyst's reactivity.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group without compensating electron-donating groups (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) are associated with low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing effect can destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on a long aliphatic chain (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The isolated hydroxy group may not sufficiently interact with the catalyst to enhance yield.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a methyl group on an aromatic ring without additional electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of significant electron-donating effects may limit catalyst stabilization.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on an aromatic ring and a formyl group (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing formyl group may counteract the potential stabilizing effect of the hydroxy group.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a pyridine ring in the same molecule, especially when no additional stabilizing groups are present (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid), tend to result in low yield. The combination of these groups may lead to competitive binding or destabilization of the catalyst.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For Rule 1, the SMARTS pattern `['[NX3;$([N][c])]', '[c]']` does not accurately capture the requirement for an aromatic amine with specific stereochemistry. The SMARTS should be refined to include stereochemistry and aromatic ring detection, possibly using `[$([NX3;$([N]([c])[c])][C@H])]` to capture stereochemistry.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Rule 2's SMARTS `['[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]', '[c][NX3;$([N]([c])[c])]']` does not match the description of a carboxylic acid adjacent to an aromatic ring with electron-withdrawing groups. The SMARTS should be adjusted to include electron-withdrawing groups, such as `[$([CX3](=O)[OX2H1][c][c][c][c][c][c][NX3;$([N]([c])[c])])]`.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: Rule 3's SMARTS `['[OX2H][CX4;!$(C(O)(O)[!#6])][OX2H]', '[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)']` should be revised to better capture sugar-like structures with multiple hydroxyl groups. Consider using a pattern like `[$([C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O))]`.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Rule 4's SMARTS `['[SX2H]', '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]']` should be simplified to focus on the presence of a sulfanyl group or thioether, such as `['[SX2H]', '[SX2]']`.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: Rule 5's SMARTS `['[n][c][c][c][c][c]', '[c][OX2H]']` does not fully capture the requirement for a pyridine ring with electron-donating groups. Consider using `['[n][c][c][c][c][c][c][OX2H]']` to ensure the presence of electron-donating groups.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Rule 6's SMARTS `['[c][OX2H]', '[c][OX2H]']` is too generic and does not specifically capture methoxy groups adjacent to an aromatic ring. A more specific pattern like `['[c][OCH3]']` should be used.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: Rule 7's SMARTS `['[c]1oc2ccccc2c1']` is correct for benzofuran structures, but ensure it is applied correctly in the code logic.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Rule 8's SMARTS `['[CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4]']` should be adjusted to better capture simple aliphatic chains, possibly using `['[CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4]']` to ensure longer chains are detected.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: Rule 9's SMARTS `['[c][CX3H]=O']` is appropriate for formyl groups on aromatic rings, but ensure it is applied correctly in the code logic.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Rule 10's SMARTS `['[OX2][CX4][OX2][CX4][OX2]']` should be revised to better capture extensive ether linkages with electron-withdrawing groups, possibly using `['[OX2][CX4][OX2][CX4][OX2][CX4]']`.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: Rule 11's SMARTS `['[CX4](F)(F)F']` is correct for trifluoromethyl groups, but ensure it is applied correctly in the code logic.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: Rule 12's SMARTS `['[OX2H][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4]']` should be adjusted to better capture hydroxy groups on long aliphatic chains, possibly using `['[OX2H][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4]']`.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: Rule 13's SMARTS `['[c][CH3]']` is appropriate for methyl groups on aromatic rings, but ensure it is applied correctly in the code logic.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: Rule 14's SMARTS `['[c][OX2H]', '[c][CX3H]=O']` should be revised to ensure both hydroxy and formyl groups are detected on the same aromatic ring, possibly using `['[c][OX2H][c][CX3H]=O']`.

- ** Suggestion 15 **: Rule 15's SMARTS `['[n][c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]']` should be adjusted to ensure the presence of both a carboxylic acid and pyridine ring, possibly using `['[n][c][c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]']`.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with an aromatic ring and specific stereochemistry (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The stereochemistry and aromatic ring can enhance π-π interactions and stabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group directly adjacent to an aromatic ring with electron-withdrawing substituents like nitro or bromo groups (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid) are associated with high yield. These substituents can enhance the reactivity of the catalyst through electron-withdrawing effects.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups in sugar-like structures with specific stereochemistry (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid) tend to lead to high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups facilitate hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group or thioether (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) are associated with high yield. The sulfur-containing groups contribute to electron-donating ability, enhancing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and additional electron-donating groups at ortho or para positions (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) generally result in high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially stabilizing the catalyst, especially when electron-donating groups are present.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a methoxy group adjacent to an aromatic ring, particularly when multiple methoxy groups are present and positioned ortho or para to each other (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), tend to result in high yield. The methoxy groups can donate electrons through resonance, potentially enhancing catalyst stability.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. The benzofuran ring can provide additional π-π interactions and electron delocalization, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a simple aliphatic chain and no additional functional groups (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of functional groups may limit interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a formyl group on an aromatic ring without any electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the formyl group may destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with an ether linkage combined with an electron-withdrawing group, especially when the ether linkage is extensive (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid), tend to result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing effect may reduce the catalyst's reactivity.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group without compensating electron-donating groups (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) are associated with low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing effect can destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on a long aliphatic chain (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The isolated hydroxy group may not sufficiently interact with the catalyst to enhance yield.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a methyl group on an aromatic ring without additional electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of significant electron-donating effects may limit catalyst stabilization.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on an aromatic ring and a formyl group (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing formyl group may counteract the potential stabilizing effect of the hydroxy group.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a pyridine ring in the same molecule, especially when no additional stabilizing groups are present (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid), tend to result in low yield. The combination of these groups may lead to competitive binding or destabilization of the catalyst.

Matrix Checker Message:
To evaluate the effectiveness of the transformation from language rules to a numeric feature matrix, let's go through each rule and the corresponding SMILES strings to ensure the feature matrix is accurate.

### Rule Evaluation:

1. **Rule 1**: Aromatic amine with specific stereochemistry
   - The SMARTS pattern `[$([NX3;$([N]([c])[c])][C@H])]` does not seem to match the description of Rule 1, which involves amino acids with aromatic rings and specific stereochemistry. The pattern should be more specific to amino acids with aromatic rings and stereochemistry.

2. **Rule 2**: Carboxylic acid adjacent to aromatic ring with EWG
   - The SMARTS pattern `[$([CX3](=O)[OX2H1][c][c][c][c][c][c][NX3;$([N]([c])[c])])]` is overly complex and does not accurately capture the rule description. It should focus on carboxylic acids directly adjacent to aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups.

3. **Rule 3**: Sugar-like structure with hydroxyl groups
   - The SMARTS pattern `[$([C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O))]` seems to match the rule description, but it should be verified against the SMILES to ensure it captures the intended structures.

4. **Rule 4**: Sulfanyl group or thioether
   - The SMARTS patterns `[SX2H]` and `[SX2]` are appropriate for identifying sulfanyl groups or thioethers.

5. **Rule 5**: Pyridine ring with electron-donating groups
   - The SMARTS pattern `[n][c][c][c][c][c][c][OX2H]` does not accurately capture the rule description. It should focus on pyridine rings with electron-donating groups at ortho or para positions.

6. **Rule 6**: Methoxy group adjacent to aromatic ring
   - The SMARTS pattern `[c][OCH3]` is appropriate for identifying methoxy groups adjacent to aromatic rings.

7. **Rule 7**: Benzofuran structure
   - The SMARTS pattern `[c]1oc2ccccc2c1` is appropriate for identifying benzofuran structures.

8. **Rule 8**: Simple aliphatic chain
   - The SMARTS pattern `[CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4]` is overly specific and does not capture the simplicity of aliphatic chains without functional groups.

9. **Rule 9**: Formyl group on aromatic ring
   - The SMARTS pattern `[c][CX3H]=O` is appropriate for identifying formyl groups on aromatic rings.

10. **Rule 10**: Ether linkage with EWG
    - The SMARTS pattern `[OX2][CX4][OX2][CX4][OX2][CX4]` does not accurately capture the rule description. It should focus on extensive ether linkages with electron-withdrawing groups.

11. **Rule 11**: Trifluoromethyl group
    - The SMARTS pattern `[CX4](F)(F)F` is appropriate for identifying trifluoromethyl groups.

12. **Rule 12**: Hydroxy group on long aliphatic chain
    - The SMARTS pattern `[OX2H][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4]` is overly specific and does not capture the rule description effectively.

13. **Rule 13**: Methyl group on aromatic ring
    - The SMARTS pattern `[c][CH3]` is appropriate for identifying methyl groups on aromatic rings.

14. **Rule 14**: Hydroxy and formyl group on aromatic ring
    - The SMARTS pattern `[c][OX2H][c][CX3H]=O` is appropriate for identifying hydroxy and formyl groups on aromatic rings.

15. **Rule 15**: Carboxylic acid and pyridine ring
    - The SMARTS pattern `[n][c][c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` does not accurately capture the rule description. It should focus on the presence of both a carboxylic acid group and a pyridine ring in the same molecule.

### Suggestions for Improvement:

** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: Revise the SMARTS pattern for Rule 1 to better capture amino acids with aromatic rings and specific stereochemistry.
- ** Suggestion 2 **: Simplify the SMARTS pattern for Rule 2 to focus on carboxylic acids directly adjacent to aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups.
- ** Suggestion 3 **: Verify the SMARTS pattern for Rule 3 against the SMILES to ensure it captures sugar-like structures with hydroxyl groups.
- ** Suggestion 4 **: Revise the SMARTS pattern for Rule 5 to focus on pyridine rings with electron-donating groups at ortho or para positions.
- ** Suggestion 5 **: Simplify the SMARTS pattern for Rule 8 to capture simple aliphatic chains without functional groups.
- ** Suggestion 6 **: Revise the SMARTS pattern for Rule 10 to focus on extensive ether linkages with electron-withdrawing groups.
- ** Suggestion 7 **: Simplify the SMARTS pattern for Rule 12 to capture hydroxy groups on long aliphatic chains more effectively.
- ** Suggestion 8 **: Revise the SMARTS pattern for Rule 15 to focus on the presence of both a carboxylic acid group and a pyridine ring in the same molecule.
** End of Suggestions **

The transformation from language rules to a numeric feature matrix is not fully effective, as several SMARTS patterns do not accurately capture the intended chemical structures described in the rules.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with an aromatic ring and specific stereochemistry (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The stereochemistry and aromatic ring can enhance π-π interactions and stabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group directly adjacent to an aromatic ring with electron-withdrawing substituents like nitro or bromo groups (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid) are associated with high yield. These substituents can enhance the reactivity of the catalyst through electron-withdrawing effects.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups in sugar-like structures with specific stereochemistry (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid) tend to lead to high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups facilitate hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group or thioether (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) are associated with high yield. The sulfur-containing groups contribute to electron-donating ability, enhancing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and additional electron-donating groups at ortho or para positions (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) generally result in high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially stabilizing the catalyst, especially when electron-donating groups are present.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a methoxy group adjacent to an aromatic ring, particularly when multiple methoxy groups are present and positioned ortho or para to each other (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), tend to result in high yield. The methoxy groups can donate electrons through resonance, potentially enhancing catalyst stability.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. The benzofuran ring can provide additional π-π interactions and electron delocalization, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a simple aliphatic chain and no additional functional groups (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of functional groups may limit interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a formyl group on an aromatic ring without any electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the formyl group may destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with an ether linkage combined with an electron-withdrawing group, especially when the ether linkage is extensive (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid), tend to result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing effect may reduce the catalyst's reactivity.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group without compensating electron-donating groups (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) are associated with low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing effect can destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on a long aliphatic chain (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The isolated hydroxy group may not sufficiently interact with the catalyst to enhance yield.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a methyl group on an aromatic ring without additional electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of significant electron-donating effects may limit catalyst stabilization.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on an aromatic ring and a formyl group (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing formyl group may counteract the potential stabilizing effect of the hydroxy group.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a pyridine ring in the same molecule, especially when no additional stabilizing groups are present (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid), tend to result in low yield. The combination of these groups may lead to competitive binding or destabilization of the catalyst.

Matrix Checker Message:
To evaluate the effectiveness of the transformation from language rules to a numeric feature matrix, let's go through each rule and compare it with the corresponding SMARTS patterns and the feature matrix.

**Rule 1**: Modifiers with an amino acid structure with an aromatic ring and specific stereochemistry.
- The SMARTS pattern `[$([NX3;$([N]([c])[c])][C@H])]` seems to be targeting aromatic amines with specific stereochemistry, which might not fully capture the amino acid structure with an aromatic ring as described in the rule. The feature matrix shows all 0s, indicating no matches, which might be due to the incorrect SMARTS pattern.

**Rule 2**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group adjacent to an aromatic ring with electron-withdrawing substituents.
- The SMARTS pattern `[$([CX3](=O)[OX2H1][c][c][c][c][c][c][NX3;$([N]([c])[c])])]` seems overly specific and might not match the intended structures. The feature matrix shows all 0s, suggesting no matches, which could be due to the pattern not accurately reflecting the rule.

**Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups in sugar-like structures with specific stereochemistry.
- The SMARTS pattern `[$([C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O))]` seems to be targeting sugar-like structures, but the feature matrix shows all 0s, indicating no matches. This might be due to the pattern not fully capturing the intended structures.

**Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group or thioether.
- The SMARTS patterns `[SX2H]` and `[SX2]` seem appropriate for capturing sulfanyl groups or thioethers. The feature matrix shows a match for one SMILES, which aligns with the rule.

**Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and additional electron-donating groups.
- The SMARTS pattern `[n][c][c][c][c][c][c][OX2H]` might not fully capture the pyridine ring with electron-donating groups as described. The feature matrix shows all 0s, indicating no matches, which might be due to the pattern not accurately reflecting the rule.

**Rule 6**: Modifiers with a methoxy group adjacent to an aromatic ring.
- The SMARTS pattern `[c][OCH3]` seems appropriate for capturing methoxy groups adjacent to aromatic rings. The feature matrix shows all 0s, indicating no matches, which might be due to the pattern not fully capturing the intended structures.

**Rule 7**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure.
- The SMARTS pattern `[c]1oc2ccccc2c1` seems appropriate for capturing benzofuran structures. The feature matrix shows all 0s, indicating no matches, which might be due to the pattern not fully capturing the intended structures.

**Rule 8**: Modifiers with a simple aliphatic chain and no additional functional groups.
- The SMARTS pattern `[CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4]` seems overly specific and might not match the intended structures. The feature matrix shows a match for one SMILES, which aligns with the rule.

**Rule 9**: Modifiers with a formyl group on an aromatic ring.
- The SMARTS pattern `[c][CX3H]=O` seems appropriate for capturing formyl groups on aromatic rings. The feature matrix shows matches for two SMILES, which aligns with the rule.

**Rule 10**: Modifiers with an ether linkage combined with an electron-withdrawing group.
- The SMARTS pattern `[OX2][CX4][OX2][CX4][OX2][CX4]` seems overly specific and might not match the intended structures. The feature matrix shows all 0s, indicating no matches, which might be due to the pattern not accurately reflecting the rule.

**Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group.
- The SMARTS pattern `[CX4](F)(F)F` seems appropriate for capturing trifluoromethyl groups. The feature matrix shows a match for one SMILES, which aligns with the rule.

**Rule 12**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on a long aliphatic chain.
- The SMARTS pattern `[OX2H][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4]` seems overly specific and might not match the intended structures. The feature matrix shows all 0s, indicating no matches, which might be due to the pattern not accurately reflecting the rule.

**Rule 13**: Modifiers with a methyl group on an aromatic ring.
- The SMARTS pattern `[c][CH3]` seems appropriate for capturing methyl groups on aromatic rings. The feature matrix shows a match for one SMILES, which aligns with the rule.

**Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on an aromatic ring and a formyl group.
- The SMARTS pattern `[c][OX2H][c][CX3H]=O` seems appropriate for capturing hydroxy and formyl groups on aromatic rings. The feature matrix shows a match for one SMILES, which aligns with the rule.

**Rule 15**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a pyridine ring.
- The SMARTS pattern `[n][c][c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` seems overly specific and might not match the intended structures. The feature matrix shows a match for one SMILES, which aligns with the rule.

** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: Review and refine the SMARTS patterns for each rule to ensure they accurately capture the intended chemical structures. Some patterns seem overly specific or not fully aligned with the natural language rules.
- ** Suggestion 2 **: Consider using more general SMARTS patterns for rules that are not matching any SMILES, as the current patterns might be too restrictive.
- ** Suggestion 3 **: Validate the SMARTS patterns against a broader set of test SMILES to ensure they are capturing the intended structures and yielding the expected feature matrix.
- ** Suggestion 4 **: For rules with complex structures, consider breaking down the SMARTS patterns into smaller, more manageable components that can be combined to capture the full structure.

Metric Commenter Message:
Based on the current rule metrics and comparing them to the reference metrics, here are some observations and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Confidence**: The current rule's train confidence is 0.6, which is relatively high compared to some of the previous rules. This indicates that the rule is correctly predicting the outcome 60% of the time when the conditions are met. However, there are previous rules with higher confidence, such as 0.7156 and 0.7043. This suggests that while the current rule is performing well, there is room for improvement to reach the higher confidence levels seen in some previous iterations.

2. **Lift**: The current rule's train lift is 1.1871, which is an improvement over some previous rules with lift values close to 1, indicating that the rule is providing a meaningful increase in the likelihood of the outcome compared to random chance. However, there are previous rules with higher lift values, such as 1.4389 and 1.4060, suggesting that the current rule could be further optimized to increase its impact.

3. **Leverage**: The current rule's train leverage is 0.0036, which is positive, indicating a stronger association than expected by chance. However, this leverage is lower than some previous rules, such as 0.0144 and 0.0146, suggesting that the rule could be improved to capture more of the additional support over what would be expected by chance.

4. **Support**: The current rule's train support is 0.0133, which is relatively low compared to some previous rules. This indicates that the rule applies to a smaller portion of the dataset. While high support is not always necessary, it can be beneficial to have rules that apply to a larger portion of the data to ensure broader applicability.

**Suggestions for Improvement**:
- **Refine Rule Conditions**: Consider refining the conditions of the current rules to capture more relevant instances, potentially increasing both support and confidence. This could involve exploring additional chemical structures or functional groups that might enhance the catalyst's performance.
  
- **Explore Combinations**: Investigate combinations of modifiers that might work synergistically to improve yield. This could lead to rules with higher lift and leverage by capturing interactions that are not currently being considered.

- **Focus on High-Impact Modifiers**: Prioritize modifiers that have shown high lift and confidence in previous iterations. This could involve focusing on specific functional groups or structural features that consistently lead to high yield.

- **Iterate and Validate**: Continue iterating on the rules, using cross-validation to ensure that improvements in metrics are not due to overfitting. This will help in identifying robust rules that generalize well to new data.

Overall, while the current rules are performing reasonably well, there is potential for further optimization to achieve higher confidence, lift, and leverage, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of the catalytic predictions.

### Performance Evaluation of Current Rules

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
   - The current rules seem to have limited effectiveness, as indicated by the validation accuracy of 0.4857. This is a decrease from previous accuracies, which were consistently around 0.6286 to 0.6286. The rules may not be capturing the complexity of the data effectively.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting:**
   - The consistent decrease in validation accuracy suggests potential underfitting. The rules might be too simplistic or not comprehensive enough to capture the underlying patterns in the data. The model's inability to generalize well to the validation set indicates that the rules may not be capturing all relevant features.

3. **Discrepancies Analysis:**
   - For molecules where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low, rules with high positive SHAP values (e.g., Rule 8, Rule 9, Rule 11) might be overestimating the loading. These rules may need refinement to reduce their influence on the predictions.
   - Conversely, for molecules where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, rules with high negative SHAP values (e.g., Rule 15) might be underestimating the loading. These rules may need adjustment to increase their influence on the predictions.

4. **Accuracy Improvements:**
   - The current accuracy metrics suggest limited improvement potential with the existing rules. The validation accuracy has not shown significant improvement over iterations, indicating that the current set of rules may have reached a local minimum.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**
   - SHAP analysis indicates that certain rules (e.g., Rule 8, Rule 9, Rule 11) consistently contribute to overestimated loadings, while others (e.g., Rule 15) contribute to underestimated loadings. This suggests that these rules may need to be refined or re-evaluated to improve model performance.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Overestimated Rules:**
   - Rules with high positive SHAP values for overestimated loadings, such as Rule 8, Rule 9, and Rule 11, should be refined. Consider incorporating additional conditions or constraints to reduce their influence on predictions.

2. **Adjust Underestimated Rules:**
   - Rules with high negative SHAP values for underestimated loadings, such as Rule 15, should be adjusted. Explore adding more features or modifying existing conditions to increase their impact on predictions.

3. **Improve Generalization:**
   - To address potential underfitting, consider expanding the feature set or introducing new rules that capture additional chemical properties or interactions. This could help the model better generalize to unseen data.

4. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - Use insights from SHAP analysis to iteratively refine the rules. Focus on rules that consistently show high SHAP values, either positive or negative, and evaluate their impact on model performance after adjustments.

5. **Incorporate Domain Knowledge:**
   - Collaborate with domain experts to incorporate additional chemical insights into the rules. This could involve identifying new chemical features or interactions that are not currently captured by the existing rules.

By implementing these recommendations, the model's performance on the validation set may improve, leading to more accurate predictions of modifier loading on catalysts.

### Possibility for Further Optimization

There is potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. By refining the rules based on SHAP analysis and incorporating additional domain knowledge, the model's performance on the validation set may improve, leading to more accurate predictions of modifier loading on catalysts.

    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with an aromatic ring and specific stereochemistry (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The stereochemistry and aromatic ring can enhance π-π interactions and stabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group directly adjacent to an aromatic ring with electron-withdrawing substituents like nitro or bromo groups (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid) are associated with high yield. These substituents can enhance the reactivity of the catalyst through electron-withdrawing effects.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups in sugar-like structures with specific stereochemistry (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid) tend to lead to high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups facilitate hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group or thioether (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) are associated with high yield. The sulfur-containing groups contribute to electron-donating ability, enhancing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and additional electron-donating groups at ortho or para positions (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) generally result in high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, potentially stabilizing the catalyst, especially when electron-donating groups are present.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a methoxy group adjacent to an aromatic ring, particularly when multiple methoxy groups are present and positioned ortho or para to each other (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), tend to result in high yield. The methoxy groups can donate electrons through resonance, potentially enhancing catalyst stability.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. The benzofuran ring can provide additional π-π interactions and electron delocalization, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a simple aliphatic chain and no additional functional groups (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of functional groups may limit interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a formyl group on an aromatic ring without any electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the formyl group may destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with an ether linkage combined with an electron-withdrawing group, especially when the ether linkage is extensive (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid), tend to result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing effect may reduce the catalyst's reactivity.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group without compensating electron-donating groups (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) are associated with low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing effect can destabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on a long aliphatic chain (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) generally result in low yield. The isolated hydroxy group may not sufficiently interact with the catalyst to enhance yield.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a methyl group on an aromatic ring without additional electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The lack of significant electron-donating effects may limit catalyst stabilization.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxy group on an aromatic ring and a formyl group (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) generally result in low yield. The electron-withdrawing formyl group may counteract the potential stabilizing effect of the hydroxy group.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a pyridine ring in the same molecule, especially when no additional stabilizing groups are present (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid), tend to result in low yield. The combination of these groups may lead to competitive binding or destabilization of the catalyst.
