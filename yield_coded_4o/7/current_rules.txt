**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group (COOH) attached to an aromatic ring, especially when combined with strong electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (NO2), tend to result in high yield. These groups can stabilize the Fe ion in the catalyst. Example: 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with an amino acid structure that includes additional aromatic or heteroaromatic groups, such as indole or phenyl, tend to result in high yield. These groups enhance coordination with the metal center, improving catalyst activity. Example: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a thiol group (SH) tend to result in high yield, especially when combined with other functional groups that enhance metal coordination, such as carboxylic acids. Example: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure, tend to result in high yield. These groups can form strong hydrogen bonds, potentially stabilizing the catalyst structure. Example: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield due to enhanced metal coordination. Example: pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (CF3) tend to result in low yield unless they are part of a larger electron-withdrawing system that can stabilize the catalyst. Example: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with an aldehyde group (CHO) on an aromatic ring tend to result in low yield unless they are part of a structure that includes additional electron-donating groups that can mitigate the negative impact of the aldehyde. Example: 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a methoxy group (OCH3) on an aromatic ring tend to result in low yield unless they are combined with other strong electron-withdrawing groups that can offset the electron-donating nature of the methoxy group. Example: 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a linear aliphatic chain of more than six carbon atoms without additional functional groups tend to result in low yield, possibly due to insufficient interaction with the catalyst. Example: octanoic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with an acetamido group (NHCOCH3) combined with an amino group (NH2) on a linear aliphatic chain tend to result in low yield. This combination may not provide sufficient interaction with the catalyst. Example: (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group (COOH) and an ether linkage (O) in a linear chain tend to result in low yield, possibly due to insufficient coordination with the catalyst. Example: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a benzoic acid structure and an additional hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring tend to result in low yield, potentially due to competitive binding or deactivation of the catalyst. Example: 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and a thiol group tend to result in high yield due to enhanced metal coordination and stabilization of the catalyst. Example: 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a nitro group (NO2) on an aromatic ring tend to result in high yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group can stabilize the Fe ion in the catalyst, enhancing its reactivity. Example: 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group (SH) and an aromatic ring tend to result in high yield due to enhanced metal coordination and stabilization of the catalyst. Example: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.
