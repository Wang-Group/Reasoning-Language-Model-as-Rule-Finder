- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group (-SH) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) tend to result in a high yield. This is seen in compounds like 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid. The presence of additional electron-withdrawing groups like nitro (-NO2) can enhance this effect. (Retained from current rules with advice considered)

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with an amino group directly attached tend to result in a high yield. This is observed in compounds like pyridine-3-carboxylic acid. (Revised based on advice)

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a nitro group (-NO2) tend to result in a high yield, especially when combined with other electron-donating groups such as hydroxyl (-OH) or amino (-NH2). (Retained from current rules with advice considered)

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) tend to result in a low yield, unless they are part of a larger aromatic system with multiple electron-donating groups that can counteract the electron-withdrawing nature of the formyl group. (Retained from current rules with advice considered)

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) tend to result in a high yield. This is seen in compounds like (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid. (Retained from current rules with advice considered)

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a benzene ring and a methoxy group (-OCH3) directly attached to the ring tend to result in a low yield, unless the methoxy group is part of a larger network of electron-donating groups. (Retained from current rules with advice considered)

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a fluorinated alkyl chain tend to result in a low yield, but this effect can be mitigated if the fluorinated chain is part of a larger, complex structure with multiple electron-donating groups. (Retained from current rules with advice considered)

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with an indole group tend to result in a high yield. This is observed in compounds like (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid. (Retained from current rules)

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with an alkyl chain longer than five carbons and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a low yield, regardless of other functional groups present. This is seen in compounds like octanoic acid and 7-aminoheptanoic acid. (Retained from current rules with advice considered)

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with both electron-donating groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) and electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, formyl) on the same aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield due to balanced electronic effects. (Retained from current rules with advice considered)

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with an ether linkage (-O-) in combination with a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a low yield. This is seen in compounds like 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid. (Retained from current rules with advice considered)

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a benzene ring and a sulfanyl group (-SH) directly attached tend to result in a low yield. This is observed in compounds like 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid. (Retained from current rules with advice considered)

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a high yield. This is seen in compounds like 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid. (Retained from current rules with advice considered)

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a benzene ring and a formyl group (-CHO) directly attached tend to result in a low yield. This is observed in compounds like 4-formylbenzoic acid. (Retained from current rules with advice considered)
