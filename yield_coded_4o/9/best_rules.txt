**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an amino group (-NH2) on a linear aliphatic chain tend to result in a high yield. This is likely due to the ability of these groups to coordinate with the metal centers, enhancing the catalytic activity. (e.g., 5-aminopentanoic acid)

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an additional functional group such as a hydroxyl (-OH) or amino (-NH2) group on the phenyl ring tend to result in a high yield. The aromatic ring can provide stability and electronic effects that enhance the reaction. (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid)

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a sulfur-containing group such as a thiol (-SH) or sulfanyl group tend to result in a high yield. These groups can form strong interactions with metal centers, potentially stabilizing the active catalytic species. (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid)

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on a linear or cyclic aliphatic chain tend to result in a high yield. The multiple hydroxyl groups can enhance solubility and interaction with the catalyst. (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid)

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring attached to a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a low yield. The pyridine ring can potentially interfere with the coordination environment of the metal center, reducing catalytic efficiency. (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, pyridine-3-carboxylic acid)

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing fluorinated alkyl chains tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of fluorine can reduce the nucleophilicity of the modifier, potentially hindering effective interaction with the catalyst. (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid)

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield. The formyl group can act as an electron-withdrawing group, potentially destabilizing the interaction with the catalyst. (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid)

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with an ether linkage (e.g., -O-CH2-CH2-O-) tend to result in a low yield. The presence of ether linkages may lead to steric hindrance or reduced ability to coordinate effectively with the metal centers. (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid)

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with an indole group attached to an amino acid backbone tend to result in a high yield. The indole group can provide additional π-π interactions and electronic effects that stabilize the catalyst. (e.g., (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid)

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. The nitro group can enhance the electron-withdrawing capacity of the aromatic ring, potentially facilitating better interaction with the catalyst. (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid)
