**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an amino group (-NH2) on a linear aliphatic chain with a chain length of 4 to 6 carbons, where the chain is unbranched, tend to result in a high yield. The linear structure allows for optimal coordination with metal centers. (e.g., 5-aminopentanoic acid)

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an additional electron-donating group such as a hydroxyl (-OH) or amino (-NH2) group on the phenyl ring tend to result in a high yield. The electron-donating groups enhance the electron density on the aromatic ring, facilitating better interaction with the catalyst. (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid)

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a thiol (-SH) or sulfanyl group on a linear aliphatic chain tend to result in a high yield. The sulfur atom can form strong interactions with metal centers, enhancing catalytic stability. (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid)

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on a linear aliphatic chain, specifically with 4 to 6 hydroxyl groups, tend to result in a high yield. The hydroxyl groups enhance solubility and hydrogen bonding, which can improve catalyst interaction. (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid)

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring attached to a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a low yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can interfere with the coordination environment of the metal center, reducing catalytic efficiency. (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid)

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing fluorinated alkyl chains with more than three fluorine atoms tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of fluorine can decrease the nucleophilicity of the modifier, hindering effective interaction with the catalyst. (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid)

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to the para position of an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield. The formyl group acts as a strong electron-withdrawing group, destabilizing the interaction with the catalyst. (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid)

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with an ether linkage (e.g., -O-CH2-CH2-O-) that are linear and unbranched, with a total chain length of 4 to 6 atoms, tend to result in a low yield. The ether linkage can introduce steric hindrance and reduce effective coordination with metal centers. (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid)

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with an indole group attached to an amino acid backbone tend to result in a high yield. The indole group provides π-π interactions and electronic effects that stabilize the catalyst. (e.g., (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid)

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. The nitro group enhances the electron-withdrawing capacity of the aromatic ring, facilitating better interaction with the catalyst. (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid)

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a methyl group (-CH3) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield. The methyl group increases steric hindrance, reducing effective interaction with the catalyst. (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid)

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a benzofuran group attached to a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a high yield. The benzofuran group provides additional stability and electronic effects that enhance catalytic activity. (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid)

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a hydroxyl group (-OH) on a linear aliphatic chain with a chain length of 5 to 7 carbons, where the chain is unbranched, tend to result in a low yield. The presence of both groups may lead to competing interactions that destabilize the catalyst. (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid)

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group (-SH) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield. The presence of the sulfanyl group on the aromatic ring can lead to steric hindrance and reduced interaction with the catalyst. (e.g., 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid)

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a methoxy group (-OCH3) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield. The methoxy group can increase electron density but also introduces steric hindrance, reducing effective interaction with the catalyst. (e.g., 4-methoxybenzoic acid)
