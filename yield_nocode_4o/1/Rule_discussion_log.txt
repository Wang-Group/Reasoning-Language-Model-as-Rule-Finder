- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an aromatic carboxylic acid group (e.g., benzoic acid derivatives) tend to result in a high yield. This is likely due to the ability of the aromatic ring to stabilize intermediates or transition states. Examples include 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid and 4-aminobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with amino acids or derivatives, particularly those with additional functional groups like hydroxyl or indole, tend to result in a high yield. This may be due to the ability of these groups to coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid and (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a sulfanyl group (thiol) tend to result in a high yield. Thiol groups can interact strongly with metal centers, potentially enhancing catalyst stability or activity. Examples include 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid and 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups, such as polyols, tend to result in a high yield. These groups can form hydrogen bonds and coordinate with metal centers, potentially stabilizing the catalyst. An example is (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro groups on an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. These groups can stabilize negative charges in transition states. An example is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with long aliphatic chains without additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield. This may be due to a lack of specific interactions with the catalyst. Examples include octanoic acid and 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with ether linkages and no additional coordinating groups tend to result in a low yield. This could be due to limited interaction with the catalyst. An example is 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a high degree of fluorination tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of fluorine may destabilize intermediates or transition states. An example is 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with ketone groups on an aliphatic chain tend to result in a low yield. The ketone group may not interact effectively with the catalyst. An example is 4-oxoheptanedioic acid.

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an aromatic carboxylic acid group with ortho or para-positioned amino groups tend to result in a high yield. These positions allow for effective resonance stabilization and hydrogen bonding. Examples include 4-aminobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with amino acids or derivatives that have aromatic side chains, such as phenyl or indole groups, tend to result in a high yield. These structures can coordinate with metal centers and enhance catalytic activity. Examples include (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid and (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups in close proximity, such as vicinal diols or polyols, tend to result in a high yield. These groups can form strong hydrogen bonds and coordinate with metal centers, stabilizing the catalyst. An example is (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro groups on an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. These groups stabilize negative charges in transition states. An example is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.
