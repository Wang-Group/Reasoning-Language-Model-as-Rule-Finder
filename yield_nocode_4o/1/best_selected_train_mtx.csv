Rule 1: Modifiers containing an aromatic carboxylic acid group with additional electron-donating groups such as amino or hydroxyl groups tend to result in a high yield.,"Rule 2: Modifiers with amino acids or derivatives, especially those with aromatic side chains or additional functional groups like indole, tend to result in a high yield.","Rule 4: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups, such as polyols, tend to result in a high yield.",Rule 5: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro groups on an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield.,Rule 10: Modifiers with pyridine rings without additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield.,Rule 15: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure and additional carboxylic acid groups tend to result in a high yield.
