Rule 1: Modifiers containing an aromatic carboxylic acid group with ortho or para-positioned amino groups tend to result in a high yield.,"Rule 3: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups in close proximity, such as vicinal diols or polyols, tend to result in a high yield.",Rule 4: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro groups on an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield.,Rule 9: Modifiers with pyridine rings without additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield.,Rule 10: Modifiers with formyl groups on an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield.,Rule 13: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure and additional carboxylic acid groups tend to result in a high yield.
