"Rule 1: Modifiers containing both carboxylic acid and amino groups, especially when they can form stable chelate complexes, tend to result in high yield.","Rule 2: Modifiers with pyridine rings, particularly when paired with a carboxylic acid group, are associated with high yield.",Rule 3: Modifiers containing aromatic heterocycles such as indole tend to result in high yield.,Rule 4: Modifiers with hydroxyphenyl groups tend to result in high yield.,Rule 5: Modifiers with sulfanyl (thiol) groups tend to result in high yield.,Rule 6: Modifiers with formyl groups tend to result in low yield unless they are combined with adjacent electron-donating groups or specific aromatic systems.,Rule 7: Modifiers with trifluoromethyl groups tend to result in low yield.,Rule 8: Modifiers with long aliphatic chains tend to result in low yield.,Rule 9: Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic systems can result in high yield.,Rule 10: Modifiers with both hydroxy and carboxylic acid groups on an aromatic ring tend to result in low yield.,Rule 11: Modifiers with amino groups on aliphatic chains tend to result in low yield.,Rule 12: Modifiers with multiple electron-withdrawing groups tend to result in low yield.,Rule 13: Modifiers with methoxy groups adjacent to electron-withdrawing groups can result in higher yields.,Rule 14: Modifiers with benzofuran carboxylic acid structures tend to result in high yield.,Rule 15: Modifiers with acetamido groups adjacent to amino acids tend to result in low yield.
