**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both carboxylic acid and amino groups, especially when they can form stable chelate complexes, tend to result in high yield. The spatial arrangement allowing for chelation enhances coordination with the metal center, improving catalyst stability and reactivity.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with pyridine rings, particularly when paired with a carboxylic acid group, are associated with high yield. The pyridine nitrogen can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing aromatic heterocycles such as indole or benzofuran structures tend to result in high yield. The aromatic system can enhance π-π interactions with the catalyst, improving its stability and reactivity.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with hydroxyphenyl groups tend to result in high yield. The phenolic OH group can participate in hydrogen bonding, potentially stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with sulfanyl (thiol) groups tend to result in high yield. The thiol group can form strong bonds with metal centers, potentially stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with formyl groups tend to result in low yield unless they are combined with adjacent electron-donating groups such as methoxy or amino groups, which can stabilize the catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with trifluoromethyl groups tend to result in low yield. However, if these modifiers also contain strong electron-donating groups like methoxy or amino groups in close proximity, the negative impact can be mitigated.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with long aliphatic chains tend to result in low yield. The hydrophobic nature and steric bulk of long chains can hinder effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic systems can result in high yield due to enhanced π-π interactions with the catalyst, despite the presence of electron-withdrawing groups like nitro.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with both hydroxy and carboxylic acid groups on an aromatic ring tend to result in low yield unless there are additional stabilizing interactions, such as hydrogen bonding or π-π stacking, with the catalyst.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with amino groups on aliphatic chains tend to result in low yield. However, if these amino groups are adjacent to aromatic or electron-withdrawing groups, they can enhance coordination with the metal center.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with multiple electron-withdrawing groups, such as nitro and trifluoromethyl, tend to result in low yield unless counteracted by strong electron-donating groups or specific structural features that enhance catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with methoxy groups adjacent to electron-withdrawing groups can result in higher yields compared to those without such adjacent groups.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with benzofuran carboxylic acid structures tend to result in high yield. The benzofuran structure can facilitate π-π stacking and stabilize the catalyst.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with acetamido groups adjacent to amino acids tend to result in low yield. The presence of both acetamido and amino groups can lead to steric hindrance and reduced coordination with the metal center.
