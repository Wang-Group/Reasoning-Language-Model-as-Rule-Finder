"Rule 1: Modifiers containing both carboxylic acid and amino groups, especially when they can form stable chelate complexes, tend to result in high yield.",Rule 3: Modifiers containing aromatic heterocycles such as indole or benzofuran structures tend to result in high yield.,"Rule 6: Modifiers with formyl groups tend to result in low yield unless they are combined with adjacent electron-donating groups such as methoxy or amino groups, which can stabilize the catalyst interaction.",Rule 7: Modifiers with trifluoromethyl groups tend to result in low yield.
