It is supported by multiple data points (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid), showing high yield. The rule is simple yet effective, scoring well on clarity, property insight, and coverage. Score: 4.5/5.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear and provides insight into the effect of phenyl groups with strong electron-withdrawing groups. It is supported by data points like 4-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, both showing high yield. The rule is straightforward and well-supported. Score: 4.5/5.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear and provides insight into pyridine rings with electron-donating groups. It is supported by pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, which shows a high yield. The rule is simple and effective, but could benefit from more data points. Score: 4/5.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear and provides insight into the effect of multiple ether linkages. It is supported by 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, which shows a low yield. The rule is clear but lacks multiple supporting data points. Score: 3.5/5.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear and provides insight into formyl groups on aromatic rings. It is supported by 4-formylbenzoic acid, which shows a low yield. The rule is clear but lacks multiple supporting data points. Score: 3.5/5.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear and provides insight into sulfur-containing groups with carboxylic acids. It is supported by 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid, which shows a high yield. The rule is clear but could benefit from more data points. Score: 4/5.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear and provides insight into indole groups. It is supported by (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid, which shows a high yield. The rule is clear but lacks multiple supporting data points. Score: 4/5.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear and provides insight into long aliphatic chains. It is supported by octanoic acid and 7-aminoheptanoic acid, both showing low yield. The rule is straightforward and well-supported. Score: 4.5/5.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear and provides insight into hydroxyl and carboxylic acid groups in linear chains. It is supported by 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, which shows a high yield. The rule is clear but could benefit from more data points. Score: 4/5.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear and provides insight into trifluoromethyl groups. It is supported by 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid, which shows a low yield. The rule is clear but lacks multiple supporting data points. Score: 3.5/5.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear and provides insight into benzofuran or pyrazole rings. It is supported by 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid and 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, both showing high yield. The rule is straightforward and well-supported. Score: 4.5/5.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is clear and provides insight into benzoic acid cores with electron-donating groups. It is supported by 4-aminobenzoic acid, which shows a high yield. The rule is clear but could benefit from more data points. Score: 4/5.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear and provides insight into pyridine rings with carboxylic acids. It is supported by 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, which shows a low yield. The rule is clear but lacks multiple supporting data points. Score: 3.5/5.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 is clear and provides insight into carboxylic acids with secondary amines. It is supported by 8-aminooctanoic acid, which shows a low yield. The rule is clear but lacks multiple supporting data points. Score: 3.5/5.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 is clear and provides insight into phenyl groups with methoxy groups. It is supported by 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid, which shows a low yield. The rule is clear but lacks multiple supporting data points. Score: 3.5/5.
