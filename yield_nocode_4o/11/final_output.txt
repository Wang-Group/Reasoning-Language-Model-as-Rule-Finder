    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino group (-NH2) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) tend to result in a high yield. This rule covers compounds like (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid, and 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid group (e.g., benzoic acid derivatives) tend to have variable effects on yield. However, if the phenyl group is substituted with electron-withdrawing groups like nitro (-NO2), the yield is high, as seen in 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing hydroxyl groups (-OH) and carboxylic acid groups, especially in a linear chain, tend to result in a high yield. This is observed in compounds like 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (e.g., polyether chains) tend to result in a low yield. This is seen in compounds like 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring tend to result in a high yield, especially when the pyridine is directly attached to a carboxylic acid group, as seen in pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing a formyl group (-CHO) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield. This is observed in compounds like 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid and 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in a low yield, as seen in 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group, such as thiol (-SH) or thioether, tend to result in a high yield. This is observed in 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with an indole group tend to result in a high yield, as seen in (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain without additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield, as seen in octanoic acid and 7-aminoheptanoic acid.

    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both an amino group (-NH2) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) with additional electron-donating groups such as hydroxyl (-OH) tend to result in a high yield. This rule covers compounds like (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid and (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid. (Refined to consider spatial arrangement and additional functional groups)

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid group and substituted with strong electron-withdrawing groups like nitro (-NO2) or halogens (e.g., bromine) tend to result in a high yield. Consideration of the position of electron-withdrawing groups and potential steric hindrance effects is included. This is observed in 4-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring directly attached to a carboxylic acid group, especially when substituted with electron-donating groups, tend to result in a high yield. This is seen in pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (e.g., polyether chains) and no additional electron-withdrawing groups tend to result in a low yield. This is seen in compounds like 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to an aromatic ring and lacking other electron-donating groups tend to result in a low yield. Exceptions are made for cases where the formyl group is adjacent to other functional groups that enhance reactivity. This is observed in compounds like 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid and 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group, such as thiol (-SH) or thioether, combined with a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a high yield. This is observed in 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with an indole group tend to result in a high yield, as seen in (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain without additional functional groups or with weak electron-withdrawing groups tend to result in a low yield, as seen in octanoic acid and 7-aminoheptanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing both hydroxyl groups (-OH) and carboxylic acid groups in a linear chain, especially when the hydroxyl group is on an aromatic ring, tend to result in a high yield. This is observed in 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in a low yield, as seen in 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a benzofuran or pyrazole ring attached to a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a high yield. Consideration of electronic effects of substituents on these rings is included. This is seen in 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid and 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a benzoic acid core structure and additional electron-donating groups such as amino (-NH2) or hydroxyl (-OH) tend to result in a high yield. This is observed in 4-aminobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring substituted with a carboxylic acid group and lacking additional electron-withdrawing groups tend to result in a low yield. This is seen in 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a secondary amine group in a linear chain tend to result in a low yield. This is observed in 8-aminooctanoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a phenyl group substituted with methoxy groups (-OCH3) and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a low yield. This is seen in 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.

    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both an amino group (-NH2) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) without strong electron-withdrawing groups tend to result in a high yield. This is observed in compounds like (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid and (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid group and substituted with strong electron-withdrawing groups like nitro (-NO2) or halogens (e.g., bromine) tend to result in a high yield. This is seen in 4-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring directly attached to a carboxylic acid group, especially when substituted with electron-donating groups such as hydroxyl (-OH) or amino (-NH2), tend to result in a high yield. This is seen in pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages (e.g., polyether chains) and no additional electron-withdrawing groups tend to result in a low yield. This is seen in compounds like 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to an aromatic ring and lacking other electron-donating groups tend to result in a low yield. However, if the aromatic ring has additional electron-donating groups, the yield may not be adversely affected.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group, such as thiol (-SH) or thioether, combined with a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a high yield. This is observed in 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with an indole group tend to result in a high yield, as seen in (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain without additional functional groups or with weak electron-withdrawing groups tend to result in a low yield, as seen in octanoic acid and 7-aminoheptanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing both hydroxyl groups (-OH) and carboxylic acid groups in a linear chain, especially when the hydroxyl group is on an aromatic ring, tend to result in a high yield. This is observed in 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in a low yield, as seen in 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a benzofuran or pyrazole ring attached to a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a high yield. This is seen in 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid and 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a benzoic acid core structure and additional electron-donating groups such as amino (-NH2) or hydroxyl (-OH) tend to result in a high yield. This is observed in 4-aminobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring substituted with a carboxylic acid group and lacking additional electron-withdrawing groups tend to result in a low yield. However, the presence of electron-donating groups can enhance the yield.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a secondary amine group in a linear chain tend to result in a low yield. This is observed in 8-aminooctanoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a phenyl group substituted with methoxy groups (-OCH3) and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a low yield. This is seen in 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.
