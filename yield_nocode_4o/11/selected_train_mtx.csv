Rule 1: Modifiers containing both an amino group (-NH2) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) without strong electron-withdrawing groups tend to result in a high yield.,Rule 5: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to an aromatic ring and lacking other electron-donating groups tend to result in a low yield.,Rule 8: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain without additional functional groups or with weak electron-withdrawing groups tend to result in a low yield.,"Rule 9: Modifiers containing both hydroxyl groups (-OH) and carboxylic acid groups in a linear chain, especially when the hydroxyl group is on an aromatic ring, tend to result in a high yield.",Rule 11: Modifiers with a benzofuran or pyrazole ring attached to a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a high yield.,Rule 12: Modifiers with a benzoic acid core structure and additional electron-donating groups such as amino (-NH2) or hydroxyl (-OH) tend to result in a high yield.,Rule 15: Modifiers with a phenyl group substituted with methoxy groups (-OCH3) and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a low yield.
