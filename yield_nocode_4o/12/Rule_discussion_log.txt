- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with a carboxylic acid group (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid) tend to result in high yield. This is likely due to the ability of amino acids to coordinate with metal centers, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid) generally lead to high yield. The aromatic ring can provide additional stabilization through π-π interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, pyridine-3-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can act as a ligand, enhancing the coordination with the metal center.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid) are associated with high yield. Hydroxyl groups can form hydrogen bonds, potentially stabilizing the catalyst structure.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing sulfur groups (e.g., 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid, 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) tend to result in low yield. Sulfur can lead to deactivation of the catalyst through strong binding or poisoning.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) generally lead to low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of fluorine can reduce the electron density available for coordination with the metal center.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with formyl groups (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid, 4-formylbenzoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The formyl group can act as an electron-withdrawing group, destabilizing the catalyst complex.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with nitro groups (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid) tend to result in high yield. The nitro group can participate in electron transfer processes, potentially enhancing the catalytic cycle.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with alkyl chains longer than six carbons (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) generally lead to low yield. Longer alkyl chains may cause steric hindrance, reducing the efficiency of the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with methoxy groups on aromatic rings (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid) tend to result in high yield. Methoxy groups can donate electron density to the aromatic ring, stabilizing the catalyst complex.

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with a carboxylic acid group and an additional hydroxyl group (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid) tend to result in high yield. The combination of these groups enhances coordination and stabilization of the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid and a hydroxyl or amino substituent on the phenyl ring (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid) generally lead to high yield. These substituents enhance π-π interactions and electron donation.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with additional electron-donating groups (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. The pyridine nitrogen and electron-donating groups enhance coordination with the metal center.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on a short carbon chain (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid) are associated with high yield. The hydroxyl groups form hydrogen bonds, stabilizing the catalyst structure.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with sulfur groups without additional stabilizing groups (e.g., 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid) tend to result in low yield. Sulfur can lead to deactivation of the catalyst through strong binding or poisoning.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with formyl groups on aromatic rings without additional electron-donating groups (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The formyl group acts as an electron-withdrawing group, destabilizing the catalyst complex.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with nitro groups on aromatic rings (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid) tend to result in high yield. The nitro group can participate in electron transfer processes, enhancing the catalytic cycle.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with alkyl chains longer than six carbons and without compensating functional groups (e.g., octanoic acid) generally lead to low yield. Longer alkyl chains cause steric hindrance, reducing catalyst efficiency.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with methoxy groups on aromatic rings and additional electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid) tend to result in high yield. Methoxy groups donate electron density, stabilizing the catalyst complex.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with benzofuran or similar heterocyclic structures and additional electron-donating groups (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. These structures provide π-π interactions and electronic stabilization.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with acetamido groups and additional steric hindrance (e.g., (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The acetamido group introduces steric hindrance, reducing effective coordination with the metal center.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups such as trifluoromethyl without additional stabilizing interactions (e.g., 2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl) tend to result in low yield. These groups decrease electron density, reducing coordination with the metal center.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with hydroxyl groups on long alkyl chains without additional stabilizing groups (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The hydroxyl group may not provide sufficient stabilization when distanced by a long alkyl chain.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a combination of a carboxylic acid group and a pyridine ring without additional electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The lack of additional electron-donating groups limits effective coordination.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a benzene ring containing both electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid) tend to result in high yield. The balance of these groups can stabilize the catalyst through resonance and inductive effects.
