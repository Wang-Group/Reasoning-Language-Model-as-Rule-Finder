"Rule 1: Modifiers containing both a carboxylic acid group (COOH) and an amino group (NH2) in close proximity, particularly in a non-aromatic context with a carbon chain length of 3 to 5 atoms, tend to result in a high yield.",Rule 2: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid group that also contain electron-donating groups such as amino (NH2) or hydroxy (OH) groups tend to result in a high yield.,Rule 3: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group (SH) in a non-aromatic context tend to result in a low yield.,"Rule 6: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with electron-donating substituents, particularly at the 3 or 4 positions, tend to result in a high yield.",Rule 7: Modifiers with an indole group tend to result in a high yield.,Rule 11: Modifiers with a nitro group (NO2) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield.,Rule 13: Modifiers with a tertiary alcohol group in a branched aliphatic chain tend to result in a low yield.
