"Rule 1: Modifiers containing both a carboxylic acid group (COOH) and an amino group (NH2) in close proximity, particularly in a non-aromatic context with a carbon chain length of 3 to 5 atoms, tend to result in a high yield.",Rule 2: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid group that also contain electron-donating groups such as amino (NH2) or hydroxy (OH) groups tend to result in a high yield.,Rule 3: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group (SH) in a non-aromatic context tend to result in a low yield.,Rule 4: Modifiers with a formyl group (CHO) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield.,Rule 5: Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains tend to result in a low yield.,"Rule 6: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with electron-donating substituents, particularly at the 3 or 4 positions, tend to result in a high yield.",Rule 7: Modifiers with an indole group tend to result in a high yield.,"Rule 8: Modifiers with heterocyclic structures other than pyridine or indole, such as pyrazole, tend to result in a high yield.",Rule 9: Modifiers with a hydroxy group (OH) on a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbon atoms) tend to result in a low yield.,"Rule 10: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages, especially in long chains, tend to result in a low yield.",Rule 11: Modifiers with a nitro group (NO2) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield.,Rule 12: Modifiers with an aromatic ring substituted with both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups tend to result in a low yield if the electron-withdrawing effects dominate.,Rule 13: Modifiers with a tertiary alcohol group in a branched aliphatic chain tend to result in a low yield.,"Rule 14: Modifiers with an aromatic ring containing a carboxylic acid group and an additional electron-withdrawing group, such as a trifluoromethyl group, tend to result in a low yield.",Rule 15: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbon atoms) and an amino group tend to result in a low yield.
