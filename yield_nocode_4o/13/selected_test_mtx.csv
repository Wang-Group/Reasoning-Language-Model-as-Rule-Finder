"Rule 1: Modifiers containing both a carboxylic acid group (COOH) and an amino group (NH2) in close proximity, particularly in a non-aromatic context with a carbon chain length of 3 to 5 atoms, tend to result in a high yield.","Rule 3: Modifiers with a pyridine ring, regardless of the position of electron-donating substituents, tend to result in a high yield.",Rule 12: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbon atoms) and an amino group tend to result in a low yield.
