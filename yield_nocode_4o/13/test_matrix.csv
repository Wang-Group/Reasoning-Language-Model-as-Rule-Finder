"Rule 1: Modifiers containing both a carboxylic acid group (COOH) and an amino group (NH2) in close proximity, particularly in a non-aromatic context with a carbon chain length of 3 to 5 atoms, tend to result in a high yield.","Rule 2: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid group that also contain electron-donating groups such as amino (NH2) or hydroxy (OH) groups tend to result in a high yield, unless there are additional electron-withdrawing groups present.","Rule 3: Modifiers with a pyridine ring, regardless of the position of electron-donating substituents, tend to result in a high yield.",Rule 4: Modifiers with an indole group tend to result in a high yield.,"Rule 5: Modifiers with heterocyclic structures other than pyridine or indole, such as pyrazole, tend to result in a high yield.",Rule 6: Modifiers with a nitro group (NO2) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield.,"Rule 7: Modifiers with a formyl group (CHO) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield, unless the aromatic system is heavily substituted with electron-donating groups that can mitigate the electron-withdrawing effects.",Rule 8: Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains tend to result in a low yield.,Rule 9: Modifiers with a hydroxy group (OH) on a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbon atoms) tend to result in a low yield.,"Rule 10: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages, especially in long chains, tend to result in a low yield.","Rule 11: Modifiers with an aromatic ring containing a carboxylic acid group and an additional electron-withdrawing group, such as a trifluoromethyl group, tend to result in a low yield.",Rule 12: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbon atoms) and an amino group tend to result in a low yield.,Rule 13: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure tend to result in a high yield.,Rule 14: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group (SH) attached to a short aliphatic chain (3 to 5 carbon atoms) tend to result in a high yield.,Rule 15: Modifiers with an aromatic ring containing both a carboxylic acid group and a sulfanyl group (SH) tend to result in a low yield.
