Rule 1: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with an aliphatic or aromatic side chain tend to result in a high yield.,Rule 2: Modifiers with a benzoic acid core and additional electron-withdrawing groups such as bromine or nitro groups tend to result in a high yield.,"Rule 4: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups, especially in a sugar-like structure, tend to result in a high yield.",Rule 6: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and additional electron-donating groups tend to result in a high yield.,Rule 8: Modifiers with a formyl group attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield.,Rule 11: Modifiers with a methoxy group on an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield.
