**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with an aromatic side chain, particularly those with electron-rich characteristics, such as (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid, tend to result in a high yield. This rule is retained due to its specificity and effectiveness.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a benzoic acid core and additional strong electron-withdrawing groups, such as nitro groups, tend to result in a high yield. This rule is expanded to include a broader range of electron-withdrawing groups, considering steric factors and the overall electronic environment.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on an aromatic ring, especially in a para position, such as 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, tend to result in a high yield. This rule is maintained due to its broad coverage of high-yielding modifiers.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups in a sugar-like structure, such as (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid, tend to result in a high yield. This rule is refined to consider the spatial arrangement of hydroxyl groups and their potential to form intramolecular hydrogen bonds.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with sulfur-containing groups, such as sulfanyl or thiol groups, tend to result in a low yield. Examples include 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid and 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid. This rule is retained due to its clear prediction of low yield.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and hydroxyl groups in specific positions that enhance electron donation, such as pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, tend to result in a high yield. This rule is refined to focus on specific electron-donating groups.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains, such as 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid, tend to result in a low yield. This rule is retained due to its specificity.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a formyl group attached to an aromatic ring, especially when interacting with other electron-withdrawing groups, tend to result in a low yield. This rule is relaxed to consider the context of the formyl group and its position relative to other groups.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with ether linkages in a non-aromatic context, such as 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, tend to result in a low yield. This rule is retained due to its specificity.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with an acetamido group in an aliphatic context, such as (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, tend to result in a low yield. This rule is retained due to its specificity.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a methoxy group on an aromatic ring, such as 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid, tend to result in a high yield. This rule is added to cover additional high-yielding modifiers.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group attached to a short aliphatic chain, such as 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid, tend to result in a low yield. This rule is added to cover additional low-yielding modifiers.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group attached to a non-aromatic, long aliphatic chain, such as octanoic acid, tend to result in a high yield. This rule is added to cover additional high-yielding modifiers.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a formyl group attached to a phenolic structure, such as 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid, tend to result in a low yield. This rule is added to cover additional low-yielding modifiers.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and additional electron-withdrawing groups, such as 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, tend to result in a low yield. This rule is added to cover additional low-yielding modifiers.
