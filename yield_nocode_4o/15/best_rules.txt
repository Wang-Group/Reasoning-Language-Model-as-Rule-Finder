**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both a carboxylic acid group (–COOH) and an amino group (–NH2) in a configuration that allows for effective intramolecular hydrogen bonding, such as in a five or six-membered ring, tend to result in a high yield. This configuration stabilizes the modifier and enhances its interaction with the catalyst. Examples include (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid and 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl ring substituted with a hydroxyl group (–OH) and an additional electron-donating group, such as an alkyl chain, tend to result in a high yield. The electron-donating nature of these groups can stabilize the catalyst. Examples include 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a sulfanyl group (–SH) and a carboxylic acid group (–COOH) tend to result in a high yield, particularly when the sulfanyl group is positioned to form strong interactions with metal centers. Examples include 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a low yield unless the pyridine ring is substituted with electron-donating groups that can counteract the electron-withdrawing nature of the pyridine. Examples of low yield include 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a formyl group (–CHO) tend to result in a low yield unless accompanied by groups that can engage in stabilizing interactions, such as hydrogen bonding or π-π interactions, which can mitigate the negative effects. Examples of low yield include 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a nitro group (–NO2) on a phenyl ring tend to result in a high yield due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group, which may facilitate catalyst activation. An example is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbons) without additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield due to poor interaction with the catalyst. However, if the chain includes polar or charged groups that enhance solubility or binding, the yield can be high. Examples of low yield include octanoic acid and 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing multiple ether linkages (–O–) tend to result in a low yield due to steric hindrance or reduced interaction with the catalyst. An example is 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with an indole group tend to result in a high yield due to π-stacking interactions with the catalyst, enhancing stability and reactivity. An example is (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a benzofuran group tend to result in a high yield due to the aromatic nature of benzofuran, which can enhance π-π interactions with the catalyst. An example is 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring substituted with an electron-donating group such as an alkyl chain or amino group can result in a high yield by offsetting the electron-withdrawing effect of the pyridine. An example is pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group (–COOH) and a formyl group (–CHO) on the same aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield due to potential side reactions or catalyst deactivation. Examples include 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a phenyl ring substituted with both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups can result in variable yields, depending on the balance of these effects. An example of high yield is 4-nitrobenzoic acid, while low yield includes 4-methylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group (–OH) on a phenyl ring, especially when accompanied by other electron-withdrawing groups, tend to result in a low yield due to potential deactivation of the catalyst. An example is 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group (–COOH) and an additional electron-withdrawing group on the same aliphatic chain tend to result in a low yield due to destabilization of the catalyst interaction. An example is 4-oxoheptanedioic acid.
