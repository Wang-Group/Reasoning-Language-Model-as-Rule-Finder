Rule 1: Modifiers containing both a carboxylic acid group (–COOH) and an amino group (–NH2) in a configuration that allows for effective intramolecular hydrogen bonding,Rule 2: Modifiers with a phenyl ring substituted with a hydroxyl group (–OH) and an additional electron-donating group,Rule 3: Modifiers containing a sulfanyl group (–SH) and a carboxylic acid group (–COOH),Rule 4: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a low yield,Rule 5: Modifiers with a formyl group (–CHO) tend to result in a low yield,Rule 6: Modifiers with a nitro group (–NO2) on a phenyl ring tend to result in a high yield,Rule 7: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbons) without additional functional groups tend to result in a low yield,Rule 8: Modifiers containing multiple ether linkages (–O–) tend to result in a low yield,Rule 9: Modifiers with an indole group tend to result in a high yield,Rule 10: Modifiers with a benzofuran group tend to result in a high yield,Rule 11: Modifiers with a pyridine ring substituted with an electron-donating group such as an alkyl chain or amino group can result in a high yield,Rule 12: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group (–COOH) and a formyl group (–CHO) on the same aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield,Rule 13: Modifiers with a phenyl ring substituted with both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups can result in variable yields,"Rule 14: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group (–OH) on a phenyl ring, especially when accompanied by other electron-withdrawing groups, tend to result in a low yield",Rule 15: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group (–COOH) and an additional electron-withdrawing group on the same aliphatic chain tend to result in a low yield
