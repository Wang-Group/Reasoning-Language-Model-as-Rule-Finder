Rule 1: Modifiers containing both an amino group (-NH2) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) in a linear or slightly branched aliphatic chain tend to result in a high yield.,Rule 2: Modifiers with a phenyl group attached to a carboxylic acid group (-C6H4-COOH) and additional electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (-NO2) result in a high yield.,Rule 3: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) in a sugar-like structure or with additional polar groups tend to result in a high yield.,Rule 4: Modifiers with a pyridine ring result in a high yield when not substituted with strong electron-withdrawing groups.,Rule 5: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to a phenyl ring tend to result in a low yield.,"Rule 6: Modifiers containing ether linkages (e.g., -O-CH2-CH2-O-) tend to result in a low yield.",Rule 7: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in a low yield.,Rule 8: Modifiers with a benzofuranone structure tend to result in a high yield.,Rule 9: Modifiers with a methyl group attached to a phenyl ring tend to result in a low yield.,Rule 10: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group (-SH) attached to a short aliphatic chain tend to result in a high yield.,Rule 11: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group (-OH) on a phenyl ring tend to result in a high yield when the hydroxyl group is ortho or para to an electron-donating group.,Rule 12: Modifiers with an indole group tend to result in a high yield.,Rule 13: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a sulfanyl group (-SH) in a short aliphatic chain tend to result in a high yield.,Rule 14: Modifiers with a phenyl ring substituted with a hydroxyl group (-OH) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) tend to result in a high yield.,Rule 15: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and a carboxylic acid group attached directly to the ring tend to result in a high yield.
