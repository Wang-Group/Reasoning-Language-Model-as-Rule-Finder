- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid) tend to result in a high yield. This is likely due to the presence of both amino and carboxylic acid groups which can enhance coordination with the metal center.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a benzoic acid structure and additional electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The electron-withdrawing groups may stabilize the Fe ion in the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain without additional functional groups (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The lack of functional groups may reduce the interaction with the metal center.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a pyrazole ring (e.g., 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The pyrazole ring can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalyst stability.

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both amino and carboxylic acid groups, especially in an amino acid structure (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid), tend to result in a high yield. These groups enhance coordination with the metal center due to their ability to act as both donors and acceptors.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a benzoic acid structure and additional electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro or bromo (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. These groups can stabilize the Fe ion by withdrawing electron density, enhancing the catalytic activity.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and additional electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid) tend to result in a low yield. The electron-withdrawing groups can diminish the pyridine's coordination ability with the metal center, reducing its effectiveness.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a phenyl ring (e.g., 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid) tend to result in a high yield. The hydroxyl group can participate in hydrogen bonding, which may enhance interaction with the catalyst.
