"Rule 1: Modifiers containing both amino and carboxylic acid groups in an amino acid structure, with a preference for short-chain amino acids, tend to result in a high yield.",Rule 2: Modifiers with a benzoic acid structure and additional electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro or bromo tend to result in a high yield.,Rule 10: Modifiers with a pyrazole ring tend to result in a high yield.,Rule 11: Modifiers with a phenyl ring substituted with electron-donating groups such as methoxy tend to result in a high yield.,Rule 15: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and additional electron-donating groups tend to result in a high yield.
