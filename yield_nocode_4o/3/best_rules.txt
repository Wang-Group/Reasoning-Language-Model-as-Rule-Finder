**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both an amino group (-NH2) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) tend to result in a high yield. This is supported by compounds like (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid and 5-aminopentanoic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid group (-C6H4-COOH) often result in a high yield, especially when there are additional electron-donating groups like hydroxyl (-OH) or amino (-NH2) on the phenyl ring. Examples include 4-aminobenzoic acid and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a low yield. This is seen in compounds like 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid and pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers containing sulfur groups such as sulfanyl (-SH) or sulfonyl (-SO2-) in combination with a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a low yield. Examples include 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid and 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with multiple fluorine atoms, such as perfluorinated chains, tend to result in a low yield. This is observed in 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with formyl groups (-CHO) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield. Examples include 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a methoxy group (-OCH3) in combination with a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a low yield. This is seen in 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing a hydroxyl group (-OH) on a long aliphatic chain (more than 5 carbons) tend to result in a low yield. Examples include 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield. This is observed in 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a pyrazole ring and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a high yield. This is seen in 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a benzoic acid structure and additional electron-withdrawing groups such as trifluoromethyl (-CF3) tend to result in a low yield. An example is 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a high yield. This is seen in 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbons) and an amino group (-NH2) tend to result in a low yield. Examples include 7-aminoheptanoic acid and 8-aminooctanoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with an indole group and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a high yield. This is supported by (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a phenyl group and an oxo group (C=O) on the aliphatic chain tend to result in a high yield. An example is 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.
