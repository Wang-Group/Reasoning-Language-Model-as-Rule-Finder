Rule 1: Modifiers containing both an amino group (-NH2) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) tend to result in a high yield.,Rule 2: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid group (-C6H4-COOH) often result in a high yield.,Rule 3: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a low yield.,Rule 4: Modifiers containing sulfur groups such as sulfanyl (-SH) or sulfonyl (-SO2-) in combination with a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a low yield.,"Rule 5: Modifiers with multiple fluorine atoms, such as perfluorinated chains, tend to result in a low yield.",Rule 6: Modifiers with formyl groups (-CHO) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in a low yield.,Rule 7: Modifiers with a methoxy group (-OCH3) in combination with a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a low yield.,Rule 8: Modifiers containing a hydroxyl group (-OH) on a long aliphatic chain (more than 5 carbons) tend to result in a low yield.,Rule 9: Modifiers with a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring tend to result in a high yield.,Rule 10: Modifiers with a pyrazole ring and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a high yield.,Rule 11: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a high yield.,Rule 12: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbons) and an amino group (-NH2) tend to result in a low yield.,Rule 13: Modifiers with an indole group and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in a high yield.,Rule 14: Modifiers with a phenyl group and an oxo group (C=O) on the aliphatic chain tend to result in a high yield.,"Rule 15: Modifiers with both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups on an aromatic ring can have a synergistic effect, potentially leading to high yields."
