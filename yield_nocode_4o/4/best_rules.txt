**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with a carboxylic acid group and an aromatic ring, specifically phenyl or indole, tend to result in high yield. The presence of these structures enhances coordination with metal centers and stabilizes the catalytic site through π-π interactions. Consider steric hindrance and electronic effects for better prediction.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid and an electron-donating group such as amino or hydroxyl generally lead to high yield. The electron-donating groups increase electron density around the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. Analyze substituent positions for improved accuracy.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a hydroxyl group in conjunction with a carboxylic acid and an additional aromatic ring are associated with high yield. The hydroxyl group enhances solubility and interaction with the catalyst, while the aromatic ring provides additional stabilization.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a sulfur-containing group, such as thiol or sulfanyl, and an aromatic ring tend to result in high yield. Sulfur acts as a soft base, coordinating well with transition metals, and the aromatic ring stabilizes the active site. Consider the position of sulfur-containing groups relative to aromatic rings for better prediction.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with multiple ether linkages and no additional functional groups tend to result in low yield. The ether groups may interfere with the coordination of the modifier to the metal center, reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a high degree of fluorination and no additional coordinating groups generally lead to low yield. The electron-withdrawing nature of fluorine can destabilize the metal-ligand interaction.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with an indole or pyridine ring and an additional coordinating group tend to result in high yield. These heterocycles can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with formyl groups and no additional stabilizing groups are associated with low yield. Consider the presence of additional stabilizing groups or specific structural motifs that could mitigate the negative effects of formyl groups.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a simple aliphatic chain and a terminal carboxylic acid, lacking additional functional groups, tend to result in low yield. However, if the aliphatic chain is sufficiently long or branched, it may lead to higher yield due to increased hydrophobic interactions.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with both an amino and a carboxylic acid group but lacking aromatic or heterocyclic structures generally lead to low yield. The absence of aromatic stabilization may reduce the effectiveness of metal coordination.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and an electron-withdrawing group such as a nitro group tend to result in high yield. The electron-withdrawing group can enhance the acidity of the carboxylic acid, improving coordination with the metal center.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in low yield if there are no additional stabilizing groups. The lack of additional stabilizing groups may lead to insufficient coordination with the metal center.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure and a carboxylic acid group tend to result in high yield. The benzofuran structure can provide additional π-π interactions and stabilization.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and an electron-donating group such as an amino group tend to result in high yield. The electron-donating group enhances coordination with the metal center, increasing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a methoxy group on an aromatic ring tend to result in high yield. The methoxy group can enhance electron density and stabilization through resonance.
