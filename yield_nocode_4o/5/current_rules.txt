**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing an amino acid structure with a short, unbranched side chain (2-5 carbons) and a terminal carboxylic acid group, such as (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, tend to result in high yield. The compact structure and terminal carboxylic acid enhance interaction with the catalyst. Modifiers with branched side chains or longer than five carbons tend to result in low yield.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group directly attached to a carboxylic acid group and an electron-withdrawing substituent in the para position, such as a bromine or nitro group (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid), generally lead to high yield. The balance between electron-withdrawing and donating effects should be considered, with strong electron-withdrawing groups preferred. Hammett sigma values can be used to fine-tune predictions.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group in a simple aliphatic chain (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) tend to result in high yield. The sulfanyl group enhances interaction with the catalyst without steric hindrance. Modifiers with longer aliphatic chains or additional bulky groups tend to result in low yield. A maximum chain length of 3 carbons is suggested for high yield.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups in a linear arrangement (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid) tend to result in high yield. The linear arrangement enhances solubility and interaction with the catalyst. Modifiers with non-linear hydroxyl arrangements or additional bulky groups tend to result in low yield. Solubility parameters and hydrogen bonding potential should be considered.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a trifluoroacetyl group (e.g., 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid) tend to result in low yield. However, modifiers with additional electron-donating groups that can stabilize the catalyst environment may mitigate this effect. Electronic descriptors can help predict when these groups are beneficial.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a methoxy group on an aromatic ring, particularly in the para position (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), tend to result in high yield. Methoxy groups in the ortho or meta positions can also lead to high yield if accompanied by other electron-donating groups. Resonance and inductive effects should be considered.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain that lack solubility-enhancing groups (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The long chain reduces solubility or causes steric interference with the reaction. Modifiers with polar groups or shorter chains may improve yield. Solubility-enhancing descriptors should be used.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing an indole group (e.g., (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid) tend to result in high yield. The indole structure provides favorable π-π interactions or stabilizes the catalyst environment. Modifiers with additional electron-withdrawing groups on the indole ring may reduce yield. π-π interaction descriptors should be used.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a formyl group on an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The formyl group interferes with the reaction mechanism or catalyst stability. Modifiers with additional electron-donating groups may counteract this effect. Electronic descriptors should be used to refine predictions.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and electron-withdrawing groups such as carboxylic acid or nitro groups (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. The electron-withdrawing groups enhance interaction with the catalyst or stabilize the transition state. Modifiers with electron-donating groups on the pyridine ring may reduce yield. Descriptors for electron-withdrawing effects should be used.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a benzofuran structure (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. The benzofuran structure provides favorable interactions with the catalyst or stabilizes the reaction intermediates. Modifiers with additional bulky groups may reduce yield. Descriptors for π-π interactions and steric hindrance should be used.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a phenyl ring (e.g., 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid) tend to result in high yield. The hydroxyl group enhances hydrogen bonding or interaction with the catalyst. Modifiers with additional electron-withdrawing groups may reduce yield. Hydrogen bonding descriptors should be used.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group on an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The sulfanyl group interferes with the catalyst or reaction mechanism. Modifiers with additional electron-donating groups may mitigate this effect. Electronic descriptors should be used.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring without electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid) tend to result in low yield. The lack of electron-withdrawing groups reduces interaction with the catalyst. Modifiers with additional electron-withdrawing groups may improve yield. Descriptors for electron-withdrawing effects should be used.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a secondary amine in a cyclic structure (e.g., 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid) tend to result in high yield. The cyclic structure enhances stability and interaction with the catalyst. Modifiers with additional bulky groups may reduce yield. Descriptors for stability and interaction with the catalyst should be used.
