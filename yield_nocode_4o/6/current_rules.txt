**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an amino group (-NH2) on an aliphatic chain with less than 6 carbons, especially when the chain is branched or has specific stereochemistry, tend to result in a high yield. This is due to enhanced hydrogen bonding and spatial arrangement that facilitates interaction with the catalyst. (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, 5-aminopentanoic acid)

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group substituted with strong electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (-NO2) or halogens (e.g., bromine) tend to result in a high yield. These groups increase the electron-deficient nature of the catalyst, facilitating radical formation. (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid)

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) on a carbon chain, especially in a sugar-like structure with specific stereochemistry, tend to result in a high yield. These groups enhance solubility and interaction with the catalyst. Consider additional functional groups that may enhance these interactions. (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid)

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with additional electron-withdrawing groups such as carboxylic acid or halogens tend to result in a high yield. The nitrogen in the pyridine can coordinate with metal centers, and the electron-withdrawing groups enhance this interaction. Evaluate the impact of steric hindrance or specific electronic effects from additional substituents. (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid)

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group (-SH) tend to result in a high yield. The thiol group can form strong interactions with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance. (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid)

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a formyl group (-CHO) on a phenyl ring tend to result in a low yield. The formyl group can potentially deactivate the catalyst by forming stable complexes. (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid)

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a methoxy group (-OCH3) on an aliphatic chain tend to result in a low yield. The electron-donating nature of methoxy groups can interfere with the radical mechanism. (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid)

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbons) without any polar or reactive groups tend to result in a low yield. The lack of functional groups reduces interaction with the catalyst. (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid)

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) tend to result in a low yield unless combined with other electron-withdrawing groups that can stabilize the radical intermediates. (e.g., 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid)

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with an indole group tend to result in a high yield unless the indole is heavily substituted with bulky groups that hinder its stabilizing effect. (e.g., (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid)

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a benzofuranone group tend to result in a high yield. The benzofuranone structure can facilitate electron delocalization, enhancing radical stability. Consider the influence of substituents on the benzofuranone ring. (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid)

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a phenyl group substituted with a hydroxyl group (-OH) tend to result in a low yield. The presence of a hydroxyl group on a phenyl ring can lead to unwanted side reactions or deactivation of the catalyst. (e.g., 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid)

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a benzene ring substituted with a methyl group (-CH3) tend to result in a low yield. The methyl group can lead to steric hindrance, reducing the efficiency of the catalyst interaction. (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid)

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a benzene ring substituted with an amino group (-NH2) tend to result in a high yield. The amino group can enhance coordination with metal centers, stabilizing the catalyst. (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid)

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a combination of an amino group (-NH2) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) on a phenyl ring tend to result in a high yield. This combination can enhance coordination and stabilize the catalyst through multiple interactions. (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid)
