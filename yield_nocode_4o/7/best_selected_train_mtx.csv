"Rule 1: Modifiers containing both amino and carboxylic acid groups, especially when they are part of a short aliphatic chain (3-5 carbons), tend to result in high yield.",Rule 2: Modifiers with a benzene ring substituted with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro or bromomethyl tend to result in high yield.,Rule 3: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group on a short aliphatic chain (3-5 carbons) tend to result in high yield.,"Rule 4: Modifiers with a pyridine ring, especially when not substituted with additional electron-withdrawing groups, tend to result in high yield.",Rule 9: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbons) tend to result in low yield.,Rule 12: Modifiers with an indole group tend to result in high yield.
