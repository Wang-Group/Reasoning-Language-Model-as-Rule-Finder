**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both amino and carboxylic acid groups, especially when they are part of a short aliphatic chain (3-5 carbons) and the amino group is at the α or β position relative to the carboxylic acid, tend to result in high yield. This is observed in structures like 5-aminopentanoic acid and (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a benzene ring substituted with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro or bromomethyl tend to result in high yield, as seen in 4-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group on a short aliphatic chain (3-5 carbons) tend to result in high yield, as seen in 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring, especially when not substituted with additional electron-withdrawing groups, tend to result in high yield, as seen in pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with a formyl group on a benzene ring tend to result in low yield, unless there are electron-donating groups such as methoxy or amino groups elsewhere in the molecule that could mitigate this effect, as seen in 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with a hydroxyphenyl group tend to result in low yield, unless there are additional electron-withdrawing groups that could enhance the yield, as seen in 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid and 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a trifluoroacetyl group tend to result in low yield, as seen in 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with an oxo group adjacent to a carboxylic acid group tend to result in low yield, as seen in 4-oxoheptanedioic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbons) tend to result in low yield, unless there are branching or polar groups such as hydroxyl or amino groups that could improve yield, as observed in octanoic acid and 7-aminoheptanoic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with multiple methoxy groups on a phenyl ring tend to result in high yield, as observed in 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with an acetamido group tend to result in low yield, as observed in (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with an indole group tend to result in high yield, as seen in (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a benzene ring substituted with a pyridyl group tend to result in low yield, as seen in 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a benzene ring without additional electron-withdrawing groups tend to result in high yield, as seen in 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a benzene ring substituted with a carboxylic acid group and no additional electron-withdrawing groups tend to result in high yield, as seen in 4-aminobenzoic acid.
