    Metric Commenter Message:
Based on the current metrics, the performance of the rules has shown some improvement compared to the previous metrics. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Confidence**: The current train confidence is 0.7667, which is significantly higher than the previous train confidence values of 0.6352 and 0.5396. This indicates that the current rules are more reliable in predicting high yield outcomes when the conditions are met. The increase in confidence suggests that the rules are becoming more precise in identifying the conditions that lead to the desired outcome.

2. **Lift**: The current train lift is 1.5393, which is a substantial improvement over the previous train lift values of 1.2048 and 1.0559. A lift value greater than 1 indicates that the rule is useful and that the presence of the condition increases the likelihood of the outcome. The current lift value suggests that the rules are significantly better at identifying conditions that lead to high yield compared to random chance.

3. **Leverage**: The current train leverage is 0.0113, which is a positive value, indicating a stronger association between the conditions and the outcome than would be expected by chance. This is an improvement over the previous negative leverage values, which suggested weaker associations.

4. **Support**: The current train support is 0.0314, which is lower than the previous train support values. While this indicates that the rules apply to a smaller portion of the dataset, the increase in confidence and lift suggests that the rules are more targeted and effective for the specific cases they cover.

**Recommendations for Improvement**:

- **Expand Rule Coverage**: While the current rules are more precise, they apply to a smaller subset of the data. Consider exploring additional conditions or combinations of conditions that might capture more instances without sacrificing confidence and lift.

- **Refine Existing Rules**: Analyze the specific conditions in the current rules to see if any can be further refined or combined to increase their applicability while maintaining or improving their predictive power.

- **Explore New Patterns**: Investigate other chemical groups or structural features that might be associated with high or low yields. This could involve data mining techniques or domain expertise to identify potential new rules.

- **Iterative Testing**: Continue to test and validate the rules on different subsets of the data to ensure their robustness and generalizability. This can help in identifying any overfitting issues and ensure that the rules perform well on unseen data.

Overall, the current iteration shows promising improvements in the effectiveness of the rules, particularly in terms of confidence and lift. Further iterations should focus on expanding the applicability of the rules while maintaining their predictive strength.

Traditional Commenter Message:
### Performance Evaluation of Current Rules

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
   - The current validation accuracy of 0.5714 is significantly lower than the previous reference accuracies, which were consistently around 0.76. This suggests that the current rules are not as effective in predicting the loading of modifiers on catalysts.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment:**
   - The drop in validation accuracy indicates potential underfitting, where the model is not capturing the underlying patterns in the data effectively. This could be due to the rules not being comprehensive or specific enough to capture the nuances of the dataset.

3. **Discrepancies Analysis:**
   - For molecules where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, Rule 1 consistently shows a negative SHAP value, indicating it might be contributing to the underestimation. Similarly, Rule 8 also shows a negative SHAP value in these cases.
   - Conversely, for molecules where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low, Rule 1 shows a positive SHAP value, suggesting it might be overestimating the loading.

4. **Accuracy Improvements:**
   - The current accuracy metrics suggest that there is room for improvement. The significant drop in validation accuracy compared to previous iterations indicates that the current rules may not be capturing the necessary features effectively.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**
   - The SHAP analysis highlights that Rule 1 has a significant impact on the predictions, both positively and negatively. This suggests that Rule 1 might be too broad or not specific enough, leading to incorrect predictions.
   - Rule 8, which consistently shows a positive SHAP value for low predictions, might need refinement to better capture the conditions under which a high loading is expected.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Rule 1:**
   - Given its significant impact on predictions, Rule 1 should be refined to be more specific. Consider breaking it down into sub-rules that capture different aspects of amino and carboxylic acid groups' interactions with catalysts.

2. **Adjust Rule 8:**
   - Rule 8, which deals with formyl groups on benzene rings, should be revisited. Consider incorporating additional structural features or context that might influence the yield, such as the presence of other functional groups or steric effects.

3. **Improve Generalization:**
   - To address potential underfitting, consider expanding the feature set to include more diverse chemical properties or interactions that might influence the loading. This could involve incorporating additional rules or modifying existing ones to capture a broader range of chemical behaviors.

4. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - Use the insights from SHAP analysis to iteratively refine the rules. Focus on rules with high positive SHAP values for overestimated loadings and high negative SHAP values for underestimated loadings. This iterative process should aim to balance specificity and generalization to improve model performance.

5. **Incorporate Additional Data:**
   - If possible, incorporate additional data or features that might provide more context or information about the chemical interactions. This could help improve the model's ability to generalize and make accurate predictions across different scenarios.

   - The drop in validation accuracy indicates underfitting, where the model is not capturing the underlying patterns effectively. This could be due to the rules not being comprehensive or specific enough.

3. **Discrepancies Analysis:**
   - Rule 1 has a significant impact on predictions, both positively and negatively, indicating it might be too broad. Rule 8 also shows consistent positive SHAP values for low predictions, suggesting it might need refinement.

4. **Accuracy Improvements:**
   - The current accuracy metrics suggest room for improvement. The significant drop in validation accuracy compared to previous iterations indicates that the current rules may not be capturing the necessary features effectively.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**
   - Rule 1 might be overestimating or underestimating the loading due to its broad nature. Rule 8 might need additional context to better capture the conditions for high loading.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Rule 1:**
   - Break down Rule 1 into sub-rules that capture different aspects of amino and carboxylic acid groups' interactions with catalysts to increase specificity.

2. **Adjust Rule 8:**
   - Revisit Rule 8 to incorporate additional structural features or context, such as the presence of other functional groups or steric effects, to improve its accuracy.

3. **Improve Generalization:**
   - Expand the feature set to include more diverse chemical properties or interactions that might influence the loading, addressing potential underfitting.

4. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - Use SHAP analysis insights to iteratively refine the rules, focusing on rules with high positive SHAP values for overestimated loadings and high negative SHAP values for underestimated loadings.

5. **Incorporate Additional Data:**
   - If possible, incorporate additional data or features to provide more context or information about the chemical interactions, improving the model's ability to generalize.

### Possibility for Further Optimization

There is potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. The current rules can be refined and expanded to capture more nuanced interactions and improve generalization.

2. **Lift**: The current train lift is 1.7952, which is a notable improvement from the previous lift of 1.5393. A lift value significantly greater than 1 indicates that the presence of the rule conditions greatly increases the likelihood of the rule prediction occurring. This suggests that the current rules are more effective in identifying meaningful associations between the modifiers and the yield outcomes.

3. **Leverage**: The current train leverage is 0.0160, which is an improvement from the previous leverage of 0.0113. Positive leverage values indicate that the rules are capturing associations that are stronger than what would be expected by chance. The increase in leverage suggests that the rules are becoming more robust in identifying non-random associations.

4. **Support**: The train support has increased slightly to 0.04 from 0.0314. While support is not the primary focus, a slight increase indicates that the rules are applicable to a larger portion of the dataset, which can be beneficial for generalizability.

**Recommendations for Improvement**:
- **Refinement of Rules**: Continue refining the rules to further increase confidence and lift. This could involve exploring additional chemical groups or combinations that may influence yield.
- **Validation on Test Data**: While the train metrics are promising, it is crucial to validate these rules on a separate test dataset to ensure that the improvements are not due to overfitting.
- **Exploration of New Features**: Consider incorporating additional features or modifying existing ones to capture more complex interactions that may affect yield.
- **Iterative Testing**: Continue iterative testing and refinement to ensure that the rules are not only statistically significant but also practically applicable in real-world scenarios.

Overall, the current metrics suggest that the rules are moving in the right direction, with significant improvements in confidence and lift. Further iterations and validations will help solidify these findings and ensure the rules' applicability and reliability.

Traditional Commenter Message:
### Performance Evaluation of Current Rules

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
   - The current validation accuracy of 0.5714 is significantly lower than the previous reference accuracies, which were consistently around 0.76. This suggests that the current rules are not as effective in predicting the loading of modifiers on catalysts.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment:**
   - The drop in validation accuracy indicates potential underfitting, where the model is not capturing the underlying patterns in the data effectively. This could be due to the rules not being comprehensive or specific enough to capture the nuances of the dataset.

3. **Discrepancies Analysis:**
   - For molecules where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, Rule 1 consistently shows a negative SHAP value, indicating it might be contributing to underestimation. This suggests that Rule 1 might need refinement to better capture cases where high loading is expected.
   - Conversely, for molecules where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low, Rule 1 shows a positive SHAP value, indicating it might be overestimating the loading in some cases.

4. **Accuracy Improvements:**
   - The current accuracy metrics suggest that there is room for improvement in the rules. The significant drop in accuracy compared to previous iterations indicates that the current set of rules may not be capturing the necessary features or interactions effectively.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**
   - The SHAP analysis highlights Rule 1 as having a significant impact on the predictions, both positively and negatively. This suggests that Rule 1 is a critical rule that needs careful refinement to improve its predictive power.
   - Other rules, such as Rule 8, also show consistent negative SHAP values, indicating they might be contributing to underestimation and could be candidates for refinement.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Rule 1:**
   - Given its significant impact on predictions, Rule 1 should be refined to better differentiate between cases of high and low loading. This could involve incorporating additional structural features or interactions that are indicative of high loading.

2. **Adjust Rules with High Negative SHAP Values:**
   - Rules like Rule 8, which consistently show negative SHAP values, should be reviewed and adjusted. This might involve revisiting the chemical rationale behind these rules and considering additional factors that could influence loading.

3. **Improve Generalization:**
   - To address potential underfitting, consider expanding the feature set used to generate the rules. This could involve incorporating more diverse chemical features or interactions that are relevant to the loading process.

4. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - Use insights from the SHAP analysis to iteratively refine the rules. This could involve testing new hypotheses about chemical interactions and their impact on loading, and incorporating these into the rules.

5. **Incorporate Additional Data:**
   - If possible, incorporate additional data or domain knowledge to inform the rule refinement process. This could help in identifying new patterns or interactions that are not currently captured by the existing rules.

By focusing on these areas, the rules can be refined to improve their predictive accuracy and generalization, ultimately leading to better performance on both the training and validation sets.

    Train leverage: 0.012353741496598642
    -------------------------------------------------------

    Metric Commenter Message:
Based on the current rule metrics, we can observe the following:

1. **Train Support**: The current train support is 0.030476190476190476, which is slightly lower than the previous iteration's train support values (0.03142857142857143 and 0.04). This indicates that the current rules apply to a smaller portion of the training data compared to the previous rules. While support is important, it is not the primary focus here, as we are more interested in the confidence and lift metrics.

2. **Train Confidence**: The current train confidence is 0.8, which is a significant improvement over the previous iteration's train confidence values (0.7666666666666666 and 0.8977777777777778). This suggests that the current rules are more reliable in predicting the outcome when the conditions are met.

3. **Train Lift**: The current train lift is 1.6107843137254902, which is higher than the previous iteration's train lift values (1.5392701525054466 and 1.7952432824981848). A lift greater than 1 indicates that the rule is useful and that the presence of the condition increases the likelihood of the outcome. The current lift value suggests that the rules are effective in identifying associations that are stronger than random chance.

4. **Train Leverage**: The current train leverage is 0.012353741496598642, which is slightly lower than the previous iteration's leverage values (0.011346938775510204 and 0.016000000000000004). Positive leverage indicates a stronger association than expected by chance, and while the current leverage is positive, it is not as high as the previous iteration's best value. This suggests that there might be room for improvement in terms of identifying more impactful rules.

**Comments and Suggestions for Improvement:**

- **Focus on Lift and Confidence**: The current rules have shown improvement in both confidence and lift, which are crucial for determining the effectiveness of the rules. The lift value, in particular, indicates that the rules are identifying meaningful associations. Continuing to refine the rules to maintain or improve these metrics should be a priority.

- **Explore Additional Conditions**: To potentially increase support and leverage, consider exploring additional conditions or combinations of conditions that might apply to a larger portion of the dataset. This could help in identifying more impactful rules that apply to a broader range of data.

- **Iterate on Low-Yield Rules**: Some rules predict low yield, which might be less desirable. Consider revisiting these rules to see if there are additional conditions or modifications that could improve their predictive power or applicability.

- **Evaluate Rule Specificity**: Ensure that the rules are not overly specific, which could limit their applicability. Balancing specificity with generalizability can help in creating rules that are both accurate and widely applicable.

Overall, the current rules show promising improvements in confidence and lift, indicating that they are effective in identifying meaningful patterns. Further iterations should focus on maintaining these improvements while exploring ways to increase support and leverage.

Traditional Commenter Message:
### Performance Evaluation of Current Rules

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
   - The current validation accuracy of 0.5714 is significantly lower than the previous reference accuracies, which were consistently around 0.76. This suggests that the current rules are not as effective in predicting the loading of modifiers on catalysts.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting:**
   - The drop in validation accuracy indicates potential underfitting, where the model is not capturing the underlying patterns in the data effectively. This could be due to the rules not being comprehensive or precise enough to capture the complexity of the data.

3. **Discrepancies Analysis:**
   - For molecules where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, rules with high negative SHAP values are likely problematic. For instance, Rule 1 consistently shows negative SHAP values for these cases, indicating it might be underestimating the loading.
   - Conversely, for molecules where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low, rules with high positive SHAP values should be scrutinized. However, such cases are less frequent in the current dataset.

4. **Accuracy Improvements:**
   - The current accuracy metrics suggest that there is room for improvement. The consistent validation accuracy of 0.5714 across iterations indicates that the model might be stuck in a local minimum, and further refinement of rules is necessary.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**
   - SHAP analysis indicates that Rule 1 has a significant impact on predictions, often contributing negatively to the predicted loading. This suggests that Rule 1 might need refinement to better capture the conditions under which high loading occurs.
   - Rules with consistently low or zero SHAP values, such as Rule 2, might not be contributing effectively to the model and could be candidates for reevaluation or removal.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Rules with High Positive SHAP Values:**
   - For overestimated loadings, focus on refining Rule 1, which has high positive SHAP values in cases where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low. Consider adding more specific conditions or exceptions to this rule to improve its precision.

2. **Adjust Rules with High Negative SHAP Values:**
   - For underestimated loadings, particularly where Rule 1 shows high negative SHAP values, consider revising the rule to better capture the characteristics of molecules that lead to high experimental loadings. This might involve incorporating additional structural features or interactions.

3. **Improve Generalization:**
   - To address potential underfitting, consider expanding the feature set used to generate the rules. This could involve incorporating additional chemical properties or interactions that are currently not captured by the existing rules.

4. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - Use insights from SHAP analysis to iteratively refine the rules. For example, rules with consistently low SHAP values might be revised to include more relevant features or interactions, or they might be removed if they do not contribute meaningfully to the model.

5. **Evaluate Rule Effectiveness:**
   - Continuously evaluate the effectiveness of each rule by monitoring changes in SHAP values and accuracy metrics. This will help identify which rules are contributing positively to the model's performance and which need further refinement.

By implementing these recommendations, the model's ability to predict the loading of modifiers on catalysts should improve, leading to higher validation accuracies and more reliable predictions.

### Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimization

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
   - The current rules show improvements in confidence and lift, indicating they are effective in identifying meaningful patterns. However, the validation accuracy of 0.5714 is lower than previous reference accuracies, suggesting potential underfitting.

2. **Discrepancies and SHAP Analysis:**
   - Rule 1 has significant SHAP values, often contributing negatively to predictions, indicating it might need refinement.
   - Rules with low or zero SHAP values, such as Rule 2, may not be contributing effectively and could be candidates for reevaluation.

3. **Current Rule Metrics:**
   - The current train support is lower than previous iterations, indicating the rules apply to a smaller portion of the training data.
   - The train confidence and lift have improved, suggesting the rules are more reliable and effective in identifying associations.

### Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Refine Rule 1:**
   - Review Rule 1 to ensure all SMILES containing both amino and carboxylic acid groups are correctly identified, even if stereochemistry is not explicitly mentioned.
   - Consider adding more specific conditions or exceptions to improve its precision.

2. **Evaluate and Adjust Other Rules:**
   - Explore additional conditions or combinations of conditions to increase support and leverage.
   - Revisit rules predicting low yield to see if there are additional conditions or modifications that could improve their predictive power.

3. **Improve Generalization:**
   - Expand the feature set used to generate the rules by incorporating additional chemical properties or interactions.

4. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - Use SHAP analysis insights to iteratively refine the rules, focusing on those with consistently low SHAP values.

5. **Evaluate Rule Specificity:**
   - Ensure rules are not overly specific, balancing specificity with generalizability to create rules that are both accurate and widely applicable.

### Possibility for Further Optimization

There is potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. The current rules show promising improvements in confidence and lift, but the lower validation accuracy suggests that the model might not be capturing the underlying patterns effectively. By refining the rules and expanding the feature set, the model's performance can be improved.

    Metric Commenter Message:
Based on the current metrics and comparing them to the previous reference metrics, we can make several observations regarding the performance of the current rules:

1. **Confidence**: The current train confidence is 0.744, which is a significant improvement over the previous test confidence values of 0.333 and 0.463. This indicates that the current rules are more reliable in predicting high yield outcomes. The confidence levels in the current iteration are consistently higher than those in the previous reference metrics, suggesting that the rules are becoming more accurate.

2. **Lift**: The current train lift is 1.493, which is a substantial improvement over the previous test lift values of 0.688 and 0.913. A lift greater than 1 indicates that the rule is useful and provides more information than random guessing. The current lift values suggest that the rules are effectively identifying conditions that lead to high yield, as they are significantly better than the baseline probability.

3. **Leverage**: The current train leverage is 0.012, which is a positive value, indicating that the rules are capturing associations that are stronger than what would be expected by chance. This is an improvement over the previous test leverage values, which were negative, indicating weaker associations.

4. **Support**: The current train support is 0.036, which is lower than the previous train support values of 0.166 and 0.184. While support is lower, it is important to note that high support is not always necessary if confidence and lift are strong, as they indicate the rule's reliability and usefulness.

### Recommendations for Improvement:

- **Refinement of Rules**: Continue refining the rules to increase support without compromising confidence and lift. This could involve exploring additional chemical structures or modifiers that align with the existing high-confidence rules.

- **Balancing Support and Confidence**: While high confidence and lift are crucial, increasing support can help ensure that the rules apply to a broader range of data. Consider identifying common structural features or conditions that might increase the applicability of the rules.

- **Exploration of New Patterns**: Investigate new patterns or combinations of modifiers that could lead to high yield, especially those that might not have been considered in the current set of rules. This could involve machine learning techniques to discover hidden patterns.

- **Validation on Test Data**: Ensure that the rules are validated on a separate test dataset to confirm that the improvements in metrics are not due to overfitting on the training data.

Overall, the current rules show promising improvements in confidence and lift, indicating that they are becoming more effective in predicting high yield outcomes. Further iterations should focus on maintaining these improvements while increasing the applicability of the rules through higher support.

### Performance Evaluation of Current Rules

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
   - The current rules have shown improvement in validation accuracy from previous iterations, reaching an accuracy of 0.8. This suggests that the rules are becoming more effective in predicting the loading of modifiers on catalysts.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment:**
   - The previous validation accuracies were consistently around 0.76, with some fluctuations. The current accuracy of 0.8 indicates a potential improvement, but it is essential to ensure that this is not due to overfitting. The SHAP values should be analyzed to confirm that the model is not overly reliant on specific rules that may not generalize well.

3. **Discrepancies Analysis:**
   - For molecules where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low, rules with high positive SHAP values should be scrutinized. For instance, Rule 1 and Rule 2 have shown high positive SHAP values in some cases, indicating they might be overestimating the loading.
   - Conversely, for molecules where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, rules with high negative SHAP values should be examined. Rules like Rule 9 and Rule 4 have shown negative SHAP values, suggesting they might be underestimating the loading.

4. **Accuracy Improvements Interpretation:**
   - The increase in validation accuracy to 0.8 suggests that the current rules are moving in the right direction. However, it is crucial to ensure that this improvement is not due to overfitting to the validation set. Continuous monitoring and validation on unseen data are necessary.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**
   - SHAP analysis indicates that certain rules, such as Rule 1 and Rule 2, have a significant impact on the predictions. These rules should be refined to ensure they are not overly influencing the model's predictions.
   - Rules with consistently negative SHAP values, like Rule 9, might need adjustment to better capture the characteristics of high-loading modifiers.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Rules with High Positive SHAP Values:**
   - Rules like Rule 1 and Rule 2, which have shown high positive SHAP values, should be refined to prevent overestimation. Consider adding conditions or exceptions to these rules to improve their specificity.

2. **Adjust Rules with High Negative SHAP Values:**
   - Rules such as Rule 9 and Rule 4, which have shown high negative SHAP values, should be adjusted to prevent underestimation. This could involve relaxing some conditions or incorporating additional features that might influence loading.

3. **Improve Generalization:**
   - To address potential overfitting, consider incorporating more diverse data into the training set. This could involve using cross-validation techniques or augmenting the dataset with additional examples.

4. **Iterative Refinement Using SHAP Insights:**
   - Use the insights from SHAP analysis to iteratively refine the rules. Focus on rules that consistently show high SHAP values, either positive or negative, and adjust them to improve their predictive power.

5. **Continuous Evaluation:**
   - Continuously evaluate the performance of the rules on new data to ensure they generalize well. This will help in identifying any overfitting issues early and allow for timely adjustments.

By following these recommendations, the current rules can be refined to improve their effectiveness and generalization, leading to more accurate predictions of modifier loading on catalysts.

    -------------------------------------------------------

    Metric Commenter Message:
Based on the current rule metrics, we can observe the following:

1. **Confidence**: The current train confidence is 0.744, which is a significant improvement over the previous test confidence values of 0.333 and 0.463. This indicates that the current rules are more reliable in predicting high yield outcomes compared to the previous iterations. A confidence level above 0.7 is generally considered strong, suggesting that the rules are capturing relevant patterns in the data.

2. **Lift**: The current train lift is 1.493, which is a notable improvement from the previous test lift values of 0.688 and 0.913. A lift value greater than 1 indicates that the rule is better than random guessing, and the current lift suggests that the rules are providing valuable insights into the factors contributing to high yield. The lift is approaching 1.5, which is a strong indicator of the rule's effectiveness.

3. **Leverage**: The current train leverage is 0.009, which is positive and indicates that the rules are capturing associations that are not due to random chance. While the leverage is lower than some of the previous iterations, it is still positive, suggesting that the rules are identifying meaningful relationships.

4. **Support**: The current train support is 0.030, which is lower than the previous train support values. This suggests that the rules are applicable to a smaller subset of the data. While this might indicate a more niche application, it could also mean that the rules are more specialized and focused on specific conditions that lead to high yield.

**Recommendations for Improvement**:

- **Expand Rule Coverage**: Consider exploring additional modifiers or combinations of modifiers that could increase the support of the rules. This could involve analyzing more diverse chemical structures or conditions that might lead to high yield.

- **Refine Existing Rules**: Review the current rules to identify any potential overlaps or redundancies. Streamlining the rules could improve their precision and applicability.

- **Test on New Data**: Validate the current rules on a new dataset to ensure their generalizability and robustness. This could help identify any overfitting issues and provide insights into potential rule adjustments.

- **Incorporate Additional Features**: Consider integrating more features or variables that could influence yield, such as reaction conditions or catalyst types, to enhance the predictive power of the rules.

Overall, the current rules show promising improvements in confidence and lift, indicating that they are effectively capturing relevant patterns. However, further refinement and validation are necessary to ensure their applicability and robustness across different datasets.

### Performance Evaluation of Current Rules

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
   - The current rules have shown some effectiveness, as indicated by the validation accuracy of 0.6286. However, this is a decrease from the previous best validation accuracy of 0.8, suggesting that the rules may not be capturing all the necessary features for accurate predictions.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment:**
   - The fluctuation in validation accuracy across iterations suggests potential overfitting or underfitting. The consistent decrease in accuracy from 0.8 to 0.6286 indicates that the model might be overfitting to specific features or rules that do not generalize well across different datasets.

3. **Discrepancies Analysis:**
   - For molecules where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, rules with high negative SHAP values are likely problematic. For instance, Rule 1 and Rule 4 often have negative SHAP values in such cases, indicating they might be underestimating the loading.
   - Conversely, for molecules where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low, rules with high positive SHAP values, such as Rule 1, might be overestimating the loading.

4. **Accuracy Improvements Interpretation:**
   - The decrease in accuracy from 0.8 to 0.6286 suggests that the current rules may not be improving the model's performance. This indicates a need for further refinement and possibly the introduction of new rules or features to capture the complexity of the data better.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**
   - SHAP analysis indicates that certain rules consistently contribute to incorrect predictions. For example, Rule 1 often has a high positive SHAP value for overestimated loadings, suggesting it might be too broad or not specific enough.
   - Rules with consistently negative SHAP values for underestimated loadings, such as Rule 4, may need to be adjusted to better capture the features associated with high loading.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Rules with High Positive SHAP Values:**
   - **Rule 1**: Consider narrowing the scope of Rule 1 to be more specific about the types of amino and carboxylic acid groups that lead to high yield. This could involve adding additional conditions or constraints to the rule.

2. **Adjust Rules with High Negative SHAP Values:**
   - **Rule 4**: Re-evaluate the conditions under which pyridine rings lead to high yield. It may be beneficial to consider additional structural features or interactions that could influence the yield.

3. **Improve Generalization:**
   - Introduce new rules or features that capture additional chemical properties or interactions not currently considered. This could involve exploring more complex molecular descriptors or machine learning techniques to identify new patterns.

4. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - Use insights from SHAP analysis to iteratively test and refine rules. This could involve creating a feedback loop where rules are adjusted based on SHAP values and then re-evaluated for their impact on model performance.

5. **Consider Additional Data:**
   - If possible, incorporate additional data or external validation sets to test the generalizability of the rules. This can help ensure that the rules are not overfitting to the current dataset and can perform well on unseen data.

By addressing these areas, the rules can be refined to improve the model's accuracy and generalization, ultimately leading to more reliable predictions of modifier loading on catalysts.

Current Rule Metrics:

    Train support: 0.030476190476190476
    Train confidence: 0.7555555555555554
    Train lift: 1.514887436456064

    -------------------------------------------------------

    Metric Commenter Message:
Based on the current rule metrics, we can observe several key points regarding the performance of the rules:

1. **Confidence**: The current rules exhibit a high level of confidence, with values ranging from 0.744 to 0.898. This indicates that when the rule conditions are met, there is a strong likelihood that the rule predictions will also be true. Compared to the previous metrics, where test confidence was lower (0.333 to 0.464), the current rules show a significant improvement in confidence. This suggests that the rules are more reliable in predicting outcomes when the conditions are satisfied.

2. **Lift**: The lift values for the current rules are consistently above 1, ranging from 1.493 to 1.795. This indicates that the presence of the rule conditions increases the likelihood of the rule predictions compared to random chance. The previous metrics showed lift values close to or below 1 in the test set, indicating less effective rules. The current lift values suggest that the rules are more interesting and provide meaningful insights into the relationships between the conditions and predictions.

3. **Leverage**: The leverage values are positive, ranging from 0.009 to 0.016, indicating that the rules provide additional support beyond what would be expected by chance. While the leverage values are relatively small, they are consistently positive, suggesting that the rules are capturing genuine associations in the data.

4. **Support**: The support values for the current rules are relatively low, ranging from 0.030 to 0.040. This indicates that the rules apply to a small proportion of the dataset. While this is not necessarily a negative aspect, it suggests that the rules may be capturing niche or specific patterns rather than broad trends.

**Comparison to Previous Metrics**: The current rules show a marked improvement in confidence and lift compared to the previous metrics, particularly in the test set. The previous rules had lower confidence and lift values, indicating less reliable and less interesting rules. The current iteration has successfully enhanced these metrics, suggesting that the rules are more effective in capturing meaningful patterns.

**Suggestions for Improvement**:
- **Increase Support**: Consider exploring additional rules or modifying existing ones to increase the support values. This could involve identifying broader patterns or combining similar rules to capture a larger portion of the dataset.
- **Refine Rule Conditions**: Analyze the conditions of the rules to ensure they are capturing the most relevant features. This may involve incorporating additional features or refining the existing conditions to improve the specificity and applicability of the rules.
- **Test on New Data**: Validate the current rules on a new dataset to ensure their generalizability and robustness. This will help confirm that the improvements in metrics are not specific to the current dataset.

Overall, the current rules demonstrate strong performance in terms of confidence and lift, indicating effective and interesting patterns. However, there is room for improvement in terms of support, and further refinement of the rules could enhance their applicability and generalizability.

### Performance Evaluation of Current Rules

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
   - The current rules seem to have limited effectiveness, as indicated by the validation accuracy of 0.5714, which is lower than the previous reference accuracies (0.76). This suggests that the rules may not be capturing the underlying patterns effectively.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting:**
   - The consistent validation accuracy of 0.5714 across iterations suggests potential underfitting. The model may not be complex enough to capture the nuances in the data, or the rules may not be sufficiently detailed or accurate.

3. **Discrepancies Analysis:**
   - For molecules where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low, Rule 1 often has a high positive SHAP value, indicating it might be overestimating the loading.
   - Conversely, for molecules where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, Rule 5 and Rule 9 frequently have high negative SHAP values, suggesting they might be underestimating the loading.

4. **Accuracy Improvements:**
   - The accuracy metrics suggest limited improvement potential with the current rules. The consistent validation accuracy across iterations indicates that the rules may have reached a local minimum, and further refinement is necessary to improve performance.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**
   - SHAP analysis indicates that Rule 1, Rule 5, and Rule 9 are critical areas for improvement. Rule 1 often contributes positively to high loading predictions, while Rule 5 and Rule 9 contribute negatively to low loading predictions. Adjusting these rules could improve the model's accuracy.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Rule 1:**
   - Rule 1, which focuses on modifiers with amino and carboxylic acid groups, may need to be more specific. Consider adding conditions related to the position of these groups or the presence of additional functional groups that could influence loading.

2. **Adjust Rule 5 and Rule 9:**
   - Rule 5, which deals with formyl groups on benzene rings, and Rule 9, which addresses long aliphatic chains, may need adjustments. Consider incorporating additional structural features or interactions that could mitigate their negative impact on loading predictions.

3. **Improve Generalization:**
   - To address potential underfitting, consider expanding the feature set or introducing new rules that capture more complex interactions. This could involve exploring additional chemical properties or structural motifs that influence loading.

4. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - Use insights from SHAP analysis to iteratively refine the rules. Focus on rules with high SHAP values (both positive and negative) and test modifications to see if they lead to improved accuracy.

5. **Incorporate Additional Data:**
   - If possible, incorporate additional data or features that could provide more context for the rules. This could include experimental conditions, catalyst properties, or other relevant factors that influence loading.

By focusing on these areas, the rules can be refined to better capture the underlying patterns in the data, potentially leading to improved model performance and more accurate predictions.

### Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimization

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
   - The current rules show strong performance in terms of confidence and lift, indicating effective and interesting patterns. However, the validation accuracy of 0.5714 suggests that the rules may not be capturing the underlying patterns effectively, indicating potential underfitting.

2. **Key Areas for Improvement:**
   - **Rule 1**: This rule often contributes positively to high loading predictions but may need more specificity. Consider refining the conditions related to the position of amino and carboxylic acid groups or the presence of additional functional groups.
   - **Rule 5 and Rule 9**: These rules frequently contribute negatively to low loading predictions. Adjustments may be needed to incorporate additional structural features or interactions that could mitigate their negative impact.

3. **Generalization and Complexity:**
   - The consistent validation accuracy across iterations suggests potential underfitting. To improve generalization, consider expanding the feature set or introducing new rules that capture more complex interactions.

4. **SHAP Analysis Insights:**
   - SHAP analysis indicates that Rule 1, Rule 5, and Rule 9 are critical areas for improvement. Iteratively refine these rules using insights from SHAP analysis to improve the model's accuracy.

5. **Support and Applicability:**
   - The support values for the current rules are relatively low, indicating that the rules may be capturing niche patterns. Consider exploring additional rules or modifying existing ones to increase support and capture broader trends.

### Possibility for Further Optimization

- There is potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. By refining specific rules, expanding the feature set, and incorporating additional data, the model can be improved to better capture the underlying patterns in the data.

### Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Refine Rule Conditions:**
   - Focus on refining Rule 1, Rule 5, and Rule 9 based on SHAP analysis insights. Consider adding conditions related to the position of functional groups or additional structural features.

2. **Expand Feature Set:**
   - Introduce new rules or features that capture more complex interactions, potentially improving generalization and addressing underfitting.

3. **Iterative Testing:**
   - Use iterative testing and validation to refine the rules, focusing on those with high SHAP values to see if modifications lead to improved accuracy.

4. **Incorporate Additional Data:**
   - If possible, incorporate additional data or features that provide more context for the rules, such as experimental conditions or catalyst properties.

By implementing these suggestions, the rules can be optimized to improve model performance and accuracy.

Current Rule Metrics:

    Train support: 0.03238095238095238
    Train confidence: 0.7333333333333333
    Train lift: 1.4716775599128544
    Train leverage: 0.011482993197278912
    -------------------------------------------------------

    Metric Commenter Message:
Based on the current metrics and comparing them to the reference metrics, we can make several observations about the performance of the current rules:

1. **Confidence**: The current train confidence is 0.733, which is a significant improvement over the previous test confidence values of 0.333 and 0.463. This indicates that the current rules are more reliable in predicting the outcome when the conditions are met. However, there is still room for improvement to reach closer to the higher confidence values seen in some of the rules during the iteration (e.g., 0.897).

2. **Lift**: The current train lift is 1.472, which is a notable improvement over the previous test lift values of 0.689 and 0.914. A lift greater than 1 suggests that the rules are providing useful information beyond what would be expected by chance. However, some rules during the iteration achieved even higher lift values (e.g., 1.795), indicating potential for further enhancement.

3. **Leverage**: The current train leverage is 0.011, which is an improvement over the negative leverage values seen in the previous test metrics. Positive leverage indicates a stronger association between the rule conditions and predictions than would be expected by chance. However, the leverage is still relatively low, suggesting that while the rules are better than random chance, they could be further optimized.

### Recommendations for Improvement:

- **Refinement of Rules**: Focus on refining rules that have shown higher confidence and lift during the iteration. For example, rules with confidence values around 0.8 and lift values above 1.6 should be analyzed to understand what specific conditions contribute to their success.

- **Incorporate More Specific Conditions**: Consider adding more specific conditions or constraints to the rules that have moderate confidence and lift. This could help in increasing the precision of the predictions.

- **Analyze Low Yield Rules**: Some rules consistently predict low yield. Investigating these rules to understand the underlying chemistry or structural features that lead to low yield could help in either improving these rules or identifying exceptions.

- **Explore Additional Features**: Consider exploring additional features or modifiers that might not have been included in the current rules but could potentially improve the predictive power.

- **Iterative Testing and Validation**: Continue with iterative testing and validation to ensure that improvements in metrics are consistent across different datasets and not just specific to the training data.

By focusing on these areas, the rules can be further optimized to achieve higher confidence and lift, thereby improving their overall predictive performance.

### Performance Evaluation of Current Rules

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
   - The current rules have shown some effectiveness, as indicated by the validation accuracy of 0.6857, which is an improvement over some previous iterations. However, the accuracy is still not consistently high across all iterations, suggesting that the rules may not be fully capturing the complexity of the data.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment:**
   - The validation accuracy has fluctuated across iterations, with some iterations showing lower accuracy (e.g., 0.5714) and others higher (e.g., 0.8). This inconsistency suggests potential overfitting in some cases, where the model performs well on the training data but not on unseen data. The rules may need to be generalized better to avoid overfitting.

3. **Discrepancies Analysis:**
   - For molecules where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low, Rule 1 often has a high positive SHAP value, indicating it might be overestimating the loading. Conversely, for molecules where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, Rule 4 often has a high negative SHAP value, suggesting it might be underestimating the loading.

4. **Accuracy Improvements:**
   - The improvement in validation accuracy from previous iterations suggests that the rules are moving in the right direction. However, the variability in accuracy indicates that further refinement is needed to achieve consistent performance.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**
   - SHAP analysis highlights that Rule 1 and Rule 4 are significant contributors to discrepancies in predictions. Rule 1 tends to overestimate high loading, while Rule 4 underestimates it. This suggests that these rules need to be refined to better align with experimental values.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Rules with High Positive SHAP Values:**
   - **Rule 1**: Consider adding more specific conditions or exceptions to Rule 1 to prevent overestimation of high loading. For example, examine the structural context in which amino and carboxylic acid groups lead to high yield and refine the rule to account for these nuances.

2. **Adjust Rules with High Negative SHAP Values:**
   - **Rule 4**: Re-evaluate the conditions under which pyridine rings lead to high yield. Consider incorporating additional structural features or modifying the rule to better capture the conditions that lead to high experimental values.

3. **Improve Generalization:**
   - Introduce more diverse training data or use techniques like cross-validation to ensure the rules generalize well to unseen data. This can help address overfitting issues.

4. **Iterative Refinement Using SHAP Insights:**
   - Use the insights from SHAP analysis to iteratively test and refine the rules. For instance, conduct experiments to test the impact of modifying Rule 1 and Rule 4 and observe changes in SHAP values and accuracy metrics.

5. **Incorporate Additional Features:**
   - Consider adding new rules or features that capture other chemical properties or interactions that may influence the loading of modifiers on catalysts. This could involve exploring additional chemical groups or structural motifs not currently covered by the existing rules.

By implementing these recommendations, the rules can be refined to improve their predictive accuracy and generalization, ultimately leading to more reliable predictions of modifier loading on catalysts.

Current Rule Metrics:

    Train support: 0.03428571428571429
    Train confidence: 0.7333333333333333
    Train lift: 1.4716775599128544
    Train leverage: 0.012462585034013604
    -------------------------------------------------------

    Metric Commenter Message:
Based on the current rule metrics and comparing them to the previous metrics, we can make several observations:

1. **Confidence**: The current train confidence is 0.7333, which is a significant improvement over the previous test confidence values of 0.3333 and 0.4639. This indicates that the current rules are more reliable in predicting the outcome when the conditions are met. However, there is still room for improvement to reach closer to the higher confidence values seen in some of the previous iterations (e.g., 0.8978).

2. **Lift**: The current train lift is 1.4717, which is a notable improvement over the previous test lift values of 0.6889 and 0.9137. A lift greater than 1 suggests that the rule is useful and that the presence of the condition increases the likelihood of the prediction. The current lift indicates that the rules are providing a meaningful increase in prediction accuracy over random chance. However, some previous iterations achieved even higher lift values (e.g., 1.7952), suggesting potential for further optimization.

3. **Leverage**: The current train leverage is 0.0125, which is an improvement over the negative leverage values seen in the previous test metrics. Positive leverage indicates that the rules are capturing associations that are stronger than what would be expected by chance. While the current leverage is positive, it is still relatively low, indicating that there might be more frequent items or stronger associations that could be captured.

4. **Support**: The current train support is 0.0343, which is lower than some of the previous train support values (e.g., 0.04). This suggests that the current rules apply to a smaller portion of the dataset, which might limit their generalizability. Increasing support while maintaining or improving confidence and lift could enhance the robustness of the rules.

**Recommendations for Improvement**:
- **Refinement of Rules**: Consider refining the rules to capture more frequent patterns in the data, which could increase support without sacrificing confidence and lift.
- **Exploration of New Features**: Investigate additional features or combinations of features that might lead to higher confidence and lift. This could involve exploring interactions between different chemical groups or structural motifs.
- **Balancing Specificity and Generality**: Strive for a balance between specificity (high confidence and lift) and generality (higher support) to ensure the rules are both accurate and applicable to a larger portion of the dataset.
- **Iterative Testing and Validation**: Continue iterating on the rules and validate them against a test set to ensure that improvements in training metrics translate to better performance on unseen data.

Overall, while the current rules show improvement in confidence and lift, there is still potential for further optimization to enhance their applicability and predictive power.

### Performance Evaluation of Current Rules

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
   - The current rules have shown some effectiveness, as indicated by the validation accuracy of 0.714, which is an improvement over some previous iterations. However, the accuracy is still not consistently high across all iterations, suggesting that the rules may not be fully capturing the complexity of the data.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment:**
   - The fluctuation in validation accuracy across iterations suggests potential overfitting or underfitting. The rules might be too specific to certain patterns in the training data, leading to overfitting, or they might be too general, missing important nuances, leading to underfitting.

3. **Discrepancies Analysis:**
   - For molecules where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low, rules with high positive SHAP values (e.g., Rule 1 and Rule 2) might be overly optimistic in their predictions.
   - Conversely, for molecules where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, rules with high negative SHAP values (e.g., Rule 4 and Rule 9) might be too conservative.

4. **Accuracy Improvements:**
   - The improvement in validation accuracy to 0.714 suggests that the rules are moving in the right direction, but there is still room for improvement. The accuracy metrics indicate that the current rules have potential but need further refinement to consistently achieve higher accuracy.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**
   - SHAP analysis highlights specific rules that contribute significantly to prediction errors. For instance, Rule 1 and Rule 4 often have high SHAP values, indicating their strong influence on predictions. This suggests that these rules might need refinement to better align with experimental outcomes.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Overestimated Loadings:**
   - Rules with high positive SHAP values, such as Rule 1 and Rule 2, should be revisited. Consider adding conditions or exceptions to these rules to prevent overestimation of loading in cases where the experimental value is low.

2. **Adjust Underestimated Loadings:**
   - Rules with high negative SHAP values, such as Rule 4 and Rule 9, should be adjusted to avoid underestimation. This could involve relaxing some conditions or incorporating additional features that might indicate higher loading.

3. **Improve Generalization:**
   - To address overfitting, consider simplifying some rules or combining similar rules to reduce complexity. For underfitting, explore additional features or interactions that might be missing from the current rules.

4. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - Use insights from SHAP analysis to iteratively refine the rules. Focus on rules that consistently show high SHAP values, either positive or negative, and test modifications to these rules in subsequent iterations.

5. **Incorporate Additional Data:**
   - If possible, incorporate more diverse data into the training set to help the model generalize better. This could involve using data from different experimental conditions or including more varied molecular structures.

By implementing these recommendations, the rules can be refined to improve their predictive accuracy and generalization, ultimately leading to more reliable predictions of modifier loading on catalysts.

Current Rule Metrics:

    Train support: 0.0380952380952381
    Train confidence: 0.8
    Train lift: 1.6051198257080614
    Train leverage: 0.014367346938775512
    -------------------------------------------------------

    Metric Commenter Message:
Based on the current metrics, the performance of the rules has shown significant improvement compared to the previous reference metrics. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Confidence**: The current train confidence is 0.8, which is a substantial improvement over the previous test confidence values of 0.333 and 0.463. This indicates that the current rules are more reliable in predicting the outcome when the conditions are met. High confidence suggests that the rules are capturing the relationships between the conditions and the outcomes more effectively.

2. **Lift**: The current train lift is 1.605, which is significantly higher than the previous train lift values of 1.204 and 1.055, and the test lift values of 0.688 and 0.913. A lift greater than 1 indicates that the rule is useful and that the presence of the condition increases the likelihood of the outcome. The current lift value suggests that the rules are not only reliable but also provide meaningful insights into the relationships between the conditions and the outcomes.

3. **Leverage**: The current train leverage is 0.014, which is positive and indicates a stronger association between the conditions and the outcomes than would be expected by chance. This is an improvement over the previous negative test leverage values, which suggested weaker associations.

4. **Support**: The current train support is 0.038, which is lower than the previous train support values of 0.166 and 0.184. While support is important, the focus should be on confidence and lift for rule effectiveness. The lower support might indicate that the rules are more specific, capturing a smaller but more accurate subset of the data.

### Recommendations for Improvement:

- **Refinement of Rules**: Continue refining the rules to maintain or improve confidence and lift. Focus on identifying conditions that consistently lead to high yields, as seen in the current rules.

- **Balancing Specificity and Generality**: While high confidence and lift are desirable, ensure that the rules are not overly specific, which could limit their applicability. Consider exploring additional conditions or combinations that might increase support without sacrificing confidence and lift.

- **Validation on Test Data**: Although the current metrics are based on training data, it is crucial to validate these rules on a separate test dataset to ensure that they generalize well and are not overfitting the training data.

- **Iterative Testing**: Continue iterating and testing new rules or modifications to existing rules to explore if further improvements in metrics can be achieved. Monitor for any signs of overfitting, especially if confidence and lift remain high but support decreases further.

Overall, the current rules are performing well, with high confidence and lift indicating strong predictive power and meaningful associations. The focus should be on maintaining these strengths while exploring ways to increase support and ensure generalizability.

### Performance Evaluation of Current Rules

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
   - The current rules have shown improvement in validation accuracy, reaching 0.7429, which is a significant increase from previous iterations where accuracy was as low as 0.5714. This suggests that the rules are becoming more effective in predicting the loading of modifiers on catalysts.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment:**
   - The consistent improvement in validation accuracy without a significant drop in performance suggests that the model is not overfitting. However, the presence of discrepancies between predicted and experimental values indicates potential underfitting for certain molecules.

3. **Discrepancy Analysis:**
   - For molecules where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low, Rule 1 and Rule 2 often have high positive SHAP values, indicating they might be overestimating the loading.
   - Conversely, for molecules where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, Rule 4 and Rule 9 frequently have high negative SHAP values, suggesting they might be underestimating the loading.

4. **Accuracy Improvements:**
   - The increase in validation accuracy suggests that the probability of improvement for the current rules is high. The iterative refinement process appears to be effective, as evidenced by the gradual increase in accuracy metrics.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**
   - SHAP analysis indicates that Rule 1 and Rule 2 are influential in predicting high loading, but they may need refinement to avoid overestimation.
   - Rule 4 and Rule 9, which often contribute to underestimation, might require adjustments to better capture the characteristics of molecules that result in high experimental loading.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Refine Rules with High Positive SHAP Values:**
   - **Rule 1:** Consider adding conditions to account for steric hindrance or electronic effects that might reduce the effectiveness of amino and carboxylic acid groups in certain configurations.
   - **Rule 2:** Introduce additional criteria to differentiate between electron-withdrawing groups that significantly impact yield and those that do not.

2. **Adjust Rules with High Negative SHAP Values:**
   - **Rule 4:** Re-evaluate the impact of pyridine rings and consider the influence of substituents that might enhance or diminish their effect on loading.
   - **Rule 9:** Modify the rule to better account for the presence of branching or polar groups that could improve yield, ensuring these factors are adequately weighted.

3. **Improve Generalization:**
   - Introduce more nuanced rules that consider the interplay between different functional groups and their spatial arrangement, which could help address underfitting issues.

4. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - Use insights from SHAP analysis to iteratively refine the rules, focusing on molecules with significant discrepancies between predicted and experimental values. This could involve creating sub-rules or exceptions for specific molecular features that are not well-captured by the current rules.

By implementing these recommendations, the rules can be further refined to improve their predictive accuracy and generalization, ultimately leading to more reliable predictions of modifier loading on catalysts.
