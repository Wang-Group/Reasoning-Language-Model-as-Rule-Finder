"Rule 1: Modifiers containing both amino and carboxylic acid groups, especially when they are part of a short aliphatic chain (3-5 carbons) and the amino group is at the α or β position relative to the carboxylic acid, tend to result in high yield.",Rule 2: Modifiers with a benzene ring substituted with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro or bromomethyl tend to result in high yield.,Rule 3: Modifiers with a sulfanyl group on a short aliphatic chain (3-5 carbons) tend to result in high yield.,"Rule 4: Modifiers with a pyridine ring, especially when not substituted with additional electron-withdrawing groups, tend to result in high yield.","Rule 5: Modifiers with a formyl group on a benzene ring tend to result in low yield, unless there are electron-donating groups such as methoxy or amino groups elsewhere in the molecule that could mitigate this effect.","Rule 6: Modifiers with a hydroxyphenyl group tend to result in low yield, unless there are additional electron-withdrawing groups that could enhance the yield.",Rule 7: Modifiers with a trifluoroacetyl group tend to result in low yield.,Rule 8: Modifiers with an oxo group adjacent to a carboxylic acid group tend to result in low yield.,"Rule 9: Modifiers with a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbons) tend to result in low yield, unless there are branching or polar groups such as hydroxyl or amino groups that could improve yield.",Rule 10: Modifiers with multiple methoxy groups on a phenyl ring tend to result in high yield.,Rule 11: Modifiers with an acetamido group tend to result in low yield.,Rule 12: Modifiers with an indole group tend to result in high yield.,Rule 13: Modifiers with a benzene ring substituted with a pyridyl group tend to result in low yield.,Rule 14: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a benzene ring without additional electron-withdrawing groups tend to result in high yield.,Rule 15: Modifiers with a benzene ring substituted with a carboxylic acid group and no additional electron-withdrawing groups tend to result in high yield.
