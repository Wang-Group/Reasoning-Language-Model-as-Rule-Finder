**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: If the molecular modifier contains both an amino group and a carboxylic acid group in a linear aliphatic chain, the yield is likely to be high. This arrangement facilitates effective coordination with the metal center. (e.g., 5-aminopentanoic acid)

- **Rule 2**: If the molecular modifier contains a pyridine ring with electron-donating groups such as methyl or methoxy, the yield is likely to be high. However, if the pyridine ring is heavily substituted, steric hindrance may reduce yield. (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid)

- **Rule 3**: If the molecular modifier contains a sulfanyl group attached to a non-aromatic chain and lacks other electron-withdrawing groups, the yield is likely to be high. The sulfanyl group can effectively stabilize the metal center. (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid)

- **Rule 4**: If the molecular modifier contains a benzofuran structure with additional electron-donating groups, the yield is likely to be high. This structure provides rigidity and potential for enhanced coordination. (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid)

- **Rule 5**: If the molecular modifier contains a simple carboxylic acid group without additional electron-withdrawing or donating groups, the yield is likely to be low. However, if the carboxylic acid is part of a larger, stabilizing structure, the yield may be higher. (e.g., octanoic acid)

- **Rule 6**: If the molecular modifier contains an indole group with additional electron-donating groups, the yield is likely to be high. Indole groups provide aromatic stabilization and coordination sites. (e.g., (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid)

- **Rule 7**: If the molecular modifier contains large substituents that introduce steric hindrance, the yield is likely to be low. Steric hindrance can reduce the accessibility of the metal center. (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid)

- **Rule 8**: If the molecular modifier contains a methoxy group attached to an aromatic ring and no other electron-withdrawing groups, the yield is likely to be high. Methoxy groups donate electron density, stabilizing the catalyst. (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid)

- **Rule 9**: If the molecular modifier contains a nitro group with additional electron-donating groups, the yield is likely to be high. Nitro groups provide electron-withdrawing effects that can stabilize the catalyst in certain contexts. (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid)

- **Rule 10**: If the molecular modifier contains a hydroxyl group adjacent to an aromatic ring without additional stabilizing groups, the yield is likely to be low. Hydroxyl groups can introduce steric hindrance or participate in hydrogen bonding. (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid)

- **Rule 11**: If the molecular modifier contains an acetamido group with additional electron-withdrawing groups, the yield is likely to be low. Acetamido groups introduce steric hindrance and reduce catalyst effectiveness. (e.g., (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid)

- **Rule 12**: If the molecular modifier contains a benzoic acid derivative with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro or halogens, the yield is likely to be high. These groups stabilize the catalyst by withdrawing electron density. (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid)

- **Rule 13**: If the molecular modifier contains a thiol group attached to an aromatic ring but also has electron-donating groups that mitigate the negative impact, the yield may not necessarily be low. Analyze the steric and electronic environment. (e.g., consider revising based on additional data)

- **Rule 14**: If the molecular modifier contains a hydroxyl group in a polyol structure, the yield is likely to be high. The multiple hydroxyl groups can enhance coordination with the metal center, especially if they are spatially arranged to avoid interference with metal coordination. (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid)

- **Rule 15**: If the molecular modifier contains a formyl group adjacent to an aromatic ring, the yield is likely to be low. The formyl group can introduce electron-withdrawing effects that destabilize the catalyst. (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid)
