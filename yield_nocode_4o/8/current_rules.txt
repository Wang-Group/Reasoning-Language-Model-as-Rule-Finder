**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: If the molecular modifier contains both an amino group and a carboxylic acid group in a linear aliphatic chain, and lacks additional electron-withdrawing groups, the yield is likely to be high. This arrangement facilitates effective coordination with the metal center. (e.g., 5-aminopentanoic acid)

- **Rule 2**: If the molecular modifier contains a pyridine ring with electron-donating groups such as methyl or methoxy, and the substituents are positioned to avoid steric hindrance, the yield is likely to be high. Ensure that the substituents do not interfere with metal center coordination. (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid)

- **Rule 3**: If the molecular modifier contains a sulfanyl group attached to a non-aromatic chain and lacks other electron-withdrawing groups, the yield is likely to be high. The sulfanyl group can effectively stabilize the metal center. (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid)

- **Rule 4**: If the molecular modifier contains a benzofuran structure with additional electron-donating groups, the yield is likely to be high. This structure provides rigidity and potential for enhanced coordination. (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid)

- **Rule 5**: If the molecular modifier contains a simple carboxylic acid group without additional electron-withdrawing or donating groups, and is part of a linear aliphatic chain with more than six carbon atoms, the yield is likely to be low. The lack of additional stabilizing interactions reduces effectiveness. (e.g., octanoic acid)

- **Rule 6**: If the molecular modifier contains an indole group with additional electron-donating groups such as alkyl or methoxy groups, the yield is likely to be high. Consider interactions between indole groups and other functional groups present in the molecular modifier. (e.g., (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid)

- **Rule 7**: If the molecular modifier contains large substituents that introduce steric hindrance, especially in proximity to the metal coordination site, the yield is likely to be low. Steric hindrance can reduce the accessibility of the metal center. (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid)

- **Rule 8**: If the molecular modifier contains a methoxy group attached to an aromatic ring and no other electron-withdrawing groups, the yield is likely to be high. Methoxy groups donate electron density, stabilizing the catalyst. (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid)

- **Rule 9**: If the molecular modifier contains a nitro group with additional electron-donating groups, and these groups are positioned to enhance the electron-withdrawing effect of the nitro group, the yield is likely to be high. (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid)

- **Rule 10**: If the molecular modifier contains a hydroxyl group adjacent to an aromatic ring without additional stabilizing groups, and the hydroxyl group is capable of forming intramolecular hydrogen bonds, the yield is likely to be low. This can interfere with effective coordination. (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid)

- **Rule 11**: If the molecular modifier contains an acetamido group with additional electron-withdrawing groups, and the acetamido group is positioned to introduce steric hindrance near the metal center, the yield is likely to be low. (e.g., (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid)

- **Rule 12**: If the molecular modifier contains a benzoic acid derivative with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro or halogens, and these groups are ortho or para to the carboxylic acid, the yield is likely to be high. These positions enhance electron-withdrawing effects. (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid)

- **Rule 13**: If the molecular modifier contains a hydroxyl group in a polyol structure, and the hydroxyl groups are positioned to form a chelating interaction with the metal center, the yield is likely to be high. (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid)

- **Rule 14**: If the molecular modifier contains a formyl group adjacent to an aromatic ring, and the formyl group is positioned to interact unfavorably with the metal center, the yield is likely to be low. (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid)

- **Rule 15**: If the molecular modifier contains a thiol group attached to an aromatic ring but also has electron-donating groups that mitigate the negative impact, the yield may not necessarily be low. Analyze the steric and electronic environment to determine the effect. (e.g., 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid)
