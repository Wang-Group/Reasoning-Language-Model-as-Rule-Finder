    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: If the molecular modifier contains both an amino group and a carboxylic acid group, the yield is likely to be high. This combination can enhance coordination with metal centers, improving catalyst performance. (e.g., 2-aminopentanedioic acid, 2-aminobutanedioic acid)

- **Rule 2**: If the molecular modifier contains a sulfanyl group, the yield is likely to be low. Sulfanyl groups can strongly bind to the metal center, potentially deactivating the catalyst. (e.g., 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid, 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid)

- **Rule 3**: If the molecular modifier contains a pyridine ring, the yield is likely to be high. Pyridine rings can act as ligands, stabilizing the metal center and enhancing catalytic activity. (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, pyridine-3-carboxylic acid)

- **Rule 4**: If the molecular modifier contains a formyl group, the yield is likely to be low. Formyl groups can introduce steric hindrance or participate in side reactions, reducing yield. (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid, 4-formylbenzoic acid)

- **Rule 5**: If the molecular modifier contains a nitro group, the yield is likely to be high. Nitro groups can increase the electron-withdrawing capacity, potentially enhancing the reactivity of the catalyst. (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid)

- **Rule 6**: If the molecular modifier contains a methoxy group attached to an aromatic ring, the yield is likely to be high. Methoxy groups can donate electron density, stabilizing the catalyst and improving yield. (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid)

- **Rule 7**: If the molecular modifier contains a trifluoroacetyl group, the yield is likely to be low. Trifluoroacetyl groups can introduce strong electron-withdrawing effects, potentially destabilizing the catalyst. (e.g., 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid)

- **Rule 8**: If the molecular modifier contains a hydroxyl group attached to a benzene ring, the yield is likely to be low. The hydroxyl group can participate in hydrogen bonding, which might interfere with the catalytic process. (e.g., 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid)

- **Rule 9**: If the molecular modifier contains a benzofuran structure, the yield is likely to be high. Benzofuran structures can provide rigidity and planar coordination, potentially enhancing catalyst performance. (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid)

- **Rule 10**: If the molecular modifier contains a simple carboxylic acid group without additional electron-withdrawing or donating groups, the yield is likely to be low. Simple carboxylic acids may not provide sufficient interaction with the catalyst to enhance yield. (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid)

- **Rule 11**: If the molecular modifier contains an indole group, the yield is likely to be high. Indole groups can provide aromatic stabilization and potential coordination sites for the metal center. (e.g., (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid)

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: If the molecular modifier contains both an amino group and a carboxylic acid group, and lacks additional electron-withdrawing groups, the yield is likely to be high. This combination can enhance coordination with metal centers, improving catalyst performance. (e.g., 2-aminopentanedioic acid, 2-aminobutanedioic acid)

- **Rule 2**: If the molecular modifier contains a pyridine ring with electron-donating groups such as alkyl or methoxy groups, the yield is likely to be high. These groups can enhance the coordination ability of pyridine with metal centers. (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid)

- **Rule 3**: If the molecular modifier contains a sulfanyl group and is part of a benzoic acid derivative, the yield is likely to be low. Sulfanyl groups can strongly bind to the metal center, potentially deactivating the catalyst. (e.g., 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid)

- **Rule 4**: If the molecular modifier contains a formyl group adjacent to an electron-donating group, the yield is likely to be low. The formyl group can introduce steric hindrance or participate in side reactions, reducing yield. (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid)

- **Rule 5**: If the molecular modifier contains a trifluoroacetyl group, the yield is likely to be low. Trifluoroacetyl groups can introduce strong electron-withdrawing effects, potentially destabilizing the catalyst. (e.g., 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid)

- **Rule 6**: If the molecular modifier contains a benzofuran structure, the yield is likely to be high. Benzofuran structures can provide rigidity and planar coordination, potentially enhancing catalyst performance. (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid)

- **Rule 7**: If the molecular modifier contains a simple carboxylic acid group without additional electron-withdrawing or donating groups, the yield is likely to be low. Simple carboxylic acids may not provide sufficient interaction with the catalyst to enhance yield. (e.g., octanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid)

- **Rule 8**: If the molecular modifier contains an indole group, the yield is likely to be high. Indole groups can provide aromatic stabilization and potential coordination sites for the metal center. (e.g., (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid)

- **Rule 9**: If the molecular modifier contains large substituents that introduce steric hindrance, the yield is likely to be low. Large groups can affect the accessibility of the metal center, reducing catalytic efficiency. (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid)

- **Rule 10**: If the molecular modifier contains a methoxy group attached to an aromatic ring and no other electron-withdrawing groups, the yield is likely to be high. Methoxy groups can donate electron density, stabilizing the catalyst and improving yield. (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid)

- **Rule 11**: If the molecular modifier contains an amino group and a sulfanyl group, the yield is likely to be low unless there are additional stabilizing groups present. The combination of these groups can lead to strong binding and potential deactivation of the catalyst. (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid)

- **Rule 12**: If the molecular modifier contains a nitro group, the yield is likely to be high. Nitro groups can provide electron-withdrawing effects that stabilize the catalyst in certain contexts. (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid)

- **Rule 13**: If the molecular modifier contains a hydroxyl group adjacent to an aromatic ring, the yield is likely to be low. Hydroxyl groups can introduce steric hindrance or participate in hydrogen bonding, affecting catalyst performance. (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid)

- **Rule 14**: If the molecular modifier contains an acetamido group, the yield is likely to be low. Acetamido groups can introduce steric hindrance and reduce the effectiveness of the catalyst. (e.g., (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid)

- **Rule 15**: If the molecular modifier contains a benzoic acid derivative with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro or halogens, the yield is likely to be high. These groups can stabilize the catalyst by withdrawing electron density. (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid)

    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: If the molecular modifier contains both an amino group and a carboxylic acid group in a linear aliphatic chain, the yield is likely to be high. This arrangement facilitates effective coordination with the metal center. (e.g., 5-aminopentanoic acid)

- **Rule 2**: If the molecular modifier contains a pyridine ring with additional electron-donating groups, the yield is likely to be high. Electron-donating groups enhance the coordination ability of the pyridine ring. (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid)

- **Rule 3**: If the molecular modifier contains a sulfanyl group attached to a non-aromatic chain and lacks other electron-withdrawing groups, the yield is likely to be high. The sulfanyl group can effectively stabilize the metal center. (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid)

- **Rule 4**: If the molecular modifier contains a benzofuran structure with additional electron-donating groups, the yield is likely to be high. This structure provides rigidity and potential for enhanced coordination. (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid)

- **Rule 5**: If the molecular modifier contains a simple carboxylic acid group without additional electron-withdrawing or donating groups, the yield is likely to be low. These modifiers lack sufficient interaction with the catalyst. (e.g., octanoic acid)

- **Rule 6**: If the molecular modifier contains an indole group with additional electron-donating groups, the yield is likely to be high. Indole groups provide aromatic stabilization and coordination sites. (e.g., (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid)

- **Rule 7**: If the molecular modifier contains large substituents that introduce steric hindrance, the yield is likely to be low. Steric hindrance can reduce the accessibility of the metal center. (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid)

- **Rule 8**: If the molecular modifier contains a methoxy group attached to an aromatic ring and no other electron-withdrawing groups, the yield is likely to be high. Methoxy groups donate electron density, stabilizing the catalyst. (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid)

- **Rule 9**: If the molecular modifier contains a nitro group with additional electron-donating groups, the yield is likely to be high. Nitro groups provide electron-withdrawing effects that can stabilize the catalyst in certain contexts. (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid)

- **Rule 10**: If the molecular modifier contains a hydroxyl group adjacent to an aromatic ring without additional stabilizing groups, the yield is likely to be low. Hydroxyl groups can introduce steric hindrance or participate in hydrogen bonding. (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid)

- **Rule 11**: If the molecular modifier contains an acetamido group with additional electron-withdrawing groups, the yield is likely to be low. Acetamido groups introduce steric hindrance and reduce catalyst effectiveness. (e.g., (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid)

- **Rule 12**: If the molecular modifier contains a benzoic acid derivative with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro or halogens, the yield is likely to be high. These groups stabilize the catalyst by withdrawing electron density. (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid)

- **Rule 13**: If the molecular modifier contains a thiol group attached to an aromatic ring but also has electron-donating groups that mitigate the negative impact, the yield may not necessarily be low. Analyze the steric and electronic environment. (e.g., consider revising based on additional data)

- **Rule 14**: If the molecular modifier contains a hydroxyl group in a polyol structure, the yield is likely to be high. The multiple hydroxyl groups can enhance coordination with the metal center. (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid)

- **Rule 15**: If the molecular modifier contains a formyl group adjacent to an aromatic ring, the yield is likely to be low. The formyl group can introduce electron-withdrawing effects that destabilize the catalyst. (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid)

    GPT Model: gpt-4o-2024-08-06
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: If the molecular modifier contains both an amino group and a carboxylic acid group in a linear aliphatic chain, the yield is likely to be high. This arrangement facilitates effective coordination with the metal center. (e.g., 5-aminopentanoic acid)

- **Rule 2**: If the molecular modifier contains a pyridine ring with electron-donating groups such as methyl or methoxy, the yield is likely to be high. However, if the pyridine ring is heavily substituted, steric hindrance may reduce yield. (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid)

- **Rule 3**: If the molecular modifier contains a sulfanyl group attached to a non-aromatic chain and lacks other electron-withdrawing groups, the yield is likely to be high. The sulfanyl group can effectively stabilize the metal center. (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid)

- **Rule 4**: If the molecular modifier contains a benzofuran structure with additional electron-donating groups, the yield is likely to be high. This structure provides rigidity and potential for enhanced coordination. (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid)

- **Rule 5**: If the molecular modifier contains a simple carboxylic acid group without additional electron-withdrawing or donating groups, the yield is likely to be low. However, if the carboxylic acid is part of a larger, stabilizing structure, the yield may be higher. (e.g., octanoic acid)

- **Rule 6**: If the molecular modifier contains an indole group with additional electron-donating groups, the yield is likely to be high. Indole groups provide aromatic stabilization and coordination sites. (e.g., (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid)

- **Rule 7**: If the molecular modifier contains large substituents that introduce steric hindrance, the yield is likely to be low. Steric hindrance can reduce the accessibility of the metal center. (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid)

- **Rule 8**: If the molecular modifier contains a methoxy group attached to an aromatic ring and no other electron-withdrawing groups, the yield is likely to be high. Methoxy groups donate electron density, stabilizing the catalyst. (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid)

- **Rule 9**: If the molecular modifier contains a nitro group with additional electron-donating groups, the yield is likely to be high. Nitro groups provide electron-withdrawing effects that can stabilize the catalyst in certain contexts. (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid)

- **Rule 10**: If the molecular modifier contains a hydroxyl group adjacent to an aromatic ring without additional stabilizing groups, the yield is likely to be low. Hydroxyl groups can introduce steric hindrance or participate in hydrogen bonding. (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid)

- **Rule 11**: If the molecular modifier contains an acetamido group with additional electron-withdrawing groups, the yield is likely to be low. Acetamido groups introduce steric hindrance and reduce catalyst effectiveness. (e.g., (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid)

- **Rule 12**: If the molecular modifier contains a benzoic acid derivative with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro or halogens, the yield is likely to be high. These groups stabilize the catalyst by withdrawing electron density. (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid)

- **Rule 13**: If the molecular modifier contains a thiol group attached to an aromatic ring but also has electron-donating groups that mitigate the negative impact, the yield may not necessarily be low. Analyze the steric and electronic environment. (e.g., consider revising based on additional data)

- **Rule 14**: If the molecular modifier contains a hydroxyl group in a polyol structure, the yield is likely to be high. The multiple hydroxyl groups can enhance coordination with the metal center, especially if they are spatially arranged to avoid interference with metal coordination. (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid)

- **Rule 15**: If the molecular modifier contains a formyl group adjacent to an aromatic ring, the yield is likely to be low. The formyl group can introduce electron-withdrawing effects that destabilize the catalyst. (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid)

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: gpt-4o-2024-08-06
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: If the molecular modifier contains both an amino group and a carboxylic acid group in a linear aliphatic chain, the yield is likely to be high. This arrangement facilitates effective coordination with the metal center. (e.g., 5-aminopentanoic acid)

- **Rule 2**: If the molecular modifier contains a pyridine ring with electron-donating groups such as methyl or methoxy, the yield is likely to be high. However, if the pyridine ring is heavily substituted, steric hindrance may reduce yield. (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid)

- **Rule 3**: If the molecular modifier contains a sulfanyl group attached to a non-aromatic chain and lacks other electron-withdrawing groups, the yield is likely to be high. The sulfanyl group can effectively stabilize the metal center. (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid)

- **Rule 4**: If the molecular modifier contains a benzofuran structure with additional electron-donating groups, the yield is likely to be high. This structure provides rigidity and potential for enhanced coordination. (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid)

- **Rule 5**: If the molecular modifier contains a simple carboxylic acid group without additional electron-withdrawing or donating groups, the yield is likely to be low. However, if the carboxylic acid is part of a larger, stabilizing structure, the yield may be higher. (e.g., octanoic acid)

- **Rule 6**: If the molecular modifier contains an indole group with additional electron-donating groups, the yield is likely to be high. Indole groups provide aromatic stabilization and coordination sites. (e.g., (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid)

- **Rule 7**: If the molecular modifier contains large substituents that introduce steric hindrance, the yield is likely to be low. Steric hindrance can reduce the accessibility of the metal center. (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid)

- **Rule 8**: If the molecular modifier contains a methoxy group attached to an aromatic ring and no other electron-withdrawing groups, the yield is likely to be high. Methoxy groups donate electron density, stabilizing the catalyst. (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid)

- **Rule 9**: If the molecular modifier contains a nitro group with additional electron-donating groups, the yield is likely to be high. Nitro groups provide electron-withdrawing effects that can stabilize the catalyst in certain contexts. (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid)

- **Rule 10**: If the molecular modifier contains a hydroxyl group adjacent to an aromatic ring without additional stabilizing groups, the yield is likely to be low. Hydroxyl groups can introduce steric hindrance or participate in hydrogen bonding. (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid)

- **Rule 11**: If the molecular modifier contains an acetamido group with additional electron-withdrawing groups, the yield is likely to be low. Acetamido groups introduce steric hindrance and reduce catalyst effectiveness. (e.g., (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid)

- **Rule 12**: If the molecular modifier contains a benzoic acid derivative with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro or halogens, the yield is likely to be high. These groups stabilize the catalyst by withdrawing electron density. (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid)

- **Rule 13**: If the molecular modifier contains a thiol group attached to an aromatic ring but also has electron-donating groups that mitigate the negative impact, the yield may not necessarily be low. Analyze the steric and electronic environment. (e.g., consider revising based on additional data)

- **Rule 14**: If the molecular modifier contains a hydroxyl group in a polyol structure, the yield is likely to be high. The multiple hydroxyl groups can enhance coordination with the metal center, especially if they are spatially arranged to avoid interference with metal coordination. (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid)

- **Rule 15**: If the molecular modifier contains a formyl group adjacent to an aromatic ring, the yield is likely to be low. The formyl group can introduce electron-withdrawing effects that destabilize the catalyst. (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid)

- **Rule 2**: If the molecular modifier contains a pyridine ring with electron-donating groups such as methyl or methoxy, and the substituents are positioned to avoid steric hindrance, the yield is likely to be high. (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid)

- **Rule 3**: If the molecular modifier contains a sulfanyl group attached to a non-aromatic chain and lacks other electron-withdrawing groups, the yield is likely to be high. The sulfanyl group can effectively stabilize the metal center. (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid)

- **Rule 4**: If the molecular modifier contains a benzofuran structure with additional electron-donating groups, the yield is likely to be high. This structure provides rigidity and potential for enhanced coordination. (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid)

- **Rule 5**: If the molecular modifier contains a simple carboxylic acid group without additional electron-withdrawing or donating groups, the yield is likely to be low. However, if the carboxylic acid is part of a larger, stabilizing structure, the yield may be higher. (e.g., octanoic acid)

- **Rule 6**: If the molecular modifier contains an indole group with additional electron-donating groups such as alkyl or methoxy groups, the yield is likely to be high. Indole groups provide aromatic stabilization and coordination sites. (e.g., (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid)

- **Rule 7**: If the molecular modifier contains large substituents that introduce steric hindrance, the yield is likely to be low. Steric hindrance can reduce the accessibility of the metal center. (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid)

- **Rule 8**: If the molecular modifier contains a methoxy group attached to an aromatic ring and no other electron-withdrawing groups, the yield is likely to be high. Methoxy groups donate electron density, stabilizing the catalyst. (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid)

- **Rule 9**: If the molecular modifier contains a nitro group with additional electron-donating groups, the yield is likely to be high. Nitro groups provide electron-withdrawing effects that can stabilize the catalyst in certain contexts. (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid)

- **Rule 10**: If the molecular modifier contains a hydroxyl group adjacent to an aromatic ring without additional stabilizing groups, the yield is likely to be low. Hydroxyl groups can introduce steric hindrance or participate in hydrogen bonding. (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid)

- **Rule 11**: If the molecular modifier contains an acetamido group with additional electron-withdrawing groups, the yield is likely to be low. Acetamido groups introduce steric hindrance and reduce catalyst effectiveness. (e.g., (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid)

- **Rule 12**: If the molecular modifier contains a benzoic acid derivative with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro or halogens, the yield is likely to be high. These groups stabilize the catalyst by withdrawing electron density. (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid)

- **Rule 13**: If the molecular modifier contains a thiol group attached to an aromatic ring but also has electron-donating groups that mitigate the negative impact, the yield may not necessarily be low. Analyze the steric and electronic environment. (e.g., consider revising based on additional data)

- **Rule 14**: If the molecular modifier contains a hydroxyl group in a polyol structure, the yield is likely to be high. The multiple hydroxyl groups can enhance coordination with the metal center, especially if they are spatially arranged to avoid interference with metal coordination. (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid)

- **Rule 15**: If the molecular modifier contains a formyl group adjacent to an aromatic ring, the yield is likely to be low. The formyl group can introduce electron-withdrawing effects that destabilize the catalyst. (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid)

- **Rule 5**: If the molecular modifier contains a simple carboxylic acid group without additional electron-withdrawing or donating groups, and is part of a linear aliphatic chain with more than six carbon atoms, the yield is likely to be low. The lack of additional stabilizing interactions reduces effectiveness. (e.g., octanoic acid)

- **Rule 6**: If the molecular modifier contains an indole group with additional electron-donating groups such as alkyl or methoxy groups, the yield is likely to be high. Consider interactions between indole groups and other functional groups present in the molecular modifier. (e.g., (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid)

- **Rule 7**: If the molecular modifier contains large substituents that introduce steric hindrance, especially in proximity to the metal coordination site, the yield is likely to be low. Steric hindrance can reduce the accessibility of the metal center. (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid)

- **Rule 8**: If the molecular modifier contains a methoxy group attached to an aromatic ring and no other electron-withdrawing groups, the yield is likely to be high. Methoxy groups donate electron density, stabilizing the catalyst. (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid)

- **Rule 10**: If the molecular modifier contains a hydroxyl group adjacent to an aromatic ring without additional stabilizing groups, and the hydroxyl group is capable of forming intramolecular hydrogen bonds, the yield is likely to be low. This can interfere with effective coordination. (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid)

- **Rule 11**: If the molecular modifier contains an acetamido group with additional electron-withdrawing groups, and the acetamido group is positioned to introduce steric hindrance near the metal center, the yield is likely to be low. (e.g., (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid)

- **Rule 12**: If the molecular modifier contains a benzoic acid derivative with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro or halogens, and these groups are ortho or para to the carboxylic acid, the yield is likely to be high. These positions enhance electron-withdrawing effects. (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid)

- **Rule 13**: If the molecular modifier contains a hydroxyl group in a polyol structure, and the hydroxyl groups are positioned to form a chelating interaction with the metal center, the yield is likely to be high. (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid)

- **Rule 14**: If the molecular modifier contains a formyl group adjacent to an aromatic ring, and the formyl group is positioned to interact unfavorably with the metal center, the yield is likely to be low. (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid)

- **Rule 15**: If the molecular modifier contains a thiol group attached to an aromatic ring but also has electron-donating groups that mitigate the negative impact, the yield may not necessarily be low. Analyze the steric and electronic environment to determine the effect. Consider revising based on additional data.

- **Rule 13**: If the molecular modifier contains a hydroxyl group in a polyol structure, and the hydroxyl groups are positioned to form a chelating interaction with the metal center, the yield is likely to be high. (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid)

- **Rule 14**: If the molecular modifier contains a formyl group adjacent to an aromatic ring, and the formyl group is positioned to interact unfavorably with the metal center, the yield is likely to be low. (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid)

- **Rule 15**: If the molecular modifier contains a thiol group attached to an aromatic ring but also has electron-donating groups that mitigate the negative impact, the yield may not necessarily be low. Analyze the steric and electronic environment to determine the effect. Consider revising based on additional data.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: If the molecular modifier contains both an amino group and a carboxylic acid group in a linear aliphatic chain, and lacks additional electron-withdrawing groups, the yield is likely to be high. This arrangement facilitates effective coordination with the metal center. (e.g., 5-aminopentanoic acid)

- **Rule 2**: If the molecular modifier contains a pyridine ring with electron-donating groups such as methyl or methoxy, and the substituents are positioned to avoid steric hindrance, the yield is likely to be high. Ensure that the substituents do not interfere with metal center coordination. (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid)

- **Rule 3**: If the molecular modifier contains a sulfanyl group attached to a non-aromatic chain and lacks other electron-withdrawing groups, the yield is likely to be high. The sulfanyl group can effectively stabilize the metal center. (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid)

- **Rule 4**: If the molecular modifier contains a benzofuran structure with additional electron-donating groups, the yield is likely to be high. This structure provides rigidity and potential for enhanced coordination. (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid)

- **Rule 5**: If the molecular modifier contains a simple carboxylic acid group without additional electron-withdrawing or donating groups, and is part of a linear aliphatic chain with more than six carbon atoms, the yield is likely to be low. The lack of additional stabilizing interactions reduces effectiveness. (e.g., octanoic acid)

- **Rule 6**: If the molecular modifier contains an indole group with additional electron-donating groups such as alkyl or methoxy groups, the yield is likely to be high. Consider interactions between indole groups and other functional groups present in the molecular modifier. (e.g., (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid)

- **Rule 7**: If the molecular modifier contains large substituents that introduce steric hindrance, especially in proximity to the metal coordination site, the yield is likely to be low. Steric hindrance can reduce the accessibility of the metal center. (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid)

- **Rule 8**: If the molecular modifier contains a methoxy group attached to an aromatic ring and no other electron-withdrawing groups, the yield is likely to be high. Methoxy groups donate electron density, stabilizing the catalyst. (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid)

- **Rule 9**: If the molecular modifier contains a nitro group with additional electron-donating groups, and these groups are positioned to enhance the electron-withdrawing effect of the nitro group, the yield is likely to be high. (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid)

- **Rule 10**: If the molecular modifier contains a hydroxyl group adjacent to an aromatic ring without additional stabilizing groups, and the hydroxyl group is capable of forming intramolecular hydrogen bonds, the yield is likely to be low. This can interfere with effective coordination. (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid)

- **Rule 11**: If the molecular modifier contains an acetamido group with additional electron-withdrawing groups, and the acetamido group is positioned to introduce steric hindrance near the metal center, the yield is likely to be low. (e.g., (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid)

- **Rule 12**: If the molecular modifier contains a benzoic acid derivative with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro or halogens, and these groups are ortho or para to the carboxylic acid, the yield is likely to be high. These positions enhance electron-withdrawing effects. (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid)

- **Rule 13**: If the molecular modifier contains a hydroxyl group in a polyol structure, and the hydroxyl groups are positioned to form a chelating interaction with the metal center, the yield is likely to be high. (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid)

- **Rule 14**: If the molecular modifier contains a formyl group adjacent to an aromatic ring, and the formyl group is positioned to interact unfavorably with the metal center, the yield is likely to be low. (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid)

- **Rule 15**: If the molecular modifier contains a thiol group attached to an aromatic ring but also has electron-donating groups that mitigate the negative impact, the yield may not necessarily be low. Analyze the steric and electronic environment to determine the effect. (e.g., 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid)
