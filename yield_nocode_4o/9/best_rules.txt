**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing both a carboxylic acid group (–COOH) and an amino group (–NH2) with an alkyl chain of 5 or fewer carbons tend to result in a high yield. This combination may enhance metal coordination through chelation. (e.g., (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, 5-aminopentanoic acid)

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers with a phenyl group (–C6H5) and a hydroxyl group (–OH) tend to result in a high yield. The phenyl group can enhance π-π interactions with the catalyst, while the hydroxyl group can participate in hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the structure. (e.g., 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid)

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a sulfanyl group (–SH) tend to result in a high yield. The sulfanyl group can form strong bonds with metal centers, potentially enhancing catalytic activity. (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid)

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and a carboxylic acid group (–COOH) tend to result in a low yield unless additional electron-withdrawing groups are present, which can mitigate the strong coordination effect. (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid)

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers with multiple methoxy groups (–OCH3) tend to result in a low yield. The electron-donating nature of methoxy groups might disrupt the electronic environment of the catalyst. (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid)

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing a nitro group (–NO2) tend to result in a high yield, especially when combined with other electron-withdrawing groups, which can enhance the electrophilicity of the metal center. (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid)

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with a trifluoromethyl group (–CF3) tend to result in a low yield. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of the trifluoromethyl group may overly stabilize the metal center, reducing its reactivity. (e.g., 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid)

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with an indole group tend to result in a high yield. The indole group can participate in π-π stacking and hydrogen bonding, potentially enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. (e.g., (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid)

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with a benzofuran group tend to result in a high yield. The benzofuran structure can facilitate π-π interactions and possibly stabilize the metal center. (e.g., 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid)

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with an alkyl chain of 7 or more carbons tend to result in a low yield. The increased steric bulk may hinder effective interaction with the catalyst. (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid)

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group (–COOH) and a bromine atom (–Br) tend to result in a high yield. The bromine atom may facilitate radical formation, enhancing the reaction process. (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid)

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with a phenyl group (–C6H5) and a methoxy group (–OCH3) tend to result in a low yield. The electron-donating methoxy group may disrupt the electronic environment of the catalyst. (e.g., 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid)

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with a pyridine ring tend to result in a low yield unless paired with electron-withdrawing groups that can balance the strong coordination effect. (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, pyridine-3-carboxylic acid)

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with a formyl group (–CHO) tend to result in a low yield. The formyl group may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorable electronic effects that reduce catalytic efficiency. (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid)

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with a hydroxyl group (–OH) and a sulfanyl group (–SH) tend to result in a high yield. The combination of these groups can enhance metal coordination and stabilize the catalyst through hydrogen bonding and thiol-metal interactions. (e.g., 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid)
