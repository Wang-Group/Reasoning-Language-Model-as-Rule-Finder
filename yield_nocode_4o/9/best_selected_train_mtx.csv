Rule 1: Modifiers containing both a carboxylic acid group (–COOH) and an amino group (–NH2) with an alkyl chain of 5 or fewer carbons tend to result in a high yield.,Rule 2: Modifiers with a phenyl group (–C6H5) and a hydroxyl group (–OH) tend to result in a high yield.,Rule 4: Modifiers with a pyridine ring and a carboxylic acid group (–COOH) tend to result in a low yield unless additional electron-withdrawing groups are present.,Rule 6: Modifiers containing a nitro group (–NO2) tend to result in a high yield.,Rule 8: Modifiers with an indole group tend to result in a high yield.,Rule 9: Modifiers with a benzofuran group tend to result in a high yield.,Rule 11: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group (–COOH) and a bromine atom (–Br) tend to result in a high yield.,Rule 12: Modifiers with a phenyl group (–C6H5) and a methoxy group (–OCH3) tend to result in a low yield.
