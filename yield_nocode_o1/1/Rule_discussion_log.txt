- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and provides specific structural criteria that unambiguously predict high yield—aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position. The physical-chemical insight is adequate, explaining how electron-withdrawing groups stabilize reaction intermediates, enhancing catalyst effectiveness. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures (aromatic ring, carboxylic acid, electron-withdrawing group), meeting the complexity criterion. It is supported by multiple data points in the dataset (e.g., compounds at indices 0 and 20 for high yield, and 19 for low yield), satisfying the coverage criterion. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear in specifying that simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups predict high yield. The physical-chemical insight is acceptable, stating that the absence of steric hindrance or electronic complications allows optimal interaction with the catalyst. The rule combines sub-structures by specifying both the aliphatic chain and the lack of polar groups, satisfying the complexity criterion. It is supported by multiple data points (e.g., octanoic acid at index 4 for high yield and 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid at index 29 for low yield), meeting the coverage requirement. The rule balances simplicity and coverage effectively.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear in identifying amino acids with non-aromatic or polar side chains near the carboxylic group as predictors of high yield. The physical-chemical insight is sound, relating polar side chains to coordination with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and activity. The rule involves a combination of sub-structures (amino acid backbone with specific side chains), meeting the complexity criterion. It is supported by multiple data points (e.g., compounds at indices 1 and 2 for high yield, and 12 for low yield), satisfying the coverage requirement. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is mostly clear but would benefit from specifying the exact chain length threshold (e.g., specifying "chains longer than C5"). The physical-chemical insight is reasonable, suggesting that terminal polar groups on long aliphatic chains can cause unfavorable intermolecular interactions, reducing catalyst efficiency. The rule incorporates multiple sub-structures (chain length, terminal polar group, carboxylic acid), satisfying the complexity criterion. It is supported by multiple data points (e.g., indices 31 and 34 for low yield, and 2 for high yield), though coverage could be enhanced by including more examples. The balance between complexity and coverage is acceptable.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear in specifying that modifiers with perfluorinated aliphatic chains predict low yield. The physical-chemical insight is plausible, indicating that increased lipophilicity and steric effects from fluorination may hinder proper interaction with the catalyst. The rule is simple but lacks complexity as it focuses on a single structural feature. It is supported by only one data point in the dataset (index 13 for low yield), limiting coverage. The rule may need additional supporting data to be robust.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear, specifying that pyridine carboxylic acids with the pyridine ring directly attached to the carboxyl group predict high yield. The physical-chemical insight is sound, explaining that pyridine rings can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity. The rule combines sub-structures (heteroaromatic ring, carboxylic acid, direct attachment), meeting the complexity criterion. It is supported by multiple data points (e.g., indices 7 and 21 for high yield, and 11 for low yield), satisfying the coverage requirement. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear in identifying aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position as predictors of low yield. The physical-chemical insight is plausible, explaining that electron-donating groups can destabilize reaction intermediates by increasing electron density. The rule incorporates combinations of sub-structures, satisfying the complexity criterion. It is supported by multiple data points (e.g., indices 22 and 30 for low yield). However, there is an exception with 4-aminobenzoic acid at index 3 showing high yield despite the amino group's electron-donating nature. This suggests that the rule may need refinement to account for such cases.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear, specifying amino acids with electron-rich heteroaromatic side chains as predictors of high yield. The physical-chemical insight is reasonable, citing enhanced interaction with the catalyst through π-coordination. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures, meeting the complexity criterion. However, it is supported by only one data point in the dataset (tryptophan at index 14 for high yield), limiting coverage. Additional supporting examples would strengthen the rule's validity.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear, identifying aromatic carboxylic acids with formyl groups at the para position as predictors of low yield. The physical-chemical insight is plausible, suggesting that aldehyde groups may undergo side reactions or deactivate the catalyst. The rule combines multiple sub-structures, fulfilling the complexity criterion. It is supported by multiple data points (e.g., indices 19 and 18 for low yield), satisfying the coverage requirement. The balance between complexity and coverage is acceptable.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is somewhat general and could benefit from more specific structural criteria to enhance clarity. The physical-chemical insight is acceptable, relating steric hindrance to reduced catalyst interaction. The rule lacks specificity in terms of which bulky groups adjacent to the carboxyl group affect yield, which may impact clarity. It is supported by only one data point (index 11 for low yield), limiting coverage. Refinement and additional supporting examples are needed to strengthen this rule.

- **Comment 1**: In **Rule 2**, the supporting example **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** contains a phenyl group with a hydroxy substituent, which is an additional polar functional group. This seems inconsistent with the rule's condition of "*without additional polar functional groups*". Clarifying whether exceptions are allowed or refining the rule to accommodate such cases would improve its clarity.

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 9** states that modifiers that are "*heterocyclic carboxylic acids with nitrogen-containing rings*" predict **high yield**, but the contrasting example **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** predicts **low yield**. This may cause confusion since pyridinyl groups are nitrogen-containing heterocycles. Providing more insight into why certain nitrogen heterocycles result in low yield (e.g., due to steric hindrance from fused rings) would enhance the rule's clarity.

- **Comment 3**: There is overlap between **Rule 8** and **Rule 13**, both involving aliphatic carboxylic acids with coordinating groups near the carboxyl group predicting **high yield**. Combining these rules could streamline the rule set and reduce redundancy, making it easier to apply them effectively.

- **Comment 4**: In **Rule 11**, modifiers with bulky substituents or fused aromatic rings predict **low yield**, yet **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan), which contains a bulky indole ring, is listed as resulting in **high yield**. This contradiction suggests that additional factors influence the outcome. Clarifying the role of specific bulky groups that may enhance coordination despite their size would improve the rule's accuracy.

- **Comment 5**: Several rules differentiate outcomes based on subtle structural differences, such as the position of functional groups or chain length (e.g., **Rule 2** vs. **Rule 3**, **Rule 6** vs. **Rule 14**). Emphasizing these distinctions and providing more detailed explanations would enhance the rules' clarity and applicability.

- **Comment 6**: Overall, the rules demonstrate good coverage and provide valuable physical-chemical insights by considering combinations of substructures. Addressing the noted inconsistencies and overlaps will improve their clarity and effectiveness for predicting reaction yields.

Supported by 4-methylbenzoic acid and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (both low yield), the rule is clear with reasonable property insight. However, potential overlap with Rule 4 (amino groups at para position predicting high yield) should be addressed to prevent confusion.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 discusses modifiers with bulky aromatic groups connected via flexible aliphatic linkers predicting high yield, provided steric hindrance is minimized. Supported by 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid (high yield), the rule is somewhat complex but provides good property insight. Coverage is limited and could be improved with more examples.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 states that modifiers with functional groups capable of chelation predict high yield.

   - **Explanation**: Ether oxygen atoms may compete with the carboxylate for metal coordination, and increased molecular flexibility can reduce effective binding to the metal center.
   - **Supporting Examples**:
     - **Low Yield**:
       - **2-[2-(2-Methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Low yield)
       - **3-[2-(2-Aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Low yield)

10. **Rule 10**: *Modifiers containing **perfluoroalkyl chains or strong electron-withdrawing fluoroalkyl groups** predict **low yield** due to excessive electron withdrawal affecting coordination.*

    - **Explanation**: Strong electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms increase the acidity excessively, potentially destabilizing the metal complex and reducing catalytic efficiency.
    - **Supporting Examples**:
      - **Low Yield**:
        - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Low yield; perfluorinated chain)

11. **Rule 11**: *Modifiers with **acylated amino groups or other blocking groups on potential coordinating sites** predict **low yield** due to reduced availability for metal coordination.*

    - **Explanation**: Acylation of amino groups diminishes their ability to coordinate with the metal center, weakening chelation and decreasing catalytic activity.
    - **Supporting Examples**:
      - **Low Yield**:
        - **(2S)-6-Acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Low yield; acetamido group blocks coordination)
        - **2-[(4-Hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Low yield; acylated amino group)

12. **Rule 12**: *Modifiers with **thiol groups on short aliphatic chains near the carboxyl group** predict **high yield**; thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings predict **low yield** due to reduced nucleophilicity.*

    - **Explanation**: Aliphatic thiols are highly nucleophilic and can effectively coordinate with the metal center. Aromatic thiols are less nucleophilic due to resonance stabilization in the aromatic system.
    - **Supporting Examples**:
      - **High Yield**:
        - **3-Sulfanylpropanoic acid** (High yield; thiol group three carbons away from carboxyl)
      - **Low Yield**:
        - **4-Sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Low yield; thiol attached to aromatic ring)

13. **Rule 13**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids linked via a sufficiently long aliphatic chain (four or more carbons) to an additional aromatic ring** predict **high yield**; shorter chains may predict **low yield** due to electronic and steric effects.*

    - **Explanation**: Longer aliphatic spacers reduce the electron-donating influence and steric hindrance of the additional aromatic ring, preserving the carboxyl group's ability to coordinate with the metal center.
    - **Supporting Examples**:
      - **High Yield**:
        - **5-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (High yield; pentyl spacer reduces interference)
      - **Low Yield**:
        - **3-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Low yield; propyl spacer insufficient)

14. **Rule 14**: *Modifiers that are **keto acids with carbonyl groups positioned to chelate the metal center** predict **high yield**; those unable to form stable chelates predict **low yield**.*

    - **Explanation**: Adjacent carbonyl groups can form stable chelate rings with the metal, enhancing complex stability and catalytic efficiency.
    - **Supporting Examples**:
      - **High Yield**:
        - **1,3-Dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (High yield; carbonyl groups enable chelation)
      - **Low Yield**:
        - **4-Oxoheptanedioic acid** (Low yield; carbonyl groups too distant for chelation)

15. **Rule 15**: *Modifiers that are **amino acids with side chains containing sulfur groups that are not available for coordination (e.g., acylated thiols)** predict **low yield** due to blocked coordination sites.*

    - **Explanation**: If sulfur-containing side chains are modified or blocked, they cannot coordinate with the metal center, reducing catalytic effectiveness.
    - **Supporting Examples**:
      - **Low Yield**:
        - **2-[[(2S)-2-Amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (Low yield; sulfur is part of a thioether, not a thiol)
        - **4-[(2,2,2-Trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** (Low yield; acylated amino group)

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**:

  **Rule 1** is clear; it allows us to predict the yield based on the presence of electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups on aromatic carboxylic acids. The physical-chemical insight is sound, explaining how electron-withdrawing groups enhance the acidity of the carboxyl group and improve coordination with the metal center, leading to higher yields. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures (aromatic ring, carboxylic acid, substituents) rather than a single functional group. It is well-supported by multiple data points: 4-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid (high yield), and 4-methylbenzoic acid (low yield), satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 2**:

  **Rule 2** is clear, focusing on aromatic carboxylic acids with amino groups at the para position predicting high yield due to additional coordination through the amino group. The physical-chemical insight is adequate, explaining the chelating effect of the amino group enhancing catalyst stability. It considers combinations of sub-structures. However, the rule has limited coverage, with only one supporting high-yield example (4-aminobenzoic acid). Including more data points would strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 3**:

  **Rule 3** is clear, predicting high yield for aliphatic carboxylic acids with unbranched hydrocarbon chains of eight carbons and no additional functional groups, and low yield when polar functional groups are present. The physical-chemical insight is reasonable, noting that hydrophobic chains interact effectively without interfering with metal coordination. It considers combinations of sub-structures. The rule is supported by octanoic acid (high yield) and 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid (low yield), satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 4**:

  **Rule 4** is clear, stating that ω-amino acids with the amino group three carbons away from the carboxyl group predict high yield, while longer chains with the amino group more distant predict low yield. The physical-chemical insight is plausible, relating the proximity of the amino group to effective chelation with the metal center. It considers combinations of sub-structures. Supported by 5-aminopentanoic acid (high yield) and 7-aminoheptanoic acid (low yield), the rule meets the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 5**:

  **Rule 5** is clear, indicating that α-amino acids with side chains containing additional coordinating groups predict high yield, while those without such groups predict low yield. The physical-chemical insight is strong, emphasizing side chains capable of coordinating with the metal center to form more stable complexes. It considers combinations of sub-structures. The rule is supported by (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid) and (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan) for high yield, and (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine) for low yield, satisfying coverage.

- **Comment 6**:

  **Rule 6** is clear, stating that aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups attached directly to the ring predict low yield due to possible interference with metal coordination.

- **Comment 8**:

  **Rule 8** is clear, predicting high yield for aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group and low yield when hydroxyl groups are distant. The physical-chemical insight is reasonable, explaining how multiple hydroxyl groups enhance chelation. It considers combinations of sub-structures. Supported by (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid) for high yield and 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid for low yield, the rule satisfies coverage.

- **Comment 9**:

  **Rule 9** is clear, predicting low yield for modifiers containing long hydrophilic chains with ether linkages near the carboxyl group due to competition for coordination and increased flexibility. The physical-chemical insight is adequate. It considers combinations of sub-structures.

- **Comment 10**:

  **Rule 10** is clear, stating that modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl chains or strong electron-withdrawing fluoroalkyl groups predict low yield due to excessive electron withdrawal affecting coordination. The physical-chemical insight is reasonable. It considers combinations of sub-structures. However, the rule has limited coverage with only one supporting example (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid). Additional data points would enhance its validity.

- **Comment 11**:

  **Rule 11** is clear, predicting low yield for modifiers with acylated amino groups or other blocking groups on potential coordinating sites due to reduced availability for metal coordination.

Supported by 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid (high yield) and 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid (low yield), the rule meets the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 13**:

  **Rule 13** is clear, stating that aromatic carboxylic acids linked via a sufficiently long aliphatic chain (four or more carbons) to an additional aromatic ring predict high yield, whereas shorter chains may predict low yield due to steric and electronic effects. The physical-chemical insight is plausible. It considers combinations of sub-structures. Supported by 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid (high yield) and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (low yield), the rule satisfies coverage.

- **Comment 14**:

  **Rule 14** is clear, predicting high yield for keto acids with carbonyl groups positioned to chelate the metal center and low yield for those unable to form stable chelates. The physical-chemical insight is sound, explaining the role of chelation in enhancing catalytic efficiency. It considers combinations of sub-structures. Supported by 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid (high yield) and 4-oxoheptanedioic acid (low yield), the rule meets the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 15**:

  **Rule 15** is clear, predicting low yield for amino acids with side chains containing sulfur groups that are not available for coordination (e.g., acylated thiols) due to blocked coordination sites. The physical-chemical insight is adequate, highlighting the importance of free coordinating groups. It considers combinations of sub-structures. Supported by 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid and 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid (both low yield), the rule satisfies coverage.
