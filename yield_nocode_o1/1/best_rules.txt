**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are **unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of six or more carbons and no additional functional groups** predict **high yield**.*

   - **Explanation**: Long, unbranched aliphatic chains without interfering functional groups allow the carboxylate to coordinate effectively with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity.
   - **Supporting Example**:
     - **Octanoic acid** (High yield)
   - **Contrasting Examples**:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Low yield; the hydroxyl group may compete with the carboxylate for metal coordination)
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Low yield; the amino group can interfere with metal binding)
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Low yield; the distant amino group reduces coordination efficiency)

2. **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halogen) at the para position** predict **high yield**.*

   - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing deprotonation and metal coordination.
   - **Supporting Examples**:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (High yield)
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (High yield)
   - **Contrasting Examples**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Low yield; methyl group is electron-donating, decreasing acidity)
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Low yield; aldehyde group may participate in side reactions or hinder coordination)

3. **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with amino groups at the para position and no additional interfering groups** predict **high yield**.*

   - **Explanation**: The amino group can serve as an additional coordination site with the metal center, forming stronger complexes and enhancing catalytic performance.
   - **Supporting Example**:
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (High yield)
   - **Contrasting Examples**:
     - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Low yield; thiol group on the aromatic ring is less effective in coordination)
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Low yield; lacks an amino group for additional coordination)

4. **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are **ω-amino acids with the amino group within five carbons of the carboxyl group** predict **high yield**, while those with more distant amino groups predict **low yield**.*

   - **Explanation**: Proximity of the amino group to the carboxylate allows effective chelation with the metal center, enhancing complex stability and catalytic activity.
   - **Supporting Example**:
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (High yield)
   - **Contrasting Examples**:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Low yield; amino group too distant for effective chelation)
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Low yield; reduced chelation due to increased chain length)

5. **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains capable of additional coordination (e.g., carboxylate, indole groups)** predict **high yield**, whereas those with non-coordinating side chains predict **low yield**.*

   - **Explanation**: Side chains that can participate in metal coordination form more stable complexes, enhancing catalytic performance.
   - **Supporting Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)** (High yield; side-chain carboxylate aids in coordination)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)** (High yield; indole ring can coordinate via π-interactions)
   - **Contrasting Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)** (Low yield; phenyl side chain lacks coordinating ability)
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Low yield; acetamido group blocks coordination)

6. **Rule 6**: *Modifiers containing **multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group (polyhydroxy acids)** predict **high yield**, while those with isolated or distant hydroxyl groups predict **low yield**.*

   - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance the ligand's ability to chelate the metal center by forming additional coordination sites, increasing complex stability and catalytic performance.
   - **Supporting Example**:
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)** (High yield)
   - **Contrasting Examples**:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Low yield; single hydroxyl group is too distant for effective chelation)
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Low yield; hydroxyl group on aromatic ring without spacer may interfere)

7. **Rule 7**: *Modifiers containing **aldehyde groups attached directly to the aromatic ring** predict **low yield**, possibly due to interference with coordination or side reactions.*

   - **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups can form intramolecular interactions or participate in side reactions, reducing the availability of the carboxylate for metal coordination.
   - **Supporting Examples**:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Low yield)
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Low yield)

8. **Rule 8**: *Modifiers containing **fluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups** predict **low yield** due to excessive electron withdrawal.*

   - **Explanation**: Strong electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms increase the acidity excessively, potentially reducing the electron density necessary for effective metal coordination.
   - **Supporting Examples**:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Low yield)
     - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** (Low yield)

9. **Rule 9**: *Modifiers containing **ether linkages near the carboxyl group** predict **low yield** due to competition for coordination and increased flexibility.*

   - **Explanation**: Ether oxygen atoms may compete with the carboxylate for metal coordination, and increased flexibility can reduce effective binding to the metal center.
   - **Supporting Examples**:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Low yield)
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Low yield)

10. **Rule 10**: *Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms in the ring capable of coordinating with the metal center** predict **high yield**.*

    - **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings serve as additional coordination sites, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and catalytic efficiency.
    - **Supporting Examples**:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)** (High yield)
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (High yield)
    - **Contrasting Example**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Low yield; pyridine ring attached via a phenyl spacer reduces coordination effectiveness)

11. **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., hydroxyl, methoxy) attached directly to the ring without an aliphatic spacer** predict **low yield**.*

    - **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing its ability to coordinate with the metal center.
    - **Supporting Examples**:
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Low yield)
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Low yield)
    - **Contrasting Example**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (High yield; aliphatic spacer separates the hydroxyl group, mitigating its effect)

12. **Rule 12**: *Modifiers containing **thiol groups on aliphatic chains near the carboxyl group (within three carbons)** predict **high yield**, while those with thiol groups on aromatic rings predict **low yield**.*

    - **Explanation**: Aliphatic thiols are more nucleophilic and can effectively coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalytic performance. Aromatic thiols are less effective due to resonance stabilization.
    - **Supporting Examples**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (High yield)
    - **Contrasting Example**:
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Low yield)

13. **Rule 13**: *Modifiers that are **amino acids or carboxylic acids with acylated amino groups** predict **low yield** due to blocked coordination sites.*

    - **Explanation**: Acylation of amino groups reduces their availability for metal coordination, weakening chelation and decreasing catalytic activity.
    - **Supporting Examples**:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Low yield)
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Low yield)

14. **Rule 14**: *Modifiers that are **keto acids with carbonyl groups positioned to chelate the metal center** predict **high yield**, whereas those unable to form stable chelates predict **low yield**.*

    - **Explanation**: Adjacent carbonyl groups can form stable chelate rings with the metal, enhancing complex stability and catalytic efficiency.
    - **Supporting Examples**:
      - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (High yield)
      - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (High yield)
    - **Contrasting Example**:
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Low yield; carbonyl groups are too distant to effectively chelate)

15. **Rule 15**: *Modifiers with **functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) located more than five carbons away from the carboxyl group in long aliphatic chains** predict **low yield** due to reduced coordination potential and increased flexibility.*

    - **Explanation**: Distant functional groups are less effective in assisting metal coordination, and increased chain flexibility can decrease binding efficiency.
    - **Supporting Examples**:
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Low yield)
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Low yield)
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Low yield)
