Rule 1: Modifiers that are unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of six or more carbons and no additional functional groups predict high yield.,"Rule 2: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halogen) at the para position predict high yield.",Rule 3: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with amino groups at the para position and no additional interfering groups predict high yield.,"Rule 4: Modifiers that are ω-amino acids with the amino group within five carbons of the carboxyl group predict high yield, while those with more distant amino groups predict low yield.","Rule 5: Modifiers that are α-amino acids with side chains capable of additional coordination (e.g., carboxylate, indole groups) predict high yield, whereas those with non-coordinating side chains predict low yield.","Rule 6: Modifiers containing multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group (polyhydroxy acids) predict high yield, while those with isolated or distant hydroxyl groups predict low yield.","Rule 7: Modifiers containing aldehyde groups attached directly to the aromatic ring predict low yield, possibly due to interference with coordination or side reactions.",Rule 8: Modifiers containing fluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups predict low yield due to excessive electron withdrawal.,Rule 9: Modifiers containing ether linkages near the carboxyl group predict low yield due to competition for coordination and increased flexibility.,Rule 10: Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms in the ring capable of coordinating with the metal center predict high yield.,"Rule 11: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., hydroxyl, methoxy) attached directly to the ring without an aliphatic spacer predict low yield.","Rule 12: Modifiers containing thiol groups on aliphatic chains near the carboxyl group (within three carbons) predict high yield, while those with thiol groups on aromatic rings predict low yield.",Rule 13: Modifiers that are amino acids or carboxylic acids with acylated amino groups predict low yield due to blocked coordination sites.,"Rule 14: Modifiers that are keto acids with carbonyl groups positioned to chelate the metal center predict high yield, whereas those unable to form stable chelates predict low yield.","Rule 15: Modifiers with functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) located more than five carbons away from the carboxyl group in long aliphatic chains predict low yield due to reduced coordination potential and increased flexibility."
