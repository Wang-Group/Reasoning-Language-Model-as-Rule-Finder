      - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (Low yield)

13. **Rule 13**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (such as methyl or methoxy groups) at the para position** predict **low yield**.*

    - **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing the stability of the carboxylate anion and weakening coordination with metal centers.
    - **Supporting Examples**:
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Low yield)
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Low yield)
    - **Contrasting Example**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (High yield; hydroxyphenyl group connected via longer aliphatic chain may reduce electron-donating effect on carboxyl group)

14. **Rule 14**: *Modifiers with **bulky aromatic groups connected via flexible aliphatic linkers** predict **high yield**, provided that steric hindrance around the coordination site is minimized.*

    - **Explanation**: Flexible linkers allow the bulky aromatic groups to position themselves without impeding the carboxylate's ability to coordinate with the metal center. Additionally, these aromatic groups may participate in π-interactions that stabilize the catalyst.
    - **Supporting Example**:
      - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (High yield)
    - **Contrasting Example**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Low yield; rigid linkage and potential steric hindrance may interfere with coordination)

15. **Rule 15**: *Modifiers containing **functional groups capable of chelation (such as adjacent carbonyl and hydroxyl groups or diketones)** predict **high yield**.*

    - **Explanation**: Chelating ligands form strong, stable complexes with metals by donating multiple pairs of electrons, enhancing catalyst stability and performance.
    - **Supporting Example**:
      - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (High yield; presence of adjacent carbonyl groups facilitates chelation)
    - **Contrasting Example**:

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are **unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids with chains of six or more carbons and no additional functional groups** predict **high yield**.*

   - **Explanation**: These long-chain fatty acids can coordinate effectively with the metal center via the carboxyl group without steric hindrance or interference from other functional groups, enhancing catalytic activity.
   - **Supporting Example**:
     - **Octanoic acid** (High yield)
   - **Contrasting Examples**:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Low yield; hydroxyl group may compete with carboxylate for metal coordination)
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Low yield; amino group can interfere with metal binding)
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Low yield; terminal amino group reduces coordination efficiency)

2. **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halogen derivatives) at the para position and no other interfering functional groups** predict **high yield**.*

   - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to deprotonate and coordinate with the metal center, thus strengthening metal-ligand interactions and improving catalytic performance.
   - **Supporting Examples**:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (High yield)
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (High yield)
   - **Contrasting Examples**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Low yield; methyl group is electron-donating, decreasing carboxylate acidity)
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Low yield; aldehyde group may engage in side reactions or hinder coordination)

3. **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are **amino acids with side chains capable of additional coordination (e.g., carboxylate, amino, indole groups)** predict **high yield**, whereas those with non-coordinating side chains predict **low yield**.*

   - **Explanation**: Side chains that can participate in metal coordination enhance complex stability and catalytic efficiency by forming additional interactions with the metal center.
   - **Supporting Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)** (High yield; side-chain carboxylate aids coordination)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)** (High yield; indole ring can coordinate via π-interactions)
   - **Contrasting Example**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)** (Low yield; phenyl side chain lacks coordinating ability)

4. **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly attached to the ring and no additional interfering groups** predict **high yield**.*

   - **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings can serve as additional coordination sites, forming stable chelate complexes with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity.
   - **Supporting Examples**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)** (High yield)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (High yield)
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (High yield)
   - **Contrasting Example**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Low yield; nitrogen heterocycle is not directly attached to the carboxyl group, reducing coordination efficiency)

5. **Rule 5**: *Modifiers containing **multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group (polyhydroxy acids)** predict **high yield**.*

   - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance the ligand's ability to chelate the metal center by forming additional hydrogen bonds and coordination sites, increasing complex stability and improving catalytic performance.
   - **Supporting Examples**:
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)** (High yield)
     - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]-2-oxoacetic acid** (High yield)
   - **Contrasting Example**:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Low yield; single hydroxyl group and distance from carboxyl group reduce chelation potential)

6. **Rule 6**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino groups positioned close to the carboxyl group (within three carbons)** predict **high yield**, whereas those with amino groups distant from the carboxyl group predict **low yield**.*

   - **Explanation**: Proximity of the amino group allows for effective chelation with the metal center, enhancing complex stability and catalytic activity.
   - **Supporting Example**:
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (High yield; amino group at position 5 promotes chelation)
   - **Contrasting Examples**:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Low yield; amino group is too distant to effectively coordinate)
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Low yield; reduced chelation due to distance)

7. **Rule 7**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups near the carboxyl group (within three carbons)** predict **high yield**, while those with thiol groups on aromatic rings predict **low yield**.*

   - **Explanation**: Aliphatic thiols are more nucleophilic and can effectively coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalytic performance. Thiol groups on aromatic rings are less nucleophilic due to resonance stabilization, diminishing their coordination ability.
   - **Supporting Example**:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (High yield)
   - **Contrasting Example**:
     - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Low yield)

8. **Rule 8**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxy) directly attached to the ring without an aliphatic spacer** predict **low yield**.*

   - **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing its ability to coordinate with the metal center. This weakens metal-ligand interactions and decreases catalytic efficiency.
   - **Supporting Examples**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Low yield)
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Low yield)
   - **Contrasting Example**:
     - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (High yield; aliphatic spacer mitigates the electron-donating effect and steric hindrance)

9. **Rule 9**: *Modifiers containing **flexible ether linkages or multiple ether groups near the carboxyl group** predict **low yield**.*

   - **Explanation**: Ether oxygen atoms may compete with the carboxylate for metal coordination, and the increased flexibility can reduce the effective binding of the ligand to the metal center, diminishing catalytic activity.
   - **Supporting Examples**:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Low yield)
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Low yield)

10. **Rule 10**: *Modifiers with **acylated amino groups (amides) near the carboxyl group** predict **low yield** due to blocked coordination sites.*

    - **Explanation**: Acylation of the amino group reduces its availability for metal coordination, weakening chelation and decreasing catalytic activity.
    - **Supporting Examples**:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Low yield)
      - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (Low yield)

11. **Rule 11**: *Modifiers containing **fluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups** predict **low yield**.*

    - **Explanation**: Strong electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms excessively increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, causing the carboxylate to become less effective in coordinating with the metal center due to decreased electron density.
    - **Supporting Examples**:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Low yield)
      - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** (Low yield)

12. **Rule 12**: *Modifiers with **aldehyde groups adjacent to the carboxyl group on aromatic rings** predict **low yield** due to potential side reactions or intramolecular interactions.*

    - **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds or undergo side reactions, reducing the availability of the carboxylate for metal coordination and diminishing catalytic efficiency.
    - **Supporting Examples**:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Low yield)
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Low yield)

13. **Rule 13**: *Modifiers that are **keto acids with carbonyl groups positioned to chelate the metal center** predict **high yield**.*

    - **Explanation**: Adjacent carbonyl groups can chelate the metal, forming stable five- or six-membered rings that enhance complex stability and catalytic efficiency.
    - **Supporting Example**:
      - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (High yield)
    - **Contrasting Example**:
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Low yield; carbonyl groups are too distant to effectively chelate)

      - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (High yield)
    - **Contrasting Example**:
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Low yield; carbonyl groups are too distant to effectively chelate)

11. **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with distant (more than five carbons away) amino or hydroxyl groups** predict **low yield** due to reduced coordination potential.*

    - **Explanation**: Distant functional groups are less effective in assisting metal coordination, and increased chain length may introduce flexibility that decreases binding efficiency.
    - **Supporting Examples**:
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Low yield)
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Low yield)
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Low yield)

12. **Rule 12**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups directly attached to the ring** predict **low yield**, possibly due to interference with coordination or side reactions.*

      - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (Low yield)

14. **Rule 14**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy or hydroxy substituents directly attached to the aromatic ring** predict **low yield**, unless separated by an aliphatic spacer.*

    - **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing its ability to coordinate with the metal center. An aliphatic spacer can mitigate this effect by distancing the electron-donating group.
    - **Supporting Examples**:
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Low yield)
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Low yield)
    - **Contrasting Example**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (High yield; aliphatic spacer allows effective coordination)

15. **Rule 15**: *Modifiers containing **thiol groups on aliphatic chains near the carboxyl group (within three carbons)** predict **high yield**, while those with thiol groups on aromatic rings predict **low yield**.*

    - **Explanation**: Aliphatic thiols are more nucleophilic and can effectively coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalytic performance. Aromatic thiols are less nucleophilic due to resonance stabilization.
    - **Supporting Example**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (High yield)
    - **Contrasting Example**:
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Low yield)

    **Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are **unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of seven or more carbons and no additional polar functional groups** predict **high yield**.*

   - **Explanation**: Long, unbranched aliphatic chains without interfering functional groups allow the carboxylate to effectively coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity through hydrophobic interactions and optimal packing.
   - **Supporting Example**:
     - **Octanoic acid** (High yield)
   - **Contrasting Examples**:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Low yield; the hydroxyl group introduces polarity and may compete with the carboxylate for metal coordination)
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Low yield; the amino group can interfere with metal binding)
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Low yield; distant amino group reduces coordination efficiency)

2. **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halogens) attached directly to the ring** predict **high yield**.*

   - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing deprotonation and strengthening metal coordination.

     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (High yield)
   - **Contrasting Example**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Low yield; methyl group is electron-donating, decreasing acidity and coordination ability)

3. **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with amino groups at the para position and no additional interfering groups** predict **high yield**.*

   - **Explanation**: The amino group can serve as an additional coordination site with the metal center, forming stronger complexes and enhancing catalytic performance.
   - **Supporting Example**:
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (High yield)
   - **Contrasting Example**:
     - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Low yield; the thiol group is less effective in coordination and may form disulfide bonds)

4. **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains capable of additional coordination (e.g., carboxylate, indole groups)** predict **high yield**, whereas those with non-coordinating side chains predict **low yield**.*

   - **Explanation**: Side chains that can participate in metal coordination form more stable complexes, enhancing catalytic efficiency.
   - **Supporting Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)** (High yield; side-chain carboxylate provides an extra coordination site)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)** (High yield; indole ring offers π-electron interactions with the metal)

     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)** (Low yield; phenyl side chain lacks coordinating ability)
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Low yield; acetamido group blocks amino coordination)

5. **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are **ω-amino acids with the amino group located within five carbons of the carboxyl group** predict **high yield**, while those with the amino group more distant predict **low yield**.*

   - **Explanation**: Proximity of the amino group to the carboxylate allows effective chelation with the metal center, enhancing complex stability and catalytic activity.
   - **Supporting Example**:
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (High yield)
   - **Contrasting Examples**:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Low yield; amino group too distant for effective chelation)
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Low yield; reduced chelation due to increased chain length)

6. **Rule 6**: *Modifiers containing **multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group (polyhydroxy acids)** predict **high yield**, while those with isolated or distant hydroxyl groups predict **low yield**.*

   - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance the ligand's ability to chelate the metal center by forming additional coordination sites, increasing complex stability.
   - **Supporting Example**:
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)** (High yield)
   - **Contrasting Examples**:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Low yield; single hydroxyl group is too distant for effective chelation)
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Low yield; hydroxyl group on aromatic ring without spacer may hinder coordination)

7. **Rule 7**: *Modifiers containing **aldehyde groups attached directly to the aromatic ring** predict **low yield**, possibly due to interference with coordination or side reactions.*

   - **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups can participate in side reactions or form intramolecular interactions, reducing the availability of the carboxylate for metal coordination.
   - **Supporting Examples**:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Low yield)
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Low yield)

8. **Rule 8**: *Modifiers containing **fluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups** predict **low yield** due to excessive electron withdrawal.*

   - **Supporting Example**:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Low yield)

9. **Rule 9**: *Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms in the ring capable of coordinating with the metal center** predict **high yield**.*

   - **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings serve as additional coordination sites, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and catalytic efficiency.
   - **Supporting Examples**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)** (High yield)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (High yield)
   - **Contrasting Example**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Low yield; the pyridine ring attached via a phenyl spacer may reduce coordination effectiveness due to steric hindrance)

10. **Rule 10**: *Modifiers containing **ether linkages near the carboxyl group** predict **low yield** due to competition for coordination and increased flexibility.*

    - **Explanation**: Ether oxygen atoms may compete with the carboxylate for metal coordination, and increased molecular flexibility can reduce effective binding to the metal center.
    - **Supporting Examples**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Low yield)
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Low yield)

11. **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., hydroxyl, methoxy) directly attached to the ring without an aliphatic spacer** predict **low yield**.*

    - **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing its ability to coordinate with the metal center.
    - **Supporting Examples**:
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Low yield)
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Low yield)
    - **Contrasting Example**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (High yield; the aliphatic spacer separates the hydroxyl group, mitigating its electron-donating effect on the carboxyl group)

12. **Rule 12**: *Modifiers that are **keto acids with carbonyl groups positioned to chelate the metal center** predict **high yield**, whereas those unable to form stable chelates predict **low yield**.*

    - **Explanation**: Adjacent carbonyl groups can form stable chelate rings with the metal, enhancing complex stability and catalytic efficiency.

13. **Rule 13**: *Modifiers containing **acylated amino groups** predict **low yield** due to blocked coordination sites.*

    - **Explanation**: Acylation of amino groups reduces their availability for metal coordination, weakening chelation and decreasing catalytic activity.
    - **Supporting Examples**:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Low yield)
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Low yield)

14. **Rule 14**: *Modifiers containing **thiol groups on short aliphatic chains near the carboxyl group (within three carbons)** predict **high yield**, while those with thiol groups on aromatic rings predict **low yield**.*

    - **Explanation**: Aliphatic thiols are highly nucleophilic and can effectively coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalytic performance. Aromatic thiols are less effective due to resonance stabilization and reduced nucleophilicity.
    - **Supporting Example**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (High yield)
    - **Contrasting Example**:
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Low yield)

15. **Rule 15**: *Modifiers with **functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) located more than five carbons away from the carboxyl group in long aliphatic chains** predict **low yield** due to reduced coordination potential and increased flexibility.*

    - **Explanation**: Distant functional groups are less effective in assisting metal coordination, and increased chain flexibility can decrease binding efficiency and catalytic performance.
    - **Supporting Examples**:
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Low yield)
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Low yield)

12. **Rule 12**: *Modifiers with **acylated amino groups or other blocking groups on potential coordinating sites** predict **low yield** due to blocked coordination sites.*

    - **Explanation**: Acylation of amino groups reduces their availability for metal coordination, weakening chelation and decreasing catalytic activity.
    - **Supporting Examples**:
      - **Low Yield**:
        - **(2S)-6-Acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Low yield; acetamido group blocks amino coordination)
        - **2-[(4-Hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Low yield; acylated amino group reduces coordination)

13. **Rule 13**: *Modifiers containing **functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) located more than five carbons away from the carboxyl group in aliphatic chains** predict **low yield** due to reduced coordination potential and increased flexibility.*

    - **Explanation**: Distant functional groups are less effective in assisting metal coordination, and increased chain flexibility can decrease binding efficiency and catalytic performance.
    - **Supporting Examples**:
      - **Low Yield**:
        - **7-Hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Low yield; hydroxyl seven carbons away from carboxyl)
        - **8-Aminooctanoic acid** (Low yield; amino group eight carbons away)

14. **Rule 14**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino, thiol) within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict **high yield**.*

    - **Explanation**: Close proximity of polar groups allows effective chelation with the metal center, enhancing complex stability and catalytic activity.
    - **Supporting Examples**:
      - **High Yield**:
        - **3-Sulfanylpropanoic acid** (High yield; thiol three carbons away)
        - **5-Aminopentanoic acid** (High yield; amino group three carbons away)

15. **Rule 15**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids connected via an aliphatic spacer to an additional aromatic ring with electron-donating groups** predict **high yield** due to maintained acidity of the carboxyl group for coordination.*

    - **Explanation**: The aliphatic spacer reduces the electron-donating effect of substituents on the additional aromatic ring, preserving the carboxyl group's ability to coordinate with the metal center.
    - **Supporting Examples**:
      - **High Yield**:
        - **5-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (High yield; hydroxyl group on aromatic ring separated by pentyl chain)
      - **Low Yield**:
        - **3-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Low yield; shorter propyl spacer doesn't mitigate electron-donating effect)

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., nitro, halogens) at the para position** predict **high yield**; those with electron-donating substituents predict **low yield**.*

   - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing deprotonation and strengthening coordination with the metal center. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity, reducing coordination efficiency.
   - **Supporting Examples**:
     - **High Yield**:
       - **4-(Bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (High yield; bromomethyl is electron-withdrawing)
       - **4-Nitrobenzoic acid** (High yield; nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing)

2. **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with unbranched hydrocarbon chains of 6 to 8 carbons and no additional polar functional groups** predict **high yield**; those with polar substituents or branching predict **low yield**.*

   - **Explanation**: Long, unbranched hydrocarbon chains without interfering polar groups allow effective interaction with the catalyst's active site and prevent competition with the carboxylate for metal coordination.
   - **Supporting Examples**:
     - **High Yield**:
       - **Octanoic acid** (High yield; unbranched C8 chain with no polar groups)
     - **Low Yield**:

       - **7-Aminoheptanoic acid** (Low yield; amino group can interfere with metal binding)

3. **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are **ω-amino acids with the amino group within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict **high yield**; those with the amino group more distant predict **low yield**.*

   - **Explanation**: Proximity of the amino group to the carboxylate allows effective chelation with the metal center, enhancing complex stability and catalytic activity.
   - **Supporting Examples**:
     - **High Yield**:
       - **5-Aminopentanoic acid** (High yield; amino group is three carbons away from the carboxyl group)

       - **7-Aminoheptanoic acid** (Low yield; amino group is six carbons away)
       - **8-Aminooctanoic acid** (Low yield; amino group is seven carbons away)

4. **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains capable of additional coordination (e.g., carboxylate, indole rings)** predict **high yield**; those without coordinating side chains predict **low yield**.*

   - **Explanation**: Side chains that can participate in metal coordination form more stable complexes, enhancing catalytic performance.
   - **Supporting Examples**:
     - **High Yield**:
       - **(2S)-2-Aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)** (High yield; side-chain carboxylate provides an extra coordination site)
       - **(2R)-2-Amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)** (High yield; indole ring can coordinate via π-electron interactions)
     - **Low Yield**:
       - **(2S)-2-Amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)** (Low yield; phenyl side chain lacks coordinating ability)

5. **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups attached directly to the ring** predict **low yield**.*

   - **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups can undergo side reactions or form intramolecular interactions, reducing the availability of the carboxylate for metal coordination.
   - **Supporting Examples**:
     - **Low Yield**:
       - **4-Formylbenzoic acid** (Low yield; aldehyde group may interfere with coordination)
       - **5-Formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Low yield; potential for internal hydrogen bonding)

6. **Rule 6**: *Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms in the ring capable of coordinating with the metal center** predict **high yield**.*

   - **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings serve as additional coordination sites, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and catalytic efficiency.
   - **Supporting Examples**:
     - **High Yield**:
       - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)** (High yield; pyridine nitrogen coordinates with metal)
       - **1H-Pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (High yield; pyrazole ring contains two nitrogen atoms)

7. **Rule 7**: *Modifiers containing **multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group (polyhydroxy acids)** predict **high yield**; those with isolated or distant hydroxyl groups predict **low yield**.*

   - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance the ligand's ability to chelate the metal center by forming additional coordination sites, increasing complex stability.
   - **Supporting Examples**:
     - **High Yield**:
       - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-Pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)** (High yield; multiple hydroxyls adjacent to carboxyl group)
     - **Low Yield**:
       - **7-Hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Low yield; hydroxyl group too distant from carboxyl group)

8. **Rule 8**: *Modifiers containing **fluorinated alkyl chains or strong electron-withdrawing fluoroalkyl groups** predict **low yield** due to excessive electron withdrawal.*

   - **Explanation**: Strong electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms increase acidity excessively, potentially reducing electron density necessary for effective metal coordination.
   - **Supporting Example**:
     - **Low Yield**:
       - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Low yield; perfluorinated chain)

9. **Rule 9**: *Modifiers with **long hydrophilic chains containing ether linkages near the carboxyl group** predict **low yield** due to competition for coordination and increased flexibility.*

   - **Explanation**: Ether oxygen atoms may compete with the carboxylate for metal coordination, and increased molecular flexibility can reduce effective binding to the metal center.
   - **Supporting Examples**:
     - **Low Yield**:
       - **2-[2-(2-Methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Low yield; polyether chain introduces flexibility and competing coordination sites)
       - **3-[2-(2-Aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Low yield; ether linkages and distant amino group)

10. **Rule 10**: *Modifiers that are **keto acids with carbonyl groups positioned to chelate the metal center** predict **high yield**; those unable to form stable chelates predict **low yield**.*

    - **Explanation**: Adjacent carbonyl groups can form stable chelate rings with the metal, enhancing complex stability and catalytic efficiency.
    - **Supporting Examples**:
      - **High Yield**:
        - **1,3-Dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (High yield; carbonyl groups positioned for chelation)
      - **Low Yield**:
        - **4-Oxoheptanedioic acid** (Low yield; carbonyl groups too distant for effective chelation)

11. **Rule 11**: *Modifiers containing **thiol groups on short aliphatic chains near the carboxyl group** predict **high yield**; those with thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings predict **low yield**.*

    - **Explanation**: Aliphatic thiols are highly nucleophilic and can effectively coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalytic performance. Aromatic thiols are less nucleophilic due to resonance stabilization.
    - **Supporting Examples**:
      - **High Yield**:
        - **3-Sulfanylpropanoic acid** (High yield; thiol group three carbons away from carboxyl)
      - **Low Yield**:
        - **4-Sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Low yield; thiol attached directly to aromatic ring)

12. **Rule 12**: *Modifiers with **acylated amino groups or other blocking groups on potential coordinating sites** predict **low yield** due to blocked coordination sites.*

    - **Explanation**: Acylation of amino groups reduces their availability for metal coordination, weakening chelation and decreasing catalytic activity.
    - **Supporting Examples**:
      - **Low Yield**:
        - **(2S)-6-Acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Low yield; acetamido group blocks amino coordination)
        - **2-[(4-Hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Low yield; acylated amino group reduces coordination)

13. **Rule 13**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids connected via an aliphatic spacer of four or more carbons to an additional aromatic ring** predict **high yield**; those with shorter spacers predict **low yield**.*

    - **Explanation**: The longer aliphatic spacer reduces the electron-donating effect of substituents on the additional aromatic ring, preserving the carboxyl group's ability to coordinate with the metal center.
    - **Supporting Examples**:
      - **High Yield**:
        - **5-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (High yield; pentyl spacer reduces interfering effects)
      - **Low Yield**:
        - **3-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Low yield; propyl spacer insufficient to mitigate electron-donation)

14. **Rule 14**: *Modifiers containing **functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) located more than five carbons away from the carboxyl group in aliphatic chains** predict **low yield** due to reduced coordination potential and increased flexibility.*

    - **Explanation**: Distant functional groups are less effective in assisting metal coordination, and increased chain flexibility can decrease binding efficiency and catalytic performance.
    - **Supporting Examples**:
      - **Low Yield**:
        - **7-Hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Low yield; hydroxyl seven carbons away from carboxyl)
        - **8-Aminooctanoic acid** (Low yield; amino group eight carbons away)

15. **Rule 15**: *Modifiers that are **polypeptides or amino acids with bulky or acylated side chains** predict **low yield** due to steric hindrance and blocked coordination sites affecting metal binding.*

    - **Explanation**: Bulky groups and acylation can interfere with metal coordination, reducing catalytic efficiency.
    - **Supporting Examples**:
      - **Low Yield**:
        - **2-[[(2S)-2-Amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (Low yield; bulky side chain and acylated amino group)
        - **(2S)-6-Acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Low yield; acylated amino group)
