**Start of Rules**

---

**Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are short-chain aliphatic amino acids (with five or fewer carbon atoms in the backbone) containing a primary amino group and one or more carboxylic acid groups, without additional bulky substituents, lead to high yield.**

- **Explanation**: These amino acids can effectively coordinate with metal centers through their amino and carboxylate groups, enhancing the catalytic activity. Short chains minimize steric hindrance, allowing for optimal interaction with the catalyst.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid)
    - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid)
    - *5-aminopentanoic acid*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid* (Longer chain reduces coordination efficiency)
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*

---

**Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted at the para position with strongly coordinating groups such as amino (-NH₂), nitro (-NO₂), or hydroxyl (-OH) lead to high yield; those substituted with non-coordinating groups like methyl (-CH₃) or electron-withdrawing groups like formyl (-CHO) lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups capable of metal coordination enhance interaction with the catalyst. Non-coordinating or electron-withdrawing substituents do not facilitate such interactions and can hinder coordination.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid*
    - *4-nitrobenzoic acid*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (Methyl group is non-coordinating)
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid* (Aldehyde group may interfere with coordination)

---

**Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms within the ring, such as pyridine or pyrazole derivatives, lead to high yield.**

- **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles provide lone pairs for coordination with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance. The aromatic nature of these rings facilitates strong binding through delocalized electrons.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
    - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Steric hindrance from fused rings reduces coordination)

---

**Rule 4**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains (polyhydroxylated carboxylic acids) lead to high yield.**

- **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and provide additional coordination sites through hydrogen bonding or direct metal coordination, strengthening interaction with the catalyst.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
    - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]amino]acetic acid*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Single hydroxyl group may be insufficient for strong coordination)

---

**Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl groups or strong electron-withdrawing groups near coordinating sites lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Strong electron-withdrawing groups reduce electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening their ability to interact with metal centers. Perfluoroalkyl groups also introduce hydrophobicity and steric hindrance.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*
    - *4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid*

---

**Rule 6**: **Modifiers with ether linkages in aliphatic chains (resembling polyethylene glycol structures) lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Ether linkages increase molecular flexibility and may interfere with optimal binding orientations. They can also introduce steric hindrance and reduce the effective coordination of the modifier with the catalyst.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

---

**Rule 7**: **Modifiers with thiol groups attached to aliphatic chains lead to high yield; those with thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Aliphatic thiol groups can effectively coordinate with metal centers due to their accessibility and strong metal-sulfur interactions. Aromatic thiols may be less available for coordination due to resonance stabilization or steric hindrance.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid*

---

**Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing electron-rich heterocycles (e.g., indole ring) lead to high yield; those with simple phenyl side chains lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Electron-rich heterocycles like indole can coordinate with metal centers through π-electron interactions, enhancing catalyst interaction. Simple phenyl groups lack these coordinating abilities.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (Tryptophan)
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine)

---

**Rule 9**: **Modifiers with aromatic ketone groups conjugated to carboxylic acid functionalities lead to high yield.**

- **Explanation**: Conjugated ketone groups within an aromatic system can coordinate with metal centers through carbonyl oxygen atoms. Resonance stabilization enhances this interaction, improving catalytic efficiency.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*
    - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid* (Lacks aromatic system for resonance)

---

**Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups directly attached to aromatic rings lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups may undergo side reactions or form unstable complexes with metal centers, decreasing the effectiveness of the catalyst.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*

---

**Rule 11**: **Modifiers with long aliphatic chains (six carbons or more) containing only terminal carboxylic acid groups and no additional polar substituents lead to high yield; those with additional polar groups lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Unsubstituted long-chain carboxylic acids can interact favorably with the catalyst surface through hydrophobic interactions and effective coordination via the carboxylate group. Additional polar groups may introduce steric hindrance or disrupt favorable interactions.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *Octanoic acid*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Hydroxyl group may interfere with coordination)
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid* (Amino group may cause steric hindrance)

---

**Rule 12**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups (amides or peptides) near coordinating sites lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Acylation reduces the availability of nitrogen's lone pair for coordination with metal centers, diminishing catalyst interaction.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid*
    - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid*

---

**Rule 13**: **Modifiers with aromatic carboxylic acids connected to aliphatic chains of four carbons or more lead to high yield; those with shorter chains lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility, reducing steric hindrance and allowing optimal orientation for coordination with metal centers. Short chains may restrict movement and hinder effective interaction.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (Shorter chain limits flexibility)

---

**Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing bulky substituents or steric hindrance near potential coordination sites lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Bulky groups close to coordination sites can obstruct the approach and binding of modifiers to metal centers, reducing catalytic effectiveness.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid* (Bulky aromatic group near coordination site)
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Steric hindrance from fused aromatic rings)

---

**Rule 15**: **Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic systems containing oxygen heterocycles conjugated with carboxylic acid groups lead to high yield.**

- **Explanation**: Oxygen atoms in heterocycles can coordinate with metal centers, and conjugation with carboxylate enhances electron density at the coordination site, improving catalyst interaction.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been carefully developed by analyzing the dataset and considering the chemical structures and functional groups of the modifiers. They are grounded in underlying physicochemical principles that influence the coordination and interaction of the modifiers with the metal catalyst. Each rule combines multiple substructural features, such as specific functional groups and molecular frameworks, to predict whether a modifier will lead to a high or low yield based on its molecular characteristics.

We have prioritized rules that cover a broad range of the dataset while balancing simplicity and complexity to maximize predictive utility. The rules aim to provide clear guidance for any given SMILES structure fitting their descriptions, ensuring they are practical for future predictions and catalyst design. By focusing on combinations of functional groups and their positions within the molecular structure, these rules can assist in designing new modifiers that enhance the yield of the remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------
