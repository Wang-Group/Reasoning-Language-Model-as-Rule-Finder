"Rule 1: Modifiers that are short-chain aliphatic amino acids (with five or fewer carbon atoms in the backbone) containing a primary amino group and one or more carboxylic acid groups, without additional bulky substituents, lead to high yield.","Rule 2: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted at the para position with strongly coordinating groups such as amino (-NH₂), nitro (-NO₂), or hydroxyl (-OH) lead to high yield; those substituted with non-coordinating groups like methyl (-CH₃) or electron-withdrawing groups like formyl (-CHO) lead to low yield.","Rule 3: Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms within the ring, such as pyridine or pyrazole derivatives, lead to high yield.",Rule 4: Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains (polyhydroxylated carboxylic acids) lead to high yield.,Rule 5: Modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl groups or strong electron-withdrawing groups near coordinating sites lead to low yield.,Rule 6: Modifiers with ether linkages in aliphatic chains (resembling polyethylene glycol structures) lead to low yield.,Rule 7: Modifiers with thiol groups attached to aliphatic chains lead to high yield; those with thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings lead to low yield.,"Rule 8: Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing electron-rich heterocycles (e.g., indole ring) lead to high yield; those with simple phenyl side chains lead to low yield.",Rule 9: Modifiers with aromatic ketone groups conjugated to carboxylic acid functionalities lead to high yield.,Rule 10: Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups directly attached to aromatic rings lead to low yield.,Rule 11: Modifiers with long aliphatic chains (six carbons or more) containing only terminal carboxylic acid groups and no additional polar substituents lead to high yield; those with additional polar groups lead to low yield.,Rule 12: Modifiers with acylated amino groups (amides or peptides) near coordinating sites lead to low yield.,Rule 13: Modifiers with aromatic carboxylic acids connected to aliphatic chains of four carbons or more lead to high yield; those with shorter chains lead to low yield.,Rule 14: Modifiers containing bulky substituents or steric hindrance near potential coordination sites lead to low yield.,Rule 15: Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic systems containing oxygen heterocycles conjugated with carboxylic acid groups lead to high yield.
