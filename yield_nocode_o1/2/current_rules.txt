**Start of Rules**

---

**Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing both an amino group (-NH₂) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) on adjacent carbons (α-amino acids), with short aliphatic side chains (1 to 4 carbons), tend to lead to high yield.**

- **Explanation**: The proximity of amino and carboxyl groups allows for effective chelation with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity. Short side chains reduce steric hindrance, facilitating better interaction with the catalyst.

- **Supporting High Yield Examples**:
  - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid)
  - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid)
  - *5-aminopentanoic acid*

- **Supporting Low Yield Examples**:
  - *7-aminoheptanoic acid* (Longer chain increases steric hindrance)
  - *8-aminooctanoic acid*

---

**Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with functional groups capable of coordinating with metal centers (such as amino (-NH₂), hydroxyl (-OH), or nitro (-NO₂) groups) tend to lead to high yield.**

- **Explanation**: Coordinating groups on the aromatic ring enhance interaction with the metal catalyst. These groups can donate electron density or form coordination bonds, improving catalyst performance.

- **Supporting High Yield Examples**:
  - *4-aminobenzoic acid*
  - *4-nitrobenzoic acid*
  - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*

- **Supporting Low Yield Examples**:
  - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (Lacks effective coordinating group)
  - *4-formylbenzoic acid* (Formyl group may not coordinate effectively)

---

**Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids without bulky substituents tend to lead to high yield.**

- **Explanation**: Nitrogen heterocycles, such as pyridine and pyrazole carboxylic acids, can coordinate with metal centers via lone pairs on nitrogen, enhancing catalytic activity. Lack of bulky groups prevents steric hindrance.

- **Supporting High Yield Examples**:
  - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
  - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
  - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*

- **Supporting Low Yield Examples**:
  - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Bulky due to bipyridine structure)
  - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid* (Steric hindrance from substituents)

---

**Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) on an aliphatic chain in combination with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) tend to lead to high yield.**

- **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites, enhancing interaction with the metal catalyst. This increases the overall coordination number and stabilizes the catalyst complex.

- **Supporting High Yield Examples**:
  - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
  - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]amino]acetic acid*

- **Supporting Low Yield Examples**:
  - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Only one hydroxyl group, longer chain reduces effectiveness)

---

**Rule 5**: **Modifiers with thiol groups (-SH) attached to short aliphatic chains (2 to 3 carbons) in combination with a carboxylic acid group tend to lead to high yield. Thiol groups attached to aromatic rings tend to lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Aliphatic thiol groups can form strong metal-sulfur bonds, enhancing coordination. Short chains minimize steric hindrance. Thiol groups on aromatic rings may experience resonance stabilization, reducing availability for coordination.

- **Supporting High Yield Examples**:
  - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*

- **Supporting Low Yield Examples**:
  - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* (Thiol attached to aromatic ring)

---

**Rule 6**: **Modifiers that can chelate the metal center through two or more adjacent donor atoms (e.g., hydroxyl and carboxyl groups in ortho positions on an aromatic ring) tend to lead to high yield.**

- **Explanation**: Chelation increases the stability of the metal complex by forming ring structures with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Supporting High Yield Examples**:
  - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*
  - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*

- **Supporting Low Yield Examples**:
  - *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid* (Possible steric hindrance reduces chelation)

---

**Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing additional coordinating groups (such as indole rings) tend to lead to high yield. Those with non-coordinating side chains tend to lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Coordinating side chains provide extra sites for interaction with the metal catalyst, enhancing activity. Non-coordinating side chains do not offer this benefit.

- **Supporting High Yield Examples**:
  - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (Tryptophan)

- **Supporting Low Yield Examples**:
  - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine; benzene ring does not coordinate effectively)

---

**Rule 8**: **Modifiers with flexible aliphatic chains connecting an aromatic ring with coordinating groups (such as hydroxyl or amino groups) to a carboxylic acid tend to lead to high yield, especially when the chain length allows for effective spatial orientation (3 to 5 carbons).**

- **Explanation**: Flexible chains enable the coordinating group on the aromatic ring to interact optimally with the metal center, while the carboxylic acid anchors the modifier to the catalyst framework.

- **Supporting High Yield Examples**:
  - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*

- **Supporting Low Yield Examples**:
  - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (Shorter chain may limit flexibility)

---

**Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing electron-withdrawing groups (such as fluorinated alkyl chains) near the coordinating sites tend to lead to low yield due to reduced electron density and weaker coordination ability.**

- **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups pull electron density away from coordinating atoms, decreasing their ability to donate electrons to the metal center.

- **Supporting Low Yield Examples**:
  - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*
  - *4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid*

---

**Rule 10**: **Modifiers with ether linkages (-O-) in aliphatic chains, especially multiple ether groups without additional coordinating functionalities, tend to lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Ether oxygen atoms are poorer ligands for metal coordination compared to amine or thiol groups. Flexible ether chains may not position coordinating groups effectively.

- **Supporting Low Yield Examples**:
  - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
  - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

---

**Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (chains longer than 6 carbons) without additional coordinating groups tend to have variable effects on yield, suggesting that chain length alone is not a definitive predictor.**

- **Explanation**: While long chains may introduce steric hindrance, some long-chain carboxylic acids like octanoic acid lead to high yield, indicating other factors such as overall hydrophobicity or packing may influence activity.

- **Supporting High Yield Examples**:
  - *Octanoic acid*

- **Supporting Low Yield Examples**:
  - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Presence of a single hydroxyl group may not be sufficient)

---

**Rule 12**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups (amides) near coordinating sites tend to lead to low yield due to reduced availability of lone pairs for metal coordination.**

- **Explanation**: Amide formation delocalizes the nitrogen's lone pair into the carbonyl group, decreasing its ability to coordinate with the metal center.

- **Supporting Low Yield Examples**:
  - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid*
  - *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*

---

**Rule 13**: **Modifiers that can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds may have reduced availability of coordinating groups, leading to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Intramolecular hydrogen bonding locks coordinating groups into a conformation that is less accessible for interaction with the metal catalyst.

- **Supporting Low Yield Examples**:
  - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid* (Ortho-hydroxy and formyl groups may form hydrogen bonds)

---

**Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing conjugated systems adjacent to coordinating groups tend to lead to high yield due to enhanced electron delocalization and coordination ability.**

- **Explanation**: Conjugation increases electron density and stabilizes the coordination bond between the modifier and the metal center.

- **Supporting High Yield Examples**:
  - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*

- **Supporting Low Yield Examples**:
  - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid* (Non-conjugated carbonyl groups)

---

**Rule 15**: **Modifiers with bulky substituents near coordinating sites that cause steric hindrance tend to lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Bulky groups can prevent effective interaction with the metal catalyst by blocking access to coordinating atoms.

- **Supporting Low Yield Examples**:
  - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Bulky bipyridine structure)
  - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid* (Bulky methoxy groups)

**End of Rules**

---

These rules highlight the relationships between specific combinations of substructures in the molecular modifiers and the resulting high or low yield of the reaction. By focusing on combinations of functional groups and their positions within the molecule, the rules provide a predictive framework for evaluating new modifiers.

**Summary of Key Factors Influencing Yield**:

- **Coordination Sites**: Modifiers with functional groups capable of coordinating with metal centers (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, thiol, heterocyclic nitrogen) enhance yield.

- **Chelation Ability**: Molecules that can chelate the metal through multiple adjacent donor atoms increase catalytic activity.

- **Steric Effects**: Bulky substituents near coordinating sites hinder metal interaction, reducing yield.

- **Chain Length and Flexibility**: Optimal chain lengths (typically 2 to 5 carbons) provide flexibility for effective coordination without introducing excessive steric hindrance.

- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-donating or withdrawing groups can influence the electron density on coordinating atoms, affecting coordination strength.

- **Conjugation**: Conjugated systems adjacent to coordinating groups enhance electron delocalization, improving coordination.

- **Functional Group Combination**: Combining multiple coordinating functionalities within a modifier increases coordination opportunities and catalyst interaction.

By applying these rules, researchers can predict the effectiveness of potential modifiers and design new ones to optimize the yield of the δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------
