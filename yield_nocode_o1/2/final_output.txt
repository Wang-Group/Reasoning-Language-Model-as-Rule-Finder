    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are short-chain aliphatic amino acids (five carbons or fewer) with both amino and carboxylic acid groups lead to high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: These amino acids effectively chelate metal centers through their amino and carboxylate groups, forming strong coordination bonds that enhance catalyst performance.

  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **High Yield**: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid), 5-aminopentanoic acid.

  - *Counterexamples*:
    - **Low Yield**: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid (longer chains reduce coordination efficiency).

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, amino) at the para position lead to high yield, while those with electron-donating groups lead to low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxylate group, enhancing interaction with the metal catalyst. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and coordination efficiency.

  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **High Yield**: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-aminobenzoic acid.

  - *Counterexamples*:
    - **Low Yield**: 4-methylbenzoic acid (methyl group is electron-donating).

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) groups lead to low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Aldehyde groups can undergo side reactions or interfere with metal coordination by forming unstable complexes, reducing catalyst effectiveness.

  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with long aliphatic chains (more than five carbons) without additional functional groups lead to high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Long-chain aliphatic acids with terminal carboxyl groups can effectively interact with the catalyst, possibly due to favorable hydrophobic interactions and minimal steric hindrance at the coordination site.

  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **High Yield**: Octanoic acid.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (more than five carbons) with additional polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) lead to low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Additional polar groups increase hydrophilicity and can introduce steric hindrance or compete for metal coordination, disrupting catalyst interactions.

  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing ether linkages or polyethylene glycol-like structures result in low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Ether linkages introduce flexibility and steric bulk, reducing the ability of coordinating groups to effectively interact with the metal center.

  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl chains lead to low yield due to their strong electron-withdrawing nature and poor coordination ability.**

  - *Explanation*: Perfluoroalkyl groups reduce electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening interactions with the metal catalyst and potentially causing repulsion.

  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid.

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with thiol groups in aliphatic chains lead to high yield, while those with thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings lead to low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Aliphatic thiol groups can form strong coordination bonds with metals due to their accessibility. Thiol groups on aromatic rings may have reduced availability for coordination due to electron delocalization and steric hindrance.

  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **High Yield**: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.
    - **Low Yield**: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids with multiple heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen) in the ring lead to high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Heteroatoms in the ring provide additional coordination sites and can form stable chelates with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity.

  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **High Yield**: 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid.

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are aromatic amino acids with electron-rich heterocycles lead to high yield, whereas those with simple phenyl groups lead to low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Electron-rich heterocycles (e.g., indole) can coordinate with metals more effectively than simple aromatic rings due to additional lone pairs and conjugation.

  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **High Yield**: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan).

  - *Counterexamples*:
    - **Low Yield**: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine).

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic amino acids with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer, containing both amino and carboxylic acid groups, lead to high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: The presence of both amino and carboxyl groups allows for effective chelation of metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance through strong coordination bonds.

  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **High Yield**: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid), 5-aminopentanoic acid.

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that contain perfluoroalkyl chains lead to low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Perfluoroalkyl groups are highly electron-withdrawing and hydrophobic, reducing coordination ability and potentially causing unfavorable interactions with the catalyst.

  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid.

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with ether linkages, especially those resembling polyethylene glycol structures, result in low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Ether linkages introduce flexibility and steric hindrance, interfering with the coordination of active groups to metal centers and reducing catalyst effectiveness.

  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid.

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with aldehyde (formyl) groups directly attached to aromatic rings lead to low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Aliphatic thiol groups are more accessible for metal coordination, forming strong bonds with metal centers and enhancing catalyst activity.

  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **High Yield**: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.
    - **Low Yield**: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid (aromatic thiol less available for coordination).

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (more than five carbons) without additional polar functional groups lead to high yield, while those with additional polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) result in low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Additional polar groups may introduce steric hindrance or compete for metal coordination, disrupting catalyst interactions.

  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **High Yield**: Octanoic acid.
    - **Low Yield**: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid.

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups (amides or peptides) lead to low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Acylation reduces the availability of nitrogen's lone pair for coordination with the metal center, diminishing interaction and catalyst performance.

  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**: (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid.

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with conjugated ketone and carboxylic acid groups within an aromatic system lead to high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Conjugation stabilizes coordination complexes through electron delocalization, enhancing interaction with the metal catalyst.

  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **High Yield**: 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid, 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing an aromatic ring connected to the carboxylic acid via an aliphatic chain longer than three carbons lead to high yield; shorter chains result in low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Longer chains reduce steric hindrance and allow better orientation for the carboxylate group to coordinate with the metal center.

  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **High Yield**: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.
    - **Low Yield**: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (chain is too short for effective coordination).

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing two aromatic rings directly connected (biaryl compounds) lead to low yield, whereas those with an aliphatic linker between the aromatic ring and carboxylic acid lead to high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Directly connected aromatic rings may impede coordination due to steric hindrance or rigidity, reducing catalyst efficiency.

  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.
    - **High Yield**: 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid (aliphatic linker enhances flexibility and coordination).

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with electron-donating groups (e.g., methoxy, methyl) at positions other than para lead to low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxylate group, especially when not optimally positioned for interaction with the metal center.

  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**: 4-methylbenzoic acid (methyl group at para position), 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid (hydroxy group involved in amide linkage reduces coordination).

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are short-chain aliphatic amino acids (five carbons or fewer), containing both amino and carboxylic acid groups without additional bulky groups, lead to high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: The presence of both amino and carboxyl groups allows for effective chelation of metal centers in the catalyst, enhancing interaction and improving catalytic activity. Short chains minimize steric hindrance, facilitating coordination.

  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **High Yield**:
      - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)
      - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)
      - 5-aminopentanoic acid

  - *Counterexamples*:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
      - 8-aminooctanoic acid
      - *(Longer chains reduce coordination efficiency due to increased flexibility and steric hindrance.)*

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted at the para position with functional groups capable of coordinating with metal centers (e.g., amino, nitro groups) lead to high yield; those substituted with non-coordinating groups (e.g., methyl) lead to low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Functional groups like amino and nitro at the para position enhance metal coordination through additional lone pairs or resonance effects, strengthening interactions with the catalyst. Non-coordinating substituents do not offer this benefit and may hinder interaction.

  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **High Yield**:
      - 4-aminobenzoic acid
      - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 4-methylbenzoic acid *(Methyl group is non-coordinating and electron-donating, which does not enhance metal binding.)*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms within the ring lead to high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles provide lone pairs that can coordinate with metal centers, forming stable complexes and enhancing catalytic performance.

  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **High Yield**:
      - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)
      - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
      - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid *(Steric hindrance due to directly connected aromatic rings reduces coordination efficiency.)*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains (polyhydroxylated acids) lead to high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance solubility and provide additional coordination sites through hydrogen bonding or direct metal coordination, strengthening the interaction with the catalyst.

  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **High Yield**:
      - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)
      - 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]amino]acetic acid

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl chains lead to low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Perfluoroalkyl groups are highly electronegative and hydrophobic, reducing the ability of the modifier to interact effectively with the catalyst. The strong electron-withdrawing effect may destabilize coordination.

  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with ether linkages resembling polyethylene glycol structures result in low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Ether linkages increase molecular flexibility and introduce steric hindrance, which can interfere with the coordination between the modifier and the metal center in the catalyst.

  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
      - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with aldehyde (formyl) groups directly attached to aromatic rings lead to low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Aldehyde groups may undergo side reactions or form unstable complexes with metal centers, decreasing the effectiveness of the catalyst.

  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 4-formylbenzoic acid
      - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are aromatic amino acids containing electron-rich heterocycles (e.g., indole ring) lead to high yield, while those with simple phenyl groups lead to low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Electron-rich heterocycles such as indole can coordinate with metal centers through delocalized π-electrons, enhancing interaction with the catalyst. Simple phenyl groups lack this capability.

  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **High Yield**:
      - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)
    - **Low Yield**:
      - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with thiol groups on aliphatic chains lead to high yield; thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings result in low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Aliphatic thiol groups can effectively coordinate with metal centers due to accessibility and strong metal–sulfur interactions. When attached directly to aromatic rings, thiol groups may be less available for coordination due to resonance delocalization or steric factors.

  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **High Yield**:
      - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (six carbons or more) without additional polar functional groups lead to high yield; those with extra polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) result in low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Unsubstituted long-chain carboxylic acids interact favorably with the catalyst surface due to hydrophobic interactions and can coordinate via the carboxylate group. Additional polar groups may introduce steric hindrance or compete for coordination, disrupting effective interaction.

  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **High Yield**:
      - Octanoic acid
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
      - 7-aminoheptanoic acid

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with acylated or amidated amino groups (amides or peptides) lead to low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Acylation or amidation reduces the availability of the nitrogen's lone pair for coordination with the metal center, diminishing interaction with the catalyst.

  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
      - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing aromatic ketone groups conjugated with carboxylic acid functionalities lead to high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Conjugated ketone groups within an aromatic system can coordinate with metal centers through the oxygen atom's lone pairs, enhancing interaction due to resonance stabilization.

  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **High Yield**:
      - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid
      - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with an aromatic ring connected to the carboxylic acid via an aliphatic chain longer than three carbons lead to high yield; shorter chains result in low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility, allowing optimal orientation for the carboxylate group to coordinate with the metal center while the aromatic ring can enhance π–π interactions with the catalyst.

  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **High Yield**:
      - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
      - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with directly connected biaryl structures (two aromatic rings connected without an aliphatic linker) lead to low yield, whereas those with an aliphatic linker between the aromatic ring and carboxylic acid lead to high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Directly connected aromatic rings increase steric hindrance and rigidity, impeding effective coordination with the metal center. An aliphatic linker increases flexibility and reduces steric constraints.

  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
    - **High Yield**:
      - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with bulky substituents or steric hindrance near potential coordination sites lead to low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Bulky groups close to coordination sites can obstruct the approach and binding of the modifier to the metal center, reducing catalytic effectiveness.

  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid *(Amide linkage and bulky aromatic group near coordination site)*
      - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid *(Ketone group may introduce steric hindrance near the carboxylate)*

      - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with aromatic rings directly connected to carboxylic acids via short aliphatic chains (three carbons or fewer) lead to low yield; those with longer chains (four carbons or more) lead to high yield.**

      - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with bulky substituents or steric hindrance near potential coordination sites lead to low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Bulky groups close to coordination sites can obstruct the approach and binding of the modifier to the metal center, reducing catalytic effectiveness.

  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid *(Amide linkage and bulky aromatic group near coordination site)*
      - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid *(Ketone group may introduce steric hindrance near the carboxylate)*

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing trifluoroacetyl or other strong electron-withdrawing groups near coordinating sites lead to low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Strong electron-withdrawing groups can destabilize coordination with metal centers by reducing electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening interaction with the catalyst.

  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

These rules have been carefully developed by analyzing the dataset and considering the chemical structures and functional groups of the modifiers. They are grounded in underlying physicochemical principles that influence the coordination and interaction of the modifiers with the metal catalyst. Each rule combines multiple substructural features, such as specific functional groups and molecular frameworks, to predict whether a modifier will lead to a high or low yield based on its molecular characteristics.

We have prioritized rules that cover a broad range of the dataset while balancing simplicity and complexity to maximize predictive utility. The rules aim to provide clear guidance for any given SMILES structure fitting their descriptions, ensuring they are practical for future predictions and catalyst design. By focusing on combinations of functional groups and their positions within the molecular structure, these rules can help in designing new modifiers that enhance the yield of the remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------

    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

**Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are short-chain aliphatic amino acids (with five or fewer carbon atoms in the backbone) containing a primary amino group and one or more carboxylic acid groups, without additional bulky substituents, lead to high yield.**

- **Explanation**: These amino acids can effectively coordinate with metal centers through their amino and carboxylate groups, enhancing the catalytic activity. Short chains minimize steric hindrance, allowing for optimal interaction with the catalyst.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid)
    - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid)
    - *5-aminopentanoic acid*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid* (Longer chain reduces coordination efficiency)
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*

---

**Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted at the para position with strongly coordinating groups such as amino (-NH₂), nitro (-NO₂), or hydroxyl (-OH) lead to high yield; those substituted with non-coordinating groups like methyl (-CH₃) or electron-withdrawing groups like formyl (-CHO) lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups capable of metal coordination enhance interaction with the catalyst. Non-coordinating or electron-withdrawing substituents do not facilitate such interactions and can hinder coordination.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid*
    - *4-nitrobenzoic acid*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (Methyl group is non-coordinating)
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid* (Aldehyde group may interfere with coordination)

---

**Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms within the ring, such as pyridine or pyrazole derivatives, lead to high yield.**

- **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles provide lone pairs for coordination with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance. The aromatic nature of these rings facilitates strong binding through delocalized electrons.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
    - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Steric hindrance from fused rings reduces coordination)

---

**Rule 4**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains (polyhydroxylated carboxylic acids) lead to high yield.**

- **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and provide additional coordination sites through hydrogen bonding or direct metal coordination, strengthening interaction with the catalyst.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
    - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]amino]acetic acid*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Single hydroxyl group may be insufficient for strong coordination)

---

**Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl groups or strong electron-withdrawing groups near coordinating sites lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Strong electron-withdrawing groups reduce electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening their ability to interact with metal centers. Perfluoroalkyl groups also introduce hydrophobicity and steric hindrance.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*
    - *4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid*

---

**Rule 6**: **Modifiers with ether linkages in aliphatic chains (resembling polyethylene glycol structures) lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Ether linkages increase molecular flexibility and may interfere with optimal binding orientations. They can also introduce steric hindrance and reduce the effective coordination of the modifier with the catalyst.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

---

**Rule 7**: **Modifiers with thiol groups attached to aliphatic chains lead to high yield; those with thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Aliphatic thiol groups can effectively coordinate with metal centers due to their accessibility and strong metal-sulfur interactions. Aromatic thiols may be less available for coordination due to resonance stabilization or steric hindrance.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid*

---

**Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing electron-rich heterocycles (e.g., indole ring) lead to high yield; those with simple phenyl side chains lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Electron-rich heterocycles like indole can coordinate with metal centers through π-electron interactions, enhancing catalyst interaction. Simple phenyl groups lack these coordinating abilities.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (Tryptophan)
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine)

---

**Rule 9**: **Modifiers with aromatic ketone groups conjugated to carboxylic acid functionalities lead to high yield.**

- **Explanation**: Conjugated ketone groups within an aromatic system can coordinate with metal centers through carbonyl oxygen atoms. Resonance stabilization enhances this interaction, improving catalytic efficiency.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*
    - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid* (Lacks aromatic system for resonance)

---

**Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups directly attached to aromatic rings lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups may undergo side reactions or form unstable complexes with metal centers, decreasing the effectiveness of the catalyst.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*

---

**Rule 11**: **Modifiers with long aliphatic chains (six carbons or more) containing only terminal carboxylic acid groups and no additional polar substituents lead to high yield; those with additional polar groups lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Unsubstituted long-chain carboxylic acids can interact favorably with the catalyst surface through hydrophobic interactions and effective coordination via the carboxylate group. Additional polar groups may introduce steric hindrance or disrupt favorable interactions.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *Octanoic acid*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Hydroxyl group may interfere with coordination)
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid* (Amino group may cause steric hindrance)

---

**Rule 12**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups (amides or peptides) near coordinating sites lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Acylation reduces the availability of nitrogen's lone pair for coordination with metal centers, diminishing catalyst interaction.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid*
    - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid*

---

**Rule 13**: **Modifiers with aromatic carboxylic acids connected to aliphatic chains of four carbons or more lead to high yield; those with shorter chains lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility, reducing steric hindrance and allowing optimal orientation for coordination with metal centers. Short chains may restrict movement and hinder effective interaction.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (Shorter chain limits flexibility)

---

**Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing bulky substituents or steric hindrance near potential coordination sites lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Bulky groups close to coordination sites can obstruct the approach and binding of modifiers to metal centers, reducing catalytic effectiveness.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid* (Bulky aromatic group near coordination site)
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Steric hindrance from fused aromatic rings)

---

**Rule 15**: **Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic systems containing oxygen heterocycles conjugated with carboxylic acid groups lead to high yield.**

- **Explanation**: Oxygen atoms in heterocycles can coordinate with metal centers, and conjugation with carboxylate enhances electron density at the coordination site, improving catalyst interaction.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*

---

**End of Rules**

These rules have been carefully developed by analyzing the dataset and considering the chemical structures and functional groups of the modifiers. They are grounded in underlying physicochemical principles that influence the coordination and interaction of the modifiers with the metal catalyst. Each rule combines multiple substructural features, such as specific functional groups and molecular frameworks, to predict whether a modifier will lead to a high or low yield based on its molecular characteristics.

We have prioritized rules that cover a broad range of the dataset while balancing simplicity and complexity to maximize predictive utility. The rules aim to provide clear guidance for any given SMILES structure fitting their descriptions, ensuring they are practical for future predictions and catalyst design. By focusing on combinations of functional groups and their positions within the molecular structure, these rules can assist in designing new modifiers that enhance the yield of the remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

**Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are short-chain aliphatic amino acids (with five or fewer carbons in the backbone), containing both amino and carboxylic acid groups, without bulky side chains, tend to lead to high yield.**

- **Explanation**: The amino and carboxylate groups can simultaneously coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity. The small size minimizes steric hindrance, allowing for optimal interaction with the catalyst's active sites.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid)
    - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid)
    - *5-aminopentanoic acid*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid* (Longer chain reduces effective coordination)
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (Acetamido group decreases coordination ability)

---

**Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups at the para position capable of coordinating with metals (e.g., amino (-NH₂), nitro (-NO₂), hydroxyl (-OH)) lead to high yield; those with non-coordinating groups (e.g., methyl (-CH₃)) or interfering groups (e.g., formyl (-CHO)) at the same position lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Electron-donating or withdrawing groups that can coordinate enhance interaction with the metal center, improving catalyst performance. Non-coordinating or interfering substituents do not facilitate such interactions and may hinder coordination.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid*
    - *4-nitrobenzoic acid*
    - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (Methyl group is non-coordinating)
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid* (Formyl group may interact unfavorably with the catalyst)
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (Short linker limits flexibility)

---

**Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole derivatives) lead to high yield, whereas bulky fused aromatic systems may lead to low yield due to steric hindrance.**

- **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles provide lone pairs for coordination with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity. However, increased steric bulk from fused rings can impede effective coordination.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
    - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Bulky fused rings create steric hindrance)

---

**Rule 4**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains (polyhydroxylated carboxylic acids) lead to high yield; those with a single hydroxyl group may not be sufficient.**

- **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and provide additional coordination sites through hydrogen bonding or direct coordination, strengthening interaction with the catalyst.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
    - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]amino]acetic acid*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Single hydroxyl group offers limited coordination)

---

**Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl groups or strong electron-withdrawing groups near coordination sites lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups reduce electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening their ability to interact with metal centers. Perfluoroalkyl groups also introduce hydrophobicity and steric hindrance.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*
    - *4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid*

---

**Rule 6**: **Modifiers with ether linkages in aliphatic chains (polyether structures) lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Ether linkages increase molecular flexibility and may interfere with optimal binding orientations. They can also reduce the overall electron density available for coordination.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

---

**Rule 7**: **Modifiers with thiol groups attached to short aliphatic chains lead to high yield; those with thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Aliphatic thiol groups can effectively coordinate with metal centers due to their accessibility and strong metal-sulfur interactions. Aromatic thiols may be less available for coordination due to delocalization of electron density.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid*

---

**Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing electron-rich heterocycles (e.g., indole ring in tryptophan) lead to high yield; those with simple phenyl side chains (e.g., phenylalanine) lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Electron-rich heterocycles can coordinate through π-electron interactions with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance. Simple phenyl groups lack these coordinating abilities.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (Tryptophan)
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine)

---

**Rule 9**: **Modifiers with aldehyde (formyl) groups directly attached to aromatic rings lead to low yield due to potential interference with catalyst sites.**

- **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups can form unwanted interactions or side reactions with metal centers, inhibiting effective coordination of the modifier.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*

---

**Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (six or more carbons) without additional polar or coordinating groups tend to lead to variable yields; optimal chain length and absence of interfering groups are key.**

- **Explanation**: Long aliphatic chains can influence solubility and steric interactions with the catalyst. The absence of additional polar groups prevents unwanted interactions that may hinder coordination.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *Octanoic acid* (Optimal chain length without interfering groups)
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid* (Amino group may cause steric hindrance)
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Hydroxyl group may interfere with coordination)

---

**Rule 11**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups (amides or peptides) near coordination sites lead to low yield due to reduced availability of lone pairs for coordination.**

- **Explanation**: Acylation diminishes the coordinating ability of nitrogen atoms by delocalizing their lone pairs into the carbonyl group, decreasing interaction with the metal center.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid*
    - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid*

---

**Rule 12**: **Modifiers with conjugated aromatic ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acid functionalities lead to high yield; non-aromatic ketones are less effective.**

- **Explanation**: Aromatic ketones can coordinate through carbonyl oxygen within an extended conjugated system, enhancing electron delocalization and stabilization of the coordination complex.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*
    - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid* (Lacks aromatic system for effective conjugation)

---

**Rule 13**: **Modifiers with bulky substituents or steric hindrance near potential coordination sites lead to low yield due to obstructed interaction with the catalyst.**

- **Explanation**: Bulky groups near coordinating atoms can prevent the modifier from properly aligning and binding to the metal center, reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Steric bulk from fused aromatic rings)
    - *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid* (Bulky acylated group near coordination site)

---

**Rule 14**: **Modifiers with electron-rich conjugated aromatic systems containing heteroatoms such as oxygen or nitrogen, capable of delocalizing electron density, lead to high yield.**

- **Explanation**: These systems can engage in π-backbonding and coordinate more effectively with metal centers, enhancing catalyst interaction.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*

---

**Rule 15**: **Modifiers with flexible aliphatic linkers (four carbons or more) between an aromatic ring and carboxylic acid group lead to high yield; shorter linkers may limit effective coordination.**

- **Explanation**: Longer linkers provide the necessary flexibility for the modifier to adopt conformations that facilitate optimal interaction with the catalyst.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (Shorter linker reduces flexibility)

  - **High Yield**:
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
    - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]amino]acetic acid*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Single hydroxyl group provides limited coordination)

---

**Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing fluorinated alkyl groups or strong electron-withdrawing groups near the coordinating sites tend to lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups reduce electron density on coordinating atoms, diminishing their ability to effectively interact with metal centers. Fluorinated groups also introduce steric bulk and hydrophobicity.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*
    - *4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid*

---

  - **Low Yield**:
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

---

**Rule 7**: **Modifiers with thiol groups attached to short aliphatic chains lead to high yield; those with thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings do not have the same effect and may lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Aliphatic thiol groups can form strong metal-sulfur bonds, enhancing coordination with the catalyst. Aromatic thiols may have reduced accessibility due to resonance stabilization and steric factors.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid*

---

**Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with electron-rich aromatic side chains capable of coordination (such as indole rings) lead to high yield; those with non-coordinating aromatic side chains lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Electron-rich side chains like indole can participate in coordination with metals through lone pairs or π-electron interactions, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (Tryptophan)
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine)

---

**Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing formyl (aldehyde) groups adjacent to potential coordinating sites lead to low yield due to possible interference with metal coordination.**

- **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups may participate in unwanted side reactions or form chelates that disrupt effective coordination with the catalyst.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*

---

**Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (with six or more carbons) lacking additional coordinating groups yield variable results; optimal chain length without interfering groups is important.**

- **Explanation**: Long aliphatic chains can influence solubility and steric interactions. Absence of additional functional groups prevents interference with coordination.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *Octanoic acid*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*

---

**Rule 11**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups (amides or peptides) near coordinating sites lead to low yield due to reduced availability of lone pairs for coordination.**

- **Explanation**: Acylation of amino groups delocalizes the nitrogen's lone pair into the carbonyl, decreasing its ability to coordinate with metal centers.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid*
    - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid*

---

**Rule 12**: **Modifiers with aromatic ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acid functionalities within a conjugated system lead to high yield; non-conjugated ketones are less effective.**

- **Explanation**: Conjugated systems facilitate electron delocalization and enhance coordination with metal centers through carbonyl oxygen atoms.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*
    - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*

---

**Rule 13**: **Modifiers with electron-rich conjugated aromatic systems containing heteroatoms (such as nitrogen or oxygen) that can participate in coordination lead to high yield.**

- **Explanation**: Heteroatoms in conjugated systems can donate electron density to metal centers, enhancing coordination and catalytic activity.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*
    - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*

---

**Rule 14**: **Modifiers with flexible aliphatic linkers (four carbons or more) between an aromatic ring and a carboxylic acid group lead to high yield; shorter linkers may limit effective coordination due to reduced flexibility.**

- **Explanation**: Longer linkers provide the necessary flexibility for the molecule to adopt favorable conformations for coordination with the catalyst.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*

---

**Rule 15**: **Modifiers with bulky substituents or steric hindrance near coordinating atoms lead to low yield due to obstructed interaction with the catalyst.**

- **Explanation**: Steric hindrance can prevent the modifier from effectively coordinating with the metal center, reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*
    - *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*

    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

**Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are short-chain aliphatic amino acids containing both primary amino (-NH₂) and carboxylic acid (-COOH) groups without bulky side chains tend to lead to high yield. Longer chains without additional coordinating groups lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Primary amino and carboxylate groups can effectively coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity. Short chains minimize steric hindrance, facilitating better interaction with the catalyst. Longer aliphatic chains without extra functional groups may reduce coordination efficiency due to increased flexibility and steric factors.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid)
    - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid)
    - *5-aminopentanoic acid*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*

---

**Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents capable of coordinating with metals (such as amino (-NH₂) or hydroxyl (-OH) groups) at the para position tend to lead to high yield. Those with electron-withdrawing groups or interfering substituents at the same position lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups enhance electron density on the aromatic ring and coordinating atoms, improving interaction with the metal catalyst. Electron-withdrawing groups can reduce electron density, diminishing coordination ability. Interfering substituents may hinder effective coordination due to steric or electronic effects.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid*
    - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *4-nitrobenzoic acid* (Nitro group is electron-withdrawing)
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid* (Formyl group is electron-withdrawing)
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (Methyl group provides minimal electron donation and no coordinating ability)

---

**Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids (such as pyridine carboxylic acids) tend to lead to high yield. Bulky substituents on the heterocycle that cause steric hindrance lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Nitrogen in heterocycles can coordinate with metal centers via lone pairs, enhancing catalytic activity. Bulky substituents can impede coordination by causing steric hindrance, reducing effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
    - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Bulky bipyridine structure increases steric hindrance)

---

**Rule 4**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups on an aliphatic chain (polyhydroxylated acids) lead to high yield. Single hydroxyl groups without additional coordinating features tend to be less effective or lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase polarity and provide additional coordination sites, enhancing interaction with the catalyst. Single hydroxyl groups offer limited coordination, and without other coordinating groups, their effectiveness decreases.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
    - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]amino]acetic acid*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*

---

**Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing thiol (-SH) groups attached to short aliphatic chains lead to high yield. Thiol groups attached directly to aromatic rings or in sterically hindered environments tend to lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Aliphatic thiol groups can form strong metal-sulfur bonds, enhancing coordination with the catalyst. When attached to aromatic rings or hindered, accessibility to the metal center is reduced, diminishing effectiveness.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid*

---

**Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with electron-rich aromatic side chains capable of coordination (such as indole or imidazole rings) lead to high yield. Those with non-coordinating or less electron-rich aromatic side chains lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Electron-rich aromatic side chains can participate in coordination with metals through lone pairs or π-electron interactions, enhancing catalytic activity. Less electron-rich or saturated side chains lack this ability.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (Tryptophan)
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine)

---

**Rule 7**: **Modifiers with flexible aliphatic linkers (four or more carbons) between an aromatic ring with coordinating groups and a carboxylic acid tend to lead to high yield. Shorter linkers without sufficient flexibility or without additional coordinating groups lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Longer linkers provide the necessary flexibility for the molecule to adopt favorable conformations for coordination with the catalyst, especially when coordinating groups are present on the aromatic ring.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*

---

**Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing electron-withdrawing groups (such as nitro (-NO₂), fluorinated alkyl chains, or formyl (-CHO) groups) near coordinating sites lead to low yield due to reduced electron density and coordination ability.**

- **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups decrease the electron density on coordinating atoms, diminishing their ability to effectively interact with metal centers.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*
    - *4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid*
    - *4-nitrobenzoic acid*
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*

---

**Rule 9**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups (amides or peptides) near coordinating sites lead to low yield due to reduced availability of lone pairs for coordination.**

- **Explanation**: Acylation of amino groups delocalizes the nitrogen's lone pair into the carbonyl, decreasing its ability to coordinate with metal centers, thus reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid*
    - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid*
    - *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*

---

**Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing flexible ether linkages (such as polyether chains) without additional coordinating groups lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Ether linkages increase molecular flexibility and may disrupt optimal coordination geometry. Without additional coordinating groups, these modifiers are less effective in interacting with the catalyst.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

---

**Rule 11**: **Modifiers with conjugated systems that include carbonyl groups (such as keto acids) adjacent to coordinating sites lead to high yield. Non-conjugated carbonyls or saturated systems are less effective and may lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Conjugated systems facilitate electron delocalization, enhancing coordination with metal centers through carbonyl oxygen atoms.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*
    - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*

---

**Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (with eight or more carbons) lacking additional coordinating groups tend to lead to low yield due to insufficient coordination sites.**

- **Explanation**: Long aliphatic chains without coordinating functional groups have limited interaction with the metal catalyst, reducing their effectiveness in enhancing yield.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *Octanoic acid*
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*

---

**Rule 13**: **Modifiers with bulky substituents or steric hindrance near coordinating atoms lead to low yield due to obstructed interaction with the catalyst.**

- **Explanation**: Steric hindrance prevents the modifier from effectively coordinating with the metal center, reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid*

---

**Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are dicarboxylic acids with conjugated systems tend to lead to high yield due to enhanced coordination through multiple sites.**

- **Explanation**: Dicarboxylic acids can chelate metal centers, and conjugation can increase electron delocalization, improving coordination strength and catalyst interaction.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid)
    - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid)
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid* (Non-conjugated system)

---

**Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing sulfur atoms in thioether groups without additional coordinating groups tend to lead to low yield due to less effective coordination compared to thiol groups.**

- **Explanation**: Thioether sulfur has less affinity for metal centers compared to thiol sulfur due to reduced availability of lone pairs for coordination.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid* (Contains a thioether group)
  - **High Yield**:
    - *(No direct examples with high yield in the dataset)*

These rules are designed to capture the relationships between the structural features of the molecular modifiers and the resulting yield of the reaction. By analyzing functional groups, chain lengths, electronic effects, and steric factors, the rules provide insights into how different modifiers may influence the catalytic activity in the reaction.

**Summary of Key Factors Influencing Yield:**

- **Coordination Ability**: Functional groups that can coordinate with metal centers (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, carboxylate, thiol) generally enhance yield.
- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-donating groups increase electron density, improving coordination. Electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density, reducing coordination.
- **Steric Hindrance**: Bulky groups near coordinating sites can hinder interaction with the catalyst, leading to lower yield.
- **Chain Length and Flexibility**: Optimal chain lengths provide necessary flexibility for coordination, while excessively long or short chains may reduce effectiveness.
- **Conjugation**: Conjugated systems facilitate electron delocalization, enhancing coordination with metal centers.
- **Functional Group Positioning**: The position of functional groups (e.g., para vs. meta) on aromatic rings affects their ability to coordinate with the catalyst.

By applying these rules, one can predict whether a new modifier might lead to a high or low yield based on its molecular structure. This approach facilitates the rational design of modifiers to optimize the reaction outcome.---------------------------------------------------------------

    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

**Rule 1**: **Modifiers containing both an amino group (-NH₂) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) on adjacent carbons (α-amino acids), with short aliphatic side chains (1 to 4 carbons), tend to lead to high yield.**

- **Explanation**: The proximity of amino and carboxyl groups allows for effective chelation with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity. Short side chains reduce steric hindrance, facilitating better interaction with the catalyst.

- **Supporting High Yield Examples**:
  - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid)
  - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid)
  - *5-aminopentanoic acid*

- **Supporting Low Yield Examples**:
  - *7-aminoheptanoic acid* (Longer chain increases steric hindrance)
  - *8-aminooctanoic acid*

---

**Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with functional groups capable of coordinating with metal centers (such as amino (-NH₂), hydroxyl (-OH), or nitro (-NO₂) groups) tend to lead to high yield.**

- **Explanation**: Coordinating groups on the aromatic ring enhance interaction with the metal catalyst. These groups can donate electron density or form coordination bonds, improving catalyst performance.

- **Supporting High Yield Examples**:
  - *4-aminobenzoic acid*
  - *4-nitrobenzoic acid*
  - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*

- **Supporting Low Yield Examples**:
  - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (Lacks effective coordinating group)
  - *4-formylbenzoic acid* (Formyl group may not coordinate effectively)

---

**Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids without bulky substituents tend to lead to high yield.**

- **Explanation**: Nitrogen heterocycles, such as pyridine and pyrazole carboxylic acids, can coordinate with metal centers via lone pairs on nitrogen, enhancing catalytic activity. Lack of bulky groups prevents steric hindrance.

- **Supporting High Yield Examples**:
  - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
  - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
  - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*

- **Supporting Low Yield Examples**:
  - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Bulky due to bipyridine structure)
  - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid* (Steric hindrance from substituents)

---

**Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) on an aliphatic chain in combination with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) tend to lead to high yield.**

- **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites, enhancing interaction with the metal catalyst. This increases the overall coordination number and stabilizes the catalyst complex.

- **Supporting High Yield Examples**:
  - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
  - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]amino]acetic acid*

- **Supporting Low Yield Examples**:
  - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Only one hydroxyl group, longer chain reduces effectiveness)

---

**Rule 5**: **Modifiers with thiol groups (-SH) attached to short aliphatic chains (2 to 3 carbons) in combination with a carboxylic acid group tend to lead to high yield. Thiol groups attached to aromatic rings tend to lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Aliphatic thiol groups can form strong metal-sulfur bonds, enhancing coordination. Short chains minimize steric hindrance. Thiol groups on aromatic rings may experience resonance stabilization, reducing availability for coordination.

- **Supporting High Yield Examples**:
  - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*

- **Supporting Low Yield Examples**:
  - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* (Thiol attached to aromatic ring)

---

**Rule 6**: **Modifiers that can chelate the metal center through two or more adjacent donor atoms (e.g., hydroxyl and carboxyl groups in ortho positions on an aromatic ring) tend to lead to high yield.**

- **Explanation**: Chelation increases the stability of the metal complex by forming ring structures with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Supporting High Yield Examples**:
  - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*
  - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*

- **Supporting Low Yield Examples**:
  - *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid* (Possible steric hindrance reduces chelation)

---

**Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing additional coordinating groups (such as indole rings) tend to lead to high yield. Those with non-coordinating side chains tend to lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Coordinating side chains provide extra sites for interaction with the metal catalyst, enhancing activity. Non-coordinating side chains do not offer this benefit.

- **Supporting High Yield Examples**:
  - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (Tryptophan)

- **Supporting Low Yield Examples**:
  - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine; benzene ring does not coordinate effectively)

---

**Rule 8**: **Modifiers with flexible aliphatic chains connecting an aromatic ring with coordinating groups (such as hydroxyl or amino groups) to a carboxylic acid tend to lead to high yield, especially when the chain length allows for effective spatial orientation (3 to 5 carbons).**

- **Explanation**: Flexible chains enable the coordinating group on the aromatic ring to interact optimally with the metal center, while the carboxylic acid anchors the modifier to the catalyst framework.

- **Supporting High Yield Examples**:
  - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*

- **Supporting Low Yield Examples**:
  - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (Shorter chain may limit flexibility)

---

**Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing electron-withdrawing groups (such as fluorinated alkyl chains) near the coordinating sites tend to lead to low yield due to reduced electron density and weaker coordination ability.**

- **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups pull electron density away from coordinating atoms, decreasing their ability to donate electrons to the metal center.

- **Supporting Low Yield Examples**:
  - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*
  - *4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid*

---

**Rule 10**: **Modifiers with ether linkages (-O-) in aliphatic chains, especially multiple ether groups without additional coordinating functionalities, tend to lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Ether oxygen atoms are poorer ligands for metal coordination compared to amine or thiol groups. Flexible ether chains may not position coordinating groups effectively.

- **Supporting Low Yield Examples**:
  - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
  - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

---

**Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (chains longer than 6 carbons) without additional coordinating groups tend to have variable effects on yield, suggesting that chain length alone is not a definitive predictor.**

- **Explanation**: While long chains may introduce steric hindrance, some long-chain carboxylic acids like octanoic acid lead to high yield, indicating other factors such as overall hydrophobicity or packing may influence activity.

- **Supporting High Yield Examples**:
  - *Octanoic acid*

- **Supporting Low Yield Examples**:
  - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Presence of a single hydroxyl group may not be sufficient)

---

**Rule 12**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups (amides) near coordinating sites tend to lead to low yield due to reduced availability of lone pairs for metal coordination.**

- **Explanation**: Amide formation delocalizes the nitrogen's lone pair into the carbonyl group, decreasing its ability to coordinate with the metal center.

- **Supporting Low Yield Examples**:
  - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid*
  - *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*

---

**Rule 13**: **Modifiers that can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds may have reduced availability of coordinating groups, leading to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Intramolecular hydrogen bonding locks coordinating groups into a conformation that is less accessible for interaction with the metal catalyst.

- **Supporting Low Yield Examples**:
  - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid* (Ortho-hydroxy and formyl groups may form hydrogen bonds)

---

**Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing conjugated systems adjacent to coordinating groups tend to lead to high yield due to enhanced electron delocalization and coordination ability.**

- **Explanation**: Conjugation increases electron density and stabilizes the coordination bond between the modifier and the metal center.

- **Supporting High Yield Examples**:
  - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*

- **Supporting Low Yield Examples**:
  - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid* (Non-conjugated carbonyl groups)

---

**Rule 15**: **Modifiers with bulky substituents near coordinating sites that cause steric hindrance tend to lead to low yield.**

- **Explanation**: Bulky groups can prevent effective interaction with the metal catalyst by blocking access to coordinating atoms.

- **Supporting Low Yield Examples**:
  - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Bulky bipyridine structure)
  - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid* (Bulky methoxy groups)

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules highlight the relationships between specific combinations of substructures in the molecular modifiers and the resulting high or low yield of the reaction. By focusing on combinations of functional groups and their positions within the molecule, the rules provide a predictive framework for evaluating new modifiers.

**Summary of Key Factors Influencing Yield**:

- **Coordination Sites**: Modifiers with functional groups capable of coordinating with metal centers (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, thiol, heterocyclic nitrogen) enhance yield.

- **Chelation Ability**: Molecules that can chelate the metal through multiple adjacent donor atoms increase catalytic activity.

- **Steric Effects**: Bulky substituents near coordinating sites hinder metal interaction, reducing yield.

- **Chain Length and Flexibility**: Optimal chain lengths (typically 2 to 5 carbons) provide flexibility for effective coordination without introducing excessive steric hindrance.

- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-donating or withdrawing groups can influence the electron density on coordinating atoms, affecting coordination strength.

- **Conjugation**: Conjugated systems adjacent to coordinating groups enhance electron delocalization, improving coordination.

- **Functional Group Combination**: Combining multiple coordinating functionalities within a modifier increases coordination opportunities and catalyst interaction.

By applying these rules, researchers can predict the effectiveness of potential modifiers and design new ones to optimize the yield of the δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------
