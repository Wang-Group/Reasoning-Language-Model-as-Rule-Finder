  - *Rationale*: Effective coordination enhances interaction with the catalyst, improving yield. Non-coordinating or deactivating groups hinder coordination or reduce electron density, leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 3**: **Carboxylic acids where the carboxyl group is directly attached to a nitrogen-containing heterocycle give high yield; if the nitrogen heterocycle is attached via a linker, the yield is low.**
  - *Examples*:
    - **High Yield**: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (nicotinic acid), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid.
    - **Low Yield**: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Direct attachment allows the heterocyclic nitrogen to coordinate effectively with the catalyst, enhancing reactivity and yield. Linkers reduce this interaction due to increased distance and flexibility.

- **Rule 4**: **Carboxylic acids containing polyether chains (long chains of ethylene glycol units) give low yield.**
  - *Examples*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Polyether chains introduce steric bulk and flexibility, hindering effective coordination with the catalyst's active sites and decreasing the reaction yield.

- **Rule 5**: **Carboxylic acids with fluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoroacetyl groups give low yield.**
  - *Examples*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid, 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Fluorination increases steric hindrance and decreases polarity, reducing the modifier's ability to coordinate effectively with the catalyst and lowering the yield.

- **Rule 6**: **Alpha-amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains (e.g., indole ring) give high yield; those with simple aromatic side chains (e.g., phenyl ring) give low yield.**
  - *Examples*:
    - **High Yield**: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan).
    - **Low Yield**: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine).
  - *Rationale*: Heteroaromatic side chains can coordinate better due to lone pairs on heteroatoms, enhancing interaction with the catalyst. Simple aromatic rings lack these features, resulting in lower yields.

- **Rule 7**: **Polyhydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids give high yield.**
  - *Examples*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and provide multiple sites for coordination or hydrogen bonding, enhancing interaction with the catalyst and improving yield.

- **Rule 8**: **Simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar or bulky functional groups give high yield.**
  - *Examples*:
    - **High Yield**: Octanoic acid.
    - **Low Yield**: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Lack of interfering functional groups allows better interaction with the catalyst. Additional polar or bulky groups can introduce steric hindrance or electronic effects that reduce yield.

- **Rule 9**: **Carboxylic acids with carbonyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group give low yield.**
  - *Examples*: 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid, 4-oxoheptanedioic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Adjacent carbonyl groups can engage in resonance or intramolecular interactions that reduce the availability of the carboxyl group for effective catalyst coordination, decreasing the yield.

- **Rule 10**: **Carboxylic acids with bulky substituents near the carboxyl group give low yield.**
  - *Example*: (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Bulky groups near the carboxyl group create steric hindrance that impedes the modifier's ability to interact effectively with the catalyst's active sites, resulting in lower yields.

- **Rule 11**: **Aliphatic carboxylic acids with omega-pyridyl groups give high yield.**
  - *Example*: 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: The pyridine nitrogen at the terminal position can coordinate with the catalyst when appropriately spaced by an aliphatic chain, enhancing interaction and yield.

- **Rule 12**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy groups on the ring and additional ketone functionalities give high yield.**
  - *Example*: 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups are electron-donating, increasing electron density and enhancing coordination. Ketone groups can also participate in coordination, collectively improving yield.

- **Rule 13**: **Carboxylic acids with thiol groups attached to aromatic rings give low yield.**
  - *Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Thiol groups can strongly bind to metal centers, potentially deactivating the catalyst by forming stable, non-reactive complexes, thereby reducing the reaction yield.

- **Rule 14**: **Aliphatic carboxylic acids with distal polar groups (hydroxyl, amino) located at positions beyond δ (epsilon or further) give low yield.**
  - *Examples*: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Polar groups too distant from the carboxyl group are less effective in coordination and may introduce flexibility that hinders effective interaction with the catalyst, leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 15**: **Aromatic carboxylic acids with non-coordinating electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., formyl) at the para position give low yield.**
  - *Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density on the aromatic ring, reducing its ability to coordinate with the catalyst and lowering the reaction yield.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** states that aliphatic carboxylic acids with omega-pyridyl groups give high yield. While the rule is clear and the property insight is adequate, it conflicts with **Rule 3** and is supported by only one data point (entry 24). Integrating this rule with **Rule 3** or refining both rules could resolve contradictions and improve overall coverage and consistency.

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** is specific, focusing on aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy groups and additional ketone functionalities giving high yield. The property insight connects electron-donating effects to increased coordination. However, the rule has limited coverage with only one data point (entry 25) and may be too narrow in scope. Broadening the rule or combining it with similar rules could enhance its applicability and coverage.

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13** points out that carboxylic acids with thiol groups attached to aromatic rings give low yield. While the property insight is adequate, the rule overlaps with **Rule 2** (which also includes 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid as a low-yield example) and has limited coverage (entry 9). It may be redundant and could be merged with **Rule 2** for better clarity and coverage.

- **Comment 14**: **Rule 14** is clear, indicating that aliphatic carboxylic acids with distal polar groups beyond the δ position give low yield. The property insight is strong, relating reduced coordination ability due to distance and flexibility. The rule has acceptable complexity and is supported by multiple data points (entries 29, 34), providing good coverage.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with aldehyde (formyl) groups on the aromatic ring give low yield due to decreased electron density and potential steric hindrance.**

  - *Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.

  - *Example*:
    - **High Yield**: *Octanoic acid*.
  - *Rationale*: The absence of interfering substituents allows the carboxyl group to coordinate freely with the metal center.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with hydroxyl or amino groups located far from the carboxyl group (beyond five carbons) yield low efficiency due to ineffective simultaneous coordination.**

  - *Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**: *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*, *8-aminooctanoic acid*.
  - *Rationale*: Distant functional groups are less likely to participate in bidentate or multidentate coordination, reducing binding strength.

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino or thiol group located within three to five carbons of the carboxyl group** yield **high efficiency** due to effective bidentate coordination with the metal center; those with these groups further away yield low efficiency.**

  - *Examples*:
    - **High Yield**: *5-aminopentanoic acid*, *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (glutamic acid), *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*.
    - **Low Yield**: *7-aminoheptanoic acid*, *8-aminooctanoic acid*, *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*.
  - *Rationale*: Close proximity of amino or thiol groups to the carboxyl group allows for simultaneous coordination to the metal center, enhancing binding strength and catalytic activity. Distant functional groups reduce chelation ability and coordination effectiveness.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with substituents capable of additional coordination (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl groups) at the para position** yield **high efficiency** due to enhanced metal-ligand interactions; those with non-coordinating or electron-donating substituents yield low efficiency.**

  - *Examples*:
    - **High Yield**: *4-aminobenzoic acid*, *4-nitrobenzoic acid*, *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid*.
    - **Low Yield**: *4-methylbenzoic acid*, *4-formylbenzoic acid*.
  - *Rationale*: Substituents capable of coordination provide additional binding sites to the metal center, enhancing catalyst stability. Non-coordinating or electron-donating groups do not offer this advantage and may decrease the coordination efficiency.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are **perfluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids** yield **low efficiency** due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms, which reduces electron density on the carboxylate oxygen atoms and weakens metal coordination.**

  - *Example*:
    - **Low Yield**: *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*.
  - *Rationale*: The highly electronegative fluorine atoms pull electron density away from the carboxylate group, diminishing its ability to effectively coordinate with the metal center.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) groups** yield **low efficiency** due to the potential of aldehyde groups to engage in side reactions or form stable, inactive complexes with the metal catalyst.**

  - *Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**: *4-formylbenzoic acid*, *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can interact with the metal center in a manner that deactivates the catalyst or reduces its availability for the desired reaction.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are **simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups** yield **high efficiency** due to minimal steric hindrance and effective coordination through the carboxylate group.**

  - *Example*:
    - **High Yield**: *Octanoic acid*.
  - *Rationale*: The absence of interfering functional groups allows the carboxylate to freely coordinate with the metal center, optimizing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with **long, flexible ether chains or bulky substituents near the carboxyl group** yield **low efficiency** due to steric hindrance that impedes effective coordination with the metal center.**

  - *Example*:
    - **Low Yield**: *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*.
  - *Rationale*: Bulky or flexible groups can obstruct the approach of the carboxylate oxygen to the metal, reducing binding efficiency.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are **amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains capable of coordination** (e.g., indole ring of tryptophan) yield **high efficiency**; those with non-coordinating side chains yield low efficiency.**

  - *Examples*:
    - **High Yield**: *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (tryptophan).
    - **Low Yield**: *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (phenylalanine).
  - *Rationale*: Heteroaromatic side chains provide additional coordination sites, enhancing metal binding and catalytic performance. Non-coordinating side chains lack this benefit.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are **nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids directly attached to the ring** yield **high efficiency** due to the ability of the heterocyclic nitrogen to coordinate with the metal; those with heterocycles connected via additional rings yield low efficiency.**

  - *Examples*:
    - **High Yield**: *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (nicotinic acid), *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*.
    - **Low Yield**: *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*.
  - *Rationale*: Direct attachment ensures effective coordination through the heterocycle. Additional rings introduce steric hindrance and electronic effects that reduce coordination efficiency.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with **conjugated keto-carboxylate systems** yield **low efficiency** due to the formation of stable chelate complexes that sequester the metal center and inhibit catalysis.**

  - *Example*:
    - **Low Yield**: *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*.
  - *Rationale*: The conjugation between the carbonyl and carboxylate groups leads to strong binding with the metal, forming inactive complexes that decrease available catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy aliphatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** yield **high efficiency** due to multiple coordination sites enhancing metal binding.**

  - *Example*:
    - **High Yield**: *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (gluconic acid).
  - *Rationale*: Hydroxyl groups near the carboxylate increase chelation effectiveness, stabilizing the metal complex and promoting catalytic activity.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with **bulky substituents near the carboxyl group** yield **low efficiency** due to steric hindrance that impairs coordination with the metal center.**

  - *Example*:
    - **Low Yield**: *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*.
  - *Rationale*: Large groups adjacent to the carboxylate obstruct metal-ligand interaction, reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with **acylated amino or hydroxyl groups** yield **low efficiency** because acylation blocks the coordinating lone pairs on nitrogen or oxygen, preventing effective metal coordination.**

  - *Example*:
    - **Low Yield**: *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid*.
  - *Rationale*: Acyl groups inhibit the ability of amino or hydroxyl groups to donate electrons to the metal center, diminishing binding and catalytic performance.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with **hydroxy or amino groups located more than five carbons away from the carboxyl group** yield **low efficiency** due to ineffective simultaneous coordination and reduced chelation potential.**

  - *Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**: *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*, *8-aminooctanoic acid*.
  - *Rationale*: Distant functional groups cannot effectively participate in bidentate coordination, lessening metal binding and catalytic activity.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with aromatic rings bearing coordinating groups** yield **high efficiency** due to additional π-π interactions and coordination sites enhancing metal-ligand binding.**

  - *Example*:
    - **High Yield**: *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*.
  - *Rationale*: The combination of an aromatic ring and coordinating substituents like hydroxyl groups promotes stronger interactions with the metal center.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are **amino acids with thioether-containing side chains** yield **low efficiency** because thioether sulfur atoms are less effective at metal coordination compared to thiols, resulting in weaker binding.**

  - *Example*:
    - **Low Yield**: *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid* (derived from methionine).
  - *Rationale*: Thioethers have diminished electron-donating ability, leading to less effective coordination with the metal center and reduced catalytic efficiency.
