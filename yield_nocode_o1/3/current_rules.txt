**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino or thiol group located within three to five carbons of the carboxyl group** yield **high efficiency** due to effective bidentate coordination with the metal center; those with these groups further away yield low efficiency.**

  - *Examples*:
    - **High Yield**: *5-aminopentanoic acid*, *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (glutamic acid), *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*.
    - **Low Yield**: *7-aminoheptanoic acid*, *8-aminooctanoic acid*, *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*.
  - *Rationale*: Close proximity of amino or thiol groups to the carboxyl group allows for simultaneous coordination to the metal center, forming stable chelate complexes that enhance catalytic activity. Distant functional groups cannot effectively chelate, reducing coordination effectiveness.

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with substituents capable of coordination (e.g., amino, nitro groups) at the para position** yield **high efficiency** due to enhanced metal-ligand interactions; those with non-coordinating or sterically hindering substituents yield low efficiency.**

  - *Examples*:
    - **High Yield**: *4-aminobenzoic acid*, *4-nitrobenzoic acid*.
    - **Low Yield**: *4-methylbenzoic acid*, *4-formylbenzoic acid*, *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid*.
  - *Rationale*: Coordinating substituents like amino and nitro groups provide additional binding sites to the metal center, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity. Non-coordinating groups or those that can engage in side reactions (e.g., formyl groups) may decrease coordination efficiency or deactivate the catalyst.

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are **perfluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids** yield **low efficiency** due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms, which reduces electron density on the carboxylate oxygen atoms and weakens metal coordination.**

  - *Example*:
    - **Low Yield**: *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*.
  - *Rationale*: The electronegative fluorine atoms pull electron density away from the carboxylate group, diminishing its ability to coordinate effectively with the metal center.

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are **simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups** yield **high efficiency** due to minimal steric hindrance and effective coordination through the carboxylate group.**

  - *Example*:
    - **High Yield**: *Octanoic acid*.
  - *Rationale*: The absence of interfering functional groups allows the carboxylate to freely coordinate with the metal center, optimizing catalytic activity by minimizing steric and electronic obstacles.

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with **hydroxyl or amino groups located more than five carbons away from the carboxyl group** yield **low efficiency** due to ineffective simultaneous coordination and reduced chelation potential.**

  - *Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**: *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*, *7-aminoheptanoic acid*, *8-aminooctanoic acid*.
  - *Rationale*: Functional groups distant from the carboxyl group cannot participate in bidentate coordination, resulting in weaker metal binding and decreased catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are **amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains capable of coordination** (e.g., indole ring of tryptophan) yield **high efficiency**; those with non-heteroaromatic side chains yield low efficiency.**

  - *Examples*:
    - **High Yield**: *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (tryptophan).
    - **Low Yield**: *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (phenylalanine).
  - *Rationale*: Heteroaromatic side chains provide additional coordination sites through heteroatoms, enhancing metal binding and catalytic performance. Non-heteroaromatic side chains lack this benefit.

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with **aldehyde (formyl) groups** yield **low efficiency** due to the potential of aldehyde groups to engage in side reactions or form stable, inactive complexes with the metal catalyst.**

  - *Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**: *4-formylbenzoic acid*, *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can interact with the metal center, deactivating the catalyst or reducing its availability for the desired reaction through irreversible binding or side reactions.

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy aliphatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** yield **high efficiency** due to multiple coordination sites enhancing metal binding.**

  - *Example*:
    - **High Yield**: *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (gluconic acid).
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxylate increase chelation effectiveness by providing several points of attachment to the metal center, stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with **long, flexible ether chains or bulky substituents near the carboxyl group** yield **low efficiency** due to steric hindrance that impedes effective coordination with the metal center.**

  - *Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**: *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*, *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*.
  - *Rationale*: Bulky or flexible groups can obstruct the approach of the carboxylate oxygen to the metal, reducing binding efficiency and inhibiting catalysis.

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are **arylalkanoic acids with longer aliphatic chains (more than four carbons) between the aromatic ring and the carboxyl group** yield **high efficiency**; those with shorter chains yield low efficiency.**

  - *Examples*:
    - **High Yield**: *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*.
    - **Low Yield**: *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*.
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains may reduce steric hindrance and electronic interference from the aromatic ring, allowing the carboxylate group to coordinate more effectively with the metal center.

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing **acylated amino groups** yield **low efficiency** because acylation blocks the coordinating lone pairs on nitrogen, preventing effective metal coordination.**

  - *Example*:
    - **Low Yield**: *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid*.
  - *Rationale*: Acyl groups on amino functions inhibit their ability to donate electrons to the metal center, diminishing binding and catalytic performance.

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are **nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids directly attached to the ring** yield **high efficiency** due to the ability of the heterocyclic nitrogen to coordinate with the metal; those with heterocycles connected via additional rings yield low efficiency.**

  - *Examples*:
    - **High Yield**: *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (nicotinic acid), *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*.
    - **Low Yield**: *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*.
  - *Rationale*: Direct attachment ensures effective coordination through the heterocycle. Additional rings introduce steric hindrance and electronic effects that reduce coordination efficiency.

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers with **electron-withdrawing groups such as trifluoroacetyl or perfluoroalkyl chains** yield **low efficiency** due to decreased electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening metal-ligand interactions.**

  - *Example*:
    - **Low Yield**: *4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid*.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups reduce the ability of coordinating atoms to donate electron density to the metal center, impairing coordination.

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with **functional groups that can form stable, inactive chelates with the metal center** yield **low efficiency** due to sequestration of the metal catalyst.**

  - *Example*:
    - **Low Yield**: *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*.
  - *Rationale*: Chelating agents can bind the metal strongly in an inactive form, reducing the availability of the catalyst for the desired reaction.

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are **amino acids with unacylated primary amino groups near the carboxyl group** yield **high efficiency** due to effective coordination; modifiers with **acylated or blocked amino groups** yield low efficiency.**

  - *Examples*:
    - **High Yield**: *5-aminopentanoic acid*.
    - **Low Yield**: *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid* (derived from methionine).
  - *Rationale*: Free amino groups enhance metal binding through coordination. Acylation or blocking of amino groups prevents this interaction, reducing catalytic efficiency.

These rules provide a structured understanding of how specific combinations of functional groups and structural features in molecular modifiers influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By focusing on direct combinations of sub-structures—including the position and type of functional groups—and considering their physico-chemical properties such as coordination ability, electron-donating or -withdrawing effects, steric hindrance, and chelation potential, the rules predict whether a modifier will result in a high or low yield.

The rules balance simplicity and complexity, covering a broad range of modifiers in the dataset while maintaining specificity. They offer clear guidance for predicting reaction outcomes based on modifier structures, aiding in the selection and design of effective modifiers to optimize and control the reaction yield.---------------------------------------------------------------
