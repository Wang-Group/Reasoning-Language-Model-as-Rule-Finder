Rule 1: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino or thiol group located within three to five carbons of the carboxyl group yield high efficiency due to effective bidentate coordination with the metal center; those with these groups further away yield low efficiency.,Rule 12: Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids directly attached to the ring yield high efficiency due to the ability of the heterocyclic nitrogen to coordinate with the metal; those with heterocycles connected via additional rings yield low efficiency.
