- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrocarbon chains (C7 and above)** lacking polar terminal groups result in **High Yield**. The hydrophobic chain may aid in substrate accessibility or catalyst solubility. Example: *octanoic acid*. Introduction of **terminal polar groups** such as hydroxyl or amino groups decreases the yield, leading to **Low Yield** due to increased polarity and possible interference with catalyst interactions. Examples: *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*, *7-aminoheptanoic acid*.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with large aromatic side chains capable of π-stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions** result in **High Yield**. These interactions can stabilize the catalyst-substrate complex. Example: *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (Tryptophan). In contrast, α-amino acids with smaller aromatic side chains that lack additional interaction sites result in **Low Yield**. Example: *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine).

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing **multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxylic acid**, such as sugar acids, produce a **High Yield**. The numerous hydroxyl groups enhance hydrogen bonding and chelation with metal centers. Example: *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid).

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with **aliphatic thiol groups near the carboxylic acid** lead to **High Yield** due to the strong ability of thiols to coordinate with metal centers. Example: *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*. However, when the thiol group is attached to an aromatic ring, the yield is **Low** due to reduced flexibility and potential steric hindrance. Example: *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid*.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **strong electron-withdrawing groups** such as perfluoroalkyl chains result in **Low Yield**. The electron-withdrawing effect can reduce the ability of the modifier to coordinate effectively with the catalyst. Example: *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **polyether chains or flexible ether linkages** attached to the carboxylic acid result in **Low Yield**. The steric bulk and flexibility of polyether chains may hinder proper orientation and coordination with the catalyst. Example: *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **aldehyde groups on the aromatic ring adjacent to the carboxylic acid** lead to **Low Yield**. Aldehyde groups may compete with the catalyst or participate in unwanted side reactions. Examples: *4-formylbenzoic acid*, *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with fused or extended conjugated ring systems** can result in **High Yield**. Extended conjugation may enhance π-interactions with the catalyst. Example: *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers possessing **functional groups capable of coordinating to metal centers**, such as amino or hydroxyl groups positioned appropriately, tend to result in **High Yield**. These groups facilitate stronger binding to the catalyst. Examples: *4-aminobenzoic acid*, *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **amide-containing compounds or peptides with bulky or polar side chains**, especially those containing sulfur groups, tend to lead to **Low Yield**. Steric hindrance and competing interactions may interfere with catalyst function. Example: *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]ethanoic acid*.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with **aromatic rings substituted with electron-donating groups at the para position**, such as methyl or methoxy groups, without additional coordinating functionalities, tend to result in **Low Yield**. Electron-donating groups can decrease acidity and weaken interactions with the catalyst. Examples: *4-methylbenzoic acid*, *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*.

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, such as nitro or bromomethyl groups, lead to **High Yield**. Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity and coordinating ability of the carboxyl group, enhancing interaction with metal centers.

  Examples:
  - *4-nitrobenzoic acid* (para-nitro group)
  - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid* (para-bromomethyl group)

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-donating groups at the para position capable of coordination**, such as amino groups, result in **High Yield**. The amino group can act as an additional coordination site, strengthening the interaction with the catalyst.

  Example:
  - *4-aminobenzoic acid* (para-amino group)

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position that are non-coordinating**, like methyl or thiol groups, result in **Low Yield**. These groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group without providing additional coordination sites, weakening interaction with the metal center.

  Examples:
  - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (para-methyl group)
  - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* (para-thiol group)

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen or oxygen atoms capable of chelation**, such as pyridine, pyrazole, or oxidized rings, result in **High Yield**. The heteroatoms enhance coordination with the metal center, improving catalyst activity.

  Examples:
  - *pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (nicotinic acid)
  - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
  - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid* (isonicotinic acid N-oxide)
  - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid* (ketoisophthalic acid derivative)

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** lead to **Low Yield**. Aldehyde groups can interfere with metal coordination or participate in side reactions, reducing catalyst effectiveness.

  Examples:
  - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
  - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with additional carboxyl groups in the side chain**, such as aspartic acid and glutamic acid, result in **High Yield**. The extra carboxyl groups provide multiple coordination sites, enhancing interaction with the metal catalyst.

  Examples:
  - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (aspartic acid)
  - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (glutamic acid)

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with aromatic side chains containing additional coordinating groups**, like the indole ring in tryptophan, lead to **High Yield**. The side chains offer π-stacking and coordination opportunities, strengthening catalyst interactions.

  Example:
  - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (tryptophan)

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with non-coordinating side chains or sterically hindered functional groups** result in **Low Yield**. Limited interaction sites or steric hindrance reduce coordination with the catalyst.

  Examples:
  - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (phenylalanine)
  - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-acetyl-L-lysine)

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length hydrocarbon chains (6–8 carbons) lacking additional polar groups** lead to **High Yield**. The hydrophobic chains may promote substrate accessibility to the catalyst's active sites without interfering with coordination.

  Example:
  - *octanoic acid*

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar functional groups (hydroxyl or amino) further along the chain** result in **Low Yield**. These polar groups may form competing interactions or disrupt catalyst structure, hindering reactivity.

  Examples:
  - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*
  - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
  - *8-aminooctanoic acid*

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers containing **multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group**, such as **sugar acids**, result in **High Yield**. The numerous hydroxyls enhance chelation with metal centers, stabilizing the catalyst.

  Examples:
  - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (gluconic acid)
  - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **perfluoroalkyl chains attached to the carboxyl group** result in **Low Yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect reduces the coordinating ability of the carboxyl group, diminishing interaction with the catalyst.

  Example:
  - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers featuring an **aromatic or heteroaromatic ring connected via a flexible aliphatic linker (3–5 carbons) to the carboxyl group** lead to **High Yield**. The flexible linker allows optimal orientation and interaction with the catalyst.

  Examples:
  - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*
  - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid*

  Conversely, modifiers with **shorter linkers (1–2 carbons)** result in **Low Yield** due to reduced flexibility and suboptimal coordination.

  Example:
  - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers containing **thiol groups near the carboxyl group on aliphatic chains** result in **High Yield**. Thiol groups strongly coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability.

  Example:
  - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*

  However, **thiol groups attached to aromatic rings** may lead to **Low Yield**, possibly due to steric hindrance or less effective coordination.

  Example:
  - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid*

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with **bulky ether or amide linkages connecting polar functional groups** tend to result in **Low Yield**. Increased steric hindrance and polarity may disrupt effective coordination with the catalyst.

  Examples:
  - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
  - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*
  - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid*

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group**, such as sugar acids, result in **High Yield**. The multiple hydroxyls enhance chelation with metal centers, stabilizing the catalyst.

  Example:
  - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (gluconic acid)

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **thiol groups near the carboxyl group on aliphatic chains** result in **High Yield**. Thiol groups strongly coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability.

  Example:
  - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with **perfluoroalkyl chains attached to the carboxyl group** result in **Low Yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect reduces the coordinating ability of the carboxyl group.

  Example:
  - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids connected via a flexible aliphatic linker (4–5 carbons) to another coordinating group or aromatic ring** result in **High Yield**. The flexible linker allows optimal orientation for effective coordination with the metal center.

  Examples:
  - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*
  - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid*

  Conversely, modifiers with **shorter linkers (1–3 carbons)** result in **Low Yield** due to limited flexibility and suboptimal coordination.

  Example:
  - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **aldehyde groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** result in **Low Yield**. Aldehyde groups can interfere with metal coordination or participate in side reactions, reducing catalyst effectiveness.

  Examples:
  - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
  - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with **bulky ether chains or flexible polar functional groups in the aliphatic chain** result in **Low Yield**. Steric hindrance and increased polarity may disrupt effective coordination with the catalyst.

  Examples:
  - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
  - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids where heteroatoms are not favorably positioned or are sterically hindered** result in **Low Yield**. Ineffective coordination reduces catalyst activity.

  Example:
  - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*
