**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino dicarboxylic acids** result in **High Yield**. These compounds have an amino group at the α-position and two carboxylic acid groups. The presence of two carboxylates allows for strong coordination with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity. Examples: *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid), *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid).

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with an electron-withdrawing group at the para position** lead to **High Yield**. Electron-withdrawing groups increase acidity and enhance interactions with metal ions. Examples include nitro and bromomethyl groups. Examples: *4-nitrobenzoic acid*, *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid*. Conversely, modifiers with electron-donating groups like methyl result in **Low Yield** (e.g., *4-methylbenzoic acid*). An exception is the amino group; despite being electron-donating, para-amino groups can coordinate with metals, leading to **High Yield** (e.g., *4-aminobenzoic acid*).

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms** result in **High Yield**. Nitrogen atoms in the ring can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity. This includes pyridine and pyrazole carboxylic acids. Examples: *pyridine-3-carboxylic acid*, *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*, *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*. Modifiers where the heteroaromatic ring is connected via a flexible aliphatic linker also result in **High Yield** due to improved flexibility and coordination. Example: *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid*. In contrast, direct attachment of bulky aromatic rings without a linker leads to **Low Yield** due to steric hindrance (e.g., *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*).

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrocarbon chains (C7 and above)** lacking polar terminal groups result in **High Yield**. The hydrophobic chain may aid in substrate accessibility or catalyst solubility. Example: *octanoic acid*. Introduction of **terminal polar groups** such as hydroxyl or amino groups decreases the yield, leading to **Low Yield** due to increased polarity and possible interference with catalyst interactions. Examples: *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*, *7-aminoheptanoic acid*.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with large aromatic side chains capable of π-stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions** result in **High Yield**. These interactions can stabilize the catalyst-substrate complex. Example: *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (Tryptophan). In contrast, α-amino acids with smaller aromatic side chains that lack additional interaction sites result in **Low Yield**. Example: *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine).

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing **multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxylic acid**, such as sugar acids, produce a **High Yield**. The numerous hydroxyl groups enhance hydrogen bonding and chelation with metal centers. Example: *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid).

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with **aliphatic thiol groups near the carboxylic acid** lead to **High Yield** due to the strong ability of thiols to coordinate with metal centers. Example: *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*. However, when the thiol group is attached to an aromatic ring, the yield is **Low** due to reduced flexibility and potential steric hindrance. Example: *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid*.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **strong electron-withdrawing groups** such as perfluoroalkyl chains result in **Low Yield**. The electron-withdrawing effect can reduce the ability of the modifier to coordinate effectively with the catalyst. Example: *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **polyether chains or flexible ether linkages** attached to the carboxylic acid result in **Low Yield**. The steric bulk and flexibility of polyether chains may hinder proper orientation and coordination with the catalyst. Example: *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **aldehyde groups on the aromatic ring adjacent to the carboxylic acid** lead to **Low Yield**. Aldehyde groups may compete with the catalyst or participate in unwanted side reactions. Examples: *4-formylbenzoic acid*, *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with fused or extended conjugated ring systems** can result in **High Yield**. Extended conjugation may enhance π-interactions with the catalyst. Example: *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers possessing **functional groups capable of coordinating to metal centers**, such as amino or hydroxyl groups positioned appropriately, tend to result in **High Yield**. These groups facilitate stronger binding to the catalyst. Examples: *4-aminobenzoic acid*, *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **amide-containing compounds or peptides with bulky or polar side chains**, especially those containing sulfur groups, tend to lead to **Low Yield**. Steric hindrance and competing interactions may interfere with catalyst function. Example: *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]ethanoic acid*.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with **aromatic rings substituted with electron-donating groups at the para position**, such as methyl or methoxy groups, without additional coordinating functionalities, tend to result in **Low Yield**. Electron-donating groups can decrease acidity and weaken interactions with the catalyst. Examples: *4-methylbenzoic acid*, *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*.
