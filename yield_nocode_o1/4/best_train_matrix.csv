Rule 1: Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids result in High Yield,Rule 2: Aromatic carboxylic acids with an electron-withdrawing group at the para position result in High Yield; electron-donating groups at the para position result in Low Yield,Rule 3: Heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms result in High Yield; direct attachment without linker leads to Low Yield,Rule 4: Aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrocarbon chains (C7 and above) lacking polar terminal groups result in High Yield; introduction of terminal polar groups leads to Low Yield,Rule 5: α-Amino acids with large aromatic side chains capable of π-stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions result in High Yield; smaller aromatic side chains result in Low Yield,Rule 6: Modifiers containing multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxylic acid produce a High Yield,Rule 7: Modifiers with aliphatic thiol groups near the carboxylic acid lead to High Yield; thiol groups on aromatic rings lead to Low Yield,Rule 8: Modifiers containing strong electron-withdrawing groups such as perfluoroalkyl chains result in Low Yield,Rule 9: Modifiers with polyether chains or flexible ether linkages attached to the carboxylic acid result in Low Yield,Rule 10: Modifiers with aldehyde groups on the aromatic ring adjacent to the carboxylic acid lead to Low Yield,Rule 11: Aromatic carboxylic acids with fused or extended conjugated ring systems result in High Yield,Rule 12: Modifiers possessing functional groups capable of coordinating to metal centers tend to result in High Yield,Rule 13: Modifiers that are amide-containing compounds or peptides with bulky or polar side chains tend to lead to Low Yield,Rule 14: Modifiers with aromatic rings substituted with electron-donating groups at the para position tend to result in Low Yield
