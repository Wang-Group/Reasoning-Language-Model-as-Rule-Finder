**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituents that are electron-withdrawing and capable of coordinating to metal centers**, such as amino (-NH₂) or nitro (-NO₂) groups, result in **High Yield**. These groups enhance the coordination with metal ions in the catalyst, improving its activity.

  Examples:
  - *4-aminobenzoic acid* (para-amino group)
  - *4-nitrobenzoic acid* (para-nitro group)

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituents that are electron-donating or non-coordinating**, such as methyl (-CH₃), thiol (-SH), or formyl (-CHO) groups, result in **Low Yield**. These groups reduce the coordinating ability of the carboxyl group or may hinder catalyst effectiveness.

  Examples:
  - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (para-methyl group)
  - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* (para-thiol group)
  - *4-formylbenzoic acid* (para-formyl group)

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with heteroatoms positioned to coordinate with metal centers**, such as nitrogen or oxygen in favorable positions, result in **High Yield**. The heteroatoms enhance binding to the metal catalyst through coordination bonds.

  Examples:
  - *pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (nicotinic acid)
  - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
  - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with additional carboxyl groups in the side chain**, such as aspartic acid and glutamic acid, result in **High Yield**. Multiple carboxyl groups provide additional coordination sites with the metal catalyst, enhancing its activity.

  Examples:
  - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (aspartic acid)
  - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (glutamic acid)

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms capable of coordination**, like the indole ring in tryptophan, lead to **High Yield**. The side chains offer additional coordination sites and π-π interactions with the catalyst.

  Example:
  - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (tryptophan)

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with non-coordinating or bulky side chains**, such as phenylalanine or N-acetylated amino acids, result in **Low Yield**. Lack of additional coordination sites or steric hindrance reduces catalyst effectiveness.

  Examples:
  - *(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (phenylalanine)
  - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-acetyl-L-lysine)

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length hydrocarbon chains (6–8 carbons) lacking additional polar functional groups** lead to **High Yield**. The hydrophobic chains may enhance substrate access to the catalyst without interfering with coordination.

  Example:
  - *octanoic acid*

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar functional groups (hydroxyl or amino) along the chain** result in **Low Yield**. These polar groups may form competing interactions or disrupt the catalyst structure.

  Examples:
  - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*
  - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
  - *8-aminooctanoic acid*

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group**, such as sugar acids, result in **High Yield**. The multiple hydroxyls enhance chelation with metal centers, stabilizing the catalyst.

  Example:
  - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (gluconic acid)

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **thiol groups near the carboxyl group on aliphatic chains** result in **High Yield**. Thiol groups strongly coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability.

  Example:
  - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with **perfluoroalkyl chains attached to the carboxyl group** result in **Low Yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect reduces the coordinating ability of the carboxyl group.

  Example:
  - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids connected via a flexible aliphatic linker (4–5 carbons) to another coordinating group or aromatic ring** result in **High Yield**. The flexible linker allows optimal orientation for effective coordination with the metal center.

  Examples:
  - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid*
  - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid*

  Conversely, modifiers with **shorter linkers (1–3 carbons)** result in **Low Yield** due to limited flexibility and suboptimal coordination.

  Example:
  - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **aldehyde groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** result in **Low Yield**. Aldehyde groups can interfere with metal coordination or participate in side reactions, reducing catalyst effectiveness.

  Examples:
  - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
  - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with **bulky ether chains or flexible polar functional groups in the aliphatic chain** result in **Low Yield**. Steric hindrance and increased polarity may disrupt effective coordination with the catalyst.

  Examples:
  - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
  - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids where heteroatoms are not favorably positioned or are sterically hindered** result in **Low Yield**. Ineffective coordination reduces catalyst activity.

  Example:
  - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*
