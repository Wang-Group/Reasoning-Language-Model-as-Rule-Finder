**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: *Aliphatic carboxylic acids with **straight-chain lengths of 5 to 8 carbons** and **no additional polar functional groups** tend to give a **high yield**. The presence of terminal polar groups like **hydroxyl** or **amino** groups reduces the yield.*
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* Octanoic acid
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Medium-chain aliphatic acids enhance hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst, promoting better substrate access. Terminal polar groups may interfere with these interactions or compete with the catalyst's active sites, leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are **alpha-amino dicarboxylic acids** (e.g., **aspartic acid** and **glutamic acid**) tend to give a **high yield** due to their ability to **chelate** effectively with metal centers.*
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* The combination of amino and carboxyl groups at adjacent positions allows for strong coordination with metal ions in the catalyst, enhancing stability and catalytic activity.

- **Rule 3**: *Aromatic carboxylic acids with **electron-withdrawing groups** at the **para position** tend to give a **high yield**, while those with **electron-donating groups** or **aldehyde groups** at the same position tend to give a **low yield**.*
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-formylbenzoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid and enhance its ability to coordinate with the metal catalyst. This improved coordination stabilizes the active site and enhances reactivity. Electron-donating groups reduce coordination efficiency, while aldehyde groups can engage in side reactions, lowering the yield.

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers containing **aliphatic thiol groups** tend to give a **high yield**, whereas those with **thiol groups attached to aromatic rings** tend to give a **low yield**.*
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Aliphatic thiol groups can form favorable interactions with the metal center without significant steric hindrance, enhancing catalytic activity. Aromatic thiol groups may introduce steric hindrance or engage in non-productive interactions that inhibit catalyst function.

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids** (having multiple hydroxyl groups) tend to give a **high yield**; those with only a **single hydroxyl group** far from the carboxylic acid tend to give a **low yield**.*
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and the ability to form hydrogen bonds with the catalyst, improving dispersion and catalytic activity. A single, distant hydroxyl group does not provide sufficient interaction to significantly affect the catalyst.

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers that are **amino acids with small, non-bulky side chains** or those capable of **π–π interactions** tend to give a **high yield**; those with **bulky or aromatic side chains** generally give a **low yield**, except for modifiers containing an **indole group**, which tend to give a **high yield**.*
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* 5-aminopentanoic acid, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine), (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Smaller side chains reduce steric hindrance, facilitating better interaction with the catalyst. Bulky or aromatic side chains can obstruct access to active sites. The indole group in tryptophan may engage in favorable π–π interactions, enhancing yield despite its size.

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms** in the ring tend to give a **high yield** due to effective coordination with the metal catalyst.*
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles can donate electron density to the metal center, enhancing catalyst stability and activity.

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers containing **aldehyde groups** attached to **aromatic rings** tend to give a **low yield** due to potential side reactions or catalyst deactivation.*
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Aldehyde groups are reactive and can form Schiff bases or condensations with amines or metal centers, possibly deactivating the catalyst or diverting the reaction pathway.

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers with **long flexible ether chains** near the carboxylic acid group tend to give a **low yield** due to steric hindrance and conformational flexibility.*
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Long, flexible chains can prevent effective interaction between the modifier and the catalyst’s active site by introducing steric bulk and reducing the likelihood of proper orientation for coordination.

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers containing **amide groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid** tend to give a **low yield** due to decreased coordination ability.*
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid, (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Amide groups are less effective at coordinating with metal centers due to resonance stabilization, and they may introduce steric hindrance that impedes catalyst-modifier interactions.

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers with **keto groups** adjacent to the carboxylic acid (**keto acids**) tend to give a **low yield** due to interference with catalyst activity.*
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 4-oxoheptanedioic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Ketone groups can chelate with metal centers or participate in side reactions, potentially deactivating the catalyst or altering its activity.

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers containing **fluorinated acyl groups** or **perfluorinated chains** tend to give a **low yield** due to decreased electron density for coordination and increased hydrophobicity.*
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid, 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Fluorinated groups are highly electronegative and reduce the electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening interactions with the metal catalyst. The steric bulk and hydrophobicity of such groups can hinder effective coordination.

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers with **phenolic hydroxyl groups** directly attached to aromatic rings tend to give a **low yield**; when the phenolic group is connected via a **flexible aliphatic chain**, they tend to give a **high yield**.*
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid, 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Flexible aliphatic chains can position the phenolic group favorably for interaction with the catalyst, enhancing yield. Direct attachment may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorable electronic effects.
