Rule 1: Aliphatic carboxylic acids with straight-chain lengths of 5 to 8 carbons and no additional polar functional groups tend to give a high yield. The presence of terminal polar groups like hydroxyl or amino groups reduces the yield.,Rule 2: Modifiers that are alpha-amino dicarboxylic acids tend to give a high yield due to their ability to chelate effectively with metal centers.,"Rule 3: Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position tend to give a high yield, while those with electron-donating groups or aldehyde groups at the same position tend to give a low yield.","Rule 4: Modifiers containing aliphatic thiol groups tend to give a high yield, whereas those with thiol groups attached to aromatic rings tend to give a low yield.",Rule 5: Modifiers that are polyhydroxy carboxylic acids (having multiple hydroxyl groups) tend to give a high yield; those with only a single hydroxyl group far from the carboxylic acid tend to give a low yield.,"Rule 6: Modifiers that are amino acids with small, non-bulky side chains or those capable of π–π interactions tend to give a high yield; those with bulky or aromatic side chains generally give a low yield, except for modifiers containing an indole group, which tend to give a high yield.",Rule 7: Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms in the ring tend to give a high yield due to effective coordination with the metal catalyst.,Rule 8: Modifiers containing aldehyde groups attached to aromatic rings tend to give a low yield due to potential side reactions or catalyst deactivation.,Rule 9: Modifiers with long flexible ether chains near the carboxylic acid group tend to give a low yield due to steric hindrance and conformational flexibility.,Rule 10: Modifiers containing amide groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid tend to give a low yield due to decreased coordination ability.,Rule 11: Modifiers with keto groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid (keto acids) tend to give a low yield due to interference with catalyst activity.,Rule 12: Modifiers containing fluorinated acyl groups or perfluorinated chains tend to give a low yield due to decreased electron density for coordination and increased hydrophobicity.,"Rule 13: Modifiers with phenolic hydroxyl groups directly attached to aromatic rings tend to give a low yield; when the phenolic group is connected via a flexible aliphatic chain, they tend to give a high yield."
