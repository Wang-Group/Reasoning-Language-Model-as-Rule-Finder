**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-withdrawing groups** (e.g., nitro, halogens) at the **para position** tend to give a **high yield**, while those with **electron-donating groups** (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxyl) at the same position tend to give a **low yield**.*
  - *Examples (High Yield):* 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid
  - *Examples (Low Yield):* 4-methylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Electron-withdrawing groups enhance the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxylic acid group with the metal catalyst, improving catalytic activity. Electron-donating groups increase electron density, reducing effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are **α-amino acids** with **acidic or polar side chains** (e.g., side-chain carboxylic acids, indole rings) tend to give a **high yield**, while those with **nonpolar side chains** tend to give a **low yield**.*
  - *Examples (High Yield):* (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid *(Aspartic acid)*, (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid *(Glutamic acid)*, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid *(Tryptophan)*
  - *Example (Low Yield):* (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid *(Phenylalanine)*
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Acidic or polar side chains offer additional sites for coordination with the metal catalyst, enhancing interaction and stability. Nonpolar side chains lack these coordinating groups, reducing their effectiveness.

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers containing **nitrogen heterocycles** directly attached to a **carboxylic acid group** or connected via a **short flexible aliphatic chain** tend to give a **high yield**, while those connected through a **rigid aromatic linker** tend to give a **low yield**.*
  - *Examples (High Yield):* Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid *(Nicotinic acid)*, 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Example (Low Yield):* 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles act as strong Lewis bases, coordinating effectively with metal centers. Flexible linkers allow better spatial alignment with the catalyst, enhancing interaction. Rigid linkers may hinder effective coordination due to steric constraints.

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** (with six or more carbons) **without additional polar functional groups** tend to give a **high yield**, whereas those with **terminal polar groups** (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) tend to give a **low yield**.*
  - *Example (High Yield):* Octanoic acid
  - *Examples (Low Yield):* 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Hydrophobic chains enhance interactions with the hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or substrate, improving yield. Terminal polar groups can introduce unfavorable interactions or alter solubility, diminishing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers containing **aliphatic thiol groups** (–SH) attached to **short chains** tend to give a **high yield**, while those with **aromatic thiol groups** tend to give a **low yield**.*
  - *Example (High Yield):* 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - *Example (Low Yield):* 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Aliphatic thiols can form strong coordination bonds with metal centers without significant steric hindrance. Aromatic thiols have sulfur atoms less accessible due to resonance stabilization and steric bulk, reducing their coordinating efficiency.

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers containing **aldehyde groups** attached to **aromatic rings** tend to give a **low yield**.*
  - *Examples (Low Yield):* 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Aldehyde groups are reactive and may form undesired adducts with catalyst components or interfere with the active site, leading to reduced catalytic activity.

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers with **amide bonds adjacent to the carboxylic acid group** tend to give a **low yield**.*
  - *Examples (Low Yield):* 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid, 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Amide groups can decrease the ability of the carboxylic acid to coordinate with the metal catalyst due to resonance stabilization and introduce steric hindrance, reducing overall efficacy.

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers containing **multiple hydroxyl groups** on an **aliphatic chain** (polyhydroxy carboxylic acids) tend to give a **high yield**.*
  - *Example (High Yield):* (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and the potential for hydrogen bonding, enhancing interaction with the catalyst and improving dispersion within the reaction mixture.

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **ether linkages** in the carbon chain tend to give a **low yield**.*
  - *Examples (Low Yield):* 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Ether linkages introduce flexibility and alter the spatial arrangement of functional groups, potentially reducing effective coordination with the catalyst. They may also decrease hydrophobic interactions necessary for optimal catalyst performance.

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers that are **fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids** tend to give a **low yield**.*
  - *Example (Low Yield):* 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Fluorination increases lipophilicity and may hinder interactions with the catalyst. The strong C–F bonds reduce the molecule's ability to participate in coordination or hydrogen bonding with the catalyst's active sites.

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers containing **ketone groups** within **aliphatic chains** (aliphatic keto acids) tend to give a **low yield**.*
  - *Example (Low Yield):* 4-oxoheptanedioic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Ketone groups can interfere with catalyst coordination by acting as competing ligands or participating in side reactions, thereby diminishing the effectiveness of the modifier.

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **ortho-hydroxyl groups** (such as salicylic acids) tend to give a **low yield**.*
  - *Example (Low Yield):* 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Ortho-hydroxyl groups can chelate metal ions, potentially deactivating the catalyst or forming stable complexes that reduce the availability of active catalytic sites.

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers with **flexible aliphatic linkers** between functional groups (e.g., carboxylic acid connected via an aliphatic chain to a heterocycle) tend to give a **high yield**, while those with **rigid aromatic linkers** tend to give a **low yield**.*
  - *Example (High Yield):* 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Example (Low Yield):* 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Flexible linkers allow for better spatial orientation and interaction with the catalyst's active sites, enhancing coordination effectiveness. Rigid linkers may restrict these interactions due to steric constraints.
