    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: *Aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 5 to 8 carbons and **no additional polar functional groups** tend to give high yield.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* Octanoic acid  
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Nonpolar aliphatic chains enhance hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst's active sites, promoting better substrate access and reactivity. Additional polar groups like amino or hydroxy can interfere with catalyst coordination or introduce steric hindrance, reducing yield.

- **Rule 2**: *Aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with an amino group at the **alpha (α)** position tend to give high yield.*  
  - *Example Modifiers:* (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (L-aspartic acid), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (L-glutamic acid)  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* The proximity of the amino group to the carboxyl groups allows for effective chelation with the metal center of the catalyst. This chelation stabilizes the metal ion, enhances catalyst efficiency, and promotes higher yields.

- **Rule 3**: *Aromatic carboxylic acids substituted at the **para position** with **strong electron-withdrawing groups** tend to give high yield; those with **electron-donating groups** or **aldehyde groups** at the same position tend to give low yield.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid  
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-formylbenzoic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing its ability to coordinate with the metal catalyst. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity, reducing coordination efficiency. Aldehyde groups may partake in side reactions or compete with carboxyl groups for catalyst binding.

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers containing **thiol groups** on **aliphatic chains** tend to give high yield; thiol groups attached to **aromatic rings** tend to give low yield.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid  
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Aliphatic thiol groups can form favorable interactions with the catalyst without significant steric hindrance, enhancing reactivity. Aromatic thiol groups may bind too strongly or introduce steric constraints, disrupting the catalyst's active site and lowering yield.

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers with **multiple hydroxyl groups** on an aliphatic chain (**polyhydroxy acids**) tend to give high yield; those with a single or remote hydroxyl group tend to give low yield.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (gluconic acid)  
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance solubility and the ability to form hydrogen bonds, improving catalyst dispersion and interaction. Single or remote hydroxyl groups may not contribute significantly to these effects and can introduce unfavorable steric or electronic factors.

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers containing **fluorinated alkyl chains** or **perfluoroalkyl groups** tend to give low yield.*  
  - *Example Modifiers:* 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid, 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Fluorination increases steric bulk and decreases the polarity and polarizability of the molecule. These factors hinder effective interaction and coordination with the catalyst's metal center, leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 7**: *Amino acids with **small, non-aromatic side chains** tend to give high yield; those with **bulky or aromatic side chains** tend to give low yield, except for those containing an **indole group** (e.g., tryptophan), which give high yield.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* 5-aminopentanoic acid, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (L-tryptophan)  
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (L-phenylalanine), (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Small side chains minimize steric hindrance, facilitating better access to the catalyst's active site. Bulky or aromatic side chains can obstruct this access. The indole group in tryptophan may engage in unique π–π or cation–π interactions with the catalyst, enhancing yield despite its bulk.

- **Rule 8**: *Heterocyclic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms in the ring **directly attached** to the carboxyl group tend to give high yield; those where the heterocycle is **conjugated** to an additional aromatic ring tend to give low yield.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (nicotinic acid), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid  
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles can coordinate with the metal catalyst, enhancing activity. Conjugation with additional aromatic rings can delocalize electron density and introduce steric hindrance, reducing coordination effectiveness.

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers with **aldehyde groups** attached to **aromatic rings** tend to give low yield.*  
  - *Example Modifiers:* 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Aldehyde groups can undergo side reactions or form competing interactions with the catalyst, interfering with the normal catalytic cycle and reducing yield.

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers with **bulky or flexible ether groups** near the carboxylic acid function tend to give low yield.*  
  - *Example Modifiers:* 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Bulky or flexible chains introduce steric hindrance and reduce the rigidity necessary for effective coordination with the catalyst. This can hinder binding to the active site and diminish catalytic activity.

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers capable of forming **strong chelating interactions** with the catalyst through multiple functional groups tend to give high yield.*  
  - *Example Modifiers:* (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Chelation stabilizes the metal center of the catalyst, enhancing its reactivity and selectivity. Multiple coordination points strengthen this interaction, leading to higher yields.

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers with **amide groups** attached to aliphatic chains tend to give low yield.*  
  - *Example Modifiers:* 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid, (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Amide groups can introduce additional steric hindrance and may compete with carboxyl groups for coordination with the catalyst. This competition can disrupt the optimal interaction between the modifier and the catalyst, reducing yield.

    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: *Aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of **5 to 8 carbons** and **no additional polar functional groups** tend to give **high yield**.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* Octanoic acid  
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Straight-chain aliphatic acids with medium chain lengths can enhance hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst's active sites, promoting better substrate access. The absence of additional polar groups prevents possible interference with catalyst coordination or unwanted side reactions, leading to higher yields.

- **Rule 2**: *Aliphatic **dicarboxylic acids** with an **alpha-amino group** tend to give **high yield**.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* The presence of both amino and carboxyl groups at adjacent positions allows for strong chelation with metal centers in the catalyst. This chelation stabilizes the active metal ion, enhancing catalytic efficiency and leading to higher yields.

- **Rule 3**: *Aromatic carboxylic acids with **electron-withdrawing groups** at the **para position** tend to give **high yield**; those with **electron-donating groups** or **aldehyde groups** at the same position tend to give **low yield**.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid  
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-formylbenzoic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with the metal catalyst. This improved coordination stabilizes the catalyst and enhances reactivity. In contrast, electron-donating groups decrease acidity and may reduce coordination efficiency, leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers containing **aliphatic thiol groups** tend to give **high yield**; in contrast, thiol groups attached to **aromatic rings** tend to give **low yield**.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid  
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Aliphatic thiol groups can form favorable interactions with the metal center without significant steric hindrance, enhancing catalytic activity. Aromatic thiol groups might engage in stronger, non-productive interactions or introduce steric constraints that interfere with catalyst function, resulting in lower yields.

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers with **multiple hydroxyl groups** (polyhydroxy acids) tend to give **high yield**; those with a single or distant hydroxyl group tend to give **low yield**.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)  
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance the solubility of the modifier and increase the number of possible hydrogen-bonding interactions with the catalyst, improving catalyst dispersion and activity. Single or remote hydroxyl groups do not provide the same level of interaction and may not significantly influence the catalyst's performance.

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers containing **perfluorinated alkyl chains** tend to give **low yield**.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Perfluorinated chains are highly electronegative and hydrophobic, which can decrease the affinity of the modifier for the catalyst. The strong C–F bonds and the bulky nature of fluorinated groups may hinder effective interaction with the catalyst's active site, leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 7**: *Amino acids with **small, non-aromatic side chains** tend to give **high yield**; those with **bulky or aromatic side chains** generally give **low yield**, except for those containing an **indole group**, which tend to give **high yield**.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* 5-aminopentanoic acid, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)  
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine), (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Smaller side chains reduce steric hindrance around the catalytic site, facilitating better interaction. Bulky or aromatic side chains can obstruct access to the active site. Tryptophan, with its indole group, may engage in favorable π–π stacking or cation–π interactions with the catalyst, enhancing yield despite its size.

- **Rule 8**: *Heterocyclic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms in the ring that are **directly bonded** to the carboxyl group tend to give **high yield**; those where the heterocycle is fused with additional rings or has extended conjugation tend to give **low yield**.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid  
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Nitrogen atoms adjacent to the carboxyl group can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity. Extended conjugation or additional fused rings may delocalize electron density and introduce steric hindrance, reducing the effectiveness of coordination.

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers with **aldehyde groups** attached to **aromatic rings** tend to give **low yield**.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Aldehyde groups are reactive and can participate in side reactions or form strong interactions with the catalyst that disrupt the catalytic cycle. This interference can decrease the availability of the active catalyst, leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers with **flexible ether chains** near the carboxylic acid group tend to give **low yield**.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Flexible ether chains can introduce conformational variability and steric hindrance, which may reduce the ability of the modifier to effectively interact with the catalyst's active site. This can hinder proper coordination and decrease catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers capable of forming **strong multidentate chelation** with the catalyst through multiple coordinating groups tend to give **high yield**.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Multidentate ligands can form several bonds with the metal center, greatly stabilizing the catalyst and enhancing its reactivity. This strong coordination ensures that the metal remains active throughout the reaction, leading to higher yields.

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers with **amide groups** attached to aliphatic chains tend to give **low yield**.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid, (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Amide groups can decrease the availability of lone pairs on nitrogen for coordination due to resonance stabilization, and they may also introduce steric hindrance. This can reduce the efficiency of catalyst-modifier interactions, leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers containing **phenolic hydroxyl groups** attached to aromatic rings tend to give **variable yields** depending on their overall structure; however, when the phenolic group is part of a larger, flexible molecule, they tend to give **high yield**.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid  
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Phenolic groups can participate in hydrogen bonding and π–π interactions. When attached to flexible aliphatic chains, they can enhance interactions with the catalyst without causing significant steric hindrance. In contrast, when the molecule is less flexible or too rigid, steric factors may reduce effective catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers with **sulfonyl groups** or **sulfonic acids** tend to give **low yield** due to potential over-coordination or deactivation of the catalyst.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* Compounds containing sulfonic acid groups (Not explicitly listed but inferred)  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Sulfonyl groups are strong electron-withdrawing groups and can bind tightly to metal centers, potentially deactivating the catalyst by over-coordination or blocking the active site.

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers that are **keto acids** (containing both ketone and carboxylic acid functional groups) tend to give **low yield** due to possible side reactions.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 4-oxoheptanedioic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Keto acids can undergo decarboxylation or participate in self-condensation reactions. Additionally, the ketone group may interact with the catalyst, interfering with its activity and leading to lower yields.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: *Aliphatic carboxylic acids with **straight-chain lengths of 5 to 8 carbons** and **no additional polar functional groups** tend to give a **high yield**. The presence of terminal polar groups like hydroxyl or amino groups reduces the yield.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* Octanoic acid  
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Medium-chain aliphatic acids can enhance hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst, promoting better substrate access and stabilization. Additional polar groups at terminal positions may interfere with these interactions or compete with the catalyst’s active sites, leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are **alpha-amino dicarboxylic acids** tend to give a **high yield** due to their ability to chelate with metal centers effectively.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* The combination of amino and carboxyl groups at adjacent positions allows for strong multidentate coordination with the metal ions in the catalyst, enhancing stability and catalytic activity, which leads to higher yields.

- **Rule 3**: *Aromatic carboxylic acids with **electron-withdrawing groups** at the **para position** tend to give a **high yield**, while those with **electron-donating groups** or **aldehyde groups** at the same position tend to give a **low yield**.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid  
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-formylbenzoic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing its ability to coordinate with the metal catalyst. This improved coordination stabilizes the active site and enhances reactivity. Electron-donating or reactive aldehyde groups can reduce coordination efficiency or participate in side reactions, lowering the yield.

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers containing **aliphatic thiol groups** tend to give a **high yield**, whereas those with **thiol groups attached to aromatic rings** tend to give a **low yield**.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid  
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Aliphatic thiol groups can form favorable interactions with the metal center without significant steric hindrance, enhancing catalytic activity. Thiol groups on aromatic rings may lead to steric hindrance or engage in non-productive interactions that inhibit catalyst function.

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids** (having multiple hydroxyl groups) tend to give a **high yield**; those with only a single hydroxyl group far from the carboxylic acid tend to give a **low yield**.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)  
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and the ability to form hydrogen bonds with the catalyst, improving dispersion and catalytic activity. Single, distant hydroxyl groups do not provide sufficient interaction to affect the catalyst significantly.

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers that are **perfluorinated carboxylic acids** tend to give a **low yield** due to their electronegativity and hydrophobicity.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Perfluorinated chains repel polar environments and may not interact effectively with the catalyst. Their strong C–F bonds and bulky nature can hinder proper coordination with the metal center, decreasing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 7**: *Amino acids with **small, non-bulky side chains** tend to give a **high yield**; those with **bulky or aromatic side chains** generally give a **low yield**, except for modifiers containing an **indole group**, which tend to give a **high yield**.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* 5-aminopentanoic acid, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)  
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine), (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Smaller side chains reduce steric hindrance, facilitating better interaction with the catalyst. Bulky or aromatic side chains can obstruct access to active sites. The indole group in tryptophan may engage in favorable interactions like π–π stacking, enhancing yield despite its size.

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms in the ring**, especially where the nitrogen is adjacent to the carboxyl group, tend to give a **high yield**. Extended conjugation or additional fused rings may lead to a **low yield**.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid  
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Heterocyclic nitrogen atoms can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and activity. However, extended conjugation or steric hindrance from larger ring systems can interfere with effective coordination.

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers with **aldehyde groups** attached to **aromatic rings** tend to give a **low yield** due to potential side reactions or catalyst deactivation.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Aldehyde groups are reactive and can form Schiff bases or condensations with amines or metal centers, possibly deactivating the catalyst or diverting the reaction pathway, resulting in lower yields.

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers with **flexible ether chains** near the carboxylic acid group tend to give a **low yield** because of steric hindrance and conformational flexibility.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Long, flexible chains can prevent effective interaction between the modifier and the catalyst’s active site by introducing steric bulk and reducing the likelihood of proper orientation for coordination.

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal amino or hydroxyl groups** tend to give a **low yield**.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Terminal polar groups may interact unfavorably with the catalyst or compete with the substrate for active sites, hindering the catalytic process and reducing yield.

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers containing **amide groups** adjacent to the carboxylic acid tend to give a **low yield** due to decreased coordination ability.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid, (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Amide groups are less effective at coordinating with metal centers due to resonance stabilization, and they may introduce steric hindrance that impedes catalyst-modifier interactions, thus lowering the yield.

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers with **ketone groups** adjacent to carboxyl groups (**keto acids**) tend to give a **low yield** due to interference with catalyst activity.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 4-oxoheptanedioic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Ketone groups can chelate with metal centers or participate in side reactions, potentially deactivating the catalyst or altering its activity, which leads to lower yields.

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers containing **phenolic hydroxyl groups** attached to aromatic rings give **variable yields**; however, when the phenolic group is part of a flexible aliphatic chain, they tend to give a **high yield**.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid  
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid, 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Flexible aliphatic chains can position the phenolic group favorably for interaction with the catalyst, enhancing yield. Without this flexibility, steric hindrance or improper orientation may reduce effective interaction, leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers with **fluorinated acyl groups** (e.g., trifluoroacetyl groups) tend to give a **low yield** due to decreased electron density for coordination.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Fluorinated groups are highly electronegative and reduce the electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening interactions with the metal catalyst. Additionally, the steric bulk of such groups can hinder effective coordination, resulting in lower yields.

    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: *Aliphatic carboxylic acids with **straight-chain lengths of 5 to 8 carbons** and **no additional polar functional groups** tend to give a **high yield**. The presence of terminal polar groups like **hydroxyl** or **amino** groups reduces the yield.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* Octanoic acid  
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Medium-chain aliphatic acids enhance hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst, promoting better substrate access and stabilization. Terminal polar groups may interfere with these interactions or compete with the catalyst's active sites, leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are **alpha-amino dicarboxylic acids** tend to give a **high yield** due to their ability to **chelate** with metal centers effectively.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* The combination of amino and carboxyl groups at adjacent positions allows for strong multidentate coordination with metal ions in the catalyst, enhancing stability and catalytic activity, leading to higher yields.

- **Rule 3**: *Aromatic carboxylic acids with **electron-withdrawing groups** at the **para position** tend to give a **high yield**, while those with **electron-donating groups** or **aldehyde groups** at the same position tend to give a **low yield**.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid  
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-formylbenzoic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid and enhance its ability to coordinate with the metal catalyst. This improved coordination stabilizes the active site and enhances reactivity. Electron-donating groups reduce coordination efficiency, while aldehyde groups can participate in side reactions, lowering the yield.

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers containing **aliphatic thiol groups** tend to give a **high yield**, whereas those with **thiol groups attached to aromatic rings** tend to give a **low yield**.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid  
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Aliphatic thiol groups can form favorable interactions with the metal center without significant steric hindrance, enhancing catalytic activity. Thiol groups on aromatic rings may lead to steric hindrance or engage in non-productive interactions that inhibit catalyst function.

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids** (having multiple hydroxyl groups) tend to give a **high yield**; those with only a **single hydroxyl group** far from the carboxylic acid tend to give a **low yield**.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)  
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and the ability to form hydrogen bonds with the catalyst, improving dispersion and catalytic activity. Single, distant hydroxyl groups do not provide sufficient interaction to affect the catalyst significantly.

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers that are **amino acids with small, non-bulky side chains** tend to give a **high yield**; those with **bulky or aromatic side chains** generally give a **low yield**, except for modifiers containing an **indole group**, which tend to give a **high yield**.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* 5-aminopentanoic acid, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)  
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine), (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Smaller side chains reduce steric hindrance, facilitating better interaction with the catalyst. Bulky or aromatic side chains can obstruct access to active sites. The indole group in tryptophan may engage in favorable interactions like π–π stacking, enhancing yield despite its size.

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms in the ring**, especially where the nitrogen is adjacent to the carboxyl group, tend to give a **high yield**; those with extended conjugation or fused rings may give a **low yield**.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid  
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Heterocyclic nitrogen atoms can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and activity. However, extended conjugation or steric hindrance from larger ring systems can interfere with effective coordination.

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers containing **aldehyde groups** attached to **aromatic rings** tend to give a **low yield** due to potential side reactions or catalyst deactivation.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Aldehyde groups are reactive and can form Schiff bases or condensations with amines or metal centers, possibly deactivating the catalyst or diverting the reaction pathway, resulting in lower yields.

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers with **long flexible ether chains** near the carboxylic acid group tend to give a **low yield** due to steric hindrance and conformational flexibility.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Long, flexible chains can prevent effective interaction between the modifier and the catalyst’s active site by introducing steric bulk and reducing the likelihood of proper orientation for coordination.

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers containing **amide groups** adjacent to the carboxylic acid tend to give a **low yield** due to decreased coordination ability.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid, (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Amide groups are less effective at coordinating with metal centers due to resonance stabilization, and they may introduce steric hindrance that impedes catalyst-modifier interactions, thus lowering the yield.

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers with **ketone groups** adjacent to carboxylic acids (**keto acids**) tend to give a **low yield** due to interference with catalyst activity.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 4-oxoheptanedioic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Ketone groups can chelate with metal centers or participate in side reactions, potentially deactivating the catalyst or altering its activity, which leads to lower yields.

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers containing **fluorinated acyl groups** or **perfluorinated chains** tend to give a **low yield** due to decreased electron density for coordination and increased hydrophobicity.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid, 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Fluorinated groups are highly electronegative and reduce the electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening interactions with the metal catalyst. Additionally, the steric bulk and hydrophobicity of such groups can hinder effective coordination, resulting in lower yields.

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers with **phenolic hydroxyl groups** directly attached to aromatic rings often give a **low yield**; however, when the phenolic group is connected via a **flexible aliphatic chain**, they tend to give a **high yield**.*  
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid  
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid, 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid  
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Flexible aliphatic chains can position the phenolic group favorably for interaction with the catalyst, enhancing yield. When the phenolic group is directly attached to the aromatic ring of the carboxylic acid, steric hindrance or unfavorable orientation may reduce effective interaction, leading to lower yields.

  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and the ability to form hydrogen bonds with the catalyst, improving dispersion and catalytic activity. A single, distant hydroxyl group does not provide sufficient interaction to significantly affect the catalyst.

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers that are **amino acids with small, non-bulky side chains** or those capable of **π–π interactions** tend to give a **high yield**; those with **bulky or aromatic side chains** generally give a **low yield**, except for modifiers containing an **indole group**, which tend to give a **high yield**.*
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* 5-aminopentanoic acid, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine), (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Smaller side chains reduce steric hindrance, facilitating better interaction with the catalyst. Bulky or aromatic side chains can obstruct access to active sites. The indole group in tryptophan may engage in favorable π–π interactions, enhancing yield despite its size.

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms** in the ring tend to give a **high yield** due to effective coordination with the metal catalyst.*
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles can donate electron density to the metal center, enhancing catalyst stability and activity.

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers containing **aldehyde groups** attached to **aromatic rings** tend to give a **low yield** due to potential side reactions or catalyst deactivation.*
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Aldehyde groups are reactive and can form Schiff bases or condensations with amines or metal centers, possibly deactivating the catalyst or diverting the reaction pathway.

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers with **long flexible ether chains** near the carboxylic acid group tend to give a **low yield** due to steric hindrance and conformational flexibility.*
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Long, flexible chains can prevent effective interaction between the modifier and the catalyst’s active site by introducing steric bulk and reducing the likelihood of proper orientation for coordination.

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers containing **amide groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid** tend to give a **low yield** due to decreased coordination ability.*
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid, (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Amide groups are less effective at coordinating with metal centers due to resonance stabilization, and they may introduce steric hindrance that impedes catalyst-modifier interactions.

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers with **keto groups** adjacent to the carboxylic acid (**keto acids**) tend to give a **low yield** due to interference with catalyst activity.*
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 4-oxoheptanedioic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Ketone groups can chelate with metal centers or participate in side reactions, potentially deactivating the catalyst or altering its activity.

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers containing **fluorinated acyl groups** or **perfluorinated chains** tend to give a **low yield** due to decreased electron density for coordination and increased hydrophobicity.*
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid, 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Fluorinated groups are highly electronegative and reduce the electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening interactions with the metal catalyst. The steric bulk and hydrophobicity of such groups can hinder effective coordination.

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers with **phenolic hydroxyl groups** directly attached to aromatic rings tend to give a **low yield**; when the phenolic group is connected via a **flexible aliphatic chain**, they tend to give a **high yield**.*
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid, 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Flexible aliphatic chains can position the phenolic group favorably for interaction with the catalyst, enhancing yield. Direct attachment may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorable electronic effects.

    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are **alpha-amino dicarboxylic acids** (amino acids with two carboxylic acid groups) tend to give a **high yield**.*
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* The presence of both amino and two carboxyl groups allows for effective chelation with metal centers in the catalyst, enhancing stability and catalytic activity.

- **Rule 2**: *Aromatic carboxylic acids with **electron-withdrawing groups** at the **para position** tend to give a **high yield**, while those with **electron-donating groups** or **aldehyde groups** at the same position tend to give a **low yield**.*
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-formylbenzoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxylic acid with the metal catalyst. Electron-donating groups decrease this ability, and aldehyde groups may participate in side reactions that deactivate the catalyst.

- **Rule 3**: *Aliphatic carboxylic acids with a **straight chain of 8 carbons** (like octanoic acid) tend to give a **high yield**. Introducing **terminal polar groups** (e.g., hydroxyl or amino) on chains longer than 5 carbons leads to a **low yield**.*
  - *Example Modifier (High Yield):* Octanoic acid
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Long hydrophobic chains enhance interactions with the catalyst's active site. Terminal polar groups can interfere with these interactions or alter solubility, reducing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids** (having multiple hydroxyl groups) tend to give a **high yield**; those with a **single hydroxyl group** far from the carboxyl group tend to give a **low yield**.*
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid), 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid
  - *Example Modifier (Low Yield):* 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and the ability to form hydrogen bonds with the catalyst, enhancing dispersion and reactivity. A single remote hydroxyl group offers limited interaction.

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms** in the ring tend to give a **high yield**, especially when the ring is directly attached to the carboxyl group or connected via a short chain.*
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid), 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Example Modifier (Low Yield):* 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles coordinate effectively with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance. Direct attachment optimizes this interaction, while additional aromatic rings may introduce steric hindrance or electronic effects that reduce yield.

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers that are **amino acids with small side chains** or **heteroatom-containing side chains** (e.g., indole group) tend to give a **high yield**; those with **bulky hydrophobic side chains** generally give a **low yield**.*
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan), 5-aminopentanoic acid
  - *Example Modifier (Low Yield):* (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Small or heteroatom-rich side chains reduce steric hindrance and facilitate coordination with the catalyst. Bulky hydrophobic side chains without coordinating groups may block active sites or decrease solubility, lowering yield.

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers containing **aliphatic thiol groups** tend to give a **high yield**, whereas those with **aromatic thiol groups** tend to give a **low yield**.*
  - *Example Modifier (High Yield):* 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - *Example Modifier (Low Yield):* 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Aliphatic thiols can form strong, favorable interactions with the metal catalyst without significant steric hindrance. Aromatic thiols may have less effective overlap and can introduce steric or electronic issues.

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers containing **aldehyde groups** attached to **aromatic rings** tend to give a **low yield** due to potential side reactions or catalyst deactivation.*
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Aldehyde groups are reactive and may form unwanted adducts or interfere with the catalyst's active site, reducing efficiency.

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers with **perfluorinated chains** or **fluorinated acyl groups** tend to give a **low yield** due to decreased electron density for coordination and increased hydrophobicity.*
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid, 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Highly electronegative fluorine atoms withdraw electron density, weakening interactions with the metal catalyst. Their hydrophobic nature may also reduce solubility and accessibility.

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers containing **amide groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid** tend to give a **low yield** due to decreased coordination ability and potential steric hindrance.*
  - *Example Modifiers (Low Yield):* 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid, (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Amide groups are less effective ligands due to resonance stabilization, and they may introduce steric bulk that impedes optimal interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers with **long flexible ether chains** near the carboxylic acid group tend to give a **low yield** due to steric hindrance and conformational flexibility.*
  - *Example Modifier (Low Yield):* 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Flexible ether chains can adopt conformations that hinder effective coordination with the catalyst, reducing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers where an **aromatic ring** is connected to the carboxylic acid via a **flexible aliphatic chain** tend to give a **high yield**, especially if the ring contains **electron-donating groups** like methoxy or hydroxy groups.*
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid
  - *Example Modifier (Low Yield):* 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* The flexible chain allows the aromatic ring to interact favorably without causing steric hindrance. Electron-donating groups enhance interactions through increased electron density. Shorter chains may not provide sufficient flexibility, leading to lower yields.

  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid *(Aspartic acid)*, (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid *(Glutamic acid)*, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid *(Tryptophan)*
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Additional carboxyl groups or nitrogen heterocycles enhance coordination with metal centers in the catalyst, improving stability and catalytic activity.

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-withdrawing groups** (e.g., nitro, halogens) at the **para position** tend to give a **high yield**, while those with **electron-donating groups** (e.g., methyl, methoxy) at the same position tend to give a **low yield**.*
  - *Example Modifiers (High Yield):* 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid
  - *Example Modifier (Low Yield):* 4-methylbenzoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxylic acid with the metal catalyst, enhancing interaction. Electron-donating groups decrease this ability.

    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-withdrawing groups** (e.g., nitro, halogens) at the **para position** tend to give a **high yield**, while those with **electron-donating groups** (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxyl) at the same position tend to give a **low yield**.*
  - *Examples (High Yield):* 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid
  - *Examples (Low Yield):* 4-methylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Electron-withdrawing groups enhance the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxylic acid group with the metal catalyst, improving catalytic activity. Electron-donating groups decrease this ability by increasing electron density, reducing effective interaction.

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are **α-amino acids** with **acidic or polar side chains** (e.g., side-chain carboxylic acids, indole rings) tend to give a **high yield**, while those with **nonpolar aromatic side chains** tend to give a **low yield**.*
  - *Examples (High Yield):* (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid *(Aspartic acid)*, (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid *(Glutamic acid)*, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid *(Tryptophan)*
  - *Example (Low Yield):* (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid *(Phenylalanine)*
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Acidic or polar side chains offer additional sites for coordination with the metal catalyst, enhancing interaction and stability. Nonpolar side chains lack these coordinating groups, reducing their effectiveness.

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers containing **nitrogen heterocycles** directly attached to a **carboxylic acid group** or connected via a **short aliphatic chain** tend to give a **high yield**.*
  - *Examples (High Yield):* Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid *(Nicotinic acid)*, 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles act as strong Lewis bases, coordinating effectively with metal centers in the catalyst, thus enhancing catalytic performance.

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** (with six or more carbons) and **no additional functional groups** tend to give a **high yield**, whereas those with **terminal polar groups** (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) tend to give a **low yield**.*
  - *Example (High Yield):* Octanoic acid
  - *Examples (Low Yield):* 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Long hydrophobic chains without polar interruptions can enhance hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst's active site or improve substrate accessibility. Terminal polar groups can introduce unfavorable interactions or alter solubility, diminishing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers containing **aliphatic thiol groups** (–SH) attached to short chains tend to give a **high yield**, while those with **aromatic thiol groups** tend to give a **low yield**.*
  - *Example (High Yield):* 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - *Example (Low Yield):* 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Aliphatic thiols can form strong coordination bonds with metal centers without significant steric hindrance. Aromatic thiols have less accessible sulfur atoms due to resonance stabilization and potential steric bulk, reducing their coordinating efficiency.

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers containing **aldehyde groups** attached to **aromatic rings** tend to give a **low yield**.*
  - *Examples (Low Yield):* 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Aldehyde groups are highly reactive and may form undesired adducts with catalyst components or interfere with the active site, leading to reduced catalytic activity.

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers with **amide bonds adjacent to the carboxylic acid group** tend to give a **low yield**.*
  - *Example (Low Yield):* 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid, 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Amide groups can decrease the ability of the carboxylic acid to coordinate with the metal catalyst due to resonance stabilization and can introduce steric hindrance, reducing overall efficacy.

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers containing **multiple hydroxyl groups** on an **aliphatic chain** (polyhydroxy carboxylic acids) tend to give a **high yield**.*
  - *Example (High Yield):* (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid *(Gluconic acid)*
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and the potential for hydrogen bonding, enhancing interaction with the catalyst and improving dispersion within the reaction mixture.

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **ether linkages** in the carbon chain tend to give a **low yield**.*
  - *Example (Low Yield):* 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Ether linkages can introduce flexibility and alter the spatial arrangement of functional groups, potentially reducing effective coordination with the catalyst. They may also decrease hydrophobic interactions necessary for optimal catalyst performance.

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers that are **fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids** tend to give a **low yield**.*
  - *Example (Low Yield):* 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Fluorination increases lipophilicity and may hinder interactions with the catalyst. The strong C–F bonds reduce the ability of the molecule to participate in coordination or hydrogen bonding with the catalyst's active sites.

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers containing **ketone groups** within **aliphatic chains** (aliphatic keto acids) tend to give a **low yield**.*
  - *Example (Low Yield):* 4-oxoheptanedioic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Ketone groups can interfere with catalyst coordination by acting as competing ligands or participating in side reactions, thereby diminishing the effectiveness of the modifier.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-withdrawing groups** (e.g., nitro, halogens) at the **para position** tend to give a **high yield**, while those with **electron-donating groups** (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxyl) at the same position tend to give a **low yield**.*
  - *Examples (High Yield):* 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid
  - *Examples (Low Yield):* 4-methylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Electron-withdrawing groups enhance the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxylic acid group with the metal catalyst, improving catalytic activity. Electron-donating groups increase electron density, reducing effective interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are **α-amino acids** with **acidic or polar side chains** (e.g., side-chain carboxylic acids, indole rings) tend to give a **high yield**, while those with **nonpolar side chains** tend to give a **low yield**.*
  - *Examples (High Yield):* (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid *(Aspartic acid)*, (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid *(Glutamic acid)*, (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid *(Tryptophan)*
  - *Example (Low Yield):* (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid *(Phenylalanine)*
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Acidic or polar side chains offer additional sites for coordination with the metal catalyst, enhancing interaction and stability. Nonpolar side chains lack these coordinating groups, reducing their effectiveness.

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers containing **nitrogen heterocycles** directly attached to a **carboxylic acid group** or connected via a **short flexible aliphatic chain** tend to give a **high yield**, while those connected through a **rigid aromatic linker** tend to give a **low yield**.*
  - *Examples (High Yield):* Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid *(Nicotinic acid)*, 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Example (Low Yield):* 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles act as strong Lewis bases, coordinating effectively with metal centers. Flexible linkers allow better spatial alignment with the catalyst, enhancing interaction. Rigid linkers may hinder effective coordination due to steric constraints.

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** (with six or more carbons) **without additional polar functional groups** tend to give a **high yield**, whereas those with **terminal polar groups** (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) tend to give a **low yield**.*
  - *Example (High Yield):* Octanoic acid
  - *Examples (Low Yield):* 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Hydrophobic chains enhance interactions with the hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or substrate, improving yield. Terminal polar groups can introduce unfavorable interactions or alter solubility, diminishing catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers containing **aliphatic thiol groups** (–SH) attached to **short chains** tend to give a **high yield**, while those with **aromatic thiol groups** tend to give a **low yield**.*
  - *Example (High Yield):* 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - *Example (Low Yield):* 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Aliphatic thiols can form strong coordination bonds with metal centers without significant steric hindrance. Aromatic thiols have sulfur atoms less accessible due to resonance stabilization and steric bulk, reducing their coordinating efficiency.

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers containing **aldehyde groups** attached to **aromatic rings** tend to give a **low yield**.*
  - *Examples (Low Yield):* 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Aldehyde groups are reactive and may form undesired adducts with catalyst components or interfere with the active site, leading to reduced catalytic activity.

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers with **amide bonds adjacent to the carboxylic acid group** tend to give a **low yield**.*
  - *Examples (Low Yield):* 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid, 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Amide groups can decrease the ability of the carboxylic acid to coordinate with the metal catalyst due to resonance stabilization and introduce steric hindrance, reducing overall efficacy.

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers containing **multiple hydroxyl groups** on an **aliphatic chain** (polyhydroxy carboxylic acids) tend to give a **high yield**.*
  - *Example (High Yield):* (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and the potential for hydrogen bonding, enhancing interaction with the catalyst and improving dispersion within the reaction mixture.

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **ether linkages** in the carbon chain tend to give a **low yield**.*
  - *Examples (Low Yield):* 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Ether linkages introduce flexibility and alter the spatial arrangement of functional groups, potentially reducing effective coordination with the catalyst. They may also decrease hydrophobic interactions necessary for optimal catalyst performance.

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers that are **fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids** tend to give a **low yield**.*
  - *Example (Low Yield):* 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Fluorination increases lipophilicity and may hinder interactions with the catalyst. The strong C–F bonds reduce the molecule's ability to participate in coordination or hydrogen bonding with the catalyst's active sites.

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers containing **ketone groups** within **aliphatic chains** (aliphatic keto acids) tend to give a **low yield**.*
  - *Example (Low Yield):* 4-oxoheptanedioic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Ketone groups can interfere with catalyst coordination by acting as competing ligands or participating in side reactions, thereby diminishing the effectiveness of the modifier.

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **ortho-hydroxyl groups** (such as salicylic acids) tend to give a **low yield**.*
  - *Example (Low Yield):* 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Ortho-hydroxyl groups can chelate metal ions, potentially deactivating the catalyst or forming stable complexes that reduce the availability of active catalytic sites.

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers with **flexible aliphatic linkers** between functional groups (e.g., carboxylic acid connected via an aliphatic chain to a heterocycle) tend to give a **high yield**, while those with **rigid aromatic linkers** tend to give a **low yield**.*
  - *Example (High Yield):* 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Example (Low Yield):* 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid
  - *Underlying Reasoning:* Flexible linkers allow for better spatial orientation and interaction with the catalyst's active sites, enhancing coordination effectiveness. Rigid linkers may restrict these interactions due to steric constraints.
