"Rule 1: Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxylic acid groups (dicarboxylic amino acids), such as L-glutamic acid and L-aspartic acid, yield high value.","Rule 2: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position, like nitro or bromomethyl groups (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid), yield high value.","Rule 3: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with amino groups at the para position (para-aminobenzoic acids), such as 4-aminobenzoic acid, yield high value.","Rule 4: Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing heterocycles with carboxylic acid groups directly attached to the ring, such as pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, yield high value.","Rule 5: Modifiers that are amino acids with nitrogen-rich heteroaromatic side chains, such as L-tryptophan, yield high value.","Rule 6: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with 3 to 5 carbons containing amino or thiol groups, like 5-aminopentanoic acid and 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid, yield high value.","Rule 7: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains leading to a carboxylic acid, such as D-gluconic acid, yield high value.","Rule 8: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids where the carboxylic acid is connected via an aliphatic chain longer than three carbons to an aromatic ring substituted with electron-donating groups (e.g., hydroxy, methoxy), such as 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, yield high value.","Rule 9: Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups attached to aromatic rings, such as 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid, yield low value.","Rule 10: Modifiers containing polyether chains or multiple ether linkages, such as 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, yield low value.","Rule 11: Modifiers with long aliphatic chains (longer than six carbons) terminated with amino or hydroxy groups, like 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, and 8-aminooctanoic acid, yield low value.","Rule 12: Modifiers that are amino acids with hydrophobic side chains containing long alkyl or aromatic groups, such as L-phenylalanine and methionine derivatives, yield low value.","Rule 13: Modifiers containing fluorinated alkyl chains, such as 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid, yield low value.","Rule 14: Modifiers containing amide linkages attached to aromatic rings, like 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid, yield low value.","Rule 15: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with electron-donating groups at the para position, such as methyl or hydroxy groups, where the aromatic ring is directly attached to the carboxylic acid (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid), yield low value."
