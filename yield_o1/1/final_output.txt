    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position result in high yield.**
  - *Explanation*: Electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro (-NO₂) or bromomethyl (-CH₂Br) increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing its ability to coordinate with the metal center of the catalyst.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (High yield)
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (High yield)
  - *Counter Examples*:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Low yield) *(Methyl is electron-donating)*
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Low yield) *(Formyl group can be electron-withdrawing but may engage in side reactions)*

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position result in low yield.**
  - *Explanation*: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, reducing its coordination ability with the catalyst's metal center.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Low yield)
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Low yield)
  - *Counter Examples*:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (High yield) *(Amino group is electron-donating but can form additional interactions with the catalyst)*

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with unbranched chains of 7 or 8 carbons and no additional functional groups result in high yield.**
  - *Explanation*: Medium-chain fatty acids have optimal hydrophobicity to interact effectively with the hydrophobic regions of the catalyst.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **Octanoic acid** (High yield)
  - *Counter Examples*:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Low yield) *(Hydroxyl group introduces polarity)*
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Low yield) *(Amino group affects interaction due to its basicity)*

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are short-chain (five carbons or fewer) amino acids result in high yield.**
  - *Explanation*: Short-chain amino acids can coordinate effectively with the catalyst without causing steric hindrance or aggregation.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (High yield)
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (High yield)
  - *Counter Examples*:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Low yield) *(Longer chain and acetamido group reduce effectiveness)*

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with pyridine rings directly attached to the carboxylic acid group result in high yield.**
  - *Explanation*: The lone pair on the pyridine nitrogen can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst-modifier interactions.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (High yield)
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (High yield)
  - *Counter Examples*:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Low yield) *(Pyridine ring is not directly connected to the carboxyl group)*

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are perfluorinated alkyl carboxylic acids result in low yield.**
  - *Explanation*: Perfluorination increases hydrophobicity and decreases solubility, hindering effective interaction with the catalyst.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Low yield)
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** (Low yield)

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with thiol groups on short aliphatic chains result in high yield.**
  - *Explanation*: Thiol groups can form strong bonds with metal centers, stabilizing the catalyst.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (High yield)
  - *Counter Examples*:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Low yield) *(Aromatic thiol may not interact effectively due to steric factors)*

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with terminal hydroxyl groups on long aliphatic chains (seven carbons or more) result in low yield.**
  - *Explanation*: Terminal hydroxyl groups increase polarity, which can disrupt hydrophobic interactions necessary for effective catalysis.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Low yield)

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing indole rings result in high yield.**
  - *Explanation*: Indole rings can engage in π-π stacking and coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (High yield)

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with acylated amino groups result in low yield.**

  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Low yield)
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (Low yield)

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with methoxy-substituted aromatic ketones linked to carboxylic acids result in high yield.**
  - *Explanation*: Methoxy groups and ketones can modulate electronic properties, enhancing interactions with the catalyst.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (High yield)

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups result in low yield.**
  - *Explanation*: Aldehyde groups are prone to side reactions, decreasing the modifier's availability for catalyst interaction.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Low yield)
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Low yield)

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with amino groups at the para position result in high yield.**
  - *Explanation*: Amino groups can enhance hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (High yield)

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains result in variable yield depending on the side chain's ability to interact with the catalyst.**
  - *Explanation*: Bulky side chains can offer beneficial π-π interactions or cause steric hindrance.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Low yield) *(Phenylalanine derivative may cause steric hindrance)*
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (High yield) *(Tryptophan derivative provides beneficial interactions)*

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (polyhydroxy compounds) result in high yield.**
  - *Explanation*: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and the potential for hydrogen bonding with the catalyst.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (High yield)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (High yield)

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

**Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with **para-substituted functional groups capable of metal coordination** (such as amino, hydroxyl, or nitro groups) result in **high yield**.**

- **Explanation**: Functional groups with lone pairs (e.g., -NH₂, -OH, -NO₂) at the para position can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalyst performance.

- **Supporting Examples**:

  - **High Yield**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** *(True)*: Amino group at para position provides coordination.
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(True)*: Nitro group can coordinate via oxygen atoms.

  - **Low Yield**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(False)*: Methyl group lacks coordination ability.
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)*: Aldehyde group may engage in side reactions and is less effective in coordination.

---

**Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms in the ring, capable of coordinating with metals, result in **high yield**.**

- **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings act as coordination sites, enhancing interaction with the metal catalyst.

- **Supporting Examples**:

  - **High Yield**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(True)*: Nitrogen in ring coordinates effectively.
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)*: Carbonyl and ring nitrogen both contribute to coordination.
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)*: Nitrogen-rich ring enhances coordination.

  - **Low Yield**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(False)*: Steric hindrance or less accessible nitrogen may reduce coordination.

  - **Counterexample**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** *(True)*: Aliphatic linker reduces steric hindrance, allowing effective coordination.

---

**Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic amino acids with free primary amino groups and chain lengths of **3 to 5 carbons** result in **high yield** due to effective coordination and optimal chain length.**

- **Explanation**: Free amino groups coordinate with metal centers, and appropriate chain length positions the amino group favorably.

- **Supporting Examples**:

  - **High Yield**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)** *(True)*: Amino and carboxyl groups enhance coordination.
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid** *(True)*: Primary amino group and suitable chain length facilitate coordination.

  - **Low Yield**:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(False)*: Longer chain reduces coordination efficiency.
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(False)*: Excessive chain length hinders effective interaction.

---

**Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with **multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group** result in **high yield** due to enhanced coordination capabilities.**

- **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites and increase solubility, strengthening interaction with the catalyst.

- **Supporting Examples**:

  - **High Yield**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)** *(True)*: Multiple hydroxyls near the acid group enhance coordination.
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** *(True)*: Hydroxyl-rich structure supports strong coordination.

  - **Low Yield**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(False)*: Single hydroxyl group distant from carboxyl group is less effective.

**End of Rules**

---

These rules illustrate the relationships between specific combinations of functional groups in the molecular modifiers and the resulting yields of the reaction. By combining multiple sub-structures and considering underlying physicochemical properties such as coordination ability, steric effects, hydrophobic interactions, and potential side reactions, these rules provide clear predictions for whether a modifier will result in a high or low yield.

The rules prioritize broader coverage of the dataset while maintaining a balance between simplicity and complexity. By applying these rules, researchers can better understand how different molecular modifiers influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. This understanding can guide the selection or design of new modifiers to optimize and control reaction outcomes.---------------------------------------------------------------

These rules illustrate the relationships between specific combinations of functional groups in the molecular modifiers and the resulting yields of the reaction. By considering combinations of sub-structures and underlying physicochemical properties such as coordination ability, steric effects, hydrophobic interactions, and potential side reactions, these rules provide clear predictions for whether a modifier will result in a high or low yield.

The rules prioritize broader coverage of the dataset while maintaining a balance between simplicity and complexity. By applying these rules, researchers can better understand how different molecular modifiers influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. This understanding can guide the selection or design of new modifiers to optimize and control reaction outcomes.---------------------------------------------------------------

---

**Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with **aldehyde or formyl groups** result in a **low yield** due to potential side reactions and decreased coordination efficiency.**

- **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups are reactive and can participate in side reactions; their electron-withdrawing nature reduces electron density required for effective metal coordination.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)*: Susceptible to side reactions, poor metal binding.
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** *(False)*: Aldehyde reduces coordination potential despite hydroxyl group.
  - **High Yield**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** *(True)*: Amino group enhances coordination without side reactions.

---

**Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with **bulky aromatic side chains lacking additional coordinating groups** result in a **low yield** due to steric hindrance.**

- **Explanation**: Bulky side chains can impede the approach of the modifier to the metal center, reducing coordination efficiency.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)** *(False)*: Steric bulk of phenyl group hinders coordination.
  - **High Yield**:

---

**Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic amino acids with **chain lengths greater than five carbons** result in a **low yield** due to decreased chelation efficiency.**

- **Explanation**: Longer chains reduce the ability of amino and carboxyl groups to simultaneously coordinate with the metal center due to increased flexibility.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(False)*: Chain too long for effective bidentate coordination.
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(False)*: Excessive length hinders simultaneous metal binding.
  - **High Yield**:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid** *(True)*: Optimal length for bidentate metal coordination.

---

**Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing **electron-rich aromatic systems with additional coordinating hydroxyl groups** result in a **high yield** due to enhanced metal interaction.**

- **Explanation**: Phenolic hydroxyl groups increase electron density and provide additional coordination sites, strengthening metal-ligand interactions.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** *(True)*: Hydroxyl group and aromatic ring facilitate strong coordination.
  - **Low Yield**:

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** *(False)*: Ketone group limits chelation geometry.
  - **High Yield**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)** *(True)*: Flexible structure allows for effective bidentate coordination.

---

**Rule 15**: **Modifiers with **fused aromatic systems containing carbonyl groups** without accessible coordinating atoms result in a **low yield** due to poor alignment for coordination.**

- **Explanation**: Fused ring systems may restrict the availability and orientation of coordinating atoms necessary for effective metal interaction.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** *(False)*: Rigid structure limits coordination potential.
  - **High Yield**:
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)*: Ring nitrogen is accessible for metal coordination.

These rules have been thoughtfully developed by analyzing the dataset and considering the underlying physicochemical properties of the molecular modifiers. Each rule combines multiple functional groups and structural features to predict the impact on the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

**Key considerations in the rules include**:

- **Metal Coordination**: Functional groups like amino, nitro, hydroxyl, thiol, and heterocyclic nitrogen enhance the ability of modifiers to coordinate with metal centers, improving catalyst performance.

- **Chain Length and Flexibility**: Optimal chain lengths (≤5 carbons) and appropriate flexibility facilitate effective coordination geometry, while excessive flexibility or rigidity can hinder interaction.

- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-donating groups increase electron density at coordinating sites, enhancing metal binding, while electron-withdrawing groups can either improve acidity (aiding coordination) or reduce electron density (hindering coordination).

- **Steric Factors**: Bulky groups or steric hindrance can impede the approach and binding of modifiers to the metal center, reducing coordination efficiency.

- **Multiple Coordination Sites**: Modifiers with multidentate capabilities (multiple coordinating groups) can form stronger and more stable complexes with metal ions, enhancing catalyst activity.

By applying these rules, chemists can predict whether a molecular modifier will result in a high or low yield in the reaction and can design new modifiers to optimize yield. The balance between simple rules with broad coverage and complex rules with specific insights ensures both practical applicability and a deep understanding of the modifier's role in the catalytic process.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

**Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with a functional group at the **para position** capable of coordinating with metal centers (e.g., amino groups) result in a **high yield**.**

- **Explanation**: The para-substituted functional group enhances coordination with the metal ion, stabilizing the catalyst complex and improving reactivity.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:

    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** *(True)*: Bromomethyl group may facilitate coordination through halogen-metal interactions.
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(False)*: Methyl group lacks lone pairs and coordination ability.
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)*: Formyl group is less effective in metal coordination due to its electron-withdrawing nature.

---

**Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids where the carboxyl group is directly attached to a **heteroaromatic ring containing a coordinating nitrogen atom** result in a **high yield**.**

- **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings act as strong ligands, coordinating with the metal center and enhancing catalyst performance.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Niacin)** *(True)*: Pyridine nitrogen coordinates effectively with the metal ion.
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)*: Pyrazole nitrogen donates electron density to the metal center.
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(False)*: The pyridine ring is not directly attached to the carboxyl group, reducing coordination efficiency.

---

**Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups (**polyhydroxy acids**) result in a **high yield** due to enhanced metal coordination.**

- **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide several coordination sites, strengthening metal binding and stabilizing the catalyst.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(True)*: Abundance of hydroxyl groups facilitates extensive metal coordination.
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** *(True)*: Polyhydroxylation enhances chelation capacity.
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(False)*: Single hydroxyl group offers limited coordination potential.

---

**Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic amino acids with amino and carboxyl groups separated by a **short chain (3-5 carbons)** result in a **high yield**, while longer chains lead to a **low yield**.**

- **Explanation**: Optimal chain length allows effective chelation of the metal ion, forming stable complexes that enhance catalytic activity.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid** *(True)*: Five-carbon chain enables effective chelation via amino and carboxyl groups.
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)** *(True)*: Short chain allows for strong metal binding.
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(False)*: Longer chain reduces chelation efficiency due to increased flexibility.
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(False)*: Excessive chain length hinders effective metal coordination.

---

**Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking additional coordinating functional groups result in a **low yield** due to steric hindrance and lack of coordination sites.**

- **Explanation**: Aromatic side chains without donor atoms do not contribute to metal coordination and may obstruct active sites.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)** *(False)*: Phenyl group does not coordinate and adds steric bulk.
  - **High Yield**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)** *(True)*: Indole nitrogen can coordinate with the metal ion.

---

**Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with **thiol groups** near the carboxyl group result in a **high yield**, while aromatic counterparts result in a **low yield** due to steric and electronic factors.**

- **Explanation**: Thiol groups are soft ligands that form strong bonds with metal ions. In aliphatic chains, they are more accessible for coordination.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)*: Thiol and carboxyl groups chelate the metal ion effectively.
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** *(False)*: Aromatic ring hinders effective thiol coordination.

---

**Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (**C8**) without additional polar functional groups result in a **high yield**.**

- **Explanation**: Medium-chain acids balance hydrophobic interactions and metal coordination via the carboxyl group, enhancing catalyst compatibility.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - **Octanoic acid** *(True)*: Eight-carbon chain offers optimal properties for metal interaction.
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(False)*: Hydroxyl group may disrupt hydrophobic balance and coordination.

---

**Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing **ether linkages** in aliphatic chains terminating in a carboxyl group result in a **low yield** due to decreased coordination efficiency.**

- **Explanation**: Ether linkages increase flexibility, preventing the carboxyl group from effectively coordinating with the metal ion.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(False)*: Flexible ether chain disrupts optimal positioning for coordination.
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** *(False)*: Ether linkages reduce rigidity needed for metal binding.

---

**Rule 9**: **Modifiers with bulky substituents near coordinating functional groups result in a **low yield** due to steric hindrance.**

- **Explanation**: Large groups near coordination sites can physically block the approach of the metal ion, preventing effective catalyst formation.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)*: Acetamido group adds steric bulk near coordination sites.
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** *(False)*: Amide linkage and bulky aromatic ring hinder metal coordination.

---

**Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with **electron-withdrawing groups** capable of coordinating with metal centers can result in a **high yield** if the group enhances metal interaction.**

- **Explanation**: Certain electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro) may still participate in metal coordination through their oxygen atoms, compensating for their withdrawing effect.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(True)*: Nitro group can coordinate with the metal ion via oxygen atoms.
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)*: Formyl group has limited coordination ability and strongly withdraws electrons.

---

**End of Rules**

---

**Rationale and Key Considerations**:

In developing these rules, the following **physicochemical principles** were considered:

- **Coordination Chemistry**: Functional groups capable of donating lone pairs (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, thiol, and heterocyclic nitrogen) enhance coordination with metal ions, leading to higher yields.

- **Steric Factors**: Bulky substituents near coordination sites can hinder metal binding due to physical obstruction.

- **Chain Length and Flexibility**: Optimal chain lengths and rigidity of the modifier influence its ability to effectively coordinate with the metal center.

- **Electronic Effects**: While electron-donating groups generally increase electron density on ligating atoms, certain electron-withdrawing groups can still enhance coordination if they possess atoms capable of interacting with the metal ion.

- **Chelation and Multidentate Binding**: Modifiers that can chelate the metal ion through multiple coordination sites form more stable complexes, improving catalytic activity.

**Application of the Rules**:

- **Predictive Utility**: These rules enable the prediction of reaction yield based on structural features, aiding in the selection or design of effective modifiers.

- **Design Guidance**: Chemists can use these rules to design new modifiers with functional groups and structural features that enhance catalyst performance.

- **Optimization**: Understanding the impact of specific functional groups assists in optimizing reaction conditions and catalyst systems.

**Balance of Rules**:

- A total of **10 rules** have been generated, meeting the requirement of producing between 5 and 15 rules.

- The rules achieve a balance between simplicity and complexity:

  - **Broad Rules**: Cover larger portions of the dataset with common structural features (e.g., Rule 1 on para-substituted aromatic acids).

  - **Specific Rules**: Address unique functional group combinations (e.g., Rule 6 on thiol-containing modifiers) for comprehensive coverage.

- The rules collectively cover a wide range of the dataset, ensuring applicability to various modifiers.

**Conclusion**:

By carefully analyzing the dataset and applying fundamental chemical principles, these rules effectively describe the relationship between molecular modifiers and the reaction yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization. They adhere to the specified requirements by:

1. **Combining Functional Groups**: Each rule considers combinations of functional groups and their collective impact on yield.

2. **Considering Physicochemical Properties**: The rules are based on coordination chemistry, steric effects, chain length, and electronic properties.

3. **Providing Clear Predictions**: Each rule specifies whether modifiers fitting the description are expected to result in a high or low yield.

4. **Prioritizing Broad Coverage**: The rules cover a wide range of examples from the dataset.

5. **Balancing Complexity**: The set includes both general and specific rules to balance coverage and detail.

These guidelines can be used to predict outcomes, design effective modifiers, and optimize catalyst performance for improved yields in the targeted chemical reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

**Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with a *para-substituted amino group* result in a **high yield**.**

- **Explanation**: The para-amino group provides lone pairs that can coordinate with metal ions, enhancing the formation of stable metal-ligand complexes critical for catalytic activity.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** *(True)*: Has a para-amino group that enhances metal coordination.
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(False)*: Methyl group lacks lone pairs and does not aid in coordination.

---

**Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are *unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids* without additional polar functional groups result in a **high yield**; introducing *amino* or *hydroxyl groups* into these chains reduces the yield.**

- **Explanation**: Simple unbranched chains allow effective coordination through the carboxyl group without steric hindrance or interference from other functional groups. Additional polar groups may alter the chelation behavior or introduce unfavorable interactions.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - **Octanoic acid** *(True)*: Unbranched chain with no interfering groups.
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(False)*: Introduction of an amino group decreases yield.
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(False)*: Presence of a hydroxyl group reduces coordination efficiency.

---

**Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are *aliphatic amino acids* with *amino and carboxyl groups* separated by a chain of *five carbons* result in a **high yield**; longer chains decrease the yield.**

- **Explanation**: The optimal chain length allows simultaneous coordination of both amino and carboxyl groups to the metal center, forming stable chelate rings.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid** *(True)*: Optimal chain length for effective chelation.
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(False)*: Longer chain reduces chelation efficiency.
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(False)*: Chain length exceeds optimal range.

---

**Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with a *para-substituted electron-withdrawing group* (e.g., nitro) result in a **high yield**; *bulky or ortho-substituents* reduce the yield due to steric hindrance or electronic effects.**

- **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups stabilize the metal-ligand complex by delocalizing electron density, while bulky or ortho-substituents can hinder coordination due to steric clashes.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(True)*: Nitro group enhances stability of the complex.
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(False)*: Methyl group does not stabilize the complex.
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** *(False)*: Ortho-substituents hinder coordination.

---

**Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are *heterocyclic carboxylic acids* containing *nitrogen atoms* within the ring structure result in a **high yield**.**

- **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles act as additional coordination sites, promoting stronger and more stable metal-ligand interactions.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(True)*: Pyridine nitrogen coordinates with metal ions.
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)*: Pyrazole ring provides nitrogen donors.
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(False)*: Bulky biphenyl structure introduces steric hindrance.

---

**Rule 6**: **Modifiers that have *multiple hydroxyl groups* along with an *amino group* result in a **high yield** due to enhanced coordination capacity.**

- **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl and amino groups provide several coordination sites, increasing the strength and stability of metal complexes.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)*: Amino and carboxyl groups enable chelation.
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(True)*: Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance coordination.
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(False)*: Single hydroxyl group insufficient for effective coordination.

---

**Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are *aliphatic carboxylic acids* containing *ether linkages* in the carbon chain result in a **low yield**.**

- **Explanation**: Ether linkages increase chain flexibility and may disrupt optimal alignment for coordination; they can also reduce electron density on oxygen atoms involved in coordination.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(False)*: Ether linkages interfere with metal binding.
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** *(False)*: Multiple ether bonds reduce coordination efficiency.

---

**Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are *perfluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids* result in a **low yield** due to strong electron-withdrawing effects of fluorine atoms.**

- **Explanation**: Fluorine atoms withdraw electron density from coordinating oxygens, diminishing their ability to donate electrons to metal ions.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(False)*: Fluorinated chain decreases coordination ability.

---

**Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *bulky substituents* or *additional aromatic rings* near the coordinating site result in a **low yield** due to steric hindrance.**

- **Explanation**: Bulky groups impede the approach and binding of metal ions to the coordinating atoms.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(False)*: Additional pyridyl ring causes steric clashes.
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** *(False)*: Bulky substituents hinder coordination.

---

**Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are *amino acids with aromatic side chains containing nitrogen heterocycles* result in a **high yield**; those with *unsubstituted phenyl rings* result in a **low yield**.**

- **Explanation**: Nitrogen-containing heterocycles in side chains can coordinate with metal ions, whereas phenyl rings without heteroatoms do not contribute to coordination.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(True)*: Indole nitrogen assists in coordination.
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(False)*: Phenyl group lacks coordinating atoms.

---

**Rule 11**: **Modifiers with *additional carbonyl groups* (e.g., keto or formyl groups) adjacent to the carboxyl group result in a **low yield**.**

- **Explanation**: Extra carbonyl groups can create competing coordination sites or form intramolecular interactions that reduce effective metal binding.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** *(False)*: Additional keto group competes for metal ions.
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)*: Formyl group may interfere with coordination.

---

**Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *ortho-substituted hydroxyl or formyl groups* result in a **low yield** due to intramolecular hydrogen bonding reducing coordination availability.**

- **Explanation**: Ortho-substituents can engage in intramolecular interactions, sequestering lone pairs that would otherwise coordinate with metal ions.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** *(False)*: Intramolecular hydrogen bonding reduces coordination sites.

---

**Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are *aliphatic amino acids* with an *additional acetamido group* result in a **low yield** due to increased steric hindrance and electron-withdrawing effects.**

- **Explanation**: The acetamido group introduces steric bulk and withdraws electron density, hindering effective coordination.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)*: Acetamido group hinders metal interaction.

---

**Rule 14**: **Modifiers containing *thiol groups* in short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids result in a **high yield**; however, when thiol groups are attached to aromatic rings, the yield is **low**.**

- **Explanation**: In aliphatic chains, thiol groups serve as strong soft-base donors for metal coordination. In aromatic systems, the thiol group's lone pair may be less available due to resonance delocalization.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)*: Thiol group enhances metal coordination.
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** *(False)*: Aromatic thiol less effective in metal binding.

---

**Rule 15**: **Modifiers that have *ester groups* or *amide linkages* in proximity to the coordinating carboxylate reduce the yield, resulting in a **low yield**.**

- **Explanation**: Ester and amide functionalities can disrupt metal coordination by altering electron density and introducing steric hindrance.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** *(False)*: Amide linkage interferes with coordination.
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** *(False)*: Amide group reduces metal binding efficiency.

---

**End of Rules**

**Rationale and Key Considerations**:

The above rules were developed by analyzing the dataset and considering fundamental **physicochemical principles**:

- **Coordination Potential**: Functional groups with lone pairs (amino, hydroxyl, thiol, heterocyclic nitrogen) can coordinate with metal ions.
- **Steric Effects**: Bulky substituents near coordination sites can hinder metal-ligand interactions.
- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups can stabilize metal complexes, enhancing catalytic activity.
- **Chelation Ability**: Optimal chain lengths between coordinating groups facilitate stable chelate ring formation.
- **Intramolecular Interactions**: Ortho-substituents capable of hydrogen bonding can reduce availability of coordinating atoms.
- **Functional Group Interference**: Ether linkages, ester, and amide functionalities can disrupt coordination due to electronic and steric factors.

**Application of the Rules**:

- The rules are designed to **predict** whether a given modifier will result in a high or low yield based on its structural features.
- They provide **guidance** for selecting or designing molecular modifiers to optimize reaction yields.
- The rules have been crafted to cover a broad range of the dataset while maintaining a balance between simplicity and complexity.

**Conclusion**:

By combining multiple sub-structures and considering their physicochemical properties, these rules fulfill the specified requirements:

1. **Combination of Sub-Structures**: Each rule integrates multiple functional groups or structural elements.
2. **Physicochemical Considerations**: The rules are grounded in coordination chemistry and the effects of steric and electronic factors.
3. **Clear Predictions**: Each rule explicitly predicts a high or low yield for modifiers fitting its description.
4. **Broad Coverage**: The rules collectively cover the majority of the dataset.
5. **Quantity of Rules**: A total of **15 rules** have been provided, adhering to the specified range.
6. **Balance Between Simplicity and Complexity**: The rules range from general trends with broad applicability to specific cases requiring detailed structural considerations.

By applying these rules, researchers can better understand the relationship between molecular modifiers and reaction yield, aiding in the design of more effective catalysts for the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization of aliphatic alcohols.---------------------------------------------------------------

**End of Rules**

---

**Rationale and Key Considerations**:

In formulating these rules, I adhered to the following principles:

1. **Combination of Substructures**: Each rule integrates multiple functional groups or structural features to predict the yield outcome.

2. **Underlying Physicochemical Properties**:
   - **Electronic Effects**: Assessing how electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups influence metal coordination.
   - **Steric Factors**: Considering how the size and position of substituents affect access to coordination sites.
   - **Chelation Ability**: Evaluating the capacity of multiple functional groups to simultaneously bind to metal ions.
   - **Hydrogen Bonding**: Recognizing when intramolecular interactions reduce the availability of coordinating atoms.

3. **Clarity in Predictions**: Each rule specifies whether modifiers fitting the description are expected to yield a high or low value.

4. **Broad Coverage**: The rules collectively encompass the majority of the dataset, providing explanations for both high and low yield modifiers.

5. **Number of Rules**: A total of **15 rules** have been generated, aligning with the requirement of producing between 5 and 15 rules.

6. **Balance Between Simplicity and Complexity**: The rules range from general observations (e.g., the effect of chain length in aliphatic acids) to specific structural combinations (e.g., aromatic carboxylic acids with ortho-substituted hydroxyl and electron-withdrawing groups).

**Application of the Rules**:

- **Predictive Utility**: These rules can be used to anticipate the yield outcome of new modifiers based on their molecular structures.
  
- **Guidance for Modifier Selection**: By understanding the structural features that contribute to high yields, chemists can design or choose modifiers that enhance catalytic performance.

**Conclusion**:

These rules offer a structured approach to relating molecular modifier structures to reaction yields, rooted in fundamental chemical principles. By applying these insights, the optimization of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction can be more effectively achieved.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

**Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *electron-withdrawing groups* (e.g., nitro, amino, bromomethyl) at the *para position* result in a **high yield**.**

- **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups enhance the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxylate ion, improving interaction with metal centers.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(High Yield)*
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid** *(High Yield)*
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** *(High Yield)*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(Low Yield)* (methyl is electron-donating)
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(Low Yield)* (aldehyde may form intramolecular interactions)
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(Low Yield)* (bulky substituent causes steric hindrance)

---

**Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are *aliphatic carboxylic acids* with *chain lengths of 4–8 carbons* and *no additional polar functional groups* result in a **high yield**.**

- **Explanation**: Medium-length aliphatic chains without polar groups allow optimal interaction with the catalyst surface, enhancing activity.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - **Octanoic acid** *(High Yield)*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(Low Yield)* (hydroxyl group introduces polarity)
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(Low Yield)* (amino group adds polarity and potential interference)

---

**Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are *amino acids* with *short aliphatic side chains* (≤5 carbons) and *no bulky or additional polar groups* result in a **high yield**.**

- **Explanation**: Short side chains without steric hindrance facilitate effective metal coordination through the amino and carboxyl groups.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid** *(High Yield)*
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)** *(High Yield)*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(Low Yield)* (longer chain length)
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(Low Yield)* (additional acetamido group adds steric bulk)

---

**Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are *carboxylic acids* with *adjacent multiple hydroxyl groups* near the carboxyl group result in a **high yield**.**

- **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can chelate metal ions alongside the carboxylate, enhancing coordination.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)** *(High Yield)*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(Low Yield)* (hydroxyl group distant from carboxylate)

---

**Rule 5**: **Modifiers that contain *thiol groups* in *short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids* result in a **high yield**; when the thiol group is on an *aromatic ring*, they result in a **low yield**.**

- **Explanation**: In aliphatic acids, thiol groups effectively coordinate with metal ions; in aromatic systems, thiol availability is reduced due to resonance and steric factors.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(High Yield)*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** *(Low Yield)*

---

**Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are *aromatic carboxylic acids* with *electron-donating groups* (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxy) at the *para position* result in a **low yield**.**

- **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups decrease carboxylate acidity and coordination ability, reducing effectiveness.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(Low Yield)*
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** *(Low Yield)*
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** *(Low Yield)*

---

**Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are *carboxylic acids* with *ether linkages* in the aliphatic chain result in a **low yield**.**

- **Explanation**: Ether linkages introduce flexibility and electron-donating oxygen atoms, potentially interfering with metal coordination.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(Low Yield)*
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** *(Low Yield)*

---

**Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are *perfluorinated carboxylic acids* result in a **low yield**.**

- **Explanation**: Strong electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms excessively reduce electron density on the carboxylate, hindering coordination.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(Low Yield)*

---

**Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are *heteroaromatic carboxylic acids* (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole rings) result in a **high yield**, unless steric hindrance is introduced by *bulky substituents*.**

- **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings enhance metal coordination; bulky groups can obstruct this interaction.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(High Yield)*
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** *(High Yield)*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(Low Yield)* (bulky pyridinyl group causing steric hindrance)

---

**Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are *amino acids* with *aromatic side chains containing nitrogen heterocycles* result in a **high yield**; those with *aromatic hydrocarbon side chains* result in a **low yield**.**

- **Explanation**: Nitrogen-containing side chains can coordinate with metals, enhancing activity, while hydrocarbon side chains lack this capability.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)** *(High Yield)*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)** *(Low Yield)*

---

**Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are *dicarboxylic acids* with *additional coordinating groups* (e.g., amino groups) result in a **high yield**; those without additional groups result in a **low yield**.**

- **Explanation**: Additional coordinating groups enhance metal binding; without them, dicarboxylic acids may bind unproductively.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **High Yield**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)** *(High Yield)*
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** *(Low Yield)*

---

**Rule 12**: **Modifiers with *bulky substituents or acyl groups* near coordinating sites (e.g., amino or carboxyl groups) result in a **low yield**.**

- **Explanation**: Bulky groups near coordination sites hinder effective metal-ligand interactions due to steric hindrance.

- **Supporting Examples**:
  - **Low Yield**:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(Low Yield)*
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** *(Low Yield)*

**End of Rules**

---

These **12 rules** provide a structured understanding of how combinations of functional groups in molecular modifiers influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By considering factors such as electronic effects, steric hindrance, chain length, and the presence of coordinating atoms or groups, these rules help predict whether a given modifier will result in a high or low yield. This knowledge can guide the design and selection of effective modifiers to optimize catalytic performance in this reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------
