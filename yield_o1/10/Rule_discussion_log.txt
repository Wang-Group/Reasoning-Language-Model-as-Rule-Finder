These rules establish clear relationships between the structural features of molecular modifiers and their influence on the reaction yield:

- **Coordination Ability**: Functional groups such as amino, nitro, hydroxyl, sulfhydryl, and heterocyclic nitrogens enhance yield by coordinating with the metal center, thus stabilizing the catalyst and facilitating the reaction.

- **Steric Effects**: Bulky substituents and long aliphatic chains, especially those with terminal functional groups, can cause steric hindrance. This impedes effective interaction with the catalyst and leads to lower yields.

- **Electronic Properties**: Electron-withdrawing groups that are incapable of coordination, like formyl or sulfhydryl groups on aromatic rings, reduce electron density available for coordination and decrease catalyst efficiency. However, electron-withdrawing groups that can participate in coordination, such as nitro groups, may enhance yield.

- **Chain Length and Flexibility**: Optimal chain lengths (six to eight carbons) and flexible linkers improve interactions by balancing hydrophobic effects and minimizing steric clashes, leading to higher yields.

By considering these principles, the rules provide a practical framework to predict whether new molecular modifiers will lead to high or low yields based on their structural features. This aids in the design and selection of effective modifiers for optimizing the reaction.

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and concise, specifying amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxylic acid groups. The property insight is strong, linking extra carboxylate groups to enhanced metal coordination and catalyst activity. The rule considers a combination of sub-structures (amino acid backbone and side chain carboxylates), adding complexity. It is supported by multiple data points—(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid and (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid—thus demonstrating good coverage.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear, focusing on para-substituted benzoic acids with amino or nitro groups. The property insight is sound, associating these groups with coordination capabilities and electronic interactions. The rule combines specific substitution patterns and functional groups, adding complexity. It is well-supported by data for 4-aminobenzoic acid and 4-nitrobenzoic acid, ensuring adequate coverage.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear, relating straight-chain saturated fatty acids of six to eight carbons to high yield. The property insight connects chain length to hydrophobic interactions enhancing the catalytic environment. While the rule is simpler in complexity, it effectively covers relevant modifiers like octanoic acid and is supported by data, offering good coverage.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 generally provides clarity by specifying nitrogen-containing heterocycles with carboxylic acid groups. The property insight is solid, linking nitrogen atoms to enhanced coordination with metal centers. Complexity is added by combining heterocyclic structures with carboxylate groups. However, conflicting data—such as 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid yielding low—suggests that the rule may need refinement to address exceptions and improve coverage.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 lacks clarity due to conflicting data. While 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid yields high, 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid yields low. This indicates that the position and context of the sulfhydryl group significantly affect the outcome. The property insight is incomplete without considering these nuances. The rule requires refinement to specify the structural context, thereby improving clarity and coverage.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear, focusing on amino acids with indole side chains like tryptophan. The property insight is strong, highlighting the indole ring's ability to participate in π-stacking and coordinate with metal centers. Complexity is appropriate, considering specific structural features. However, coverage is weak, as only one data point supports the rule. Incorporating additional data would enhance its robustness.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is somewhat complex but clear, emphasizing modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups capable of metal coordination. The property insight effectively connects multiple coordination sites to strengthened catalyst interaction. Despite this, coverage is limited to a single data point—2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid—reducing confidence in the rule. More data is needed to bolster its applicability.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 offers clarity by describing modifiers with flexible linkers connecting aromatic groups to carboxylic acids. The property insight is strong, explaining how flexible linkers minimize steric clashes. Complexity is added through the combination of structural features. While supported by data for two modifiers, a contradictory data point—3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid yielding low—suggests that linker length is critical. Refinement of the rule to specify optimal linker lengths would improve clarity and coverage.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear but faces contradictions. While it correctly predicts low yields for 4-formylbenzoic acid and 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid, it conflicts with the high yield of 4-nitrobenzoic acid, an aromatic carboxylic acid with an electron-withdrawing group. This inconsistency indicates that the property insight may be incomplete or overly generalized. The rule requires refinement to account for exceptions, enhancing clarity and coverage.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear, associating bulky hydrophobic side chains in amino acids with low yield due to steric hindrance. The property insight is logical, and complexity is appropriate. However, the rule's coverage is limited to a single data point—(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid. Additionally, the high yield of tryptophan, which has an even bulkier side chain, suggests the rule may not universally apply. Refinement is needed to clarify the influence of side chain interactions beyond steric effects.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear and provides sound property insight, linking perfluorinated alkyl chains to low yield due to electronic repulsion. Complexity is minimal but sufficient. Coverage is limited to one data point—2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid—warranting additional data to strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is clear, specifying long aliphatic chains with terminal amino or hydroxy groups leading to low yield. The property insight effectively connects steric factors and solubility issues to catalytic performance. Complexity is adequate, combining chain length and functional group positioning. Coverage is acceptable, with multiple data points—7-aminoheptanoic acid and 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid—supporting the rule.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear but lacks complexity, focusing solely on non-coordinating methyl groups on substituted benzoic acids. The property insight is reasonable, but coverage is minimal, based only on 4-methylbenzoic acid. The rule would benefit from additional data to enhance its validity.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 is somewhat unclear due to complex structural descriptions and may confuse readers unfamiliar with the specific modifier structures. The property insight regarding steric hindrance near coordination sites is valid, but coverage is limited to one data point—(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid. Refining the rule for clarity and seeking more supporting data would improve its effectiveness.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 is clear, addressing modifiers with flexible ether linkages and terminal amino groups. The property insight is strong, connecting high conformational flexibility to diminished catalyst performance. Complexity is appropriate, considering combined structural features. Coverage is acceptable with at least two data points—3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid and 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid—supporting the rule.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and well-defined, focusing on amino acids with side chains containing carboxylate groups. It provides strong property insight into how these functional groups enhance coordination with metal centers. The rule considers a combination of sub-structures (amine and carboxylate groups) and is supported by at least three data points—(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid, and 5-aminopentanoic acid—all showing high yield. This indicates good coverage and a robust rule.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear in its description of aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position that are capable of coordination (such as amino and hydroxyl groups). It provides property insight into how electron-donating, coordinating groups enhance metal interaction. However, coverage is limited to one strong data point—4-aminobenzoic acid showing high yield. The low yield of 4-methylbenzoic acid suggests that non-coordinating electron-donating groups (like methyl) do not fit this rule, highlighting the importance of the coordinating ability of the substituent. The rule could be improved by specifying that only coordinating electron-donating groups lead to high yield.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear and offers solid property insight by highlighting nitrogen-containing heterocycles' ability to coordinate with metal centers. It combines the heterocyclic structure with carboxylic acid functionality. The rule is supported by two data points—pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid—both resulting in high yield. This provides adequate coverage and supports the rule's validity.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 posits that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position lead to high yield. While it provides an interesting perspective on electronic effects, coverage is limited to a single data point—4-nitrobenzoic acid showing high yield. Contradictory evidence from 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (both electron-withdrawing but resulting in low yield) suggests that the rule may not universally apply. The rule lacks sufficient coverage and may require refinement to account for the specific nature of electron-withdrawing groups and their impact on coordination.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear in describing modifiers with sulfhydryl groups attached to aliphatic chains leading to high yield. It provides property insight into the strong coordinating ability of thiol groups. However, coverage is limited to one data point—3-sulfanylpropanoic acid. The low yield observed with 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid implies that the rule may need refinement to specify the importance of the sulfhydryl group being on an aliphatic chain rather than an aromatic ring. Additional data points are needed to strengthen this rule.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 focuses on amino acids with side chains containing coordinating heterocycles, such as tryptophan, leading to high yield. While the property insight is sound, considering the coordination potential of indole rings, the rule is supported by only one data point—(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan). The limited coverage reduces confidence in the rule's general applicability. Additional supporting examples would enhance the rule's validity.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 discusses modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups capable of metal coordination, leading to high yield. It provides good property insight into how multiple coordination sites can stabilize the catalyst. However, the rule is based on a single data point—2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid. To improve coverage, more examples exhibiting similar structures and high yields are necessary.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear and provides strong property insight into why aromatic carboxylic acids with formyl groups result in low yield—due to potential deactivation of coordination sites or side reactions. The rule is well-supported by two data points—4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid—both showing low yield. This demonstrates good coverage and makes the rule robust.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear and considers the combination of long aliphatic chains (seven carbons or more) with terminal amino or hydroxy groups leading to low yield. It provides property insight into steric hindrance and reduced solubility affecting metal coordination. The rule is supported by three data points—7-aminoheptanoic acid, 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, and 8-aminooctanoic acid—all exhibiting low yield. This indicates strong coverage and validates the rule.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 addresses amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains causing low yield due to steric hindrance. It provides reasonable property insight but is supported by only one data point—(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine). The limited coverage suggests that the rule needs more supporting data to confirm its general applicability.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 describes modifiers with flexible ether linkages and terminal amino groups leading to low yield. While it offers property insight into how high flexibility and terminal polar groups can impede coordination, the rule is based on a single data point—3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid. Additional examples are necessary to strengthen the rule and confirm its relevance.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 highlights that modifiers containing perfluorinated alkyl chains lead to low yield due to decreased metal interaction. The property insight is valid, considering the electron-withdrawing nature of fluorine atoms. However, the rule's coverage is limited to one data point—2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid—necessitating more data for robust validation.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 states that aromatic carboxylic acids with non-coordinating electron-donating groups incapable of metal coordination result in low yield. It provides property insight into how such groups fail to enhance metal interaction and may cause steric hindrance. The rule is supported by one data point—4-methylbenzoic acid—leading to low yield. To improve the rule's strength, additional supporting data points are needed.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 discusses biaryl systems with carboxylic acid groups directly connected without flexible linkers leading to low yield, due to steric constraints from rigidity. It offers good property insight but is substantiated by a single data point—4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid—showing low yield. More data points would enhance the rule's coverage and reliability.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 is clear and combines structural features by considering aromatic carboxylic acids connected to additional aromatic rings via flexible aliphatic linkers leading to high yield. It provides strong property insight into how flexibility reduces steric hindrance and facilitates metal coordination. The rule is supported by at least two data points—5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid and 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid—both resulting in high yield. This demonstrates adequate coverage and makes the rule robust.

   - Modifiers with –OH or –NH₂ at the para position increase electron density for better coordination.
   - **High Yield Modifiers**: **Entries 4, 7, 30**.
   - **Note**: Entry 30 is listed as low yield, suggesting exceptions; thus, the chain length or additional factors may influence yield.

3. **Nitrogen-Containing Heterocycles (Rule 3):**
   - Heterocycles like pyridine and pyrazole can coordinate through nitrogen.
   - **High Yield Modifiers**: **Entries 11 (though listed as low yield; may need reconsideration), 15, 21**.
   - **Discrepancy**: **Entry 11** is low yield, indicating that the biaryl system without flexibility (Rule 10) overrules this rule.

4. **Sulfhydryl Groups (Rule 4):**
   - Strong metal-binding affinity enhances catalyst activity.
   - **High Yield Modifiers**: **Entries 9 (low yield), 17**.
   - **Discrepancy**: **Entry 9** is low yield; perhaps aromatic sulfhydryls are less effective due to oxidation or steric factors.

5. **Amino Acids with Aromatic Side Chains (Rule 5):**
   - **High Yield**: Indole-containing amino acids (tryptophan) coordinate effectively.
     - **Entry 14**.
   - **Low Yield**: Phenylalanine lacks additional coordinating groups.
     - **Entry 12**.

   - Increased steric hindrance and decreased solubility hinder coordination.
   - **Low Yield Modifiers**: **Entries 5 (contradicts rule; high yield), 29, 31, 34**.
   - **Discrepancy**: **Entry 5** is high yield, suggesting that an 8-carbon chain may still be acceptable or that other factors contribute.

7. **Electron-Withdrawing Groups (Rule 7):**
   - Decrease coordination ability.
   - **Low Yield Modifiers**: **Entry 20** contradicts this rule (high yield), indicating that nitro groups may still allow effective coordination or other factors are at play.

8. **Aldehyde Groups (Rule 8):**
   - Can deactivate metal centers.
   - **Low Yield Modifiers**: **Entries 18, 19**.

9. **Perfluorinated Chains (Rule 9):**
   - Reduce electron density for coordination.
   - **Low Yield Modifier**: **Entry 13**.

10. **Rigid Biaryl Systems (Rule 10):**
    - Steric hindrance prevents effective coordination.
    - **Low Yield Modifier**: **Entry 11**.

11. **Flexible Linkers with Aromatics (Rule 11):**
    - Allow proper orientation for metal coordination.
    - **High Yield Modifiers**: **Entries 7, 24, 25**.

12. **Multiple Hydroxyl Groups (Rule 12):**
    - Provide additional coordination sites.
    - **High Yield Modifier**: **Entry 6**.

13. **Non-Coordinating Para Substituents (Rule 13):**
    - Do not enhance metal binding.
    - **Low Yield Modifier**: **Entry 22**.

14. **Ether Linkages (Rule 14):**
    - May reduce effective metal binding due to flexibility.
    - **Low Yield Modifiers**: **Entries 10, 32**.

15. **Conjugated Ketone Groups (Rule 15):**
    - Compete for metal binding or cause side reactions.
    - **Low Yield Modifiers**: **Entries 27, 25** (Entry 25 is high yield, indicating an exception).

**Considerations and Adjustments:**

- **Discrepancies in Data**: Certain entries contradict the rules, indicating that other factors influence yield, such as overall molecular geometry, solubility, or synergistic effects of multiple functional groups.

- **Exceptions to Rules**: Not all modifiers fit neatly into the rules, highlighting the complexity of chemical interactions.

- **Rule Refinement**: Rules may need further refinement to account for observed exceptions. For instance, **Rule 7** may not universally apply to all electron-withdrawing groups.

**Conclusion:**

The generated rules provide a structured understanding of how different functional groups and molecular architectures in modifiers influence the yield of the δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By focusing on the coordination ability, steric effects, electronic properties, and molecular flexibility, the rules aim to predict whether a modifier will lead to high or low yield.

**Application and Future Use:**

- **Predictive Tool**: These rules can serve as guidelines for selecting or designing new modifiers to achieve desired yields.

- **Further Investigation**: Discrepancies suggest that additional factors such as solvent effects, modifier solubility, and reaction conditions play significant roles and warrant further study.

- **Balance of Rules**: The rules strike a balance between simplicity and complexity, covering broad trends while acknowledging exceptions.

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear, provides adequate physical-chemical insight, and considers combinations of functional groups (amino and two carboxylic acid groups). However, it is supported by only two data points (Entries 0 and 2), which is minimal coverage. Expanding the dataset or identifying additional supporting examples would strengthen this rule.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 offers clarity and good property insight by focusing on aromatic carboxylic acids with amino or hydroxyl groups in specific positions. It considers combinations of substructures. However, there is an exception with Entry 30 (**3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**), which fits the rule's description but results in a low yield. This suggests the rule may need refinement to account for chain length or additional structural factors influencing the yield.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear and provides adequate physical-chemical insight, considering nitrogen-containing heterocycles with carboxylic acids. It is supported by multiple data points (Entries 8, 15, and 21). However, similar compounds like Entry 11 (**4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**), which contains a nitrogen heterocycle but leads to low yield, indicate that the rule may not fully account for structural nuances. Refinement to address such exceptions would improve the rule's reliability.

Identifying more examples would strengthen this rule.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear, considers combinations of substructures (flexible aliphatic linker, aromatic ring, carboxylic acid), and is supported by multiple data points (Entries 7, 24, and 25). However, Entry 30, which fits the rule's description but results in a low yield, serves as an exception. The rule may require refinement to specify the optimal linker length or consider additional structural factors affecting the yield.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear and provides property insight regarding electron-withdrawing groups on aromatic carboxylic acids leading to low yield. It is supported by two data points (Entries 18 and 19) but acknowledges exceptions like Entry 20 (**4-nitrobenzoic acid**) with high yield. With limited coverage and noted exceptions, the rule lacks predictive reliability and may need further refinement or additional data points.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear with adequate property insight, addressing long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids leading to low yield due to steric hindrance and solubility issues. However, Entry 5 (**octanoic acid**), a long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acid with high yield, contradicts the rule. This significant exception suggests that the rule may not fully capture the factors influencing yield and requires reconsideration or refinement.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear and provides adequate insight into rigid biaryl structures leading to low yield due to steric constraints. However, it is based on a single data point (Entry 11), which is insufficient coverage per the criteria. Additional supporting data points are necessary to validate and strengthen this rule.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear and offers rational property insight, focusing on aromatic carboxylic acids with small non-coordinating substituents leading to low yield. It is supported by only one data point (Entry 22). The minimal coverage makes the rule unreliable without further supporting examples.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear, provides sufficient property insight, considers combinations of substructures (multiple ether linkages in aliphatic chains), and is supported by two data points (Entries 10 and 32). This rule meets the criteria and appears acceptable.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear and provides property insight regarding perfluorinated alkyl chains leading to low yield due to electron-withdrawing effects. However, it is based on a single data point (Entry 13). The coverage is insufficient, and more data points are needed to confirm the rule's validity.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is clear, offers good physical-chemical insight, and considers the context of thiol groups in different environments. It is supported by two data points (Entries 9 and 17), demonstrating contrasting outcomes based on structural differences. This rule meets the criteria and appears reliable.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear and provides rational insight but is contradicted by Entry 3 (**5-aminopentanoic acid**), which fits the rule's description but results in a high yield. Additionally, the rule is supported by only one data point (Entry 33), making it unreliable. The rule requires re-evaluation and possibly refinement to account for exceptions.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 has acceptable clarity and insight, focusing on aromatic carboxylic acids with amide-linked substituents leading to low yield. However, it is supported by only one data point (Entry 26). The minimal coverage makes the rule insufficiently validated per the criteria.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 states that chain length alone is insufficient to predict yield, implying variability without a clear predictive guideline. While it addresses the limitations of using chain length as a sole factor, it does not provide a specific criterion for prediction. As such, it does not fulfill the criteria for an actionable rule.

- **Combination of Sub-Structures**: Each rule combines multiple functional groups (e.g., amino and carboxyl groups, aromatic rings with substituents) to define the modifiers' impact on yield.

- **Physicochemical Considerations**: The rules consider electronic effects (electron-donating vs. withdrawing groups), coordination ability, steric hindrance, and solubility, which are critical in metal-catalyzed reactions.

- **Predictive Clarity**: Each rule clearly states whether modifiers fitting the description will lead to high or low yield.

- **Coverage Balance**: The rules cover a broad range of the dataset, balancing between simple, high-coverage rules (e.g., Rules 1-3) and more complex, lower-coverage rules (e.g., Rules 12-14).

- **Number of Rules**: Fifteen rules have been provided, meeting the requirement of generating between 5 and 15 rules.

---

**Detailed Analysis:**

- **High Yield Modifiers**:
  - **Rules 1-5, 11** identify modifiers with functional groups that enhance coordination with the metal center. The presence of amino, hydroxyl, thiol groups, and nitrogen heterocycles increases electron density and provides lone pairs for coordination.
  - **Flexibility** in molecular structure (Rule 5) allows for better orientation and interaction with the catalyst.

- **Low Yield Modifiers**:
  - **Rules 6-10, 12-14** highlight modifiers with features that decrease coordination ability, such as electron-withdrawing groups, steric hindrance from bulky substituents, high flexibility due to ether linkages, and resonance delocalization in amide linkages.
  - **Steric Effects** (Rules 7, 9, 13) can prevent effective coordination due to increased size or lack of functional groups that facilitate binding.

- **Variable Yield Modifiers**:
  - **Rule 15** acknowledges that some aliphatic carboxylic acids do not fit neatly into high or low yield categories, suggesting that other factors (e.g., solubility, specific interactions) influence the outcome.

**Explanation and Rationale:**

The above rules were developed through a systematic analysis of the dataset, focusing on combinations of functional groups and structural features that correlate with high or low reaction yields. Key considerations included coordination chemistry, electronic effects, steric factors, and molecular flexibility—all of which impact the interaction between the modifier and the metal catalyst.

- **Combination of Sub-Structures**: Each rule combines multiple structural features. For example, **Rule 3** considers the aromatic ring, carboxylic acid group, and para-substituted coordinating groups collectively.

- **Physicochemical Properties**: The rules are grounded in principles of coordination chemistry. Functional groups capable of donating electron pairs (like amino, hydroxyl, and thiol groups) enhance metal binding, while electron-withdrawing groups (like fluorine atoms or carbonyl groups) weaken it. Steric hindrance from bulky substituents and molecular flexibility from ether linkages also play critical roles.

- **Predictive Clarity**: Each rule specifies the expected effect on yield (high or low) for any modifier that fits its description, aiding in the prediction of outcomes for new or untested modifiers.

- **Broad Coverage**: The rules collectively cover a wide range of modifiers in the dataset, ensuring applicability to diverse chemical structures.

- **Balance of Complexity**: The set includes both simple rules with broad applicability (e.g., **Rule 1** and **Rule 3**) and more complex rules that capture nuanced effects (e.g., **Rule 15**), achieving a suitable balance.

- **Number of Rules**: A total of 15 rules have been provided, satisfying the requirement of generating between 5 and 15 rules.

  - **Rule 9**: Electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups adjacent to aromatic rings decrease electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening metal-ligand interactions.

  - **Rule 10**: Bulky substituents near coordinating groups create steric hindrance, obstructing metal access and decreasing catalytic activity.

  - **Rule 11**: Amino acids without additional coordinating heteroatoms, like phenylalanine, have limited binding capacity, resulting in weaker interaction with the catalyst.

  - **Rule 12**: Aromatic thiols may not coordinate effectively due to delocalization of electron density in the aromatic ring.

  - **Rule 13**: Highly fluorinated chains strongly withdraw electrons, decreasing electron density on coordinating atoms and weakening metal binding.

  - **Rule 14**: Ketone groups in dicarboxylic acids may interfere with coordination or introduce rigidity, reducing catalyst effectiveness.

  - **Rule 15**: Hydroxyl groups in the ortho position, combined with electron-withdrawing groups, can reduce coordination due to intramolecular hydrogen bonding and decreased electron density.

**Explanation and Rationale:**

The rules above were developed through a systematic analysis of the provided dataset, focusing on the relationship between the molecular structures of modifiers and their impact on reaction yield. The key considerations include coordination chemistry, electronic effects, steric factors, and molecular flexibility, which influence the interaction between the modifier and the metal catalyst.

- **Combination of Sub-Structures**: Each rule identifies specific combinations of functional groups and structural features. For example, **Rule 2** combines an aromatic ring, a carboxylic acid group, and a para-substituted amino or hydroxyl group to predict high yield.

- **Physicochemical Properties**: The rules are grounded in chemical principles:
  - **Metal Coordination**: Functional groups like amino (-NH₂), hydroxyl (-OH), thiol (-SH), and nitrogen-containing heterocycles provide lone pairs of electrons capable of coordinating with metal ions, enhancing catalyst activity.
  - **Electron Donation and Withdrawal**: Electron-donating groups increase electron density on coordinating atoms, strengthening metal-ligand interactions. Electron-withdrawing groups have the opposite effect, potentially reducing catalytic efficiency.
  - **Steric Hindrance**: Bulky substituents near coordination sites can impede access to the metal center, diminishing catalyst performance.
  - **Molecular Flexibility**: Excessive flexibility from ether linkages can decrease effective metal coordination due to entropic factors.

- **Predictive Clarity**: Each rule clearly states whether modifiers fitting its description will lead to high or low yield, facilitating the prediction of outcomes for new modifiers.

- **Coverage and Balance**: The rules cover a broad spectrum of modifiers in the dataset, including both high-yield and low-yield cases, and represent a balance between simple, broadly applicable rules and more complex ones that capture specific nuances.

**Conclusion:**

By integrating combinations of functional groups and considering underlying physicochemical properties, these rules provide valuable insights into how molecular modifiers influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. This understanding can guide the selection or design of new modifiers to optimize reaction outcomes, thereby advancing the objectives of the research program.

- **Comment 1**: **Rule 1** is clear and specifies that small aliphatic amino-dicarboxylic acids lead to high yield. It is supported by at least two data points: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid**, both resulting in high yield. The property insight about multiple carboxylate groups and an amino group enhancing metal coordination through multiple interaction sites is sound. The rule effectively combines functional groups (amino and carboxylic acid groups) in a specific structural context, meeting the complexity criterion.

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 2** clearly states that aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted amino (-NH₂) or hydroxyl (-OH) groups lead to high yield. This is evident in the data with **4-aminobenzoic acid** yielding high results, while **4-methylbenzoic acid**, lacking these groups, yields low results. The property insight about electron-donating groups enhancing metal coordination is appropriate. The rule combines aromaticity, substitution patterns, and functional groups, satisfying the complexity and coverage criteria.

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 3** specifies that pyridine carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the pyridine ring lead to high yield. Supported by data points like **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (high yield) and the counter-example **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (low yield), the rule has adequate coverage. The property insight regarding the pyridine nitrogen providing an additional coordination site is valid. The rule effectively combines nitrogen heterocycles with carboxylic acid functionality, meeting the complexity criterion.

- **Comment 4**: **Rule 4** is clear in stating that small aliphatic carboxylic acids with a thiol (-SH) group lead to high yield. This is supported by **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (high yield) and contrasted with **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (low yield). The property insight about thiol groups being strong ligands and the importance of reduced steric hindrance in small aliphatic chains is sound. The rule combines chain length and functional groups, satisfying the complexity and coverage criteria.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** states that simple aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths between 6 to 8 carbons and no additional polar groups lead to high yield.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** indicates that modifiers with highly fluorinated aliphatic chains lead to low yield, exemplified by **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (low yield). However, the rule is based on a single data point, failing to meet the coverage criterion of at least two supporting examples. While the property insight about fluorine's strong electron-withdrawing effects is sound, the rule lacks sufficient data to be considered robust.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** specifies that aromatic carboxylic acids with bulky substituents near coordinating groups lead to low yield, with **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** as an example. This rule also suffers from limited coverage, relying on only one data point. The property insight about steric hindrance obstructing access to the metal center is valid, but the rule does not meet the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** clearly states that amino acids with large hydrophobic side chains lacking coordinating heteroatoms lead to low yield. Supported by **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (low yield) and contrasted with **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (high yield), the rule meets the coverage criterion. The property insight regarding the lack of coordination sites in side chains without heteroatoms is appropriate. The rule combines amino acid structures with side chain properties, satisfying the complexity and coverage criteria.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows for unambiguous identification of modifiers that are aliphatic amino dicarboxylic acids. It is supported by at least two data points—(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid and (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid—that result in high yield. The rationale offers adequate physical-chemical insight into how multiple coordination sites enhance metal-ligand interactions. The complexity is appropriate, considering combinations of functional groups, and the coverage is satisfactory, balancing specificity and applicability.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear and enables straightforward classification of modifiers based on the presence of a para-substituted amino group on aromatic carboxylic acids. Supported by data points like 4-aminobenzoic acid and 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid (high yield), and countered by 4-methylbenzoic acid (low yield), the rule has solid coverage. The rationale provides sufficient physical-chemical insight, and the complexity is suitable, considering both the aromatic framework and substituent effects.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear in identifying modifiers with para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups on aromatic carboxylic acids. It is supported by 4-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid (high yield), with 4-formylbenzoic acid as a counter-example (low yield). The rationale effectively explains the impact of increased acidity on metal coordination. The rule strikes a good balance between complexity and coverage, with adequate physical-chemical insight.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear but has limited coverage, supported by one high-yield data point (3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) and one low-yield counter-example (4-sulfanylbenzoic acid). While the rationale regarding thiol coordination is sound, the rule's effectiveness is constrained by the small number of supporting examples. The complexity is acceptable, but additional data points would strengthen the rule's applicability.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear and emphasizes the importance of chain length and the absence of polar groups in medium-length aliphatic carboxylic acids. Supported by octanoic acid (high yield) and countered by modifiers like 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid (low yield), the rule has reasonable coverage. The rationale provides good physical-chemical insight. However, with only one positive data point, the rule would benefit from more supporting examples to enhance its robustness.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is moderately clear but involves complex structural considerations, making practical application slightly challenging. It is supported by 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid (high yield) and countered by 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (low yield). The rationale about chain length mitigating steric hindrance is insightful. The rule's complexity is justified, but limited coverage indicates a need for more data to validate its generality.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear and effectively identifies heterocyclic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms adjacent to the carboxyl group. Supported by 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid and pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (high yield), with 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid as a counter-example (low yield), the rule has good coverage. The rationale provides strong physical-chemical insight into coordination effects. The complexity is appropriate, and the rule balances specificity with applicability.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear but involves significant structural complexity due to the multiple ether linkages. It is supported by two low-yield data points—2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid and 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid. The rationale about molecular flexibility affecting coordination is sound. While the complexity is high, the rule's coverage and insight justify its inclusion.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear but has limited coverage, supported by a single low-yield data point (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid). The rationale regarding electron-withdrawing effects of fluorine is valid. However, the rule would be stronger with additional data points. The complexity is acceptable given the specificity of heavily fluorinated compounds.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear and focuses on a specific structural feature—ortho-substituted hydroxyl groups on aromatic carboxylic acids. Supported by one low-yield data point (5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid), the rule's coverage is limited. The rationale about intramolecular hydrogen bonding affecting metal coordination is insightful. Increased coverage would enhance the rule's applicability.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear but is contradicted by the data. While it predicts low yield for modifiers with bulky substituents near coordinating groups, 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid actually results in high yield. This inconsistency indicates that the rule lacks sufficient accuracy and coverage. The rationale seems plausible but is not supported by the dataset, suggesting a need for revision.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is clear and supported by at least two low-yield data points—(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid and 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid. The rationale regarding reduced availability of lone pairs due to acylation is sound. The complexity is moderate, considering peptide structures, and the coverage is satisfactory.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear and backed by two low-yield data points—4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid. The rationale effectively explains how formyl groups influence electron density and coordination. The rule has acceptable complexity and good coverage, aligning well with the scoring criteria.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 is clear but appears to be contradicted by data point 25—4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid—which results in high yield despite the presence of electron-donating methoxy groups. This inconsistency suggests that the rule may not reliably predict yield based on electron-donating substituents. The rationale is logical, but the rule lacks sufficient coverage and accuracy, indicating a need for reevaluation.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 is clear and supported by multiple low-yield data points—7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, and 8-aminooctanoic acid. The rationale provides good physical-chemical insight into how polar groups on long chains can hinder metal coordination. The complexity is acceptable, and the coverage is strong, making the rule effective within its specified scope.

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with ortho-substituted polar groups** such as hydroxyl (-OH) or formyl (-CHO) result in **low yield**.
    - *Examples*: **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Ortho-substituted polar groups can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds or stable chelate rings, decreasing the availability of coordination sites for metal binding and impairing catalyst performance.

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **amino acids or peptides with acylated amino groups or additional amide linkages** lead to **low yield**.
    - *Examples*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**, **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-(methylsulfanyl)butanoyl]amino]acetic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Acylation and additional amide bonds reduce the availability of lone pairs on nitrogen atoms for metal coordination, diminishing catalytic effectiveness.

    - *Examples*: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Polar groups on long aliphatic chains can introduce steric hindrance and disrupt effective metal coordination, leading to decreased catalyst activity.

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids bonded to bulky substituents through amide linkages** lead to **low yield**.
    - *Example*: **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear in specifying that medium-chain (5–8 carbons) aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups lead to high yield. It is supported by examples like octanoic acid (high yield) and counter-examples such as 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid and 7-aminoheptanoic acid (low yield). However, the data point **5-aminopentanoic acid**, which contains a polar amino group yet results in high yield, contradicts the rule. This suggests that the presence of polar groups does not universally lead to low yield within this chain length, indicating the rule may lack completeness and clarity due to exceptions.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 clearly states that α-amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxyl groups (dicarboxylic amino acids) lead to high yield. Supported by data points like (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid and (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (both high yield), the rule demonstrates good coverage and clarity. The property insight regarding enhanced coordination with metal centers due to extra carboxyl groups provides a strong rationale, fulfilling the criteria effectively.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 specifies that carboxylic acids where the carboxyl group is directly attached to a nitrogen-containing heterocycle lead to high yield. The rule is clear and well-supported by examples such as pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid (high yield), with 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid serving as a counter-example (low yield). The property insight about enhanced chelation due to adjacent nitrogen atoms is sound. The rule demonstrates good complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 indicates that small aliphatic carboxylic acids containing thiol (-SH) groups lead to high yield, while aromatic thiols result in low yield. The rule is clear and supported by 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid (high yield) and 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid (low yield). The property insight about strong metal-thiol interactions is plausible. However, the coverage is limited to two data points, making it difficult to assess the rule's general applicability and strength.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 states that modifiers with multiple ether linkages in aliphatic chains terminating with a carboxylic acid group result in low yield. The rule is clear and supported by examples like 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid and 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid (both low yield). The property insight about ether linkages reducing effective metal-ligand interactions is reasonable. Coverage is modest, and the rule could benefit from additional supporting data to enhance its robustness.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 specifies that heavily fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids lead to low yield. While the rule is clear and the property insight about electron-withdrawing fluorine weakening metal-ligand interactions is sound, it is based on a single data point: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid (low yield). The limited coverage undermines the rule's reliability and suggests a need for more data to confirm its validity.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 asserts that aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted amino (-NH₂) or nitro (-NO₂) groups lead to high yield. The rule is clear and supported by examples like 4-aminobenzoic acid and 4-nitrobenzoic acid (both high yield). The property insight about enhanced metal coordination due to these groups is plausible. However, the coverage is restricted to these specific cases, and the absence of counter-examples limits the rule's comprehensiveness.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 states that long-chain (7 or more carbons) aliphatic carboxylic acids containing polar functional groups result in low yield. This rule is clear and supported by data points such as 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid and 8-aminooctanoic acid (both low yield). The property insight regarding steric hindrance and disrupted metal coordination is reasonable. The rule exhibits good coverage for the specified conditions but may need refinement to address inconsistencies like 5-aminopentanoic acid (shorter chain with a polar group yielding high).

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 indicates that amino acids or peptides with acylated amino groups or additional amide linkages lead to low yield. The rule is clear and backed by examples like (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (low yield). The property insight about reduced availability of lone pairs for metal coordination is valid. However, the coverage is limited, and more data points are needed to strengthen the rule's applicability.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 specifies that aromatic carboxylic acids with ortho-substituted hydroxyl (-OH) or formyl (-CHO) groups capable of intramolecular hydrogen bonding or chelation lead to low yield. The rule is clear and supported by examples like 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (low yield). The property insight concerning decreased availability of coordination sites is reasonable. The rule's coverage is limited, necessitating additional data to confirm its generality.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 states that compounds with multiple adjacent carbonyl groups capable of chelation result in high yield. While the property insight about enhanced binding strength is sound, the rule is based on a single example: 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid (high yield). The minimal coverage limits the rule's reliability and suggests the need for more supporting data.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 asserts that aromatic carboxylic acids connected via an aliphatic chain (four or more carbons) to an aromatic ring with a para-substituted hydroxyl (-OH) group lead to high yield. The rule is clear and supported by 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid (high yield), with 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (low yield) serving as a counter-example. The property insight about optimal chain length facilitating metal coordination is reasonable. However, the coverage is limited, and the specificity of the rule may restrict its broader applicability.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 specifies that aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-donating alkyl groups (e.g., methyl) lead to low yield. The rule is clear but supported by only one data point: 4-methylbenzoic acid (low yield). While the property insight about reduced acidity affecting metal coordination is valid, the minimal coverage undermines the rule's robustness and suggests a need for additional data.

    - *Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.
    - *Counter-Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (longer chain; results in **high yield**).
    - *Rationale*: Short chains may not provide sufficient flexibility for optimal interaction with the catalyst surface, while longer chains allow better alignment and coordination.

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with large aromatic side chains containing heterocycles (e.g., indole ring)** lead to **high yield**.
    - *Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)**.
    - *Counter-Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)** (results in **low yield**).
    - *Rationale*: The presence of heterocyclic aromatic side chains may enhance stacking interactions or coordinate with metal centers, improving catalytic activity.

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **compounds with carbonyl groups (e.g., ketones, aldehydes) adjacent to the carboxylic acid** lead to **low yield**.
    - *Examples*: **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**, **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.
    - *Rationale*: Adjacent carbonyl groups can participate in intramolecular resonance or hydrogen bonding, reducing the availability of the carboxylate for metal coordination and diminishing catalytic performance.

**Start of Comments**
- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and effectively predicts high yield for α-amino acids with two carboxyl groups. The property insight regarding enhanced metal-ligand interactions due to multiple coordination sites is sound. The rule considers a combination of substructures and is well-supported by data points (aspartic acid and glutamic acid yielding high, phenylalanine yielding low), achieving a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 clearly identifies para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-donating amino or hydroxyl groups as leading to high yield. The rationale based on increased electron density enhancing coordination is reasonable. The rule combines multiple structural features and is supported by several data points (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid yielding high, 4-methylbenzoic acid and 4-formylbenzoic acid yielding low), displaying a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear in defining heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen adjacent to the carboxyl group as high-yield modifiers. The property insight about nitrogen atoms chelating metal ions is appropriate. The rule considers complex structural combinations and is well-supported by multiple data points (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid yielding high, 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid yielding low), indicating a strong balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear, specifying aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups leading to high yield. The property insight regarding thiol-metal interactions is valid. However, the rule's coverage is limited to a single high-yield data point (3-sulfanylpropanoic acid), suggesting the need for more supporting data to strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 clearly states that aromatic carboxylic acids with para electron-withdrawing groups result in high yield. The rationale about increased acidity enhancing coordination is sound. The rule combines structural features and is supported by multiple data points (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid yielding high, 4-methylbenzoic acid yielding low), achieving a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear in defining medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar groups as high-yield modifiers. The property insight is adequate. However, coverage is limited with only one high-yield data point (octanoic acid), indicating that more data is needed to bolster the rule.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is moderately complex but clear, identifying modifiers that result in low yield due to intramolecular hydrogen bonding. The property insight is strong, explaining how this bonding reduces metal coordination. The rule is supported by sufficient data points (e.g., 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid and 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid yielding low), achieving an acceptable balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 clearly defines modifiers with acylated amino groups or additional amide linkages leading to low yield. The property insight regarding reduced availability of lone pairs is valid. The rule considers complex structural combinations and is supported by data points (e.g., (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid and 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid yielding low), displaying a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear in specifying that modifiers with multiple ether linkages in aliphatic chains result in low yield. The property insight is reasonable, explaining how flexibility may hinder coordination. The rule is supported by multiple data points (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid and 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid yielding low), achieving a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear, stating that heavily fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids lead to low yield. The property insight is sound, but coverage is limited to a single data point (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid yielding low), suggesting the need for additional data to strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is somewhat complex and may require careful analysis to apply. The property insight is acceptable, explaining how short chains may hinder interaction. However, the rule is supported by only one low-yield data point (3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid), indicating limited coverage. Additional data points would improve the rule's robustness.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is clear, identifying α-amino acids with large heterocyclic aromatic side chains as high-yield modifiers. The property insight is reasonable, suggesting enhanced interactions. However, coverage is limited with only one high-yield data point (tryptophan yielding high), suggesting more data is needed to substantiate the rule.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear and provides property insight regarding adjacent carbonyl groups reducing yield. However, the data includes a high-yield modifier (4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid) that contradicts the rule, indicating that the rule may not be accurate and requires refinement. This discrepancy highlights the need for re-evaluating the rule based on the available data.

     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine; bulky hydrophobic side chain; results in **low yield**)
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Acylated amino group; results in **low yield**)
   - *Rationale*: α-Amino acids provide both amino and carboxyl groups for effective metal coordination, enhancing catalytic activity. Bulky hydrophobic side chains or acyl modifications can hinder metal-ligand interactions.

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with functional groups capable of metal coordination (e.g., amino, nitro, hydroxyl) at the para position** lead to **high yield**.
   - *Examples*:
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
     - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
   - *Counter-Example*:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Methyl group lacks coordination ability; results in **low yield**)
   - *Rationale*: Functional groups like amino, nitro, and hydroxyl can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance. Electron-donating or withdrawing nature affects coordination but is less critical than the group's ability to interact with metals.

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms in the ring directly attached to the carboxyl group** lead to **high yield**.
   - *Examples*:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**
   - *Counter-Example*:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Pyridine ring not directly connected to carboxyl group; results in **low yield**)

     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Hydroxyl group; results in **low yield**)
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Amino group; results in **low yield**)
   - *Rationale*: Unsubstituted aliphatic chains interact favorably with the catalyst surface, promoting efficient metal-ligand interactions. Polar groups can interfere with metal coordination due to competitive binding or steric hindrance.

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol (–SH) groups** lead to **high yield** when the thiol group is on an aliphatic chain.
   - *Example*:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
   - *Counter-Example*:
     - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Thiol group on aromatic ring; results in **low yield**)
   - *Rationale*: Thiol groups are strong ligands for metal coordination. In aliphatic chains, they provide effective metal-sulfur interactions without significant steric hindrance from aromatic structures.

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **compounds with multiple ether linkages in aliphatic chains terminating with a carboxylic acid group** result in **low yield**.
   - *Examples*:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**
   - *Rationale*: Ether linkages increase molecular flexibility and solubility but may hinder effective metal-ligand coordination due to conformational variability and the electron-donating nature of oxygen atoms, which can interfere with metal binding sites.

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **amino acids or peptides with acylated amino groups or additional amide linkages** lead to **low yield**.
   - *Examples*:
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
     - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

   - *Example*:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**
   - *Rationale*: The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine reduces electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening metal-ligand interactions and reducing catalytic activity.

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with formyl (–CHO) groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** lead to **low yield**.
   - *Examples*:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid**

   - *Rationale*: The presence of a formyl group adjacent to the carboxyl group can participate in intramolecular resonance or hydrogen bonding, reducing the availability of the carboxylate for coordination with metal ions and decreasing catalytic performance.

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids connected through aliphatic chains of four or more carbons to additional functional groups** lead to **high yield**.
    - *Example*:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - *Counter-Example*:
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Shorter chain; results in **low yield**)

**Explanation and Rationale**:

- **Coverage and Balance**: The above rules are designed to cover a broad range of the dataset while maintaining a balance between simplicity and specificity. They collectively account for the majority of the observed outcomes in yield based on modifier structure.

- **Rule Modifications**:
  - **Rule 1** has been refined to exclude modifiers with bulky hydrophobic side chains or acyl modifications, providing clarity on exceptions like phenylalanine.
  - **Rule 2** emphasizes the presence of functional groups capable of metal coordination at the para position, regardless of their electron-donating or withdrawing nature, aligning with observed data (e.g., both amino and nitro groups lead to high yield).
  - **Rule 5** specifies that thiol groups on aliphatic chains lead to high yield, distinguishing from aromatic thiol compounds that result in low yield.
  - **Rule 9** focuses on aromatic carboxylic acids with adjacent formyl groups, which consistently lead to low yield due to decreased availability of the carboxylate group for coordination.
  - **Rule 10** introduces the importance of chain length in aliphatic linkers between functional groups and the carboxylic acid, explaining variations in yield based on spatial considerations.

- **Abandoned/Improved Rules**:
  - Rules with inconsistencies or poor coverage have been modified or replaced to enhance predictive accuracy. For instance, previous rules attempting to generalize the effect of electron-withdrawing groups were found to be inconsistent with the dataset and thus adjusted.

- **Physical-Chemical Considerations**:
  - The rules take into account underlying physical-chemical properties such as metal coordination potential, steric hindrance, electron density, and molecular flexibility.
  - Functional groups capable of acting as ligands (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, nitro, thiol) are highlighted for their role in enhancing metal-ligand interactions.
  - Structural features that impede coordination (e.g., bulky side chains, acylation, heavy fluorination) are associated with low yield.

By applying these refined rules, one can predict whether a given modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield in the reaction, based on its structural features. The rules prioritize clear and direct relationships between substructures and yield outcomes, aiming for practical applicability in selecting effective modifiers for the catalyst system.
