**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids without bulky hydrophobic side chains or acyl modifications** lead to **high yield**.
   - *Examples*:
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
   - *Counter-Examples*:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine; bulky hydrophobic side chain; results in **low yield**)
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Acylated amino group; results in **low yield**)
   - *Rationale*: α-Amino acids provide both amino and carboxyl groups for effective metal coordination, enhancing catalytic activity. Bulky hydrophobic side chains or acyl modifications can hinder metal-ligand interactions.

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with functional groups capable of metal coordination (e.g., amino, nitro, hydroxyl) at the para position** lead to **high yield**.
   - *Examples*:
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
     - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
   - *Counter-Example*:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Methyl group lacks coordination ability; results in **low yield**)
   - *Rationale*: Functional groups like amino, nitro, and hydroxyl can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance. Electron-donating or withdrawing nature affects coordination but is less critical than the group's ability to interact with metals.

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms in the ring directly attached to the carboxyl group** lead to **high yield**.
   - *Examples*:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**
   - *Counter-Example*:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Pyridine ring not directly connected to carboxyl group; results in **low yield**)
   - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles can serve as additional coordination sites, strengthening metal-ligand interactions and enhancing catalytic efficiency.

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **unsubstituted medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (6 to 8 carbons)** without additional polar groups lead to **high yield**.
   - *Example*:
     - **Octanoic acid**
   - *Counter-Examples*:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Hydroxyl group; results in **low yield**)
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Amino group; results in **low yield**)
   - *Rationale*: Unsubstituted aliphatic chains interact favorably with the catalyst surface, promoting efficient metal-ligand interactions. Polar groups can interfere with metal coordination due to competitive binding or steric hindrance.

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol (–SH) groups** lead to **high yield** when the thiol group is on an aliphatic chain.
   - *Example*:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
   - *Counter-Example*:
     - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Thiol group on aromatic ring; results in **low yield**)
   - *Rationale*: Thiol groups are strong ligands for metal coordination. In aliphatic chains, they provide effective metal-sulfur interactions without significant steric hindrance from aromatic structures.

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **compounds with multiple ether linkages in aliphatic chains terminating with a carboxylic acid group** result in **low yield**.
   - *Examples*:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**
   - *Rationale*: Ether linkages increase molecular flexibility and solubility but may hinder effective metal-ligand coordination due to conformational variability and the electron-donating nature of oxygen atoms, which can interfere with metal binding sites.

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **amino acids or peptides with acylated amino groups or additional amide linkages** lead to **low yield**.
   - *Examples*:
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
     - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**
   - *Rationale*: Acylation of amino groups and the presence of additional amide bonds decrease the availability of lone pairs on nitrogen atoms for metal coordination, weakening ligand interactions and diminishing catalytic effectiveness.

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **heavily fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids** result in **low yield**.
   - *Example*:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**
   - *Rationale*: The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine reduces electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening metal-ligand interactions and reducing catalytic activity.

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with formyl (–CHO) groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** lead to **low yield**.
   - *Examples*:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
   - *Rationale*: The presence of a formyl group adjacent to the carboxyl group can participate in intramolecular resonance or hydrogen bonding, reducing the availability of the carboxylate for coordination with metal ions and decreasing catalytic performance.

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids connected through aliphatic chains of four or more carbons to additional functional groups** lead to **high yield**.
    - *Example*:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - *Counter-Example*:
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Shorter chain; results in **low yield**)
    - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains offer greater flexibility and optimal spatial orientation for the functional groups to interact with the catalyst, enhancing metal-ligand coordination.

**End of Rules**

**Explanation and Rationale**:

- **Coverage and Balance**: The above rules are designed to cover a broad range of the dataset while maintaining a balance between simplicity and specificity. They collectively account for the majority of the observed outcomes in yield based on modifier structure.

- **Rule Modifications**:
  - **Rule 1** has been refined to exclude modifiers with bulky hydrophobic side chains or acyl modifications, providing clarity on exceptions like phenylalanine.
  - **Rule 2** emphasizes the presence of functional groups capable of metal coordination at the para position, regardless of their electron-donating or withdrawing nature, aligning with observed data (e.g., both amino and nitro groups lead to high yield).
  - **Rule 5** specifies that thiol groups on aliphatic chains lead to high yield, distinguishing from aromatic thiol compounds that result in low yield.
  - **Rule 9** focuses on aromatic carboxylic acids with adjacent formyl groups, which consistently lead to low yield due to decreased availability of the carboxylate group for coordination.
  - **Rule 10** introduces the importance of chain length in aliphatic linkers between functional groups and the carboxylic acid, explaining variations in yield based on spatial considerations.

- **Abandoned/Improved Rules**:
  - Rules with inconsistencies or poor coverage have been modified or replaced to enhance predictive accuracy. For instance, previous rules attempting to generalize the effect of electron-withdrawing groups were found to be inconsistent with the dataset and thus adjusted.

- **Physical-Chemical Considerations**:
  - The rules take into account underlying physical-chemical properties such as metal coordination potential, steric hindrance, electron density, and molecular flexibility.
  - Functional groups capable of acting as ligands (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, nitro, thiol) are highlighted for their role in enhancing metal-ligand interactions.
  - Structural features that impede coordination (e.g., bulky side chains, acylation, heavy fluorination) are associated with low yield.

By applying these refined rules, one can predict whether a given modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield in the reaction, based on its structural features. The rules prioritize clear and direct relationships between substructures and yield outcomes, aiming for practical applicability in selecting effective modifiers for the catalyst system.---------------------------------------------------------------
