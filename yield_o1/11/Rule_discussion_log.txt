Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and provides a straightforward criterion for identifying modifiers that result in high yield. The property insight is solid, explaining how the proximity of the amino group allows for chelation with metal centers, enhancing catalyst coordination. It considers a combination of sub-structures (carboxylic acid group and amino group within three carbons), adding appropriate complexity. The rule is well-supported by multiple examples and counter-examples, ensuring good coverage.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is relatively clear but could benefit from specifying which electron-withdrawing substituents are most effective. The property insight aligns with the understanding that electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing coordination with metal centers. It involves combinations of sub-structures (aromatic ring, carboxylic acid group, and electron-withdrawing substituents), providing sufficient complexity. The rule has acceptable coverage with supporting examples and counter-examples.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear and the rationale provides good property insight into why modifiers with an aldehyde group yield low reactions—due to potential interference with the catalyst. It considers the combination of functional groups (carboxylic acid and aldehyde), adding complexity. However, the coverage is minimal, supported by only two data points, which may limit the reliability of the rule.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 lacks clarity in defining "multiple hydroxyl groups" and their specific positions relative to the carboxylic acid group. The property insight is reasonable, suggesting that multiple hydroxyl groups enhance coordination through hydrogen bonding. It does consider combinations of sub-structures, but the coverage is insufficient, with only one supporting example and one counter-example. This limited data reduces the confidence in the rule's general applicability.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear and provides solid property insight by explaining that functional groups distant from the carboxyl group are less effective in coordinating with metal centers, resulting in low yield. It considers combinations of sub-structures and the effect of chain length, adding appropriate complexity. The rule has good coverage, supported by multiple examples, enhancing its reliability.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear and offers strong property insight into how an amino group on an aromatic ring enhances coordination with metal centers due to its lone pair electrons. It involves combinations of sub-structures (aromatic ring, carboxylic acid group, amino group), providing sufficient complexity. The coverage is good, with several supporting examples and a counter-example that helps refine the rule.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear, and the rationale provides sound property insight by explaining that amide groups' delocalized lone pairs reduce their ability to coordinate with metal centers, leading to low yield. It focuses on specific functional groups (amide linkages or peptide bonds), adding complexity. The coverage is adequate, supported by multiple examples, which strengthens the rule's validity.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear, specifying that perfluoroalkyl chains attached to a carboxylic acid group tend to give low yield due to their high electronegativity hindering metal interaction. The property insight is plausible. However, the coverage is insufficient, with only one supporting example. This limited data weakens the reliability and general applicability of the rule.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is reasonably clear but would benefit from a more precise definition of "electron-donating substituents" and perhaps examples of such groups. The property insight is appropriate, explaining how electron-donating groups decrease the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxyl group. It considers combinations of sub-structures, adding complexity. The coverage is acceptable but not robust, supported by two examples and a counter-example.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear, stating that modifiers with ether linkages tend to give low yield, possibly due to steric hindrance or increased solubility without enhancing catalyst interaction. The property insight is reasonable. It considers specific structural features (ether linkages), adding complexity. However, the coverage is minimal, supported by only two examples, which may limit confidence in the rule.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear and provides strong property insight into how nitrogen atoms in heterocyclic aromatic rings can enhance coordination with metal centers. It involves combinations of sub-structures (heterocyclic aromatic rings with nitrogen atoms and carboxylic acid group), adding appropriate complexity. The coverage is solid, with multiple supporting examples and a counter-example, making the rule reliable.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is clear, suggesting that thiol groups near a carboxylic acid group enhance yield by forming strong coordination bonds with metal centers. The property insight is valid. However, the coverage is inadequate, supported by only one example, which diminishes the rule's reliability and general applicability.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is complex and may lack clarity due to its specificity (ketone group adjacent to a carboxylic acid group attached to an aromatic ring). The property insight is reasonable, proposing that this combination increases coordination sites. However, the coverage is minimal, with only one supporting example and one counter-example, making the rule appear too specific and less reliable.

**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and well-defined, focusing on modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and an amino group within four carbons of the carboxyl group. The physical-chemical insight is solid, attributing high yields to enhanced chelation with metal centers due to the proximity of the amino group. It effectively considers combinations of functional groups and is supported by multiple data points (Entries 0, 2, 3), meeting the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is straightforward, describing modifiers with a carboxylic acid directly attached to an aromatic ring bearing electron-withdrawing substituents. The rationale is sound, linking increased acidity and coordination ability to the presence of electron-withdrawing groups. It combines sub-structural elements and is supported by several examples (Entries 1, 20) and counter-examples (Entries 22, 30), fulfilling the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 clearly identifies modifiers containing both a carboxylic acid and an aldehyde group as leading to low yields. The provided insight—that aldehyde groups may engage in side reactions or inhibit catalyst activity—is reasonable. It considers a combination of functional groups and is backed by at least two data points (Entries 18, 19), satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 addresses modifiers with amide linkages or peptide bonds, associating them with low yields. The rationale provided is that resonance stabilization reduces their ability to coordinate with metal centers, which is chemically plausible. It looks at specific functional groups in combination and is supported by multiple data points (Entries 23, 26, 33), meeting the coverage standard.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 pertains to modifiers containing heterocyclic aromatic rings with nitrogen atoms directly attached to a carboxylic acid group, resulting in high yields. The physical-chemical insight is appropriate, emphasizing additional coordination sites from nitrogen atoms. While generally clear, the term "directly attached" could be more precise. It considers complex sub-structures and is supported by examples (Entries 8, 15, 21) and a counter-example (Entry 11), fulfilling the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear in identifying modifiers with a carboxylic acid and a nearby thiol group as leading to high yields. The rationale about strong coordination bonds with metal centers is credible. However, coverage is limited to a single example (Entry 17), which does not meet the criterion of having at least two supporting data points.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 clearly describes modifiers with perfluoroalkyl chains attached to a carboxylic acid group, associated with low yields. The provided insight is acceptable, noting the potential for these groups to hinder coordination due to their electronegativity. Nevertheless, only one data point (Entry 13) supports this rule, falling short on the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 effectively states that modifiers with long aliphatic chains and terminal amino or hydroxyl groups distant from the carboxylic acid group result in low yields. The rationale is sound, explaining the reduced effectiveness in metal coordination. It considers the combination of structural features and is supported by multiple data points (Entries 29, 31, 34), satisfying the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 identifies modifiers containing ether linkages as leading to low yields. The physical-chemical insight provided is reasonable, suggesting that ether oxygens may not coordinate effectively and could introduce steric hindrance. It focuses on specific functional groups and is backed by at least two data points (Entries 10, 32), meeting the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 discusses modifiers with a ketone group adjacent to a carboxylic acid attached to an aromatic ring, resulting in high yields. The rationale is convincing, highlighting increased coordination sites. While the rule is complex, it is clear and considers multiple sub-structures. It is supported by examples (Entries 16, 25) and a counter-example (Entry 27), fulfilling the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear, linking modifiers with aromatic rings bearing electron-donating substituents to low yields. The insight about decreased acidity and coordination ability is valid. It effectively considers combinations of sub-structures and is supported by multiple data points (Entries 22, 26, 30). However, the counter-example (Entry 7) suggests exceptions to the rule, indicating that other structural factors may influence the outcome.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 states that simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups tend to give high yields. While the rule is clear, it lacks depth in physical-chemical insight, providing only a general rationale about simplicity aiding coordination. Coverage is insufficient, as it is supported by only one data point (Entry 5), which does not meet the coverage criterion.

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **long aliphatic chains bearing functional groups (e.g., amino or hydroxyl) distant from the carboxylic acid group** tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Functional groups far from the carboxyl group are less effective in coordinating with the metal center.

    - **Examples**:
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Entry 31) – Low Yield
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Entry 34) – Low Yield

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers containing **ketone groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid on an aromatic system** tend to give a **high yield**.

    - **Rationale**: The synergy between the ketone and carboxylic acid groups enhances coordination with the metal center.

    - **Example**:
      - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Entry 16) – High Yield

    - **Counter-Example**:
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Entry 27) – Low Yield (lack of aromatic system may reduce coordination effectiveness)

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers with **bulky hydrophobic side chains on α-amino acids** tend to give a **low yield**, unless the side chain contains heteroatoms that can coordinate.

    - **Rationale**: Bulky hydrophobic groups can hinder effective coordination unless they introduce additional binding sites.

    - **Examples**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Entry 12) – Low Yield (phenylalanine)
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Entry 14) – High Yield (tryptophan; indole nitrogen aids coordination)

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers with **flexible aliphatic linkers connecting aromatic systems to the carboxylic acid group** tend to give a **low yield** if the linker reduces effective coordination.

    - **Rationale**: Flexible linkers may prevent the aromatic system from properly aligning for coordination with the metal center.

    - **Examples**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** (Entry 24) – High Yield (optimal linker length)
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30) – Low Yield (linker may be too flexible or long)

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and specifies that α-amino acids with polar or acidic side chains give high yield. It has strong property insight, emphasizing enhanced metal coordination. The rule considers combinations of substructures (α-amino acid backbone with specific side chains) and is supported by multiple data points (Entries 0 and 2 as examples, Entry 12 as a counter-example), satisfying the criteria.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 states that benzoic acid derivatives with electron-withdrawing groups at the para-position give high yield. While the rule is clear and offers property insight, it lacks coverage and has contradictions. For instance, **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Entry 4) has an electron-donating group but yields a high yield, which contradicts the rule. This indicates the rule needs refinement to account for such exceptions.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 suggests that electron-donating groups at the para-position lead to low yield. Although the rule is clear, it fails to account for exceptions like **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Entry 4) which has an electron-donating group yet gives a high yield. The property insight is reasonable, but the coverage is insufficient, and the rule requires modification to address these inconsistencies.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear, stating that modifiers with both a carboxylic acid group and an aldehyde group on the aromatic ring lead to low yield. It has solid property insight regarding potential side reactions or inhibition of catalyst activity. The rule is supported by multiple data points (Entries 18 and 19) and satisfies the criteria.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 claims that aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of C6-C8 give high yield. While the rule is clear and provides property insight, it lacks sufficient coverage with only one supporting example (**octanoic acid**, Entry 5) and limited consideration of counter-examples. The rule requires more data points to be convincing.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear and focuses on heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen atoms adjacent to a carboxylic acid group, leading to high yield. The property insight is strong, explaining enhanced coordination. The rule considers specific structural combinations and is supported by data points (Entries 15 and 21), meeting the criteria.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 indicates that ether linkages in the aliphatic chain result in low yield. The rule is clear with acceptable property insight about the effect of ethers on coordination and solubility. It has examples supporting it (Entries 10 and 32) but could benefit from additional data points for stronger coverage.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 states that thiol groups proximal to the carboxylic acid lead to high yield. Although the rule is clear and offers good property insight, it is supported by only one data point (**3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**, Entry 17), which is insufficient coverage according to the criteria.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 posits that multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid group result in high yield. The rule is clear with solid property insight about chelation. However, it has only one supporting example (**Entry 9**), lacking sufficient coverage.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 suggests that perfluorinated carboxylic acids give low yield due to destabilization of metal centers. The rule is clear and provides property insight, but it is based on a single data point (**Entry 13**) and lacks broader coverage.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 states that modifiers containing amide or peptide bonds tend to give a low yield. The rule is clear, with strong property insight regarding resonance delocalization of lone pairs. It considers combinations of substructures and is supported by multiple data points (Entries 23 and 33), meeting the criteria.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 indicates that long aliphatic chains with distant functional groups lead to low yield. The rule is clear and provides adequate property insight. It is supported by several data points (Entries 31 and 34), satisfying the criteria.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 claims that ketone groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid on an aromatic system yield high yield. While the rule is clear and offers property insight, it is supported by only one example (**Entry 16**), lacking sufficient coverage.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 mentions that bulky hydrophobic side chains on α-amino acids tend to give low yield unless they contain coordinating heteroatoms. The rule is clear, with good property insight. It considers structural combinations and is supported by examples (Entries 12 and 14), satisfying the criteria.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 suggests that flexible aliphatic linkers connecting aromatic systems to the carboxylic acid group tend to give low yield if they reduce effective coordination. The rule is complex and could benefit from improved clarity. It requires more data points and refinement to fully meet the criteria.

     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 33) – Low Yield (Modified lysine; amide reduces coordination ability)

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **benzoic acid derivatives with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, haloalkyl) at the para-position** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group and enhance the ability of the aromatic ring to coordinate with metal centers.

   - **Examples**:
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Entry 1) – High Yield
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Entry 20) – High Yield

   - **Counter-Example**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 22) – Low Yield (Methyl group is electron-donating)

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **benzoic acid derivatives with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxyl) at the para-position** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing its coordination ability with metal centers.

   - **Examples**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 22) – Low Yield
     - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Entry 7) – High Yield (Exception due to aliphatic linker increasing flexibility)
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30) – Low Yield

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers containing an **aldehyde group ortho or para to the carboxylic acid on an aromatic ring** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Aldehyde groups can act as competing ligands or deactivate catalysts through side reactions.

   - **Examples**:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19) – Low Yield
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 18) – Low Yield

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium chain lengths (C5-C8) and no additional functional groups** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Optimal chain length balances hydrophobic interactions and solubility, facilitating effective catalyst-modifier interaction.

   - **Example**:
     - **Octanoic acid** (Entry 5) – High Yield

   - **Counter-Examples**:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Entry 29) – Low Yield (Hydroxyl group may interfere with coordination)

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing **heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen atoms adjacent to the carboxylic acid group** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles can serve as additional coordination sites, enhancing binding to metal centers.

   - **Examples**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Entry 21) – High Yield
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 15) – High Yield

   - **Counter-Example**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 11) – Low Yield (Pyridyl group at para-position may not effectively coordinate due to steric hindrance)

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers with **multiple ether linkages in the aliphatic chain** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Ether oxygens may not coordinate effectively and increase solubility in the solvent, reducing interaction with the catalyst.

   - **Examples**:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 10) – Low Yield
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32) – Low Yield

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **thiol or thioether groups proximal to the carboxylic acid group** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Sulfur atoms can form strong coordination bonds with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

   - **Examples**:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 17) – High Yield
     - **(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoic acid** (Derived from Entry 23 without amide linkage) – Would predict High Yield if not for amide bond in actual compound

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups (polyols) near the carboxylic acid group** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can chelate metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity.

   - **Example**:
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Entry 9) – High Yield

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **perfluorinated carboxylic acids** tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Strong electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms decrease the electron density on the carboxylate, hindering effective coordination.

    - **Example**:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Entry 13) – Low Yield

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers containing **amide bonds adjacent to the carboxylic acid group** tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Amide nitrogens are less available for coordination due to resonance delocalization; amide linkage may also alter binding geometry unfavorably.

    - **Examples**:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 33) – Low Yield
      - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (Entry 23) – Low Yield

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **long aliphatic chains bearing amino or hydroxyl groups distant (>4 carbons) from the carboxylic acid group** tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Distant functional groups are less effective in chelating the metal center, and long chains may introduce steric hindrance.

    - **Examples**:
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Entry 31) – Low Yield
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Entry 34) – Low Yield

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers containing **ketone or keto-enol groups conjugated with the carboxylic acid on an aromatic system** tend to give a **high yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Conjugated ketones can delocalize electron density and participate in chelation, enhancing coordination.

    - **Examples**:
      - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Entry 16) – High Yield
      - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 8) – High Yield

    - **Counter-Example**:
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Entry 27) – Low Yield (Aliphatic ketone may not effectively coordinate)

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups ortho to the carboxyl group** tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Ortho-hydroxyl groups can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds, reducing availability for metal coordination.

    - **Example**:
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 18) – Low Yield
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Entry 26) – Low Yield (Hydroxyl may be involved in intramolecular interactions)

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers with **flexible aliphatic linkers connecting non-coordinating aromatic groups to the carboxylic acid** tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Flexible linkers may prevent proper alignment of coordinating groups, and non-coordinating aromatics may not contribute beneficially.

    - **Examples**:
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30) – Low Yield
      - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (Entry 25) – High Yield (Exception due to ketone group enhancing coordination)

It combines structural elements and is supported by examples and a counter-example, demonstrating adequate coverage.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 effectively indicates that electron-donating groups on benzoic acid derivatives lead to a low yield. The rationale is sound, correlating decreased acidity with reduced coordination. While there is an exception (Entry 7), the rule generally holds true and is supported by examples, showing balanced complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear in stating that modifiers with aldehyde groups ortho or para to the carboxylic acid result in a low yield. The rationale involving potential side reactions is reasonable. The rule is straightforward and supported by two examples, meeting the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 suggests that medium-chain aliphatic acids without additional functional groups tend to give a high yield. The rationale about balancing hydrophobic interactions and solubility is plausible. It combines chain length and absence of functional groups, but the coverage could be improved by including more data points or addressing counter-examples like Entry 29.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 clearly identifies that heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with adjacent nitrogen atoms lead to a high yield. The physical-chemical insight about additional coordination sites is strong. The rule is complex, involving heterocycles and coordinating atoms, and is well-supported by examples and a counter-example, demonstrating good coverage.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 states that modifiers with multiple ether linkages result in a low yield. The rationale regarding ineffective coordination and increased solubility is acceptable. The rule is clear but has limited coverage with only two examples. Including more data points would strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 indicates that modifiers with thiol or thioether groups near the carboxylic acid give a high yield. The rationale about strong sulfur-metal coordination is solid. However, the rule relies on limited data, with only one strong example (Entry 17). Coverage would benefit from additional supporting examples.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 highlights that modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxylic acid tend to give a high yield. The chelation rationale is sound. However, the rule is based on a single example (Entry 9), limiting its coverage. More data points are needed to reinforce the rule.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 posits that perfluorinated carboxylic acids lead to a low yield due to reduced coordination ability. While the rationale is logical, the rule is supported by only one example (Entry 13), limiting its coverage. Additional data would enhance its validity.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 observes that modifiers with amide bonds adjacent to the carboxylic acid result in a low yield. The rationale involving reduced coordination due to resonance is appropriate. The rule is supported by two examples, meeting the coverage criterion, and balances complexity and insight effectively.

The rationale about ineffective chelation and steric hindrance is plausible. The rule is clear, combines structural elements, and is supported by multiple examples, demonstrating strong coverage.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 suggests that modifiers with conjugated ketone groups on aromatic systems lead to a high yield. While the rationale about enhanced coordination is reasonable, the rule has limited coverage with few examples and a counter-example (Entry 27). Refinement and additional data could strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 specifies that ortho-hydroxyl groups on aromatic carboxylic acids lead to a low yield due to intramolecular hydrogen bonding. The rationale is sound, but the rule is supported by limited data. Including more examples would improve coverage and confidence in the rule.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 notes that flexible aliphatic linkers connecting non-coordinating aromatics to carboxylic acids tend to give a low yield. The rationale regarding misalignment and ineffectiveness is plausible. However, the rule has limited supporting data and exceptions (e.g., Entry 25). Refinement and additional examples are needed for stronger support.

   - **Counter-Examples**:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Entry 29) – Low Yield (Hydroxyl group may interfere with coordination)
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Entry 31) – Low Yield (Amino group may introduce unfavorable interactions)

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms in positions favorable for coordination (e.g., adjacent or orthogonal to the carboxyl group)** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in the ring can serve as additional coordination sites, enhancing metal binding and catalyst performance.

   - **Examples**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Entry 21) – High Yield (Nitrogen atom adjacent to carboxyl group)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 15) – High Yield (Pyrazole ring with coordinating nitrogen)

   - **Counter-Example**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 11) – Low Yield (Pyridyl group at para-position may not effectively coordinate due to steric factors)

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing **functional groups capable of strong metal coordination (e.g., thiol, multiple adjacent hydroxyls) near the carboxylate group** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: These groups can chelate the metal center, increasing catalyst stability and reactivity.

   - **Examples**:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 17) – High Yield (Thiol group enhances coordination)
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Entry 9) – High Yield (Multiple hydroxyls for chelation)

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers with **multiple ether linkages or flexible polar chains (e.g., polyether chains)** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Ether oxygens are less effective as coordinating ligands and increase solubility in the solvent, reducing interactions with the catalyst surface.

   - **Examples**:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 10) – Low Yield (Multiple ether linkages)
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32) – Low Yield (Flexible ether-containing chain)

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **amide bonds adjacent to the carboxylic acid group** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Amide groups can reduce coordination ability due to resonance delocalization of the lone pair on the nitrogen, altering binding geometry unfavorably.

     - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Entry 26) – Low Yield (Amide linkage affects coordination)

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **perfluorinated carboxylic acids (carboxylic acids with perfluoroalkyl chains)** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Strong electron-withdrawing effects of perfluoroalkyl groups decrease electron density on the carboxylate, hindering effective metal coordination.

   - **Example**:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Entry 13) – Low Yield (Perfluorinated chain)

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing **aldehyde groups on an aromatic ring, especially when adjacent to coordinating groups like hydroxyls** tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Aldehyde groups may interfere with metal coordination or participate in side reactions, reducing catalyst effectiveness.

    - **Examples**:
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 18) – Low Yield (Aldehyde and hydroxyl groups may chelate unfavorably)
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19) – Low Yield (Aldehyde group adjacent to carboxylate)

**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: **Rule 1** is clear and well-defined, allowing for easy identification of modifiers fitting the criteria of α-amino acids with polar or coordinating side chains. The property insight is strong, as it links the enhanced metal-ligand interactions to the presence of additional coordination sites provided by polar functional groups. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures (the α-amino acid backbone and specific side chains), fulfilling the complexity criterion. With at least three supporting data points (Entries 0, 2, and 14) and a clear counter-example (Entry 12), the coverage is adequate. Overall, the rule achieves a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 2** is clearly stated, focusing on aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents directly attached to the ring. The property insight is solid, explaining how increased acidity enhances metal coordination. The complexity is appropriate, addressing specific substituents and their positions. Coverage is sufficient with multiple examples (Entries 1, 16, and 20) and a counter-example (Entry 22), satisfying the coverage criterion. The rule maintains a good balance, effectively linking structural features to yield outcomes.

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 3** is clear, outlining that electron-donating substituents on aromatic carboxylic acids lead to low yields. The property insight logically explains the decreased acidity and coordination ability. Complexity is appropriate, considering the type of substituents. The rule is supported by several data points (Entries 22, 26, and 30) and acknowledges an exception (Entry 7), which demonstrates depth in understanding. The coverage is adequate, and the balance between simplicity and explanatory power is well-maintained.

- **Comment 4**: **Rule 4** is straightforward, specifying medium-length straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups. The property insight is acceptable, but somewhat general. The coverage is limited, with only one supporting example (Entry 5) and few modifiers matching the criteria, which diminishes its strength. To improve coverage, the rule could be expanded to include similar chain lengths or slightly varied functional groups, enhancing its applicability without sacrificing clarity.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** offers clarity in identifying heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms positioned favorably for coordination. The property insight is strong, highlighting the role of nitrogen in metal binding. Complexity is satisfactory, considering specific positions of heteroatoms. With two supporting examples (Entries 15 and 21) and a counter-example (Entry 11), the coverage meets the minimum requirement but could be strengthened by additional data points. The balance is acceptable, though extending coverage would enhance the rule's robustness.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** is somewhat broad, encompassing modifiers with functional groups capable of strong metal coordination near the carboxylate group. While the property insight is solid, the clarity could be improved by specifying which functional groups (e.g., thiols, multiple adjacent hydroxyls) are included. The coverage is minimal, relying on two examples (Entries 9 and 17). To enhance the rule, it could be refined to focus on specific functional groups and include more supporting data, thereby improving clarity and coverage.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** is clear in its description of modifiers with multiple ether linkages or flexible polar chains leading to low yields. The property insight effectively explains the reduced catalyst interaction. Complexity is appropriate, considering the impact of multiple ether groups. Coverage is limited but acceptable with two supporting examples (Entries 10 and 32). The balance between complexity and coverage is reasonable, but the rule could be strengthened by identifying additional examples to increase its applicability.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** clearly identifies modifiers with amide bonds adjacent to the carboxylic acid as leading to low yields. The property insight is logical, addressing resonance effects on coordination. Complexity is sufficient, focusing on the specific structural arrangement. Coverage is minimal, with two examples (Entries 26 and 33). Enhancing the rule with more data points or exploring related structures could improve coverage and strengthen its predictive power.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** is clear but has very limited coverage, supported by only one data point (Entry 13). The property insight is reasonable, but the lack of additional examples weakens the rule's reliability. To meet the coverage criterion and improve the rule, more data points involving perfluorinated carboxylic acids would be needed, if available in the dataset.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** is clear in stating that modifiers with aldehyde groups on aromatic rings, especially adjacent to coordinating groups, lead to low yields. The property insight is sound, explaining potential interference with metal coordination. Complexity is appropriate. Coverage meets the minimum with two examples (Entries 18 and 19). The rule balances clarity and complexity well, but additional supporting data would enhance its reliability and adherence to the coverage criterion.

   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Bromomethyl group)
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Nitro group)
   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Methyl group is electron-donating)
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Hydroxyl group is electron-donating)

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating nitrogen atoms in positions favorable for metal binding (e.g., adjacent to the carboxyl group)** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in the ring can serve as additional coordination sites, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and catalyst performance.

   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nitrogen atom adjacent to carboxyl group)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Pyrazole ring with coordinating nitrogen)
   - **Low Yield Counter-Example**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Pyridyl group may not effectively coordinate due to unfavorable positioning)

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-chain lengths (C6–C8) and no additional polar functional groups** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: The optimal chain length facilitates hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst surface while the carboxylate group effectively coordinates with the metal center.

   - **High Yield Example**:
     - **Octanoic acid** (Eight-carbon chain)
   - **Low Yield Counter-Example**:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Presence of amino group may interfere with coordination)

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing **additional coordinating functional groups such as thiols or multiple adjacent hydroxyls near the carboxylate group** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: These functional groups can chelate the metal center, forming more stable complexes and enhancing catalytic activity.

   - **Examples**:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Thiol group enhances coordination)
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Multiple hydroxyls for chelation)

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids fused with additional carbonyl groups within the ring structure** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Additional carbonyl groups can participate in resonance stabilization and metal coordination, enhancing catalytic activity.

   - **Example**:
     - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Fused ketone groups)

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing **functional groups that hinder metal coordination, such as aldehyde groups adjacent to the carboxylate, amide bonds near the carboxylate, or strongly electron-withdrawing perfluoroalkyl groups**, tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Aldehydes may interfere with coordination or participate in side reactions; amide groups can reduce coordination ability due to resonance delocalization; perfluoroalkyl groups excessively decrease electron density on the carboxylate oxygen.

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Aldehyde group adjacent to carboxylate)
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Amide group adjacent to carboxylate)
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Perfluorinated chain)

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers with **bulky, non-coordinating substituents near the carboxylate group**, such as **aromatic rings without additional coordinating groups**, tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Bulky groups can introduce steric hindrance, reducing the effectiveness of metal coordination and catalyst performance.

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine; bulky phenyl group)
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Bulky aromatic ring with electron-donating hydroxyl group)

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **flexible polar chains with ether linkages (polyether chains) or multiple amino groups** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Ether oxygens and amino groups may not coordinate effectively and can increase solubility in the solvent, reducing interaction with the catalyst surface.

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Multiple ether linkages)
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Flexible ether-containing chain with amino group)

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **long aliphatic chains containing polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl or amino groups) distant from the carboxylate** tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Polar groups far from the carboxylate may not effectively participate in metal coordination and can interfere with catalyst interaction or solubility.

    - **Low Yield Examples**:
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Hydroxyl group distant from carboxylate)
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Amino group distant from carboxylate)

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **linear dicarboxylic acids without additional interfering functional groups may give variable yields depending on chain length**, with shorter chains potentially giving a **high yield** and longer or more substituted chains giving a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Two carboxylate groups can enhance coordination, but longer chains or additional groups may introduce steric hindrance or alter coordination geometry.

    - **High Yield Potential**:
      - **Modifiers with short dicarboxylic chains (e.g., succinic acid)**
    - **Low Yield Example**:
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Ketone group may interfere with coordination)

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows for straightforward determination of high-yield modifiers when they are **α-amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxyl groups or nitrogen-containing heterocycles**. It provides excellent property insight by linking the presence of chelating groups to enhanced metal coordination. The rule considers combinations of substructures (amino acid backbone and specific side chains) and is well-supported by multiple data points (entries 0, 2, and 14 with high yield; entry 12 as a counter-example). The balance between complexity and coverage is effective.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear in its distinction between **electron-withdrawing and electron-donating substituents** on aromatic carboxylic acids, leading to high or low yields, respectively. The property insight is solid, explaining how substituents influence acidity and coordination ability. The rule combines substructures (aromatic ring, carboxylate, and substituents) and is backed by several data points (entries 1 and 20 for high yield; entries 22 and 30 for low yield). The balance between complexity and coverage is well-maintained.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 provides a clear description of **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating nitrogen atoms in favorable positions**, leading to high yield. The property insight is appropriate, highlighting the role of nitrogen atoms in metal coordination. It considers positional isomerism, and is supported by data (entries 15 and 21 with high yield; entry 11 as a counter-example). The rule balances complexity and coverage effectively.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear regarding **aliphatic carboxylic acids of medium chain length (C6–C8) without additional polar functional groups** leading to high yield. However, the coverage is limited, with only one high-yield example (entry 5) and a counter-example (entry 31). The rule lacks sufficient data points to strongly support it. The balance between complexity and coverage could be improved to enhance its reliability.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear and relates modifiers with **additional coordinating functional groups such as thiols or multiple adjacent hydroxyls near the carboxylate** to high yield. The property insight is sound, focusing on chelation enhancing metal coordination. The rule combines substructures effectively and is supported by data (entries 9 and 17 with high yield). The balance between complexity and coverage is acceptable.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is specific but may lack clarity due to its narrow focus on **aromatic carboxylic acids fused with additional carbonyl groups within the ring structure**. The coverage is limited, with only one supporting data point (entry 16). Therefore, the rule may not be well-supported by the data, and the balance between complexity and coverage is suboptimal.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear in identifying **functional groups that hinder metal coordination**, predicting low-yield modifiers accordingly. The property insight is valid, explaining how certain groups interfere with coordination. It considers combinations of substructures and is supported by multiple data points (entries 13, 19, and 33 with low yield). The balance between complexity and coverage is good.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 lacks clarity due to its broad definition of **"bulky, non-coordinating substituents near the carboxylate group"**. It may not consistently predict yields, as there is a high-yield example (entry 7) that contradicts the rule. The coverage is inconsistent, and the balance between complexity and coverage could be improved to avoid contradictions.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear regarding modifiers with **flexible polar chains with ether linkages or multiple amino groups** leading to low yield. The property insight is appropriate, focusing on decreased catalyst interaction. It considers combinations of substructures and is supported by data (entries 10 and 32 with low yield). The balance between complexity and coverage is acceptable.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 clearly states that modifiers with **long aliphatic chains containing polar groups distant from the carboxylate** result in low yield. The property insight is reasonable, explaining how distant polar groups may not aid coordination and could interfere with catalyst interaction. It is supported by data (entries 29 and 34 with low yield). The balance between complexity and coverage is good.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is ambiguous, stating that modifiers **may give variable yields depending on chain length**, with no clear guidelines. The coverage is limited, with only one low-yield example (entry 27) and no high-yield examples. The rule lacks clarity, sufficient data support, and the balance between complexity and coverage is poor.

While the property insight is logical, the coverage is limited, supported by only one data point (nonafluoropentanoic acid). This limits the rule's robustness and generalizability.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear about functional groups that may interfere with metal coordination causing low yield. The property insight is strong, explaining potential interference and competition. Complexity is appropriate, considering various interfering groups. Coverage is strong, with multiple supporting examples (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid, 4-oxoheptanedioic acid).

**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with side chains containing additional coordinating groups**, such as **extra carboxylate groups or nitrogen-containing heterocycles**, tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Additional coordinating groups enhance chelation with metal centers, stabilizing the catalyst and improving its efficiency.

   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid; extra carboxylate group)
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid; extra carboxylate group)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan; indole ring containing nitrogen)

   - **Low Yield Counter-Example**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine; lacks additional coordinating groups)

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing substituents** (e.g., **nitro, halogens**) attached directly to the aromatic ring tend to give a **high yield**, whereas those with **electron-donating substituents** (e.g., **alkyl, methoxy, hydroxyl groups**) tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylate, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and weaken metal coordination.

   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Bromomethyl group is electron-withdrawing)
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing)

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Methyl group is electron-donating)
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Hydroxyl group is electron-donating)

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing **nitrogenous heterocycles capable of coordinating with metals**, such as **pyridine or pyrazole carboxylic acids**, tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles act as additional coordination sites, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and catalyst performance.

   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid; pyridine ring with nitrogen)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Pyrazole ring with coordinating nitrogen)

   - **Low Yield Counter-Example**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Possible steric hindrance or unfavorable coordination geometry)

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium chain lengths (C6–C8)** and **no additional polar functional groups** tend to give a **high yield**. Those with **polar groups distant from the carboxylate** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Medium-chain aliphatic acids without interfering groups provide optimal hydrophobic interactions and solubility, facilitating effective catalyst interaction.

   - **High Yield Example**:
     - **Octanoic acid** (Eight-carbon chain with no additional functional groups)

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Hydroxyl group distant from carboxylate)
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Amino group distant from carboxylate)
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing **thiol groups near the carboxylate**, such as **mercapto carboxylic acids**, tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Thiol groups can form strong bonds with metal centers, enhancing coordination and catalyst stability.

   - **High Yield Example**:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Thiol group adjacent to carboxylate)

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers with **multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxylate**, such as **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids**, tend to give a **high yield**. Conversely, modifiers with **multiple ether linkages** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Adjacent hydroxyl groups can participate in chelation, enhancing coordination. Ether linkages may not contribute effectively to coordination and might increase flexibility.

   - **High Yield Example**:
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid; multiple hydroxyl groups)

   - **Low Yield Example**:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Contains multiple ether linkages)

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that have **aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxylate**, or **amide bonds near the carboxylate**, tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: These functional groups may compete with the carboxylate for metal coordination or interfere with catalyst activity.

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Aldehyde group adjacent to carboxylate)
     - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Ketone group near carboxylate)
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Amide group near carboxylate)

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **strong electron-withdrawing groups that excessively reduce electron density on the carboxylate**, such as **perfluoroalkyl chains**, tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Overly electron-deficient carboxylate groups may not coordinate effectively with metal centers.

   - **Low Yield Example**:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Perfluorinated chain)

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **bulky aromatic side chains without additional coordinating groups**, especially when adjacent to the carboxylate, tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Bulky groups can introduce steric hindrance, reducing the efficiency of metal coordination.

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine; bulky phenyl group)
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Bulky aromatic ring with hydroxyl group)

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that have **polyether chains or multiple ether linkages**, especially when distant from the carboxylate group, tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Ether oxygen atoms are weakly coordinating, and flexible chains may reduce effective interaction with the catalyst.

    - **Low Yield Examples**:
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Multiple ether linkages with amino group)
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Multiple ether linkages)

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear in specifying that amino acids with side chains containing additional coordinating groups, such as extra carboxylate groups or nitrogen-containing heterocycles, tend to give a high yield. The rationale provides adequate physical-chemical insight by explaining how additional coordinating groups enhance chelation with metal centers, stabilizing the catalyst. The rule considers combinations of structural features (amino acid backbone and side chain functionality), satisfying the complexity criterion. It is well-supported by multiple data points in the dataset (entries 0, 2, and 14 for high yield, and entry 12 as a low yield counter-example), fulfilling the coverage requirement. Therefore, Rule 1 effectively meets all the criteria.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 clearly defines that aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing substituents lead to a high yield, while those with electron-donating substituents lead to a low yield. The rationale offers property insight by relating substituent effects to carboxylate acidity and coordination ability. The rule demonstrates complexity by considering both the aromatic system and the nature of substituents. It is supported by data points (entries 1 and 20 for high yield, entries 22 and 18 for low yield). However, there is an exception with 4-aminobenzoic acid (entry 4), which has an electron-donating amino group yet gives a high yield. This suggests that the rule may need refinement to account for cases where electron-donating groups can coordinate with metals, indicating that the coverage might not fully encompass all relevant data points.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear in identifying that modifiers containing nitrogenous heterocycles capable of coordinating with metals tend to give a high yield. The rationale provides solid property insight into the role of nitrogen atoms as additional coordination sites. The rule demonstrates complexity by focusing on specific heterocycles combined with carboxylic acids. It is supported by data points (entries 15 and 21 for high yield) and includes a counter-example (entry 11 for low yield). However, the high yield of 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid (entry 24) suggests that linker length and steric factors influence the outcome. The rule could be improved by incorporating these factors to enhance its clarity and coverage.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 clearly states that medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (C6–C8) without additional polar functional groups tend to give a high yield, while those with polar groups distant from the carboxylate give a low yield. The rationale provides property insight into how hydrophobic interactions and optimal solubility facilitate effective catalyst interaction. The rule demonstrates complexity by considering chain length and the presence or absence of functional groups. It is well-supported by data points (entry 5 for high yield; entries 29, 31, and 34 for low yield), satisfying the coverage criterion. Rule 4 effectively meets all the criteria.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear in specifying that modifiers containing thiol groups near the carboxylate tend to give a high yield. The rationale offers property insight into the strong bonding of thiol groups with metal centers. However, the rule lacks complexity as it focuses on a single functional group and has limited coverage with only one supporting data point (entry 17). To strengthen the rule, additional examples or broader functional group considerations could be included to enhance coverage and meet the criteria more effectively.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 effectively distinguishes between modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxylate, leading to high yield, and those with multiple ether linkages, leading to low yield. The rationale provides adequate property insight into the chelation ability of hydroxyl groups versus the less effective coordination of ether linkages. The rule demonstrates complexity by considering combinations of functional groups and their positions relative to the carboxylate. It is well-supported by data points (entries 6 and 9 for high yield; entries 10 and 32 for low yield), fulfilling the coverage requirement. Rule 6 meets all the criteria effectively.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 clearly states that modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxylate, or amide bonds near the carboxylate, tend to give a low yield. The rationale offers property insight into possible competition for metal coordination or interference with catalyst activity. The rule considers combinations of functional groups, indicating complexity. It is supported by multiple data points (entries 19, 27, and 33), satisfying the coverage criterion. Rule 7 effectively meets all the criteria.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 specifies that modifiers containing strong electron-withdrawing groups like perfluoroalkyl chains tend to give a low yield. While the rationale provides property insight into the electron-deficient carboxylate's reduced coordination ability, the rule lacks complexity and has limited coverage, being supported by only one data point (entry 13). To improve the rule, additional examples or a broader range of electron-withdrawing groups could be considered to enhance coverage and meet the criteria more fully.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear in indicating that modifiers with bulky aromatic side chains without additional coordinating groups tend to give a low yield due to steric hindrance. The rationale provides adequate property insight. The rule demonstrates complexity by focusing on steric effects and the absence of coordinating groups. It is supported by data points (entries 12 and 30 for low yield). However, the high yield of 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid (entry 7) suggests that the distance of the bulky group from the carboxylate may mitigate steric hindrance. Refining the rule to account for the position of the bulky group could enhance its clarity and coverage.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 clearly states that modifiers with polyether chains or multiple ether linkages, especially when distant from the carboxylate group, tend to give a low yield. The rationale provides property insight into how weakly coordinating ether oxygen atoms and chain flexibility may reduce effective catalyst interaction. The rule demonstrates complexity by considering both the presence of ether linkages and their position. It is supported by data points (entries 10 and 32 for low yield), satisfying the coverage criterion. Rule 10 effectively meets all the criteria.
