**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing a **carboxylic acid group** and an **amino group at the alpha or beta position** (adjacent or one carbon away from the carboxyl group) tend to give **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The proximity of the amino group to the carboxylic acid can facilitate chelation with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity.
  - *Examples*: 
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Entry 0) – High Yield
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Entry 2) – High Yield
    - 5-aminopentanoic acid (Entry 3) – High Yield
  - *Counter-Examples*: 
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid (Entry 31) – Low Yield (amino group too far from carboxyl group)
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid (Entry 34) – Low Yield

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers containing a **carboxylic acid group** and an **amino group directly attached to an aromatic ring** tend to give **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aromatic amino groups can engage in π-coordination and enhance electronic interactions with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*: 
    - 4-aminobenzoic acid (Entry 4) – High Yield
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Entry 21) – High Yield
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid (Entry 15) – High Yield
  - *Counter-Example*: 
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (Entry 11) – Low Yield (amino group not directly attached to carboxyl-bearing ring)

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a **carboxylic acid group** and an **aldehyde group** tend to give **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can react with amines or other nucleophiles, deactivating the modifier or interfering with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*: 
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid (Entry 19) – Low Yield
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (Entry 18) – Low Yield

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers containing a **perfluoroalkyl chain** attached to a carboxylic acid group tend to give **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Perfluorinated chains increase hydrophobicity and can hinder interaction with the catalyst due to steric and electronic effects.
  - *Example*: 
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid (Entry 13) – Low Yield

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing **ether linkages** (polyether chains) attached to a carboxylic acid group tend to give **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether chains can chelate metal centers differently or increase solubility in the solvent rather than interacting effectively with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*: 
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid (Entry 10) – Low Yield
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid (Entry 32) – Low Yield

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing a **carboxylic acid group** and **multiple hydroxyl groups** tend to give **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups can enhance hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst, improving its performance.
  - *Example*: 
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Entry 9) – High Yield
  - *Counter-Example*: 
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid (Entry 29) – Low Yield (only one hydroxyl group)

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing a **carboxylic acid group** and a **thiol group** tend to give **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Thiol groups can form strong bonds with metal centers, stabilizing the catalyst and enhancing reactivity.
  - *Example*: 
    - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid (Entry 17) – High Yield

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing a **nitro group attached to an aromatic ring** along with a carboxylic acid group tend to give **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Nitro groups are strong electron-withdrawing groups, which can enhance coordination with metal catalysts through resonance effects.
  - *Example*: 
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid (Entry 20) – High Yield

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing an **aromatic ring with electron-donating groups** (e.g., methyl, methoxy) and a carboxylic acid group tend to give **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups can reduce the ability of the modifier to coordinate with the metal catalyst effectively.
  - *Examples*: 
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid (Entry 22) – Low Yield
    - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Entry 12) – Low Yield
  - *Counter-Example*: 
    - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid (Entry 25) – High Yield (additional ketone group may offset the effect)

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing **amide linkages or peptide bonds** tend to give **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide groups may reduce the availability of lone pairs for coordination or interfere with catalytic sites.
  - *Examples*: 
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid (Entry 23) – Low Yield
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (Entry 33) – Low Yield

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers containing **heterocyclic aromatic rings with nitrogen atoms** (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole) attached to a carboxylic acid group tend to give **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen heterocycles can coordinate effectively with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.
  - *Examples*: 
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Entry 21) – High Yield
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid (Entry 15) – High Yield
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid (Entry 8) – High Yield
  - *Counter-Example*: 
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (Entry 11) – Low Yield (possible steric hindrance due to the benzoic linker)

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and well-defined, specifying that modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and an amino group at the alpha or beta position tend to give high yield. The rationale regarding chelation with metal centers provides good property insight. The rule considers a combination of substructures, fulfilling the complexity criterion. It is well-supported by multiple examples and counter-examples, demonstrating good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clearly articulated, indicating that modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and an amino group directly attached to an aromatic ring yield high results. The rationale provides solid property insight into π-coordination and electronic interactions with the catalyst. The rule incorporates combinations of substructures, meeting the complexity criterion. It is backed by sufficient examples and a counter-example, showing good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear in stating that modifiers with both carboxylic acid and aldehyde groups tend to give low yields. The rationale regarding possible side reactions involving the aldehyde group provides sound property insight. The rule combines multiple functional groups, satisfying the complexity criterion, and is supported by examples, ensuring adequate coverage and balance.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear in describing that modifiers with perfluoroalkyl chains attached to a carboxylic acid group tend to give low yield. The rationale about increased hydrophobicity and steric effects offers good property insight. However, the rule is based on only one data point, which limits its coverage. To strengthen this rule, more examples supporting the trend would be beneficial.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 clearly states that modifiers with ether linkages attached to a carboxylic acid group lead to low yields. The rationale provides acceptable property insight by explaining potential chelation differences and solubility issues. The rule considers combinations of functional groups, fulfilling complexity. It is supported by two examples, ensuring basic coverage, though additional data points could enhance its robustness.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 suggests that modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and multiple hydroxyl groups tend to yield high results. While the rationale about enhanced hydrogen bonding provides some property insight, the term "multiple hydroxyl groups" lacks specificity, affecting clarity. The rule has limited coverage with only one supporting example and one counter-example. More data points and clearer definitions would strengthen this rule.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 clearly indicates that modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and a thiol group tend to give high yields. The rationale is sound, noting strong bonding with metal centers. However, the rule is based on a single data point, which is insufficient for robust coverage. Additional supporting examples are needed to validate this rule.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear in its description that modifiers with a nitro group on an aromatic ring and a carboxylic acid group lead to high yield. The property insight is acceptable, referencing electron-withdrawing effects. However, the rule is supported by only one data point, limiting its coverage. More supporting data is needed to substantiate this rule.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 clearly states that modifiers with an aromatic ring bearing electron-donating groups and a carboxylic acid group tend to give low yields. The rationale provides solid property insight. The rule considers combinations of substructures, meeting complexity. It is supported by multiple examples and a counter-example, showing acceptable coverage and balance.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 clearly indicates that modifiers containing amide linkages or peptide bonds tend to give low yields. The rationale provides good property insight into possible interference with catalytic sites. The rule considers complex functional groups, fulfilling the complexity criterion, and is supported by multiple data points, ensuring adequate coverage and balance.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear, stating that modifiers with nitrogen-containing heterocyclic aromatic rings and a carboxylic acid group tend to yield high results. The rationale provides good property insight into coordination with metal centers. The rule combines complex substructures, fulfilling the complexity criterion. It has sufficient coverage with multiple examples and a counter-example, resulting in a well-balanced rule.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing a **carboxylic acid group** and an **amino group at the alpha or beta position** (adjacent or one carbon away from the carboxyl group) tend to give **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The proximity of the amino group to the carboxylic acid can facilitate chelation with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity.
  - *Examples*: 
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Entry 0) – High Yield
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Entry 2) – High Yield
    - 5-aminopentanoic acid (Entry 3) – High Yield
  - *Counter-Examples*: 
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid (Entry 31) – Low Yield (amino group too far from carboxyl group)
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid (Entry 34) – Low Yield

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers containing a **carboxylic acid group** and an **amino group directly attached to an aromatic ring** tend to give **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aromatic amino groups can engage in π-coordination and enhance electronic interactions with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*: 
    - 4-aminobenzoic acid (Entry 4) – High Yield
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Entry 21) – High Yield
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid (Entry 15) – High Yield
  - *Counter-Example*: 
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (Entry 11) – Low Yield (amino group not directly attached to carboxyl-bearing ring)

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a **carboxylic acid group** and an **aldehyde group** tend to give **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can react with amines or other nucleophiles, deactivating the modifier or interfering with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*: 
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid (Entry 19) – Low Yield
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (Entry 18) – Low Yield

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers containing a **perfluoroalkyl chain** attached to a carboxylic acid group tend to give **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Perfluorinated chains increase hydrophobicity and can hinder interaction with the catalyst due to steric and electronic effects.
  - *Example*: 
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid (Entry 13) – Low Yield

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing **ether linkages** (polyether chains) attached to a carboxylic acid group tend to give **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether chains can chelate metal centers differently or increase solubility in the solvent rather than interacting effectively with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*: 
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid (Entry 10) – Low Yield
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid (Entry 32) – Low Yield

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing a **carboxylic acid group** and **multiple hydroxyl groups** tend to give **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups can enhance hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst, improving its performance.
  - *Example*: 
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Entry 9) – High Yield
  - *Counter-Example*: 
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid (Entry 29) – Low Yield (only one hydroxyl group)

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing a **carboxylic acid group** and a **thiol group** tend to give **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Thiol groups can form strong bonds with metal centers, stabilizing the catalyst and enhancing reactivity.
  - *Example*: 
    - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid (Entry 17) – High Yield

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing a **nitro group attached to an aromatic ring** along with a carboxylic acid group tend to give **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Nitro groups are strong electron-withdrawing groups, which can enhance coordination with metal catalysts through resonance effects.
  - *Example*: 
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid (Entry 20) – High Yield

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing an **aromatic ring with electron-donating groups** (e.g., methyl, methoxy) and a carboxylic acid group tend to give **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups can reduce the ability of the modifier to coordinate with the metal catalyst effectively.
  - *Examples*: 
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid (Entry 22) – Low Yield
    - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Entry 12) – Low Yield
  - *Counter-Example*: 
    - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid (Entry 25) – High Yield (additional ketone group may offset the effect)

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing **amide linkages or peptide bonds** tend to give **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide groups may reduce the availability of lone pairs for coordination or interfere with catalytic sites.
  - *Examples*: 
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid (Entry 23) – Low Yield
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (Entry 33) – Low Yield

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers containing **heterocyclic aromatic rings with nitrogen atoms** (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole) attached to a carboxylic acid group tend to give **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen heterocycles can coordinate effectively with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.
  - *Examples*: 
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Entry 21) – High Yield
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid (Entry 15) – High Yield
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid (Entry 8) – High Yield
  - *Counter-Example*: 
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (Entry 11) – Low Yield (possible steric hindrance due to the benzoic linker)

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: Modify the code to handle logical OR conditions in patterns. In Rule 1, the patterns `'alpha_amino'` and `'beta_amino'` are meant to be alternatives (either one can satisfy the rule). Update the rule's patterns to reflect that the molecule should match `'carboxylic_acid'` **AND** (`'alpha_amino'` **OR** `'beta_amino'`).

- **Suggestion 2**: Introduce an `'or_patterns'` key in the rule definitions to handle patterns that are in an either/or relationship. Update the code to check that at least one pattern in `'or_patterns'` matches. For example, for Rule 1:

  ```python
  {
      'number': 1,
      'description': 'Modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group and an amino group at the alpha or beta position tend to give high yield.',
      'patterns': [
          carboxylic_acid
      ],
      'or_patterns': [
          alpha_amino,
          beta_amino
      ],
      'prediction': 1
  }
  ```

- **Suggestion 3**: Adjust the matching logic in the code to accommodate the new `'or_patterns'`. After checking that all `'patterns'` match, add logic to confirm that at least one pattern in `'or_patterns'` matches. If none of the `'or_patterns'` match, set `match = False`.

  ```python
  # Check 'or_patterns' if any
  if 'compiled_or_patterns' in rule:
      or_match = False
      for pat in rule['compiled_or_patterns']:
          if mol.HasSubstructMatch(pat):
              or_match = True
              break
      if not or_match:
          match = False
  ```

- **Suggestion 4**: Ensure that the SMARTS patterns accurately represent the chemical groups described in the rules. For example, verify that `'alpha_amino'` and `'beta_amino'` correctly identify amino groups at the alpha and beta positions relative to a carboxylic acid group.

- **Suggestion 5**: For Rule 9, which uses `'optional_patterns'`, confirm that the code correctly requires at least one of the optional patterns to match in addition to the required patterns. Ensure the logic does not inadvertently exclude modifiers that should match.

- **Suggestion 6**: Enhance the code by adding detailed logging or print statements that indicate which patterns are matched or not matched for each molecule. This will help diagnose why certain molecules are not matching any rules.

- **Suggestion 7**: Review and correct the SMARTS patterns for functional groups where necessary. For instance, ensure that the SMARTS for `'aromatic_amino'` (`'[c][NX3;H2,H1]'`) captures amino groups directly attached to aromatic rings, including various substitution patterns.

- **Suggestion 8**: For rules involving counts of certain groups (e.g., Rule 5 and Rule 6), verify that the `'count_patterns'` logic correctly counts the number of occurrences. Adjust the code to ensure that the counts are accurate, especially in cases where overlapping matches might occur.

- **Suggestion 9**: Implement exception handling around pattern matching to catch any errors that occur during substructure searches. Log these exceptions to assist in debugging the code.

- **Suggestion 10**: Re-express complex rules that involve combinations of functional groups and structural features to make them more amenable to SMARTS pattern matching. Consider breaking down difficult rules into simpler, sequential matching steps if necessary.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing a **carboxylic acid group** and an **amino group at the alpha or beta position** (adjacent or one carbon away from the carboxyl group) tend to give **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The proximity of the amino group to the carboxylic acid can facilitate chelation with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity.
  - *Examples*: 
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Entry 0) – High Yield
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Entry 2) – High Yield
    - 5-aminopentanoic acid (Entry 3) – High Yield
  - *Counter-Examples*: 
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid (Entry 31) – Low Yield (amino group too far from carboxyl group)
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid (Entry 34) – Low Yield

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers containing a **carboxylic acid group** and an **amino group directly attached to an aromatic ring** tend to give **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aromatic amino groups can engage in π-coordination and enhance electronic interactions with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*: 
    - 4-aminobenzoic acid (Entry 4) – High Yield
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Entry 21) – High Yield
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid (Entry 15) – High Yield
  - *Counter-Example*: 
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (Entry 11) – Low Yield (amino group not directly attached to carboxyl-bearing ring)

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a **carboxylic acid group** and an **aldehyde group** tend to give **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can react with amines or other nucleophiles, deactivating the modifier or interfering with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*: 
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid (Entry 19) – Low Yield
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (Entry 18) – Low Yield

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers containing a **perfluoroalkyl chain** attached to a carboxylic acid group tend to give **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Perfluorinated chains increase hydrophobicity and can hinder interaction with the catalyst due to steric and electronic effects.
  - *Example*: 
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid (Entry 13) – Low Yield

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing **ether linkages** (polyether chains) attached to a carboxylic acid group tend to give **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether chains can chelate metal centers differently or increase solubility in the solvent rather than interacting effectively with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*: 
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid (Entry 10) – Low Yield
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid (Entry 32) – Low Yield

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing a **carboxylic acid group** and **multiple hydroxyl groups** tend to give **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups can enhance hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst, improving its performance.
  - *Example*: 
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Entry 9) – High Yield
  - *Counter-Example*: 
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid (Entry 29) – Low Yield (only one hydroxyl group)

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing a **carboxylic acid group** and a **thiol group** tend to give **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Thiol groups can form strong bonds with metal centers, stabilizing the catalyst and enhancing reactivity.
  - *Example*: 
    - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid (Entry 17) – High Yield

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing a **nitro group attached to an aromatic ring** along with a carboxylic acid group tend to give **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Nitro groups are strong electron-withdrawing groups, which can enhance coordination with metal catalysts through resonance effects.
  - *Example*: 
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid (Entry 20) – High Yield

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing an **aromatic ring with electron-donating groups** (e.g., methyl, methoxy) and a carboxylic acid group tend to give **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups can reduce the ability of the modifier to coordinate with the metal catalyst effectively.
  - *Examples*: 
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid (Entry 22) – Low Yield
    - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Entry 12) – Low Yield
  - *Counter-Example*: 
    - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid (Entry 25) – High Yield (additional ketone group may offset the effect)

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing **amide linkages or peptide bonds** tend to give **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide groups may reduce the availability of lone pairs for coordination or interfere with catalytic sites.
  - *Examples*: 
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid (Entry 23) – Low Yield
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (Entry 33) – Low Yield

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers containing **heterocyclic aromatic rings with nitrogen atoms** (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole) attached to a carboxylic acid group tend to give **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen heterocycles can coordinate effectively with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Revise Rule 2 Implementation**  
  **Issue**: Rule 2 aims to identify modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group and an amino group directly attached to an aromatic ring. However, the current SMARTS pattern `aromatic_amino = '[c][NX3;H2,H1]'` only matches amino groups (–NH₂ or –NH–) directly attached to aromatic carbons. The examples provided include pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, where the amino functionality is part of the heteroaromatic ring (nitrogen atoms within the ring).  
  **Suggestion**: Modify the SMARTS pattern to include heteroaromatic nitrogen atoms directly attached to the ring. Use a pattern that captures both amino groups bonded to aromatic carbons and heterocyclic nitrogen atoms within the ring. For example:
  ```python
  aromatic_amino = '[c,NH1,NH2][nX2]?[c]'  # Matches aromatic carbons/nitrogens attached to nitrogen
  ```
  Additionally, consider merging Rules 2 and 11 or clearly differentiating them to avoid overlap.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Correct Rule 11 Pattern for Heterocyclic Nitrogen Rings**  
  **Issue**: Rule 11 is intended to match modifiers containing heterocyclic aromatic rings with nitrogen atoms attached to a carboxylic acid group. The current pattern `heterocyclic_nitrogen = '[n]'` may not ensure that the heterocycle is aromatic or directly connected to the carboxylic acid group.  
  **Suggestion**: Refine the SMARTS pattern to ensure it matches heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen atoms directly adjacent to a carboxylic acid group. For example:
  ```python
  heterocyclic_nitrogen = '[n;R]';  # Aromatic nitrogen within a ring
  heterocycle_carboxylic_acid = '[n;R][c;R][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'  # Nitrogen-containing aromatic ring attached to –COOH
  ```
  Update Rule 11 to use these patterns to accurately capture the intended structures.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Adjust Rule 5 Ether Linkage Counting**  
  **Issue**: Rule 5 seeks to identify modifiers containing ether linkages (polyether chains) attached to a carboxylic acid group, predicting low yield. The current implementation counts any molecule with at least two ether linkages, which may not accurately represent polyether chains.  
  **Suggestion**: Modify the count threshold and ensure that ether linkages are part of a chain (e.g., –(O–CH₂–CH₂)ₙ–). Update the count to reflect consecutive ether linkages:
  ```python
  ether_linkage = '[#6][OX2][#6]'  # As before
  # Require at least two consecutive ether linkages
  polyether_chain = '([#6][OX2][#6]){2,}'
  ```
  Use `polyether_chain` as the pattern and adjust the count accordingly.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Enhance Rule 6 for Multiple Hydroxyl Groups**  
  **Issue**: Rule 6 is intended to match modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and multiple hydroxyl groups, predicting high yield. The current pattern looks for at least two hydroxyl groups, which may capture molecules with only two hydroxyls not fitting the rule's intent.  
  **Suggestion**: Increase the minimum count of hydroxyl groups to more accurately reflect "multiple" (e.g., three or more):
  ```python
  # Change count from 2 to 3 or more
  count_patterns = [{'pattern': hydroxyl_group, 'count': 3}]
  ```
  Additionally, ensure that hydroxyl groups are spread throughout the molecule and not part of functional groups like carboxylic acids.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Clarify Rule 9 for Electron-Donating Groups**  
  **Issue**: Rule 9 targets modifiers containing an aromatic ring with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy) and a carboxylic acid group, predicting low yield. The current optional patterns may not capture all electron-donating groups or may miss substituted aromatics with multiple donating groups.  
  **Suggestion**: Expand the optional patterns to include other common electron-donating groups and account for multiple substitutions:
  ```python
  # Include additional electron-donating groups
  electron_donating_groups = ['[c][CH3]', '[c][OX2][CH3]', '[c][NH2]', '[c][OH]']
  # Update optional_patterns
  'optional_patterns': electron_donating_groups,
  ```
  Ensure the code can detect molecules with one or more electron-donating groups attached to an aromatic ring.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Improve Rule 10 for Amide and Peptide Bonds**  
  **Issue**: Rule 10 aims to identify modifiers containing amide linkages or peptide bonds, predicting low yield. The current pattern `amide_group = '[CX3](=O)[NX3]'` may not account for all amide configurations, such as secondary or tertiary amides, or cyclic amides (lactams).  
  **Suggestion**: Broaden the SMARTS pattern to include various types of amide bonds:
  ```python
  amide_group = '[CX3](=O)[NX3;$([NX3][#6]),$([NX3H][#6]),$([NX3H2])]'  # Matches primary, secondary, tertiary amides
  ```
  Additionally, include patterns for peptide bonds specifically:
  ```python
  peptide_bond = '[NX3;$([NX3][CX3](=O)[#6])][CX3](=O)[#6]'
  ```
  Use these patterns to more accurately capture modifiers with amide or peptide functionalities.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Ensure Consistency Between Rules and Examples**  
  **Issue**: There are inconsistencies between the examples provided and the rules' descriptions, such as Rule 2 examples fitting better with Rule 11.  
  **Suggestion**: Review all rules and their corresponding examples to ensure they align correctly. Adjust the rules, examples, or both to eliminate overlaps and inconsistencies. This may involve reassigning examples to the appropriate rules or refining rule descriptions for clarity.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Validate Rule Matching with Additional Test Cases**  
  **Issue**: Some modifiers may not be correctly classified due to the specificity of SMARTS patterns.  
  **Suggestion**: Create a set of test SMILES that are known to match or not match each rule. Use these to validate and adjust the SMARTS patterns to ensure accurate matching. Consider edge cases and molecules with multiple functional groups.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Improve Error Handling in the Code**  
  **Issue**: The code currently appends a row of zeros if a molecule cannot be parsed, which might mask underlying issues.  
  **Suggestion**: Implement error logging or messages that indicate which SMILES could not be parsed and why. This will help in troubleshooting and ensuring that all molecules are correctly evaluated.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Optimize SMARTS Patterns for Performance**  
  **Issue**: Some SMARTS patterns may be overly complex or inefficient, leading to slower processing times.  
  **Suggestion**: Review and simplify SMARTS patterns where possible without sacrificing accuracy. Use recursive SMARTS or atom maps judiciously to balance performance and precision.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing a **carboxylic acid group** and an **amino group at the alpha or beta position** (adjacent or one carbon away from the carboxyl group) tend to give **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The proximity of the amino group to the carboxylic acid can facilitate chelation with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity.
  - *Examples*: 
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Entry 0) – High Yield
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Entry 2) – High Yield
    - 5-aminopentanoic acid (Entry 3) – High Yield
  - *Counter-Examples*: 
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid (Entry 31) – Low Yield (amino group too far from carboxyl group)
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid (Entry 34) – Low Yield

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers containing a **carboxylic acid group** and an **amino group directly attached to an aromatic ring** tend to give **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aromatic amino groups can engage in π-coordination and enhance electronic interactions with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*: 
    - 4-aminobenzoic acid (Entry 4) – High Yield
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Entry 21) – High Yield
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid (Entry 15) – High Yield
  - *Counter-Example*: 
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (Entry 11) – Low Yield (amino group not directly attached to carboxyl-bearing ring)

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a **carboxylic acid group** and an **aldehyde group** tend to give **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can react with amines or other nucleophiles, deactivating the modifier or interfering with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*: 
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid (Entry 19) – Low Yield
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (Entry 18) – Low Yield

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers containing a **perfluoroalkyl chain** attached to a carboxylic acid group tend to give **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Perfluorinated chains increase hydrophobicity and can hinder interaction with the catalyst due to steric and electronic effects.
  - *Example*: 
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid (Entry 13) – Low Yield

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing **ether linkages** (polyether chains) attached to a carboxylic acid group tend to give **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether chains can chelate metal centers differently or increase solubility in the solvent rather than interacting effectively with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*: 
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid (Entry 10) – Low Yield
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid (Entry 32) – Low Yield

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing a **carboxylic acid group** and **multiple hydroxyl groups** tend to give **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups can enhance hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst, improving its performance.
  - *Example*: 
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Entry 9) – High Yield
  - *Counter-Example*: 
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid (Entry 29) – Low Yield (only one hydroxyl group)

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing a **carboxylic acid group** and a **thiol group** tend to give **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Thiol groups can form strong bonds with metal centers, stabilizing the catalyst and enhancing reactivity.
  - *Example*: 
    - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid (Entry 17) – High Yield

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing a **nitro group attached to an aromatic ring** along with a carboxylic acid group tend to give **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Nitro groups are strong electron-withdrawing groups, which can enhance coordination with metal catalysts through resonance effects.
  - *Example*: 
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid (Entry 20) – High Yield

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing an **aromatic ring with electron-donating groups** (e.g., methyl, methoxy) and a carboxylic acid group tend to give **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups can reduce the ability of the modifier to coordinate with the metal catalyst effectively.
  - *Examples*: 
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid (Entry 22) – Low Yield
    - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Entry 12) – Low Yield
  - *Counter-Example*: 
    - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid (Entry 25) – High Yield (additional ketone group may offset the effect)

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing **amide linkages or peptide bonds** tend to give **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide groups may reduce the availability of lone pairs for coordination or interfere with catalytic sites.
  - *Examples*: 
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid (Entry 23) – Low Yield
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (Entry 33) – Low Yield

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers containing **heterocyclic aromatic rings with nitrogen atoms** (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole) attached to a carboxylic acid group tend to give **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen heterocycles can coordinate effectively with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.
  - *Examples*: 
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Entry 21) – High Yield
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid (Entry 15) – High Yield
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid (Entry 8) – High Yield
  - *Counter-Example*: 
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (Entry 11) – Low Yield (possible steric hindrance due to the benzoic linker)

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- **Suggestion 1**: **Adjust Rule 1 Patterns for Alpha and Beta Amino Groups**

  The current SMARTS patterns for alpha and beta amino groups in Rule 1 may not correctly enforce the spatial relationship relative to the carboxylic acid group. To ensure that the amino group is specifically at the alpha or beta position to the carboxylic acid, consider using more precise SMARTS patterns that capture the exact connectivity.

  *Suggested Changes*:
  
  - **Alpha Amino Group**: Use a SMARTS pattern that specifies the amino group attached to a carbon that is directly connected to the carboxylic acid carbon.

    ```python
    alpha_amino = '[NX3;H2,H1][CX4H][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'
    ```
  
  - **Beta Amino Group**: Use a pattern where the amino group is two carbons away from the carboxylic acid group.

    ```python
    beta_amino = '[NX3;H2,H1][CX4][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'
    ```

  Additionally, modify the rule to ensure that the amino group and the carboxylic acid group are part of the same chain.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Correct Logical Operators in Rule Matching**

  In the code, for rules that require both a functional group and a specific structural relationship (like Rules 1 and 2), ensure that logical operators reflect the natural language accurately.

  For Rule 1, the amino group should be at the alpha or beta position *relative* to the carboxylic acid group. Currently, the code checks for the presence of both independently. Use SMARTS that capture their relative positions.

  *Suggested Change*:

  Implement a single SMARTS pattern that captures both the carboxylic acid and the amino group in the correct relative positions, rather than checking them separately.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Refine Rule 2 Patterns for Aromatic Amino Groups**

  The SMARTS patterns for Rule 2 may not fully capture the requirement of the amino group being directly attached to an aromatic ring. Adjust the patterns to ensure that the amino group is bonded to an aromatic carbon.

  *Suggested Change*:

  ```python
  aromatic_amino = '[c][NH2,NH1,N]'
  ```

  Also, ensure that the carboxylic acid group is attached to the same aromatic ring.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Fix Usage of 'optional_patterns' in Code**

  The use of `'optional_patterns'` in the code is misleading. In the current implementation, if none of the optional patterns match, the rule is considered not matched, which contradicts the idea of them being optional.

  *Suggested Change*:

  - Rename `'optional_patterns'` to `'required_subpatterns'` or `'and_patterns'` to reflect that at least one must be present.
  - Alternatively, modify the logic so that the presence of `'optional_patterns'` does not lead to a match failure if they are not found.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Adjust Rule 9 to Accurately Reflect Electron-Donating Groups**

  For Rule 9, the SMARTS patterns for electron-donating groups should be directly attached to an aromatic ring. Ensure that the patterns capture this specific arrangement.

  *Suggested Changes*:

  Define a pattern that represents an aromatic ring with an electron-donating group:

  ```python
  electron_donating_group_on_aromatic = '[c][c]([c])[C,N,O,S]'
  ```

  Then, in the rule, use `'and_patterns'` instead of `'optional_patterns'`:

  ```python
  {
      'number': 9,
      'description': 'Modifiers containing an aromatic ring with electron-donating groups and a carboxylic acid group tend to give low yield.',
      'patterns': [carboxylic_acid, electron_donating_group_on_aromatic],
      'prediction': -1
  }
  ```

- **Suggestion 6**: **Ensure Accurate Counting in 'count_patterns'**

  For Rule 6, which involves counting multiple hydroxyl groups, verify that the code correctly counts *unique* hydroxyl groups and that rings or multiple occurrences are properly considered.

  *Suggested Change*:

  Use the following logic to count hydroxyl groups:

  ```python
  hydroxyl_group = '[OX2H]'
  hydroxyl_count = 3

  # In the code, count unique matches
  matches = mol.GetSubstructMatches(Chem.MolFromSmarts(hydroxyl_group))
  unique_matches = set(matches)
  if len(unique_matches) < hydroxyl_count:
      match = False
  ```

- **Suggestion 7**: **Refine Rule 5 for Polyether Chains**

  In Rule 5, the SMARTS pattern for polyether chains may not enforce that the ether linkages are consecutive. The current pattern `'([#6][OX2][#6]){2,}'` may not work as intended.

  *Suggested Change*:

  Use a recursive SMARTS pattern to match continuous polyether chains:

  ```python
  polyether_chain = '[#6]-O-[#6]-O-[#6]'
  ```

  For longer chains, adjust the pattern accordingly or implement a recursive search.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Verify 'and_patterns' Logic Across Rules**

  Ensure that for rules that require multiple features to be present (like Rule 3 and Rule 7), the code correctly uses `'and_patterns'` to enforce the presence of all required substructures.

  *Suggested Change*:

  Review each rule's implementation to confirm that `'patterns'` and `'and_patterns'` are used appropriately, and that the code logic reflects the need for all these patterns to match.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Handle Data Alignment Between SMILES and Feature Matrix**

  There appears to be a misalignment between the number of SMILES entries and the rows in the feature matrix. This can lead to incorrect interpretations.

  *Suggested Changes*:

  - Ensure that the SMILES list and the feature matrix have the same number of entries.
  - Verify that the indices in the SMILES list correspond to the correct rows in the feature matrix.
  - If entries are missing, update the SMILES list or feature matrix accordingly.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Include Error Handling for Invalid SMILES**

  In cases where `mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smi)` returns `None` (invalid SMILES), the code currently appends a row of zeros.

  *Suggested Change*:

  Implement logging or error messages to flag invalid SMILES strings for review, rather than silently proceeding with zeros.

- **Suggestion 11**: **Add Unit Tests for Each Rule**

  To validate the transformation process, create unit tests with known SMILES strings that should match or not match each rule.

  *Suggested Change*:

  For each rule, provide test cases (both positive and negative) to verify that the code correctly identifies matches as intended.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

Using the provided metrics, we can evaluate the performance of the current set of rules in comparison to the previous reference metrics. The focus will be on **confidence** and **lift**, as requested.

---

### **1. Support**

- **Current Train Support**: **0.0234** (approximately 2.34%)
- **Reference Train Support**: [0.1667 (16.67%), 0.1845 (18.45%)]

**Comment**: The current train support is significantly lower than the previous reference supports. This indicates that the current rules apply to a much smaller portion of the dataset. While a low support does not necessarily denote poor rule quality, it suggests that the rules might be too specific or not widely applicable.

---

### **2. Confidence**

- **Current Train Confidence**: **0.5833** (58.33%)
- **Reference Train Confidence**: [0.6352 (63.52%), 0.5396 (53.96%)]

**Comment**: The current confidence level is within the range of previous values, slightly lower than the highest reference confidence but higher than the second reference value. A confidence of 58.33% means that when the rule conditions are met, there is a 58.33% chance that the prediction (e.g., high yield) is correct. While this is acceptable, there is room for improvement to increase the reliability of the predictions.

---

### **3. Lift**

- **Current Train Lift**: **1.1649**
- **Reference Train Lift**: [1.2048, 1.0559]

**Comment**: The lift value of 1.1649 indicates that the occurrence of the prediction (e.g., high yield) is about 16.49% more likely when the rule conditions are met than when they are not. This lift is between the two reference values, suggesting that the rule has a moderate positive impact on predicting the outcome. A lift greater than 1 implies that the rule is valuable in increasing the likelihood of the prediction.

---

### **4. Leverage**

- **Current Train Leverage**: **0.00898**
- **Reference Train Leverage**: [0.0289, -0.0041]

**Comment**: The current leverage is positive but lower than the highest reference leverage. A positive leverage indicates that the rule improves the prediction over random chance. However, the relatively low value suggests that the rule's additional contribution is modest.

---

**Overall Assessment**:

- **Strengths**:
  - The **confidence** and **lift** values are acceptable and within the range of previous metrics, indicating that the rules have a reasonable predictive power when they apply.
  - The positive **lift** suggests that the rules are indeed helpful in predicting the desired outcome better than random chance.

- **Weaknesses**:
  - The **support** is significantly lower than before, which means the rules cover a smaller subset of data. This limits the overall impact of the rules.
  - The low **leverage** signals that while the rules are better than chance, they may not contribute substantially new information.

---

**Determining a Local Minimum and Iterations Needed**

The decrease in support without a significant gain in confidence or lift suggests that the current set of rules may have reached a **local minimum**. This means that further minor adjustments to these rules are unlikely to yield significant improvements in performance metrics.

- **Local Minimum**: The rules may be too narrowly focused, capturing specific instances well but failing to generalize across the dataset.
- **Iterations**: Given that metrics are not improving substantially and support has decreased, it may be time to reconsider the current approach rather than continue with similar iterations.

---

**Recommendations for Improving the Current Rules**

1. **Increase Rule Generality**:
   - **Broaden the Conditions**: Relax some of the stringent conditions in the rules to cover a larger portion of the dataset, thereby increasing support.
   - **Combine Similar Rules**: Identify overlapping rules and merge them to create more general rules with higher support.

2. **Focus on High-Impact Features**:
   - **Feature Analysis**: Re-examine the features used in the rules to identify which ones have the most significant impact on the outcome.
   - **Eliminate Redundant Features**: Remove or replace features that do not contribute substantially to confidence or lift.

3. **Optimize Confidence and Lift**:
   - **Balance Specificity and Generality**: While more general rules increase support, ensure that confidence and lift do not diminish significantly.
   - **Iterative Testing**: Experiment with different combinations of conditions to find an optimal balance where confidence and lift are maximized without sacrificing too much support.

4. **Address Overfitting**:
   - **Cross-Validation**: Use cross-validation techniques to ensure that the rules perform well on unseen data and are not overfitted to the training set.
   - **Simplify Rules**: Simplify overly complex rules that might fit the training data well but perform poorly on new data.

5. **Incorporate Additional Data**:
   - **Expand the Dataset**: If possible, include more data to provide a richer basis for rule generation.
   - **Update Data Preprocessing**: Review how the data is preprocessed to ensure important information is not lost.

6. **Leverage Domain Knowledge**:
   - **Consult Experts**: Collaborate with domain experts to refine the rules based on chemical insights that may not be immediately apparent from the data.
   - **Incorporate Chemical Theory**: Use established chemical principles to guide the formulation of rules that are both scientifically sound and predictive.

---

**Conclusion**

The current rules exhibit reasonable confidence and lift but suffer from low support, limiting their applicability. To enhance performance:

- **Aim to Increase Support**: Broaden the applicability of the rules without substantially reducing confidence and lift.
- **Enhance Rule Effectiveness**: Focus on refining conditions that contribute most to predictive power.
- **Avoid Local Minima**: Consider re-evaluating the rule-generation strategy to avoid being confined to suboptimal solutions.

By implementing these recommendations, the rules can be improved to provide more generalizable and powerful predictions, ultimately enhancing the effectiveness of the research program.

ML Commenter Message:
**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

Based on the latest training results, the current classification model achieved an accuracy of **0.6286** on the validation set. This is notably lower than the previous validation accuracies, which consistently hovered around **0.76**. The test accuracies in previous iterations were **0.75** and **0.625**, indicating that the models previously had better generalization performance.

The decrease in validation accuracy suggests that the current set of rules may not be as effective in capturing the underlying patterns that lead to accurate predictions. It appears that the model's ability to generalize from the training data to unseen data has diminished. This could be due to the refinement of rules that inadvertently removed important predictive features or introduced noise.

**Assessing Overfitting and Underfitting**

The consistent lower accuracy across the validation folds indicates potential underfitting. The model may be too simplistic or the rules may not be capturing the complexity of the data adequately. Overfitting is less likely since both training and validation accuracies are low; however, without explicit training accuracy, this cannot be conclusively determined. The focus should be on enhancing the model's capacity to represent the data more effectively by refining the existing rules.

**SHAP Analysis Feedback**

The SHAP analysis provided focuses exclusively on **Rule 10**, which pertains to modifiers containing **amide linkages or peptide bonds** tending to give **low yield**. The SHAP values indicate how much each molecule's Rule 10 feature contributes to predicting a high loading of the modifier on the catalyst.

**Observations:**

1. **Overestimation Cases:**

   - There are several molecules where the model **predicts a high loading** but the **experimental value is low**. In these cases, **Rule 10 has a positive SHAP value**, contributing to the overestimation.
   - Examples include:
     - **C(=O)(C(C(C(C(F)(F)F)(F)F)(F)F)(F)F)O**
     - **C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O**
     - **C(CCCC(=O)O)CCCN**
     - **CC1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=O)O**
     - **C1=CC(=CC=C1CCC(=O)O)O**

2. **Underestimation Cases:**

   - There are molecules where the model **predicts a low loading** and the **experimental value is low**, with **Rule 10 having a negative SHAP value**, supporting the correct prediction.
   - Examples include:
     - **C(CC(=O)O)CNC(=O)C(F)(F)F**
     - **CC(=O)NCCCC[C@@H](C(=O)O)N**
     - **CSCC[C@@H](C(=O)NCC(=O)O)N**
     - **C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)NCC(=O)O)O**

3. **Mixed Cases:**

   - Some molecules with **positive SHAP values for Rule 10** are correctly predicted as high loading and have high experimental values.
   - Other molecules with similar SHAP contributions are incorrectly predicted, indicating that Rule 10 may not be universally applicable or may need refinement.

**Analysis of Rule 10**

- **Rule 10** posits that modifiers with **amide linkages or peptide bonds** tend to give **low yield**.
- The SHAP analysis shows that Rule 10 often contributes positively to predicting high loading, which contradicts the rule's original assumption.
- The positive SHAP values in overestimated cases suggest that the presence of amide linkages is, in these instances, incorrectly being associated with high yield.
- Therefore, Rule 10 may be improperly weighted or too general, leading to misclassifications.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

1. **Refine Rule 10:**

   - **Reevaluate the Scope:** Consider revising Rule 10 to account for exceptions where amide-containing modifiers actually result in high yield. The rule may be too broad and not account for structural contexts that influence activity.
   - **Incorporate Structural Nuances:** Analyze the specific structural features of the molecules where Rule 10 leads to incorrect predictions. For instance, the position of the amide group or the presence of additional functional groups may modulate the effect.
   - **Adjust Rule Weighting:** Modify the weighting of Rule 10 in the feature matrix so that it does not disproportionately influence the prediction towards low yield when it may not be applicable.

2. **Introduce New Rules or Modify Existing Ones:**

   - **Consider Synergistic Effects:** Examine if the combination of amide groups with other functional groups (e.g., carboxylic acids, aromatic rings) affects the yield differently than amide groups alone.
   - **Update Rule 2 and Rule 11:** Since modifiers with aromatic amino groups and nitrogen-containing heterocycles tend to give high yield, perhaps overlapping features with Rule 10 are causing confusion. Clarify these rules to distinguish cases where aromatic amides might behave differently.

3. **Address Overfitting/Underfitting:**

   - **Enhance Rule Generalization:** Ensure that the rules are neither too specific (causing underfitting) nor too general (leading to overfitting). Incorporate more nuanced conditions or exceptions where necessary.
   - **Cross-Validation:** Perform additional cross-validation to check the robustness of the rules across different subsets of the data.

4. **Leverage SHAP Insights:**

   - Use SHAP values to identify which rules consistently contribute to incorrect predictions. Rules with high positive SHAP values in overestimation cases and high negative SHAP values in underestimation cases are prime candidates for refinement.
   - **Analyze Other Rules:** Since the SHAP analysis focused on Rule 10, consider performing similar analyses on other rules to uncover additional areas for improvement.

5. **Expand Feature Set:**

   - **Incorporate Additional Descriptors:** Beyond the current rule-based features, consider adding molecular descriptors that capture other aspects of the modifiers, such as electronic properties, steric factors, or solubility parameters.
   - **Machine Learning Models:** Utilize models that can capture nonlinear relationships and interactions between features, which might not be fully accounted for by the current rules.

6. **Data Enhancement:**

   - **Increase Dataset Size:** If possible, gather more experimental data to provide a richer training set. This can improve the model's ability to learn and generalize.
   - **Balance the Dataset:** Ensure that there is a balanced representation of high-yield and low-yield modifiers, as imbalanced data can skew the model.

**Conclusion**

The current rules, particularly Rule 10, appear to be contributing to decreased model performance due to potential mischaracterizations of the relationship between amide linkages and catalytic yield. By refining this rule to account for exceptions and considering additional structural factors, we can improve the accuracy of the model. Incorporating insights from the SHAP analysis and enhancing the feature set will aid in developing a more robust predictive model that generalizes better to new data.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

---

**1. Performance Analysis of Current Rules:**

The evaluation of the current set of rules reveals the following key points:

- **Low Train Support:** The train support for the current rules is **2.34%**, significantly lower than previous supports of **16.67%** and **18.45%**. This suggests that the rules are too specific and apply to a small subset of the data.

- **Moderate Train Confidence and Lift:** The train confidence is **58.33%**, within the range of previous confidence values (**53.96%** to **63.52%**). The train lift is **1.1649**, indicating a **16.49%** higher likelihood of achieving high yield when the rule conditions are met compared to random chance. While these values show some predictive power, they are not strong enough to compensate for the low support.

- **Low Leverage:** The train leverage is **0.00898**, which is positive but lower than previous leverage values. This indicates that the rules contribute minimally beyond random chance.

---

**2. Accuracy and SHAP Analysis:**

- **Decreased Model Accuracy:** The classification model achieved a validation accuracy of **62.86%**, lower than previous validations that consistently achieved **76%**. This drop suggests the model may not be capturing the underlying patterns effectively.

- **SHAP Analysis of Rule 10:**
  - **Contradictory Contributions:** Rule 10 asserts that modifiers containing **amide linkages or peptide bonds** tend to give **low yield**. However, SHAP values indicate that this rule sometimes contributes positively toward predicting **high yield**, contradicting its intended purpose.
  - **Incorrect Predictions:** The model overestimates high yield for some molecules where Rule 10 has a positive SHAP value, leading to incorrect predictions.

---

**3. Suggestions to Improve Current Rules:**

**Suggestion 1: Adjust Rule 1 Patterns for Alpha and Beta Amino Groups**

- **Issue:** The SMARTS patterns do not accurately enforce the spatial relationship between the amino group and the carboxylic acid group.
- **Improvement:**
  - **Alpha Amino Group Pattern:**
    ```python
    alpha_amino = '[NX3;H2,H1][CX4H][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'
    ```
  - **Beta Amino Group Pattern:**
    ```python
    beta_amino = '[NX3;H2,H1][CX4][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'
    ```
  - Ensure that the amino group is at the correct position relative to the carboxylic acid within the same chain.

**Suggestion 2: Correct Logical Operators in Rule Matching**

- **Issue:** The current code may not accurately reflect the need for both functional groups and their specific relationship.
- **Improvement:** Use combined SMARTS patterns that capture both the carboxylic acid and amino group with the correct connectivity, ensuring that both conditions are met simultaneously.

**Suggestion 3: Refine Rule 2 Patterns for Aromatic Amino Groups**

- **Issue:** The patterns may not ensure that the amino group is directly attached to an aromatic ring.
- **Improvement:** Update the pattern to:
  ```python
  aromatic_amino = '[c][NH2,NH1,N]'
  ```
  Ensure the carboxylic acid group is also attached to the same aromatic ring.

**Suggestion 4: Clarify 'optional_patterns' Usage**

- **Issue:** The term `'optional_patterns'` is misleading, as the matching logic requires these patterns to be present.
- **Improvement:** Rename to `'required_subpatterns'` or `'and_patterns'` to reflect that these patterns are necessary for a match. Adjust the logic accordingly to prevent confusion.

**Suggestion 5: Adjust Rule 9 for Electron-Donating Groups**

- **Issue:** The SMARTS patterns may not accurately capture electron-donating groups attached to aromatic rings.
- **Improvement:** Define a precise pattern:
  ```python
  electron_donating_group_on_aromatic = '[c][c]([c])[C,N,O,S]'
  ```
  Use `'and_patterns'` to ensure both the electron-donating group and carboxylic acid are present.

**Suggestion 6: Ensure Accurate Counting in 'count_patterns'**

- **Issue:** Counting of hydroxyl groups may not be accurate due to overlapping matches.
- **Improvement:** Count unique hydroxyl group matches to ensure correct functionality:
  ```python
  hydroxyl_group = '[OX2H]'
  # Count unique matches
  matches = mol.GetSubstructMatches(Chem.MolFromSmarts(hydroxyl_group))
  unique_matches = set(matches)
  ```

**Suggestion 7: Refine Rule 5 for Polyether Chains**

- **Issue:** The patterns may not ensure consecutive ether linkages.
- **Improvement:** Use recursive SMARTS or more specific patterns to capture continuous polyether chains:
  ```python
  polyether_chain = '[#6]-O-[#6]-O-[#6]'
  ```

**Suggestion 8: Verify 'and_patterns' Logic Across Rules**

- **Issue:** Multiple required features may not be enforced correctly.
- **Improvement:** Review each rule to ensure that `'patterns'` and `'and_patterns'` are appropriately used to reflect the logical requirements.

**Suggestion 9: Align SMILES Data with Feature Matrix**

- **Issue:** Misalignment can lead to incorrect interpretations and predictions.
- **Improvement:** Ensure that the SMILES list and feature matrix are synchronized, with corresponding indices.

**Suggestion 10: Include Error Handling for Invalid SMILES**

- **Issue:** Invalid SMILES strings result in zeroed feature rows without notification.
- **Improvement:** Implement error handling to log or flag invalid SMILES for correction.

**Suggestion 11: Add Unit Tests for Each Rule**

- **Issue:** Lack of testing may allow errors to persist unnoticed.
- **Improvement:** Create unit tests with known SMILES strings to validate the matching logic of each rule.

---

**4. Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

The current performance metrics and observations indicate that there is potential for further optimization of the rules without overfitting:

- **Increase Rule Generality:** Broaden overly specific rules to cover more data points, increasing support while maintaining confidence and lift.

- **Refine Rules with Conflicting Evidence:** Reevaluate rules like Rule 10, where SHAP analysis reveals contradictions. Adjust or split such rules to account for different contexts.

- **Fine-Tune SMARTS Patterns:** Improve pattern specificity and accuracy to better capture the intended chemical features.

- **Enhance Model Complexity Judiciously:** Introduce additional relevant features or consider more advanced models to capture complex relationships, avoiding underfitting.

- **Leverage Domain Expertise:** Collaborate with chemists to integrate chemical knowledge that may not be evident from data alone.

**Please Optimize Rules**

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing a **carboxylic acid group** and an **amino group at the alpha or beta position** (adjacent or one carbon away from the carboxyl group) tend to give **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The proximity of the amino group to the carboxylic acid can facilitate chelation with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity.
  - *Examples*: 
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Entry 0) – High Yield
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Entry 2) – High Yield
    - 5-aminopentanoic acid (Entry 3) – High Yield
  - *Counter-Examples*: 
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid (Entry 31) – Low Yield (amino group too far from carboxyl group)
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid (Entry 34) – Low Yield

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers containing a **carboxylic acid group** and an **amino group directly attached to an aromatic ring** tend to give **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aromatic amino groups can engage in π-coordination and enhance electronic interactions with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*: 
    - 4-aminobenzoic acid (Entry 4) – High Yield
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Entry 21) – High Yield
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid (Entry 15) – High Yield
  - *Counter-Example*: 
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (Entry 11) – Low Yield (amino group not directly attached to carboxyl-bearing ring)

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a **carboxylic acid group** and an **aldehyde group** tend to give **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can react with amines or other nucleophiles, deactivating the modifier or interfering with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*: 
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid (Entry 19) – Low Yield
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (Entry 18) – Low Yield

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers containing a **perfluoroalkyl chain** attached to a carboxylic acid group tend to give **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Perfluorinated chains increase hydrophobicity and can hinder interaction with the catalyst due to steric and electronic effects.
  - *Example*: 
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid (Entry 13) – Low Yield

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing **ether linkages** (polyether chains) attached to a carboxylic acid group tend to give **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether chains can chelate metal centers differently or increase solubility in the solvent rather than interacting effectively with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*: 
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid (Entry 10) – Low Yield
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid (Entry 32) – Low Yield

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing a **carboxylic acid group** and **multiple hydroxyl groups** tend to give **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups can enhance hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst, improving its performance.
  - *Example*: 
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Entry 9) – High Yield
  - *Counter-Example*: 
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid (Entry 29) – Low Yield (only one hydroxyl group)

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing a **carboxylic acid group** and a **thiol group** tend to give **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Thiol groups can form strong bonds with metal centers, stabilizing the catalyst and enhancing reactivity.
  - *Example*: 
    - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid (Entry 17) – High Yield

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing a **nitro group attached to an aromatic ring** along with a carboxylic acid group tend to give **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Nitro groups are strong electron-withdrawing groups, which can enhance coordination with metal catalysts through resonance effects.
  - *Example*: 
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid (Entry 20) – High Yield

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing an **aromatic ring with electron-donating groups** (e.g., methyl, methoxy) and a carboxylic acid group tend to give **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups can reduce the ability of the modifier to coordinate with the metal catalyst effectively.
  - *Examples*: 
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid (Entry 22) – Low Yield
    - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Entry 12) – Low Yield
  - *Counter-Example*: 
    - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid (Entry 25) – High Yield (additional ketone group may offset the effect)

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing **amide linkages or peptide bonds** tend to give **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide groups may reduce the availability of lone pairs for coordination or interfere with catalytic sites.
  - *Examples*: 
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid (Entry 23) – Low Yield
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (Entry 33) – Low Yield

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers containing **heterocyclic aromatic rings with nitrogen atoms** (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole) attached to a carboxylic acid group tend to give **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen heterocycles can coordinate effectively with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.
  - *Examples*: 
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Entry 21) – High Yield
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid (Entry 15) – High Yield
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid (Entry 8) – High Yield
  - *Counter-Example*: 
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (Entry 11) – Low Yield (possible steric hindrance due to the benzoic linker)

---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **
- **Advice 1**: **Adjust Rule 1 Patterns for Alpha and Beta Amino Groups**

  Update Rule 1's SMARTS patterns to accurately capture modifiers where the amino group is at the alpha or beta position relative to the carboxylic acid group within the same chain. Ensure that the amino group and carboxylic acid are connected correctly.

  - **Alpha Amino Group Pattern**:
    ```python
    alpha_amino = '[NX3;H2,H1][CX4H][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'
    ```
  - **Beta Amino Group Pattern**:
    ```python
    beta_amino = '[NX3;H2,H1][CX4][CX4H][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'
    ```
  Replace the existing patterns in Rule 1 with these to improve matching accuracy.

- **Advice 2**: **Correct Logical Operators in Rule Matching**

  Modify the rule matching logic to ensure that both the amino group and carboxylic acid group are present and correctly positioned. Use combined SMARTS patterns that enforce the spatial relationship between functional groups within the molecule.

  - **Example Combined Pattern**:
    ```python
    alpha_beta_amino_acid = '[NX3;H2,H1][CX4H,X4][CX4H,X4][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'
    ```
  This pattern captures both alpha and beta amino acids by allowing for one or two carbon atoms between the amino group and carboxylic acid.

- **Advice 3**: **Refine Rule 2 Patterns for Aromatic Amino Groups**

  Update Rule 2's SMARTS patterns to accurately capture modifiers with an amino group directly attached to an aromatic ring that also bears a carboxylic acid group.

  - **Updated Pattern**:
    ```python
    aromatic_amino_acid = 'c1(c(C(=O)[O,H]))[cH,c:NH2,NH1,N](c([NH2,NH1,N]))[cH,c]c1'
    ```
  Ensure that the amino group and carboxylic acid are attached to the same aromatic ring to improve rule specificity.

- **Advice 4**: **Rename 'optional_patterns' to 'and_patterns'**

  Change the term `'optional_patterns'` in the code to `'and_patterns'` to more accurately reflect that these patterns are required for a match. Adjust the logic so that all patterns listed under `'and_patterns'` must be present in the molecule for the rule to apply.

- **Advice 5**: **Adjust Rule 9 Patterns for Electron-Donating Groups**

  Refine Rule 9's SMARTS patterns to accurately identify electron-donating groups attached to aromatic rings. Define precise patterns for common electron-donating groups such as methyl and methoxy groups.

  - **Example Pattern for Methyl Group**:
    ```python
    methyl_on_aromatic = '[c][c]([CH3])[c]'
    ```
  - **Example Pattern for Methoxy Group**:
    ```python
    methoxy_on_aromatic = '[c][c](OC)[c]'
    ```
  Use `'and_patterns'` to ensure both the electron-donating group and carboxylic acid are present on the aromatic ring.

- **Advice 6**: **Ensure Accurate Counting in 'count_patterns'**

  Modify the counting logic to accurately count unique functional groups without duplication due to overlapping matches.

  - **Example for Hydroxyl Groups**:
    ```python
    hydroxyl_group = '[OX2H]'
    matches = mol.GetSubstructMatches(Chem.MolFromSmarts(hydroxyl_group), uniquify=True)
    num_hydroxyl_groups = len(matches)
    ```
  Setting `uniquify=True` ensures that only unique matches are counted.

- **Advice 7**: **Refine Rule 5 Patterns for Polyether Chains**

  Update Rule 5's patterns to accurately capture polyether chains by ensuring consecutive ether linkages are correctly identified.

  - **Updated Pattern**:
    ```python
    polyether_chain = '[#6]-O-[#6]-O-[#6]-O-[#6]'
    ```
  This pattern matches molecules with at least three consecutive ether linkages, characteristic of polyether chains.

- **Advice 8**: **Verify 'and_patterns' Logic Across All Rules**

  Review and adjust the logic of `'and_patterns'` in all rules to ensure that multiple required features are enforced correctly. Confirm that the presence of all specified patterns is mandatory for a rule to apply.

- **Advice 9**: **Align SMILES Data with Feature Matrix**

  Ensure that the SMILES strings and the feature matrix are aligned by verifying that their indices match. This alignment prevents misinterpretation of which molecules correspond to which feature vectors.

  - **Implementation Tip**: Use pandas DataFrame indices or identifiers to maintain alignment between datasets.

- **Advice 10**: **Include Error Handling for Invalid SMILES**

  Implement error handling in the code that processes SMILES strings to detect and flag invalid entries.

  - **Example**:
    ```python
    try:
        mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles)
        if mol is None:
            raise ValueError(f'Invalid SMILES: {smiles}')
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
        # Handle the invalid SMILES appropriately
    ```
  This ensures that invalid SMILES do not silently lead to incorrect feature representations.

- **Advice 11**: **Add Unit Tests for Each Rule**

  Create unit tests for each rule using known SMILES strings to validate that the SMARTS patterns and matching logic work as intended.

  - **Example Test Case**:
    ```python
    def test_rule1_alpha_amino_acid():
        smiles = 'NCC(=O)O'  # Glycine
        mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles)
        assert matches_rule1_alpha_amino(mol) == True
    ```
  Regular testing helps identify and correct issues early in the development process.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and provides a straightforward criterion for identifying modifiers that result in high yield. The property insight is solid, explaining how the proximity of the amino group allows for chelation with metal centers, enhancing catalyst coordination. It considers a combination of sub-structures (carboxylic acid group and amino group within three carbons), adding appropriate complexity. The rule is well-supported by multiple examples and counter-examples, ensuring good coverage.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is relatively clear but could benefit from specifying which electron-withdrawing substituents are most effective. The property insight aligns with the understanding that electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing coordination with metal centers. It involves combinations of sub-structures (aromatic ring, carboxylic acid group, and electron-withdrawing substituents), providing sufficient complexity. The rule has acceptable coverage with supporting examples and counter-examples.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear and the rationale provides good property insight into why modifiers with an aldehyde group yield low reactions—due to potential interference with the catalyst. It considers the combination of functional groups (carboxylic acid and aldehyde), adding complexity. However, the coverage is minimal, supported by only two data points, which may limit the reliability of the rule.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 lacks clarity in defining "multiple hydroxyl groups" and their specific positions relative to the carboxylic acid group. The property insight is reasonable, suggesting that multiple hydroxyl groups enhance coordination through hydrogen bonding. It does consider combinations of sub-structures, but the coverage is insufficient, with only one supporting example and one counter-example. This limited data reduces the confidence in the rule's general applicability.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear and provides solid property insight by explaining that functional groups distant from the carboxyl group are less effective in coordinating with metal centers, resulting in low yield. It considers combinations of sub-structures and the effect of chain length, adding appropriate complexity. The rule has good coverage, supported by multiple examples, enhancing its reliability.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear and offers strong property insight into how an amino group on an aromatic ring enhances coordination with metal centers due to its lone pair electrons. It involves combinations of sub-structures (aromatic ring, carboxylic acid group, amino group), providing sufficient complexity. The coverage is good, with several supporting examples and a counter-example that helps refine the rule.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear, and the rationale provides sound property insight by explaining that amide groups' delocalized lone pairs reduce their ability to coordinate with metal centers, leading to low yield. It focuses on specific functional groups (amide linkages or peptide bonds), adding complexity. The coverage is adequate, supported by multiple examples, which strengthens the rule's validity.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear, specifying that perfluoroalkyl chains attached to a carboxylic acid group tend to give low yield due to their high electronegativity hindering metal interaction. The property insight is plausible. However, the coverage is insufficient, with only one supporting example. This limited data weakens the reliability and general applicability of the rule.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is reasonably clear but would benefit from a more precise definition of "electron-donating substituents" and perhaps examples of such groups. The property insight is appropriate, explaining how electron-donating groups decrease the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxyl group. It considers combinations of sub-structures, adding complexity. The coverage is acceptable but not robust, supported by two examples and a counter-example.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear, stating that modifiers with ether linkages tend to give low yield, possibly due to steric hindrance or increased solubility without enhancing catalyst interaction. The property insight is reasonable. It considers specific structural features (ether linkages), adding complexity. However, the coverage is minimal, supported by only two examples, which may limit confidence in the rule.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear and provides strong property insight into how nitrogen atoms in heterocyclic aromatic rings can enhance coordination with metal centers. It involves combinations of sub-structures (heterocyclic aromatic rings with nitrogen atoms and carboxylic acid group), adding appropriate complexity. The coverage is solid, with multiple supporting examples and a counter-example, making the rule reliable.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is clear, suggesting that thiol groups near a carboxylic acid group enhance yield by forming strong coordination bonds with metal centers. The property insight is valid. However, the coverage is inadequate, supported by only one example, which diminishes the rule's reliability and general applicability.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is complex and may lack clarity due to its specificity (ketone group adjacent to a carboxylic acid group attached to an aromatic ring). The property insight is reasonable, proposing that this combination increases coordination sites. However, the coverage is minimal, with only one supporting example and one counter-example, making the rule appear too specific and less reliable.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: For **Rule 2**, please specify which electron-withdrawing groups are most effective. Provide specific examples such as nitro, cyano, or halogen groups like fluoro, chloro, and bromo. This will enhance clarity and help in identifying high-yielding modifiers more accurately.

- **Advice 2**: In **Rule 4**, clarify what is meant by "multiple hydroxyl groups" by specifying the exact number and their positions relative to the carboxylic acid group. For instance, indicate if three or more hydroxyl groups in close proximity (e.g., adjacent carbons) are required to achieve high yield. This specificity will improve the rule's applicability.

- **Advice 3**: For rules with limited coverage, such as **Rule 3 (aldehyde-containing modifiers)**, **Rule 8 (perfluoroalkyl chains)**, **Rule 12 (thiol groups near carboxylic acid)**, and **Rule 13 (ketone adjacent to carboxylic acid on aromatic ring)**, consider combining them if they share common features or re-evaluating their inclusion due to insufficient data. Alternatively, gather more examples to strengthen these rules or present them as observations rather than definitive rules.

- **Advice 4**: In **Rule 9**, provide a precise definition of "electron-donating substituents" by listing specific groups such as methyl, methoxy, and hydroxy. Include examples of modifiers containing these groups that result in low yield. This will enhance clarity and assist users in applying the rule more effectively.

- **Advice 5**: For **Rule 10**, which addresses modifiers with ether linkages and has limited coverage, consider seeking additional data to support the rule or clarify the structural requirements. If insufficient data exists, rephrase the rule to reflect the uncertainty or integrate it with related rules to provide a broader context.

- **Advice 6**: Re-evaluate **Rule 13** due to its complexity and minimal supporting data. Simplify the rule by focusing on the key functional groups that contribute to high yield without over-specifying structural details. If possible, incorporate its insights into **Rule 2** or another relevant rule to consolidate the information.

- **Advice 7**: For rules supported by a single example (e.g., **Rules 8 and 12**), consider presenting them as tentative observations. Encourage the collection of more data to confirm these trends before establishing them as firm rules.

- **Advice 8**: Ensure that all rules specify not only the functional groups but also consider the overall molecular context, such as steric factors and conjugation, which may influence the yield. Including this information will provide a more comprehensive understanding of how different modifiers affect the reaction.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing a **carboxylic acid group** and an **amino group within four carbons (α to δ positions)** of the carboxyl group tend to give a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The proximity of the amino group enhances chelation with metal centers, improving catalyst coordination and reactivity.
  - *Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Entry 0) – High Yield
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Entry 2) – High Yield
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (Entry 3) – High Yield
  - *Counter-Examples*:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Entry 31) – Low Yield (amino group too distant)
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Entry 34) – Low Yield

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers containing a **carboxylic acid group** attached directly to an **aromatic ring** with an **electron-withdrawing substituent** (e.g., nitro, halogens) tend to give a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers.
  - *Examples*:
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Entry 1) – High Yield
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Entry 20) – High Yield
  - *Counter-Examples*:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 22) – Low Yield (electron-donating methyl group)
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30) – Low Yield (electron-donating hydroxy group)

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a **carboxylic acid group** and an **aldehyde group** tend to give a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can engage in side reactions or inhibit catalyst activity by interacting with active sites.
  - *Examples*:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19) – Low Yield
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 18) – Low Yield

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers containing **amide linkages** or **peptide bonds** tend to give a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide bonds have resonance-stabilized lone pairs, reducing their ability to coordinate effectively with metal centers.
  - *Examples*:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 33) – Low Yield
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Entry 26) – Low Yield
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (Entry 23) – Low Yield

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing **heterocyclic aromatic rings with nitrogen atoms** directly attached to a **carboxylic acid group** tend to give a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles can act as additional coordination sites, enhancing interaction with metal centers.
  - *Examples*:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Entry 21) – High Yield
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 15) – High Yield
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 8) – High Yield
  - *Counter-Examples*:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 11) – Low Yield (possible steric hindrance due to fused aromatic systems)

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing a **carboxylic acid group** and a **thiol group** in close proximity tend to give a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Thiol groups can form strong coordination bonds with metal centers, stabilizing the catalyst.
  - *Example*:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 17) – High Yield

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing **perfluoroalkyl chains** attached to a **carboxylic acid group** tend to give a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Perfluoroalkyl groups are highly electronegative and can repel catalytic metal centers or hinder effective coordination.
  - *Example*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Entry 13) – Low Yield

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with **long aliphatic chains** that have **terminal amino or hydroxyl groups** distant from the **carboxylic acid group** tend to give a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Functional groups far from the carboxyl group are less effective in coordinating with metal centers.
  - *Examples*:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Entry 29) – Low Yield
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Entry 31) – Low Yield
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Entry 34) – Low Yield

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **ether linkages** within their structure tend to give a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether oxygen atoms may not coordinate effectively due to steric factors and can increase solubility without enhancing catalyst interaction.
  - *Examples*:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 10) – Low Yield
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32) – Low Yield

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing a **ketone group adjacent to a carboxylic acid group** attached to an **aromatic ring** tend to give a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The combination of ketone and carboxyl groups adjacent to an aromatic system increases coordination sites and stabilizes interactions with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Entry 16) – High Yield
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (Entry 25) – High Yield
  - *Counter-Example*:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Entry 27) – Low Yield (absence of aromatic ring reduces coordination effectiveness)

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers containing an **aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents** (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxy) attached to a **carboxylic acid group** tend to give a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing its ability to coordinate with metal centers.
  - *Examples*:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 22) – Low Yield
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30) – Low Yield
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Entry 26) – Low Yield
  - *Counter-Example*:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Entry 7) – High Yield (the longer aliphatic chain may mitigate the electron-donating effect)

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **simple aliphatic carboxylic acids** without additional functional groups tend to give a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Simplistic structures may allow for better access and coordination to the metal centers without steric hindrance.
  - *Example*:
    - **Octanoic acid** (Entry 5) – High Yield

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and well-defined, focusing on modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and an amino group within four carbons of the carboxyl group. The physical-chemical insight is solid, attributing high yields to enhanced chelation with metal centers due to the proximity of the amino group. It effectively considers combinations of functional groups and is supported by multiple data points (Entries 0, 2, 3), meeting the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is straightforward, describing modifiers with a carboxylic acid directly attached to an aromatic ring bearing electron-withdrawing substituents. The rationale is sound, linking increased acidity and coordination ability to the presence of electron-withdrawing groups. It combines sub-structural elements and is supported by several examples (Entries 1, 20) and counter-examples (Entries 22, 30), fulfilling the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 clearly identifies modifiers containing both a carboxylic acid and an aldehyde group as leading to low yields. The provided insight—that aldehyde groups may engage in side reactions or inhibit catalyst activity—is reasonable. It considers a combination of functional groups and is backed by at least two data points (Entries 18, 19), satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 addresses modifiers with amide linkages or peptide bonds, associating them with low yields. The rationale provided is that resonance stabilization reduces their ability to coordinate with metal centers, which is chemically plausible. It looks at specific functional groups in combination and is supported by multiple data points (Entries 23, 26, 33), meeting the coverage standard.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 pertains to modifiers containing heterocyclic aromatic rings with nitrogen atoms directly attached to a carboxylic acid group, resulting in high yields. The physical-chemical insight is appropriate, emphasizing additional coordination sites from nitrogen atoms. While generally clear, the term "directly attached" could be more precise. It considers complex sub-structures and is supported by examples (Entries 8, 15, 21) and a counter-example (Entry 11), fulfilling the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear in identifying modifiers with a carboxylic acid and a nearby thiol group as leading to high yields. The rationale about strong coordination bonds with metal centers is credible. However, coverage is limited to a single example (Entry 17), which does not meet the criterion of having at least two supporting data points.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 clearly describes modifiers with perfluoroalkyl chains attached to a carboxylic acid group, associated with low yields. The provided insight is acceptable, noting the potential for these groups to hinder coordination due to their electronegativity. Nevertheless, only one data point (Entry 13) supports this rule, falling short on the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 effectively states that modifiers with long aliphatic chains and terminal amino or hydroxyl groups distant from the carboxylic acid group result in low yields. The rationale is sound, explaining the reduced effectiveness in metal coordination. It considers the combination of structural features and is supported by multiple data points (Entries 29, 31, 34), satisfying the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 identifies modifiers containing ether linkages as leading to low yields. The physical-chemical insight provided is reasonable, suggesting that ether oxygens may not coordinate effectively and could introduce steric hindrance. It focuses on specific functional groups and is backed by at least two data points (Entries 10, 32), meeting the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 discusses modifiers with a ketone group adjacent to a carboxylic acid attached to an aromatic ring, resulting in high yields. The rationale is convincing, highlighting increased coordination sites. While the rule is complex, it is clear and considers multiple sub-structures. It is supported by examples (Entries 16, 25) and a counter-example (Entry 27), fulfilling the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear, linking modifiers with aromatic rings bearing electron-donating substituents to low yields. The insight about decreased acidity and coordination ability is valid. It effectively considers combinations of sub-structures and is supported by multiple data points (Entries 22, 26, 30). However, the counter-example (Entry 7) suggests exceptions to the rule, indicating that other structural factors may influence the outcome.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 states that simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups tend to give high yields. While the rule is clear, it lacks depth in physical-chemical insight, providing only a general rationale about simplicity aiding coordination. Coverage is insufficient, as it is supported by only one data point (Entry 5), which does not meet the coverage criterion.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Enhance Rule Coverage and Robustness**  
  Review the existing rules and ensure that each rule is supported by multiple examples and counter-examples from the dataset. For rules with limited coverage (e.g., Rules 4, 6, 7, 8, 12), either find additional data points within the dataset or consider merging them with related rules to create more general and robust rules. This will improve the reliability and applicability of the rules.

- **Advice 2**: **Incorporate SMILES-Based Substructure Patterns**  
  Update the rules by defining key functional groups and substructures using SMILES notation. This will improve precision and facilitate computational analysis. For example, specify functional groups like `[NH2]` for amino groups, `C(=O)OH` for carboxylic acid groups, and use SMILES patterns to define proximity (e.g., `[CH2][CH2][NH2]` for an amino group three carbons away from a carboxyl group).

- **Advice 3**: **Improve Clarity and Specificity of Rules**  
  Refine the language of the rules to make them more precise. Clearly define terms like "close proximity," "multiple hydroxyl groups," or "distant functional groups" by specifying the exact number of atoms or bonds separating them. This specificity will reduce ambiguity and enhance the rules' effectiveness.

- **Advice 4**: **Address Overlaps and Contradictions Between Rules**  
  Identify and resolve any conflicts or redundancies among the rules. For instance, if a modifier falls under two rules with opposing predictions, clarify which rule takes precedence or adjust the rules to prevent overlap. Ensuring that the rules are mutually exclusive where possible will improve prediction accuracy.

- **Advice 5**: **Combine Similar Rules for Simplification**  
  Merge rules that have similar rationales or affect yield in the same way to simplify the rule set. For example, combine rules about electron-donating groups leading to low yield into a single rule, specifying all relevant substituents. This will make the rule set more concise and easier to apply.

- **Advice 6**: **Expand on Property Insights with Chemical Justifications**  
  Enhance the rationales by including detailed chemical explanations for why certain functional groups or substructures affect the yield. Reference concepts like electron density, coordination chemistry, and steric effects to provide a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms.

- **Advice 7**: **Reevaluate Rules with Limited Data Support**  
  For rules supported by only one example (e.g., Rules 6, 7, 12), consider whether they are statistically significant. If additional data cannot be found, these rules may need to be removed or rephrased as observations rather than definitive rules. Alternatively, investigate external datasets or literature to find more supporting evidence.

- **Advice 8**: **Incorporate Quantitative Parameters Where Applicable**  
  Where possible, include quantitative thresholds in the rules. For example, specify exact distances (in terms of bonds) for "proximate" functional groups or define ranges for electron-withdrawing effects using known parameters like Hammett constants. This will add rigor to the rules and enhance their predictive capabilities.

- **Advice 9**: **Use Hierarchical Rule Structuring**  
  Organize the rules hierarchically, starting with the most influential factors affecting yield. This approach can help in prioritizing rules during prediction and resolving conflicts when a modifier fits multiple rules.

- **Advice 10**: **Validate and Refine Rules with Computational Tools**  
  Utilize cheminformatics software to model the modifiers and predict their interactions with the catalyst. Computational validation can identify exceptions to the rules or suggest additional factors to consider, leading to more refined and accurate rules.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing a **carboxylic acid group** and an **amino group within four carbons (α to δ positions)** of the carboxyl group tend to give a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The proximity of the amino group enhances chelation with metal centers, improving catalyst coordination and reactivity.
  - *Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Entry 0) – High Yield
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Entry 2) – High Yield
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (Entry 3) – High Yield
  - *Counter-Examples*:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Entry 31) – Low Yield (amino group too distant)
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Entry 34) – Low Yield

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers containing a **carboxylic acid group** attached directly to an **aromatic ring** with an **electron-withdrawing substituent** (e.g., nitro, halogens) tend to give a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers.
  - *Examples*:
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Entry 1) – High Yield
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Entry 20) – High Yield
  - *Counter-Examples*:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 22) – Low Yield (electron-donating methyl group)
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30) – Low Yield (electron-donating hydroxy group)

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a **carboxylic acid group** and an **aldehyde group** tend to give a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can engage in side reactions or inhibit catalyst activity by interacting with active sites.
  - *Examples*:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19) – Low Yield
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 18) – Low Yield

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers containing **amide linkages** or **peptide bonds** tend to give a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide bonds have resonance-stabilized lone pairs, reducing their ability to coordinate effectively with metal centers.
  - *Examples*:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 33) – Low Yield
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Entry 26) – Low Yield
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (Entry 23) – Low Yield

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing **heterocyclic aromatic rings with nitrogen atoms** directly attached to a **carboxylic acid group** tend to give a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles can act as additional coordination sites, enhancing interaction with metal centers.
  - *Examples*:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Entry 21) – High Yield
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 15) – High Yield
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 8) – High Yield
  - *Counter-Examples*:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 11) – Low Yield (possible steric hindrance due to fused aromatic systems)

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing a **carboxylic acid group** and a **thiol group** in close proximity tend to give a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Thiol groups can form strong coordination bonds with metal centers, stabilizing the catalyst.
  - *Example*:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 17) – High Yield

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing **perfluoroalkyl chains** attached to a **carboxylic acid group** tend to give a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Perfluoroalkyl groups are highly electronegative and can repel catalytic metal centers or hinder effective coordination.
  - *Example*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Entry 13) – Low Yield

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with **long aliphatic chains** that have **terminal amino or hydroxyl groups** distant from the **carboxylic acid group** tend to give a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Functional groups far from the carboxyl group are less effective in coordinating with metal centers.
  - *Examples*:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Entry 29) – Low Yield
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Entry 31) – Low Yield
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Entry 34) – Low Yield

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **ether linkages** within their structure tend to give a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether oxygen atoms may not coordinate effectively due to steric factors and can increase solubility without enhancing catalyst interaction.
  - *Examples*:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 10) – Low Yield
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32) – Low Yield

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing a **ketone group adjacent to a carboxylic acid group** attached to an **aromatic ring** tend to give a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The combination of ketone and carboxyl groups adjacent to an aromatic system increases coordination sites and stabilizes interactions with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Entry 16) – High Yield
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (Entry 25) – High Yield
  - *Counter-Example*:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Entry 27) – Low Yield (absence of aromatic ring reduces coordination effectiveness)

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers containing an **aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents** (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxy) attached to a **carboxylic acid group** tend to give a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing its ability to coordinate with metal centers.
  - *Examples*:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 22) – Low Yield
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30) – Low Yield
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Entry 26) – Low Yield
  - *Counter-Example*:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Entry 7) – High Yield (the longer aliphatic chain may mitigate the electron-donating effect)

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **simple aliphatic carboxylic acids** without additional functional groups tend to give a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Simplistic structures may allow for better access and coordination to the metal centers without steric hindrance.
  - *Example*:
    - **Octanoic acid** (Entry 5) – High Yield

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Verify Substructure Match Atom Indices**

  In your code, when you use `mol.GetSubstructMatches()`, it returns a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple represents a match and contains the atom indices corresponding to the atoms in your SMARTS pattern **in the order they appear in the SMARTS**. For example, for the carboxylic acid pattern `'[CX3](=O)[O;H1,-1]'`, each match will contain three atom indices: the carbonyl carbon, the carbonyl oxygen, and the hydroxyl oxygen. 

  **Issue**: In your code, you assume that `c_match[0]` gives you the index of the carboxylic carbon. However, depending on the SMARTS pattern and how RDKit interprets it, the order might not be as you expect.

  **Solution**: Explicitly assign atom indices based on the positions in your SMARTS pattern. For example:

  ```python
  # For carboxylic acid
  for c_match in carboxy_matches:
      c_idx = c_match[0]  # Carbonyl carbon
      o_idx = c_match[1]  # Carbonyl oxygen
      oh_idx = c_match[2]  # Hydroxyl oxygen
  ```

  Verify the order by testing the SMARTS patterns on known molecules and printing out the atom indices to confirm they correspond to the right atoms.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Fix Rule 1 Matching Logic**

  In Rule 1, you need to find if there's a carboxylic acid group and an amino group within four carbons (α to δ positions) of the carboxyl group.

  **Issue**: The current code might not correctly identify the proximity because it calculates the shortest path between the carboxylic carbon and the amino nitrogen without considering only carbon atoms. Furthermore, the path length may not correspond to the number of carbons between the functional groups.

  **Solution**: Modify the path length calculation to count only carbon atoms between the carboxyl carbon and the amino nitrogen. Use a breadth-first search (BFS) that considers paths through carbon atoms only. Alternatively, after finding the shortest path, count the number of carbon atoms between the two groups.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Correct the Electron-Withdrawing Group Matching in Rule 2**

  In Rule 2, you need to check for electron-withdrawing substituents (EWGs) on the aromatic ring attached to the carboxylic acid.

  **Issue**: The current code may incorrectly use `mol.GetSubstructMatch()` with the `atoms` argument, which doesn't specify the atoms to match against but rather restricts the match to those atoms, leading to potential false negatives.

  **Solution**: Instead of using `mol.GetSubstructMatch(ewg_pat, atoms=[atom_idx])`, traverse the atoms in the ring and for each atom, check if it matches any EWG patterns:

  ```python
  for atom_idx in ring:
      atom = mol.GetAtomWithIdx(atom_idx)
      for ewg_pat in electron_withdrawing_pats:
          if atom.HasSubstructMatch(ewg_pat):
              ewg_found = True
              break
      if ewg_found:
          break
  ```

  Alternatively, generate a subgraph for the aromatic ring and use `HasSubstructMatch()`.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Adjust SMARTS Patterns for Functional Groups**

  Ensure that your SMARTS patterns accurately capture the functional groups described in the rules.

  **Issues**:

  - **Amine SMARTS**: The pattern `'[NX3;H2,H1;!$(N-C=O)]'` may not match secondary amines correctly and might exclude some amines due to the amide exclusion group.

    **Solution**: Simplify the amine SMARTS to include primary and secondary amines while excluding amides:

    ```python
    amine_smarts = '[NX3;!$(N-C=O)]'
    amine_pat = Chem.MolFromSmarts(amine_smarts)
    ```

    Then, filter amines by checking the number of hydrogen atoms attached:

    ```python
    for a_match in amine_matches:
        a_idx = a_match[0]
        a_atom = mol.GetAtomWithIdx(a_idx)
        if a_atom.GetTotalNumHs() > 0:
            # Proceed with path length calculation
    ```

  - **Perfluoroalkyl SMARTS**: The pattern `'[CX4]([F,Cl,Br,I])([F,Cl,Br,I])[F,Cl,Br,I]'` only matches carbon atoms with three halogens attached, which may not capture all perfluoroalkyl chains.

    **Solution**: Modify the SMARTS to identify any carbon in a perfluoroalkyl chain:

    ```python
    perfluoroalkyl_smarts = '[CX4][CX4](F)(F)(F)'
    ```

    Or to match longer chains:

    ```python
    perfluoroalkyl_smarts = 'C(F)(F)(F)'
    ```

- **Suggestion 5**: **Enhance Rule 8 Logic**

  For Rule 8, you need to determine if the amino or hydroxyl groups are distant from the carboxylic acid group.

  **Issue**: The current code may incorrectly label molecules because it only checks if any such group is more than six bonds away from the carboxylic acid, rather than ensuring that the terminal functional group is distant.

  **Solution**: Identify terminal amino or hydroxyl groups and calculate their distance from the carboxylic acid group:

  ```python
  # Identify terminal amino/hydroxyl groups
  terminal_groups = []
  for a_match in amine_matches:
      a_idx = a_match[0]
      a_atom = mol.GetAtomWithIdx(a_idx)
      if len(a_atom.GetNeighbors()) == 1:
          terminal_groups.append(a_idx)
  for h_match in hydroxyl_matches:
      h_idx = h_match[0]
      h_atom = mol.GetAtomWithIdx(h_idx)
      if len(h_atom.GetNeighbors()) == 1:
          terminal_groups.append(h_idx)

  # Calculate distance from carboxylic acid
  for c_match in carboxy_matches:
      c_idx = c_match[0]
      for tg_idx in terminal_groups:
          path = Chem.GetShortestPath(mol, c_idx, tg_idx)
          if path and len(path)-1 > 6:
              rule8_match = -1
              break
  ```

- **Suggestion 6**: **Check for Exception Handling and Debugging**

  **Issue**: The code suppresses exceptions without providing error details, making it challenging to debug.

  **Solution**: Modify the exception handling to log or print errors:

  ```python
  except Exception as e:
      print(f"Error processing SMILES {smi}: {e}")
      row = [0]*12
  ```

  This will help identify if any molecules are failing due to parsing errors or unexpected exceptions.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Review Ether SMARTS Pattern in Rule 9**

  The ether SMARTS pattern `'[#6][OX2][#6]'` may match any C-O-C linkage, including those in esters or other functional groups.

  **Issue**: This might lead to false positives by matching functional groups other than simple ethers.

  **Solution**: Refine the ether SMARTS pattern to exclude esters and other oxygen-containing groups:

  ```python
  ether_smarts = '[#6][OX2;!$(O=C)][#6]'
  ```

- **Suggestion 8**: **Validate Parsing of SMILES Strings**

  **Issue**: If `mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smi)` returns `None`, the molecule isn't parsed correctly.

  **Solution**: Ensure all SMILES strings are valid. If any SMILES strings are failing to parse, correct them or remove invalid entries.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Test Individual Rules with Known Molecules**

  **Issue**: The code might have logical errors that aren't apparent without testing.

  **Solution**: Create unit tests for each rule using molecules where the expected outcome is known. This helps verify that each rule functions as intended.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Use RDKit's Built-in Functions for Functional Groups**

  **Issue**: Writing custom SMARTS patterns can be error-prone.

  **Solution**: Utilize RDKit's `Chem.MolFeatureFactory` and predefined functional group definitions to identify functional groups reliably.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers containing a **carboxylic acid group** and an **amino group within four carbons (α to δ positions)** of the carboxyl group tend to give a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The proximity of the amino group enhances chelation with metal centers, improving catalyst coordination and reactivity.
  - *Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Entry 0) – High Yield
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Entry 2) – High Yield
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (Entry 3) – High Yield
  - *Counter-Examples*:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Entry 31) – Low Yield (amino group too distant)
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Entry 34) – Low Yield

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers containing a **carboxylic acid group** attached directly to an **aromatic ring** with an **electron-withdrawing substituent** (e.g., nitro, halogens) tend to give a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers.
  - *Examples*:
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Entry 1) – High Yield
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Entry 20) – High Yield
  - *Counter-Examples*:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 22) – Low Yield (electron-donating methyl group)
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30) – Low Yield (electron-donating hydroxy group)

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a **carboxylic acid group** and an **aldehyde group** tend to give a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can engage in side reactions or inhibit catalyst activity by interacting with active sites.
  - *Examples*:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19) – Low Yield
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 18) – Low Yield

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers containing **amide linkages** or **peptide bonds** tend to give a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide bonds have resonance-stabilized lone pairs, reducing their ability to coordinate effectively with metal centers.
  - *Examples*:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 33) – Low Yield
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Entry 26) – Low Yield
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (Entry 23) – Low Yield

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing **heterocyclic aromatic rings with nitrogen atoms** directly attached to a **carboxylic acid group** tend to give a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles can act as additional coordination sites, enhancing interaction with metal centers.
  - *Examples*:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Entry 21) – High Yield
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 15) – High Yield
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 8) – High Yield
  - *Counter-Examples*:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 11) – Low Yield (possible steric hindrance due to fused aromatic systems)

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing a **carboxylic acid group** and a **thiol group** in close proximity tend to give a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Thiol groups can form strong coordination bonds with metal centers, stabilizing the catalyst.
  - *Example*:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 17) – High Yield

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing **perfluoroalkyl chains** attached to a **carboxylic acid group** tend to give a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Perfluoroalkyl groups are highly electronegative and can repel catalytic metal centers or hinder effective coordination.
  - *Example*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Entry 13) – Low Yield

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with **long aliphatic chains** that have **terminal amino or hydroxyl groups** distant from the **carboxylic acid group** tend to give a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Functional groups far from the carboxyl group are less effective in coordinating with metal centers.
  - *Examples*:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Entry 29) – Low Yield
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Entry 31) – Low Yield
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Entry 34) – Low Yield

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **ether linkages** within their structure tend to give a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether oxygen atoms may not coordinate effectively due to steric factors and can increase solubility without enhancing catalyst interaction.
  - *Examples*:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 10) – Low Yield
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32) – Low Yield

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing a **ketone group adjacent to a carboxylic acid group** attached to an **aromatic ring** tend to give a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The combination of ketone and carboxyl groups adjacent to an aromatic system increases coordination sites and stabilizes interactions with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Entry 16) – High Yield
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (Entry 25) – High Yield
  - *Counter-Example*:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Entry 27) – Low Yield (absence of aromatic ring reduces coordination effectiveness)

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers containing an **aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents** (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxy) attached to a **carboxylic acid group** tend to give a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing its ability to coordinate with metal centers.
  - *Examples*:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 22) – Low Yield
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30) – Low Yield
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Entry 26) – Low Yield
  - *Counter-Example*:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Entry 7) – High Yield (the longer aliphatic chain may mitigate the electron-donating effect)

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **simple aliphatic carboxylic acids** without additional functional groups tend to give a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Simplistic structures may allow for better access and coordination to the metal centers without steric hindrance.
  - *Example*:
    - **Octanoic acid** (Entry 5) – High Yield

**Analysis of Current Rule Metrics Compared to Reference Metrics**

Based on the provided metrics and the set of current rules, here's a detailed analysis focusing on **confidence** and **lift**, using the previous metrics as a baseline for comparison.

---

### **1. Train Support**

- **Previous Metrics**: 
  - **Train Support**: 0.1667 and 0.1845
- **Current Metric**: 
  - **Train Support**: **0.0571**

**Comment**:
- **Decrease in Support**: The current train support has decreased significantly compared to the previous metrics. This means that the current set of rules applies to a smaller portion (**5.71%**) of the training data, down from approximately **16.67% - 18.45%** previously.
- **Implication**: While the rules are becoming more specific, they might be overlooking a larger portion of the data, potentially missing other important patterns or associations.

---

### **2. Train Confidence**

- **Previous Metrics**:
  - **Train Confidence**: 0.6352 and 0.5396
- **Current Metric**: 
  - **Train Confidence**: **0.7146**

**Comment**:
- **Increase in Confidence**: The current train confidence has increased, indicating that when the rule conditions are met, there is a **71.46%** chance that the prediction (high yield) is correct, up from approximately **53.96% - 63.52%** previously.
- **Implication**: The rules are more accurate for the instances they cover, suggesting improved precision in predicting high yields.

---

### **3. Train Lift**

- **Previous Metrics**:
  - **Train Lift**: 1.2048 and 1.0559
- **Current Metric**: 
  - **Train Lift**: **1.4427**

**Comment**:
- **Increase in Lift**: The lift has increased significantly, indicating that the predictive power of the rules relative to random chance is stronger. A lift of **1.4427** means the rule is about **44.27%** more effective at predicting high yields than random guessing, compared to **5.59% - 20.48%** previously.
- **Implication**: Higher lift values suggest that the rules are capturing meaningful associations that are not due to chance.

---

### **4. Train Leverage**

- **Previous Metrics**:
  - **Train Leverage**: 0.0289 and -0.0041
- **Current Metric**: 
  - **Train Leverage**: **0.0217**

**Comment**:
- **Positive Leverage**: The current leverage is positive and comparable to the higher end of the previous metrics.
- **Implication**: Positive leverage confirms that the rules are identifying associations stronger than would be expected by chance, reinforcing the significance of the rules.

---

### **Overall Assessment**

- **Improved Precision**: The increase in **confidence** and **lift** suggests that the current rules are more precise in predicting high yields when their conditions are met.
- **Reduced Coverage**: The decrease in **support** indicates that the rules apply to fewer instances, potentially limiting their practical utility in broader applications.
- **Balance Between Specificity and Generalization**: The current rules are more specific, which enhances prediction accuracy but may overlook other relevant cases.

---

### **Determination of Convergence and Iteration Sufficiency**

- **Local Minimum Consideration**:
  - The increase in confidence and lift, coupled with decreased support, suggests that the model might be converging to a local minimum where it is optimizing for precision at the expense of coverage.
- **Sufficiency of Iterations**:
  - Given the current trajectory—improved precision but reduced coverage—it may indicate that further iterations are necessary to find a better balance.
  - There is a risk of overfitting to the training data, especially since the support has decreased significantly.

---

### **Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

1. **Increase Rule Coverage Without Sacrificing Too Much Precision**:
   - **Combine Similar Rules**: Identify rules with overlapping conditions and consider merging them to cover more instances.
   - **Relax Stringent Conditions**: Re-evaluate the conditions that might be too restrictive. For example, consider broadening the acceptable range for functional group positions or types.

2. **Incorporate Additional Data Points**:
   - **Analyze Low Yield Instances**: Study the modifiers that result in low yields but are close to the high-yield criteria to identify potential exceptions or additional factors influencing yield.
   - **Feature Engineering**: Include more molecular descriptors (e.g., electronic properties, steric factors) to capture nuances not currently accounted for.

3. **Balance Electron Donating and Withdrawing Effects**:
   - Some rules emphasize the impact of electron-withdrawing groups on yield. Investigate if certain electron-donating groups, when combined with other structural features, could also result in high yields.

4. **Assess for Overfitting**:
   - **Cross-Validation**: Use techniques like cross-validation to ensure that the rules generalize well to unseen data.
   - **Test Set Evaluation**: Apply the rules to a separate test set to evaluate their performance outside of the training data.

5. **Iterative Refinement**:
   - **Feedback Loop**: Use insights from incorrect predictions to refine the rules.
   - **Expert Consultation**: Collaborate with domain experts to validate the chemical plausibility of the rules and their rationales.

6. **Explore Interactions Between Rules**:
   - Analyze whether combinations of rules can cover more data points without significantly lowering confidence. Some modifiers might not fit a single rule but could be explained by the interaction of multiple rules.

---

### **Specific Suggestions for Rule Improvement**

- **Rule 1 (Amino Acids with Proximal Amino Groups)**:
  - **Expand Carbon Position Range**: Consider extending the range beyond four carbons (e.g., include ε-amino acids) to see if it increases support while maintaining confidence.
  - **Evaluate Side Chains**: Incorporate the effect of different side chains on yield, which might reveal additional high-yield modifiers.

- **Rule 5 (Heterocyclic Aromatics with Nitrogen Atoms)**:
  - **Include Additional Heterocycles**: Assess other nitrogen-containing heterocycles to increase support.
  - **Analyze Steric Effects**: Determine if steric hindrance is a significant factor in counter-examples, and adjust the rule accordingly.

- **Rule 11 (Electron-Donating Groups on Aromatic Rings Leading to Low Yield)**:
  - **Identify Exceptions**: Investigate why certain compounds with electron-donating groups still result in high yields (e.g., Entry 7) and adjust the rule to account for these cases.

- **Rule 12 (Simple Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids)**:
  - **Broaden Definition**: Include aliphatic carboxylic acids with small substituents to increase support.
  - **Consider Chain Length Effects**: Analyze how different chain lengths affect yield to refine the rule.

---

### **Conclusion**

- **Strengths of Current Rules**:
  - **High Confidence and Lift**: Indicates strong predictive capability where the rules apply.
  - **Positive Leverage**: Confirms that associations are significant and not due to random chance.

- **Areas for Improvement**:
  - **Low Support**: Rules currently apply to a small subset of data, limiting practical applicability.
  - **Overfitting Risk**: High specificity might hinder generalization to new data.

- **Next Steps**:
  - **Iterate on Rule Development**: Aim to increase support while maintaining acceptable levels of confidence and lift.
  - **Validate with External Data**: Ensure that the refined rules perform well on unseen datasets.
  - **Engage in Collaborative Review**: Utilize the expertise of team members to refine rules and uncover overlooked patterns.

By focusing on these recommendations, we can work towards developing a set of rules that not only predict high yields with high confidence but also apply to a larger portion of the dataset, enhancing their utility in the catalytic problem at hand.

**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

*Using the previous metrics as a baseline and analyzing the latest training results, we observe the following:*

1. **Accuracy Improvement**:
   - **Previous Validation Accuracies**:
     - Validation Accuracy: [0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]; Test Accuracy: 0.75
     - Validation Accuracy: [0.76, 0.68, 0.72, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]; Test Accuracy: 0.75
     - Validation Accuracy: [0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]; Test Accuracy: 0.625
     - Validation Accuracy: [0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]; Test Accuracy: 0.625
   - **Previous Iteration Accuracy**:
     - Validation Accuracy: 0.6286
   - **Current Iteration Accuracy**:
     - Validation Accuracy: **0.8286**

   *The current validation accuracy of 0.8286 represents a significant improvement over both the previous iteration accuracy (0.6286) and the earlier validation accuracies (~0.76). This suggests that the current set of rules has enhanced the model's ability to correctly predict the loading of modifiers on the catalyst.*

2. **Assessing Overfitting/Underfitting**:
   - The model shows improved validation accuracy, indicating better generalization on unseen data within cross-validation.
   - However, the absence of current test accuracy metrics limits our assessment of potential overfitting to the training data.
   - *Given the improved validation accuracy without a corresponding increase in the complexity of the model, there is no immediate indication of overfitting. Nonetheless, monitoring test accuracy in future iterations is essential to confirm this.*

3. **Analyzing Discrepancies via SHAP Analysis**:
   - **Overestimated Loadings** (Predicted High, Experimental Low):
     - *Example Molecules*:
       1. **C(=O)(C(C(C(C(F)(F)F)(F)F)(F)F)(F)F)O**
          - **Rules with High Positive SHAP Values**:
            - Rule 8: **0.1078**
            - Rule 4: **0.0973**
            - Rule 3: **0.0596**
       2. **CC1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=O)O**
          - **Rules with High Positive SHAP Values**:
            - Rule 8: **0.1425**
            - Rule 4: **0.0723**
            - Rule 3: **0.0631**
            - Rule 7: **0.0346**
       3. **C(CCCO)CCC(=O)O**
          - **Rules with High Positive SHAP Values**:
            - Rule 8: **-0.6270**
            - *Note*: Negative SHAP value for Rule 8 indicates it's contributing to predicting low loading.
     - *Analysis*:
       - **Rule 8** consistently contributes significantly to overestimations.
       - **Rule 4** and **Rule 3** also contribute positively but to a lesser extent.
   - **Underestimated Loadings** (Predicted Low, Experimental High):
     - *Example Molecules*:
       1. **C1=CC(=CC=C1CCCCC(=O)O)O**
          - **Rules with Negative SHAP Values**:
            - Rule 8: **-0.6270**
            - Rule 3: **0.0291**
            - Rule 4: **0.0466**
            - Rule 7: **0.0156**
       2. **C(CCCO)CCC(=O)O**
          - *Already mentioned above; predicted low, experimental value is low.*
     - *Analysis*:
       - **Rule 8** has a high negative SHAP value, contributing to underestimation.
       - Suggests that Rule 8 may be overly penalizing certain structures.

4. **Interpretation of Accuracy Improvements**:
   - The increase in validation accuracy from 0.6286 to 0.8286 indicates that the current rules have improved the model's predictive performance.
   - The higher accuracy suggests better alignment between the rules and the underlying chemical phenomena governing catalyst loading.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis**:
   - **Rule 8**:
     - Exhibits both high positive and high negative SHAP values, indicating it strongly influences predictions in both directions.
     - It contributes to overestimations when positive and underestimations when negative.
     - The inconsistencies suggest that Rule 8 may be too broad or not sufficiently specific, capturing a wide range of modifiers without adequately distinguishing their effects.
   - **Rule 4**:
     - Has consistently positive SHAP values in cases of overestimation.
     - May be overemphasizing the importance of certain functional groups (e.g., amide linkages) leading to high predicted loadings where experimental values are low.
   - **Rule 3**:
     - Shows moderate positive SHAP values in overestimations.
     - May require refinement to better capture the impact of aldehyde groups adjacent to carboxylic acids.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

*Based on the analysis above, the following recommendations are proposed to refine the current rules and improve the model's performance:*

1. **Refine Rule 8**:
   - **Current Rule 8**:
     - *Modifiers with long aliphatic chains that have terminal amino or hydroxyl groups distant from the carboxylic acid group tend to give a low yield.*
   - **Issues Identified**:
     - The rule may be too general, leading to misclassification of modifiers with medium-length chains or those where the functional groups, despite being distant, still influence catalyst loading.
     - High negative SHAP values in cases with experimental high loadings suggest that the rule incorrectly penalizes certain structures.
   - **Suggested Refinements**:
     - **Specify Chain Length**: Define the exact chain length (e.g., chains longer than 6 carbons) considered 'long' to reduce ambiguity.
     - **Consider Functional Group Influence**: Account for the presence of additional coordinating groups within the aliphatic chain that may enhance catalyst interaction.
     - **Modify the Rule**:
       - *Revised Rule 8*: Modifiers containing long (>6 carbons) aliphatic chains **without additional coordinating functional groups** tend to give a low yield.
   - **Expected Outcome**:
     - Reduces incorrect penalization of modifiers with beneficial functional groups, improving prediction accuracy for these molecules.

2. **Adjust Rule 4**:
   - **Current Rule 4**:
     - *Modifiers containing amide linkages or peptide bonds tend to give a low yield.*
   - **Issues Identified**:
     - Uniformly penalizes all amide-containing modifiers, potentially overlooking cases where amide groups are adjacent to other functional groups that enhance coordination.
     - Contributes to overestimations in some cases, suggesting the rule may not accurately reflect the influence of amide groups in certain molecular contexts.
   - **Suggested Refinements**:
     - **Incorporate Contextual Factors**: Acknowledge that amide groups adjacent to strong electron-withdrawing groups or additional coordinating sites may not hinder coordination as much.
     - **Modify the Rule**:
       - *Revised Rule 4*: Modifiers containing amide linkages **without adjacent electron-withdrawing groups or additional coordinating functional groups** tend to give a low yield.
   - **Expected Outcome**:
     - Allows the model to account for exceptions where amide-containing modifiers can still result in high yields, reducing overestimations.

3. **Re-evaluate Rule 3**:
   - **Current Rule 3**:
     - *Modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group and an aldehyde group tend to give a low yield.*
   - **Issues Identified**:
     - Contributes to overestimations, indicating that the presence of aldehyde groups may not universally lead to low yields.
   - **Suggested Refinements**:
     - **Differentiate Based on Aldehyde Position**: Consider whether the position of the aldehyde group relative to the carboxylic acid affects the outcome.
     - **Modify the Rule**:
       - *Revised Rule 3*: Modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group and an aldehyde group **in close proximity (e.g., α or β positions)** tend to give a low yield due to potential intramolecular interactions or side reactions.
   - **Expected Outcome**:
     - Reduces misclassification of modifiers where the aldehyde group is positioned such that it does not negatively impact catalyst loading.

4. **Enhance Specificity of Rule 7**:
   - **Current Rule 7**:
     - *Modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl chains attached to a carboxylic acid group tend to give a low yield.*
   - **Issues Identified**:
     - Although Rule 7 shows lower SHAP values, its contribution to overestimations suggests it may need refinement.
   - **Suggested Refinements**:
     - **Define Perfluoroalkyl Chain Length**: Specify the minimum chain length that influences yield.
     - **Consider Additional Functional Groups**: Account for the presence of other functional groups that might mitigate the electron-withdrawing effects of perfluoroalkyl chains.
     - **Modify the Rule**:
       - *Revised Rule 7*: Modifiers containing long perfluoroalkyl chains (e.g., ≥3 carbons) attached to a carboxylic acid group without additional coordinating groups tend to give a low yield.
   - **Expected Outcome**:
     - Improves the rule's precision, reducing overestimations and underestimations related to perfluoroalkyl-containing modifiers.

5. **Address Overfitting and Underfitting**:
   - **Balance Rule Complexity**:
     - Ensure that the rules are neither too simplistic (leading to underfitting) nor too tailored to the training data (leading to overfitting).
   - **Generalization**:
     - Test the modified rules on an independent test set to evaluate their generalizability.
   - **Iterative Refinement**:
     - Continue to use SHAP analysis in subsequent iterations to monitor the impact of rule changes on model predictions.

6. **Leverage SHAP Insights Without Direct Rule Changes**:
   - **Understand Feature Importance**:
     - Use SHAP values to gain insights into which rules have the most significant impact on predictions.
   - **Indirect Rule Improvement**:
     - While direct changes based solely on SHAP values are avoided, the analysis highlights areas where empirical chemical knowledge can be applied to refine rules.
   - **Collaborative Expert Review**:
     - Engage with domain experts (e.g., chemists) to interpret SHAP findings and validate rule modifications.

**Conclusion**

The current set of rules has led to an improved validation accuracy, indicating enhanced predictive performance. However, the SHAP analysis reveals specific rules contributing to misclassifications, particularly Rules 8, 4, and 3. By refining these rules with more precise chemical reasoning and incorporating the insights gained from the SHAP values, we can further improve the model's accuracy and generalizability. Continuous iterative refinement, guided by both the data and domain expertise, will be essential in optimizing the rules for better performance in predicting catalyst modifier loadings.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

**Summary:**

In the current iteration, we have observed significant improvements in the model's performance:

- **Validation Accuracy** increased to **82.86%**, up from previous iterations of around 76% and 62.86%. This indicates better predictive performance.

- **Train Confidence** increased to **71.46%**, suggesting that when the rules predict a high yield, they are correct approximately 71% of the time.

- **Train Lift** improved to **1.44**, meaning the model is 44% better at predicting high yields than random chance.

- **Train Support** decreased to **5.71%**, indicating that the rules apply to a smaller portion of the data compared to previous iterations.

The **SHAP analysis** revealed that certain rules, particularly **Rule 3**, **Rule 4**, and **Rule 8**, have significant positive and negative contributions to the predictions. These rules are contributing to both correct and incorrect predictions, suggesting that they may need refinement.

**Directions to Optimize Current Rules:**

To further improve the current rules without overfitting, I recommend the following optimizations:

1. **Refine Rule 8**:

   - **Issue Identified:** Rule 8 is too general and may incorrectly penalize modifiers with beneficial functional groups that are distant from the carboxylic acid group.

   - **Suggested Refinement:**

     - **Specify Chain Length:** Clearly define what constitutes a "long" aliphatic chain (e.g., chains longer than 6 carbons).

     - **Consider Additional Functional Groups:** Amend the rule to account for modifiers that have additional coordinating groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino groups) within the aliphatic chain that can enhance coordination, even if they are distant from the carboxylic acid group.

     - **Revised Rule 8:** Modifiers containing long (>6 carbons) aliphatic chains **without additional coordinating functional groups along the chain** tend to give a **low yield**.

2. **Adjust Rule 4**:

   - **Issue Identified:** Rule 4 may be overly broad by penalizing all modifiers with amide linkages or peptide bonds, potentially missing cases where these groups do not hinder coordination.

   - **Suggested Refinement:**

     - **Incorporate Contextual Factors:** Modify the rule to consider the presence of electron-withdrawing groups or additional coordinating sites near the amide linkage that may enhance coordination with metal centers.

     - **Revised Rule 4:** Modifiers containing amide linkages **without adjacent electron-withdrawing groups or additional coordinating functional groups** tend to give a **low yield**.

3. **Re-evaluate Rule 3**:

   - **Issue Identified:** Rule 3 may overgeneralize the negative impact of aldehyde groups, leading to incorrect predictions.

   - **Suggested Refinement:**

     - **Differentiate Based on Aldehyde Position:** Specify that only aldehyde groups in close proximity (e.g., at the α or β position) to the carboxylic acid group negatively impact yield.

     - **Revised Rule 3:** Modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group and an aldehyde group **in close proximity (α or β positions)** tend to give a **low yield**.

4. **Enhance Specificity of Rule 7**:

   - **Issue Identified:** Rule 7 may be too broad, leading to overgeneralization.

   - **Suggested Refinement:**

     - **Define Perfluoroalkyl Chain Length:** Specify the minimum chain length of perfluoroalkyl groups (e.g., three or more carbons) that affect yield.

     - **Consider Additional Functional Groups:** Adjust the rule to account for the presence of coordinating groups that may mitigate the negative impact of perfluoroalkyl chains.

     - **Revised Rule 7:** Modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl chains of **three or more carbons** attached to a carboxylic acid group **without additional coordinating functional groups** tend to give a **low yield**.

5. **Increase Rule Coverage Without Sacrificing Precision**:

   - **Issue Identified:** The decrease in train support suggests that the rules are too specific and cover a smaller portion of the data.

   - **Suggested Refinement:**

     - **Relax Stringent Conditions:** Re-evaluate conditions that may be too restrictive in some rules to include more data points.

     - **Combine Similar Rules:** Identify and merge overlapping rules to increase their applicability.

     - **Expand Acceptable Functional Groups:** Consider including additional functional groups that may also enhance coordination with metal centers.

6. **Assess for Overfitting**:

   - **Action Required:** Continuously monitor the model for signs of overfitting by evaluating performance on independent test sets.

   - **Cross-Validation:** Use techniques like cross-validation to ensure that the refined rules generalize well to unseen data.

7. **Iterative Refinement Using SHAP Analysis**:

   - **Leverage Insights:** Use SHAP values to understand the impact of each rule on the model's predictions.

   - **Adjust Rules Accordingly:** Refine rules that contribute to misclassifications based on their SHAP values while ensuring that changes are grounded in chemical reasoning.

8. **Collaborate with Domain Experts**:

   - **Expert Validation:** Engage with chemists or other domain experts to validate the chemical plausibility of the rules and their rationales.

   - **Incorporate Feedback:** Use expert feedback to further refine the rules and uncover potentially overlooked patterns.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

There is a clear possibility for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. By refining rules that are too broad or too restrictive and incorporating additional chemical insights, we can enhance the model's predictive power while maintaining or improving its generalizability. Adjustments grounded in chemical reasoning will help avoid overfitting and ensure that the rules capture the true underlying patterns in the data.

  - *Rationale*: Thiol groups can form strong coordination bonds with metal centers, stabilizing the catalyst.
  - *Example*:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 17) – High Yield

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing **perfluoroalkyl chains** attached to a **carboxylic acid group** tend to give a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Perfluoroalkyl groups are highly electronegative and can repel catalytic metal centers or hinder effective coordination.
  - *Example*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Entry 13) – Low Yield

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with **long aliphatic chains** that have **terminal amino or hydroxyl groups** distant from the **carboxylic acid group** tend to give a **low yield**.

  - *Examples*:
    - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Entry 16) – High Yield
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (Entry 25) – High Yield
  - *Counter-Example*:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Entry 27) – Low Yield (absence of aromatic ring reduces coordination effectiveness)

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers containing an **aromatic ring with electron-donating substituents** (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxy) attached to a **carboxylic acid group** tend to give a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing its ability to coordinate with metal centers.
  - *Examples*:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 22) – Low Yield
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30) – Low Yield
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Entry 26) – Low Yield
  - *Counter-Example*:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Entry 7) – High Yield (the longer aliphatic chain may mitigate the electron-donating effect)

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **simple aliphatic carboxylic acids** without additional functional groups tend to give a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Simplistic structures may allow for better access and coordination to the metal centers without steric hindrance.
  - *Example*:
    - **Octanoic acid** (Entry 5) – High Yield

** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Refine Rule 8 to Specify Chain Length and Presence of Functional Groups**

  - **Action**: Modify Rule 8 to define "long aliphatic chains" explicitly as chains longer than 6 carbon atoms.
  - **Adjust the Rule**: Update Rule 8 to state:
    - *"Modifiers containing aliphatic chains longer than 6 carbons without additional coordinating functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl -OH or amino -NH₂ groups) along the chain tend to give a low yield."*
  - **Implement in SMILES**:
    - Identify modifiers with aliphatic chains (`CCCCCCC` or longer) lacking -OH or -NH₂ groups.
    - Use SMARTS patterns to exclude chains with coordinating groups:
      - Pattern for long chain without functional groups: `C{7,}`, meaning 7 or more consecutive carbon atoms.
      - Exclude molecules where the long chain has attached -OH (`[CX4][OH]`) or -NH₂ (`[CX4][NH2]`).

- **Advice 2**: **Adjust Rule 4 to Consider Adjacent Groups**

  - **Action**: Refine Rule 4 to account for the presence of electron-withdrawing or coordinating groups near the amide linkage.
  - **Adjust the Rule**: Update Rule 4 to state:
    - *"Modifiers containing amide linkages or peptide bonds without adjacent electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halogens) or additional coordinating functional groups (e.g., -OH, -NH₂) tend to give a low yield."*
  - **Implement in SMILES**:
    - Detect amide groups: `C(=O)N`
    - Check for absence of electron-withdrawing groups or coordinating groups adjacent to the amide:
      - Exclude modifiers with EWG near amide: `[NX3][C](=O)[CX3](E)`, where E is an electron-withdrawing group.
      - Exclude modifiers with adjacent -OH or -NH₂: `[NX3][C](=O)[CX3]([OH,NH2])`

- **Advice 3**: **Refine Rule 3 by Specifying Aldehyde Position**

  - **Action**: Modify Rule 3 to focus on aldehyde groups in close proximity to the carboxylic acid group.
  - **Adjust the Rule**: Update Rule 3 to state:
    - *"Modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group and an aldehyde group at the α or β position tend to give a low yield."*
  - **Implement in SMILES**:
    - Identify carboxylic acid groups: `C(=O)O[H]`
    - Identify aldehyde groups: `C=O`
    - Check for aldehyde within 1 or 2 bonds from the carboxylic carbon:
      - α position: `[C](=O)O[C][C](=O)`
      - β position: `[C](=O)O[C][C][C](=O)`

- **Advice 4**: **Enhance Specificity of Rule 7**

  - **Action**: Refine Rule 7 by defining perfluoroalkyl chain length and considering additional functional groups.
  - **Adjust the Rule**: Update Rule 7 to state:

  - **Implement in SMILES**:
    - Identify perfluoroalkyl chains: `C(F)(F)(F)C(F)(F)(F)C(F)(F)(F)` (three CF₃ groups)
    - Ensure attachment to carboxylic acid: `C(F)(F)(F)C(F)(F)(F)C(F)(F)(F)C(=O)O[H]`
    - Exclude modifiers with coordinating groups: Ensure no -OH or -NH₂ groups in the molecule.

- **Advice 5**: **Relax Stringent Conditions to Increase Rule Coverage**

  - **Action**: Review rules that may be overly restrictive and consider combining or broadening them without compromising accuracy.
  - **Adjustments**:
    - **Rule 12**: Include simple aliphatic carboxylic acids with small, non-hindering substituents.
      - Update Rule 12 to state:
        - *"Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids or have small substituents (e.g., methyl, ethyl) that do not hinder coordination tend to give a high yield."*
    - **Implement in SMILES**:
      - Identify aliphatic carboxylic acids: `[CX3](=O)[OX1H]` attached to an aliphatic chain.
      - Allow small substituents: Alkyl groups up to two carbons (`C` or `CC`).

- **Advice 6**: **Iteratively Refine Rules Using SHAP Analysis**

  - **Action**: Utilize SHAP values to pinpoint rules contributing to misclassifications and adjust them accordingly.
  - **Adjustments**:
    - For rules with high SHAP values leading to errors, refine the corresponding SMARTS patterns to improve specificity.
    - **Example**:
      - If a rule incorrectly labels modifiers due to the presence of a specific substructure, modify the rule to exclude that substructure.
    - **Implement in SMILES**:
      - Adjust patterns to exclude or include certain features based on SHAP insights.

- **Advice 7**: **Collaborate with Domain Experts for Rule Validation**

  - **Action**: Engage with chemists to ensure rules are chemically sound and capture meaningful patterns.
  - **Adjustments**:
    - Review each rule's rationale and SMILES implementation with experts.
    - Incorporate their feedback to refine rules and correct any misinterpretations.
    - **Implement in SMILES**:
      - Update SMARTS patterns based on expert recommendations to accurately represent the chemical functionalities.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Combine Rules with Limited Coverage to Enhance Robustness**  
  Several rules have limited supporting data (e.g., Rule 4 on simple aliphatic carboxylic acids, Rule 12 on thiol groups, Rule 14 on multiple hydroxyl groups, and Rule 15 on long aliphatic chains). To improve their reliability, consider merging these into broader, more general rules. For instance, create a single rule about aliphatic carboxylic acids that accounts for chain length and the presence or absence of additional functional groups, specifying how these factors collectively influence yield.

- **Advice 2**: **Clarify and Refine Rules with Ambiguities**  
  Some rules could benefit from clearer definitions and boundaries. For example, in **Rule 5** regarding ether linkages, specify the effect of the number and position of ether groups on the yield. Instead of stating "ether linkages tend to give a low yield," define whether all ethers have this effect or only certain types (e.g., polyether chains versus simple ethers). Providing additional examples and counter-examples can help clarify these nuances.

- **Advice 3**: **Expand Dataset for Underrepresented Rules**  
  Rules like **Rule 12** (thiol groups) and **Rule 14** (multiple hydroxyl groups) are currently supported by only one example. To strengthen these rules, gather more experimental data or literature examples that either support or contradict the existing observations. A larger dataset will improve statistical confidence and help determine if these are consistent trends or isolated cases.

- **Advice 4**: **Incorporate Position Effects into Existing Rules**  
  For rules involving functional groups, explicitly state how the position of these groups relative to the carboxylic acid affects yield. For instance, modify **Rule 1** and **Rule 6** to create a comprehensive rule that explains how amino or hydroxyl groups' proximity to the carboxylic acid influences coordination with metal centers and, consequently, the yield.

- **Advice 5**: **Address Exceptions and Outliers in Rules**  
  Some rules have notable exceptions that should be acknowledged and explained. For example, in **Rule 11**, although heterocyclic aromatic rings with nitrogen atoms generally lead to high yields, **Entry 11** is a counter-example possibly due to steric hindrance. Refine the rule to include steric effects or create sub-rules that account for such anomalies.

- **Advice 6**: **Specify Parameters for Terms like "Long" and "Close Proximity"**  
  Vague terms can lead to confusion. Replace terms like "long aliphatic chains" and "close proximity" with specific criteria (e.g., "chains with more than six carbons" or "functional groups within three bonds of the carboxylic acid"). This precision will make the rules more actionable and easier to apply consistently.

- **Advice 7**: **Unify Overlapping Rules to Reduce Redundancy**  
  Identify and merge rules that cover similar chemical features to streamline the rule set. For example, **Rule 1** (amino groups in α or β positions) and **Rule 7** (aromatic amino groups) both discuss amino groups enhancing yield. Consider creating a unified rule about amino groups enhancing metal coordination, specifying how their position and the molecular context affect the outcome.

- **Advice 8**: **Introduce Quantitative Criteria Where Possible**  
  Incorporate quantitative thresholds into the rules to enhance specificity. For instance, in **Rule 8** about electron-donating substituents, quantify the electronic effects using Hammett constants or other relevant parameters. This approach allows for a more nuanced prediction of yield based on the strength of electron-donating or withdrawing effects.

- **Advice 9**: **Reevaluate Rules with Single Data Points**  
  Rules supported by only one data point (e.g., **Rule 12** on thiol groups, **Rule 15** on chain length) should be treated cautiously. Unless further data can be obtained, consider combining these observations into broader rules or noting them as preliminary findings that require additional validation.

- **Advice 10**: **Include Steric Factors in Rules Involving Aromatic Rings**  
  For rules concerning aromatic rings (e.g., **Rule 2**, **Rule 11**), consider adding information about steric hindrance from substituents that may impact metal coordination and yield. Specify how ortho-substitution or bulky groups adjacent to key functional groups might hinder effective interaction with the metal center.

- **Advice 11**: **Prioritize Rules Based on Data Support and Relevance**  
  Focus on refining and prioritizing rules that have strong supporting evidence and a significant impact on yield prediction. Clearly distinguish between well-supported rules and those that are tentative. This prioritization will aid in applying the most reliable rules first during modifier selection or catalyst design.

- **Advice 12**: **Enhance Rules with Additional Examples and Counter-Examples**  
  Strengthen each rule by providing more supporting data. Actively seek out or generate additional examples that either reinforce the rule or highlight its limitations. This practice will improve the robustness of the rules and increase confidence in their predictive power.

- **Advice 13**: **Integrate Electronic and Steric Parameters into Rules**  
  Consider incorporating concepts like ligand field strength, coordination numbers, and steric hindrance into the rules. By integrating these chemical principles, the rules can provide deeper insights into the observed yields and help in designing modifiers with optimal properties.

- **Advice 14**: **Develop Computational Models to Supplement Rules**  
  Use computational chemistry tools to model the interactions between modifiers and metal centers. This approach can validate the proposed rules, reveal underlying mechanisms, and predict the behavior of modifiers not yet tested experimentally.

- **Advice 15**: **Regularly Review and Update Rules with New Data**  
  Establish a process for continuously updating the rules as new data become available. This iterative approach ensures that the rule set remains current and evolves to reflect the latest findings, thereby improving its utility and accuracy over time.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and specifies that α-amino acids with polar or acidic side chains give high yield. It has strong property insight, emphasizing enhanced metal coordination. The rule considers combinations of substructures (α-amino acid backbone with specific side chains) and is supported by multiple data points (Entries 0 and 2 as examples, Entry 12 as a counter-example), satisfying the criteria.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 states that benzoic acid derivatives with electron-withdrawing groups at the para-position give high yield. While the rule is clear and offers property insight, it lacks coverage and has contradictions. For instance, **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Entry 4) has an electron-donating group but yields a high yield, which contradicts the rule. This indicates the rule needs refinement to account for such exceptions.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 suggests that electron-donating groups at the para-position lead to low yield. Although the rule is clear, it fails to account for exceptions like **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Entry 4) which has an electron-donating group yet gives a high yield. The property insight is reasonable, but the coverage is insufficient, and the rule requires modification to address these inconsistencies.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear, stating that modifiers with both a carboxylic acid group and an aldehyde group on the aromatic ring lead to low yield. It has solid property insight regarding potential side reactions or inhibition of catalyst activity. The rule is supported by multiple data points (Entries 18 and 19) and satisfies the criteria.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 claims that aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of C6-C8 give high yield. While the rule is clear and provides property insight, it lacks sufficient coverage with only one supporting example (**octanoic acid**, Entry 5) and limited consideration of counter-examples. The rule requires more data points to be convincing.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear and focuses on heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen atoms adjacent to a carboxylic acid group, leading to high yield. The property insight is strong, explaining enhanced coordination. The rule considers specific structural combinations and is supported by data points (Entries 15 and 21), meeting the criteria.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 indicates that ether linkages in the aliphatic chain result in low yield. The rule is clear with acceptable property insight about the effect of ethers on coordination and solubility. It has examples supporting it (Entries 10 and 32) but could benefit from additional data points for stronger coverage.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 states that thiol groups proximal to the carboxylic acid lead to high yield. Although the rule is clear and offers good property insight, it is supported by only one data point (**3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**, Entry 17), which is insufficient coverage according to the criteria.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 posits that multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid group result in high yield. The rule is clear with solid property insight about chelation. However, it has only one supporting example (**Entry 9**), lacking sufficient coverage.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 suggests that perfluorinated carboxylic acids give low yield due to destabilization of metal centers. The rule is clear and provides property insight, but it is based on a single data point (**Entry 13**) and lacks broader coverage.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 states that modifiers containing amide or peptide bonds tend to give a low yield. The rule is clear, with strong property insight regarding resonance delocalization of lone pairs. It considers combinations of substructures and is supported by multiple data points (Entries 23 and 33), meeting the criteria.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 indicates that long aliphatic chains with distant functional groups lead to low yield. The rule is clear and provides adequate property insight. It is supported by several data points (Entries 31 and 34), satisfying the criteria.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 claims that ketone groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid on an aromatic system yield high yield. While the rule is clear and offers property insight, it is supported by only one example (**Entry 16**), lacking sufficient coverage.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 mentions that bulky hydrophobic side chains on α-amino acids tend to give low yield unless they contain coordinating heteroatoms. The rule is clear, with good property insight. It considers structural combinations and is supported by examples (Entries 12 and 14), satisfying the criteria.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 suggests that flexible aliphatic linkers connecting aromatic systems to the carboxylic acid group tend to give low yield if they reduce effective coordination. The rule is complex and could benefit from improved clarity. It requires more data points and refinement to fully meet the criteria.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Enhance Rule Coverage for Limited Data Points**  
  For rules with insufficient coverage (only one supporting example), such as Rule 4, Rule 7, Rule 9, Rule 12, Rule 14, and Rule 15, revisit the dataset to identify additional supporting examples or counter-examples. If the dataset lacks sufficient data, consider merging these rules with similar ones to form broader rules with better coverage. This will strengthen their validity and applicability.

- **Advice 2**: **Address Contradictions in Rules with Exceptions**  
  Reevaluate Rule 2 and Rule 3 to account for exceptions like **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Entry 4), which contains an electron-donating group but results in a high yield, contradicting Rule 3. Modify these rules to specify conditions or additional structural factors (e.g., the presence of an amino group that can coordinate with metal centers) that influence the outcome, ensuring the rules accurately reflect the data.

- **Advice 3**: **Combine Similar Rules to Increase Robustness**  
  Merge rules that address related structural features and outcomes to improve their coverage and strength. For example, combine Rule 4 (aldehyde groups leading to low yield) with Rule 13 (ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acid on an aromatic system leading to high yield) into a comprehensive rule about carbonyl groups' effects on yield, specifying how different positions and contexts (aromatic vs. aliphatic) influence reactivity.

- **Advice 4**: **Refine Rules with Broad Structural Definitions**  
  For rules with vague terms like "moderate chain lengths" in Rule 5, provide precise definitions (e.g., specify carbon chain lengths C6-C8) and include additional examples or counter-examples to clarify the rule's applicability. This will enhance clarity and make the rules more actionable.

- **Advice 5**: **Expand Rules with Limited Functional Group Representation**  
  For rules focusing on specific functional groups with limited examples (e.g., Rule 8 on thiol groups and Rule 9 on multiple hydroxyl groups), consider expanding them into a broader rule about functional groups capable of chelation (e.g., hydroxyl, thiol, amino groups adjacent to carboxylic acids) and gather more examples from the dataset to support this combined rule.

- **Advice 6**: **Provide Additional Examples for Underrepresented Rules**  
  Actively search for more data points within the dataset to support underrepresented rules, such as Rule 7 (ether linkages leading to low yield) and Rule 12 (long aliphatic chains with distant functional groups leading to low yield). More examples will solidify these rules and increase their reliability.

- **Advice 7**: **Eliminate or Revise Weak Rules**  
  If certain rules cannot be adequately supported due to insufficient data (e.g., Rule 14 on bulky hydrophobic side chains and Rule 15 on flexible aliphatic linkers), consider removing them or revising them to fit within more comprehensive rules. This will streamline the rule set and focus on the most impactful structural features.

- **Advice 8**: **Clarify Structural Contexts for Specific Rules**  
  For rules where structural context significantly affects the outcome (e.g., Rule 7 and Rule 15), provide detailed explanations of how specific structural features (like linker length or flexibility) influence the yield. Include examples that illustrate these nuances to improve the rule's clarity and usefulness.

- **Advice 9**: **Ensure Consistency Between Rules and Data**  
  Review all rules to confirm that they are consistently supported by the data. Resolve any discrepancies where exceptions occur by either refining the rule or noting the exceptions explicitly. This will enhance the credibility of the rules and prevent confusion.

- **Advice 10**: **Enhance Physical-Chemical Insights in Rules**  
  Strengthen the rationale in each rule by providing deeper physical-chemical insights. Explain not just the observed correlation but also the underlying reasons, such as electronic effects, steric hindrance, or specific coordination abilities, to make the rules more informative and scientifically grounded.

- **Advice 11**: **Optimize Rule Formatting for Clarity**  
  Present all rules in a consistent and clear format, specifying the structural criteria precisely and unambiguously. Use standardized chemical nomenclature and, where helpful, include structural diagrams or SMILES strings to aid comprehension and practical application.

- **Advice 12**: **Update Rules Based on Feedback and New Data**  
  Continuously refine the rules by incorporating feedback from discussions and any new data that becomes available. Be open to modifying or replacing rules as more information is gathered, ensuring that the rule set remains current and effective in guiding catalyst optimization.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains capable of additional metal coordination (carboxylate, hydroxyl, or thioether groups)** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Side chains with additional coordination sites enhance metal-ligand interactions, stabilizing the catalyst and improving reactivity.

   - **Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Entry 0) – High Yield (Glutamic acid; extra carboxylate)
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Entry 2) – High Yield (Aspartic acid; extra carboxylate)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Entry 14) – High Yield (Tryptophan; indole nitrogen)

   - **Counter-Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Entry 12) – Low Yield (Phenylalanine; non-coordinating side chain)
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 33) – Low Yield (Modified lysine; amide reduces coordination ability)

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **benzoic acid derivatives with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, haloalkyl) at the para-position** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group and enhance the ability of the aromatic ring to coordinate with metal centers.

   - **Examples**:
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Entry 1) – High Yield
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Entry 20) – High Yield

   - **Counter-Example**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 22) – Low Yield (Methyl group is electron-donating)

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **benzoic acid derivatives with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxyl) at the para-position** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing its coordination ability with metal centers.

   - **Examples**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 22) – Low Yield
     - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Entry 7) – High Yield (Exception due to aliphatic linker increasing flexibility)
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30) – Low Yield

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers containing an **aldehyde group ortho or para to the carboxylic acid on an aromatic ring** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Aldehyde groups can act as competing ligands or deactivate catalysts through side reactions.

   - **Examples**:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19) – Low Yield
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 18) – Low Yield

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium chain lengths (C5-C8) and no additional functional groups** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Optimal chain length balances hydrophobic interactions and solubility, facilitating effective catalyst-modifier interaction.

   - **Example**:
     - **Octanoic acid** (Entry 5) – High Yield

   - **Counter-Examples**:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Entry 29) – Low Yield (Hydroxyl group may interfere with coordination)

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing **heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen atoms adjacent to the carboxylic acid group** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles can serve as additional coordination sites, enhancing binding to metal centers.

   - **Examples**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Entry 21) – High Yield
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 15) – High Yield

   - **Counter-Example**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 11) – Low Yield (Pyridyl group at para-position may not effectively coordinate due to steric hindrance)

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers with **multiple ether linkages in the aliphatic chain** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Ether oxygens may not coordinate effectively and increase solubility in the solvent, reducing interaction with the catalyst.

   - **Examples**:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 10) – Low Yield
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32) – Low Yield

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **thiol or thioether groups proximal to the carboxylic acid group** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Sulfur atoms can form strong coordination bonds with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

   - **Examples**:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 17) – High Yield
     - **(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoic acid** (Derived from Entry 23 without amide linkage) – Would predict High Yield if not for amide bond in actual compound

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups (polyols) near the carboxylic acid group** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can chelate metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity.

   - **Example**:
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Entry 9) – High Yield

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **perfluorinated carboxylic acids** tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Strong electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms decrease the electron density on the carboxylate, hindering effective coordination.

    - **Example**:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Entry 13) – Low Yield

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers containing **amide bonds adjacent to the carboxylic acid group** tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Amide nitrogens are less available for coordination due to resonance delocalization; amide linkage may also alter binding geometry unfavorably.

    - **Examples**:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 33) – Low Yield
      - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (Entry 23) – Low Yield

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **long aliphatic chains bearing amino or hydroxyl groups distant (>4 carbons) from the carboxylic acid group** tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Distant functional groups are less effective in chelating the metal center, and long chains may introduce steric hindrance.

    - **Examples**:
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Entry 31) – Low Yield
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Entry 34) – Low Yield

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers containing **ketone or keto-enol groups conjugated with the carboxylic acid on an aromatic system** tend to give a **high yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Conjugated ketones can delocalize electron density and participate in chelation, enhancing coordination.

    - **Examples**:
      - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Entry 16) – High Yield
      - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 8) – High Yield

    - **Counter-Example**:
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Entry 27) – Low Yield (Aliphatic ketone may not effectively coordinate)

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups ortho to the carboxyl group** tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Ortho-hydroxyl groups can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds, reducing availability for metal coordination.

    - **Example**:
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 18) – Low Yield
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Entry 26) – Low Yield (Hydroxyl may be involved in intramolecular interactions)

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers with **flexible aliphatic linkers connecting non-coordinating aromatic groups to the carboxylic acid** tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Flexible linkers may prevent proper alignment of coordinating groups, and non-coordinating aromatics may not contribute beneficially.

    - **Examples**:
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30) – Low Yield
      - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (Entry 25) – High Yield (Exception due to ketone group enhancing coordination)

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**
- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and specifies that α-amino acids with coordinating side chains (carboxylate, hydroxyl, or thioether groups) tend to give a high yield. The physical-chemical insight is strong, explaining how additional coordination sites enhance metal-ligand interactions. The rule combines sub-structures (amino acid backbone and side chains) and is supported by multiple examples and counter-examples, showing good coverage.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 clearly states that benzoic acid derivatives with electron-withdrawing groups at the para-position tend to give a high yield. The rationale aligns with increased acidity and coordination ability due to electron-withdrawing substituents. It combines structural elements and is supported by examples and a counter-example, demonstrating adequate coverage.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 effectively indicates that electron-donating groups on benzoic acid derivatives lead to a low yield. The rationale is sound, correlating decreased acidity with reduced coordination. While there is an exception (Entry 7), the rule generally holds true and is supported by examples, showing balanced complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear in stating that modifiers with aldehyde groups ortho or para to the carboxylic acid result in a low yield. The rationale involving potential side reactions is reasonable. The rule is straightforward and supported by two examples, meeting the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 suggests that medium-chain aliphatic acids without additional functional groups tend to give a high yield. The rationale about balancing hydrophobic interactions and solubility is plausible. It combines chain length and absence of functional groups, but the coverage could be improved by including more data points or addressing counter-examples like Entry 29.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 clearly identifies that heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with adjacent nitrogen atoms lead to a high yield. The physical-chemical insight about additional coordination sites is strong. The rule is complex, involving heterocycles and coordinating atoms, and is well-supported by examples and a counter-example, demonstrating good coverage.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 states that modifiers with multiple ether linkages result in a low yield. The rationale regarding ineffective coordination and increased solubility is acceptable. The rule is clear but has limited coverage with only two examples. Including more data points would strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 indicates that modifiers with thiol or thioether groups near the carboxylic acid give a high yield. The rationale about strong sulfur-metal coordination is solid. However, the rule relies on limited data, with only one strong example (Entry 17). Coverage would benefit from additional supporting examples.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 highlights that modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxylic acid tend to give a high yield. The chelation rationale is sound. However, the rule is based on a single example (Entry 9), limiting its coverage. More data points are needed to reinforce the rule.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 posits that perfluorinated carboxylic acids lead to a low yield due to reduced coordination ability. While the rationale is logical, the rule is supported by only one example (Entry 13), limiting its coverage. Additional data would enhance its validity.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 observes that modifiers with amide bonds adjacent to the carboxylic acid result in a low yield. The rationale involving reduced coordination due to resonance is appropriate. The rule is supported by two examples, meeting the coverage criterion, and balances complexity and insight effectively.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 states that long-chain aliphatic acids with distant amino or hydroxyl groups tend to give a low yield. The rationale about ineffective chelation and steric hindrance is plausible. The rule is clear, combines structural elements, and is supported by multiple examples, demonstrating strong coverage.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 suggests that modifiers with conjugated ketone groups on aromatic systems lead to a high yield. While the rationale about enhanced coordination is reasonable, the rule has limited coverage with few examples and a counter-example (Entry 27). Refinement and additional data could strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 specifies that ortho-hydroxyl groups on aromatic carboxylic acids lead to a low yield due to intramolecular hydrogen bonding. The rationale is sound, but the rule is supported by limited data. Including more examples would improve coverage and confidence in the rule.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 notes that flexible aliphatic linkers connecting non-coordinating aromatics to carboxylic acids tend to give a low yield. The rationale regarding misalignment and ineffectiveness is plausible. However, the rule has limited supporting data and exceptions (e.g., Entry 25). Refinement and additional examples are needed for stronger support.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains capable of additional metal coordination (carboxylate, hydroxyl, or thioether groups)** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Side chains with additional coordination sites enhance metal-ligand interactions, stabilizing the catalyst and improving reactivity.

   - **Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Entry 0) – High Yield (Glutamic acid; extra carboxylate)
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Entry 2) – High Yield (Aspartic acid; extra carboxylate)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Entry 14) – High Yield (Tryptophan; indole nitrogen)

   - **Counter-Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Entry 12) – Low Yield (Phenylalanine; non-coordinating side chain)
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 33) – Low Yield (Modified lysine; amide reduces coordination ability)

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **benzoic acid derivatives with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, haloalkyl) at the para-position** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group and enhance the ability of the aromatic ring to coordinate with metal centers.

   - **Examples**:
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Entry 1) – High Yield
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Entry 20) – High Yield

   - **Counter-Example**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 22) – Low Yield (Methyl group is electron-donating)

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **benzoic acid derivatives with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxyl) at the para-position** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing its coordination ability with metal centers.

   - **Examples**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 22) – Low Yield
     - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Entry 7) – High Yield (Exception due to aliphatic linker increasing flexibility)
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30) – Low Yield

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers containing an **aldehyde group ortho or para to the carboxylic acid on an aromatic ring** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Aldehyde groups can act as competing ligands or deactivate catalysts through side reactions.

   - **Examples**:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19) – Low Yield
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 18) – Low Yield

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium chain lengths (C5-C8) and no additional functional groups** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Optimal chain length balances hydrophobic interactions and solubility, facilitating effective catalyst-modifier interaction.

   - **Example**:
     - **Octanoic acid** (Entry 5) – High Yield

   - **Counter-Examples**:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Entry 29) – Low Yield (Hydroxyl group may interfere with coordination)

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing **heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen atoms adjacent to the carboxylic acid group** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles can serve as additional coordination sites, enhancing binding to metal centers.

   - **Examples**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Entry 21) – High Yield
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 15) – High Yield

   - **Counter-Example**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 11) – Low Yield (Pyridyl group at para-position may not effectively coordinate due to steric hindrance)

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers with **multiple ether linkages in the aliphatic chain** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Ether oxygens may not coordinate effectively and increase solubility in the solvent, reducing interaction with the catalyst.

   - **Examples**:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 10) – Low Yield
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32) – Low Yield

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **thiol or thioether groups proximal to the carboxylic acid group** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Sulfur atoms can form strong coordination bonds with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

   - **Examples**:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 17) – High Yield
     - **(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoic acid** (Derived from Entry 23 without amide linkage) – Would predict High Yield if not for amide bond in actual compound

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups (polyols) near the carboxylic acid group** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups can chelate metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity.

   - **Example**:
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Entry 9) – High Yield

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **perfluorinated carboxylic acids** tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Strong electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms decrease the electron density on the carboxylate, hindering effective coordination.

    - **Example**:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Entry 13) – Low Yield

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers containing **amide bonds adjacent to the carboxylic acid group** tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Amide nitrogens are less available for coordination due to resonance delocalization; amide linkage may also alter binding geometry unfavorably.

    - **Examples**:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 33) – Low Yield
      - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (Entry 23) – Low Yield

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **long aliphatic chains bearing amino or hydroxyl groups distant (>4 carbons) from the carboxylic acid group** tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Distant functional groups are less effective in chelating the metal center, and long chains may introduce steric hindrance.

    - **Examples**:
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Entry 31) – Low Yield
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Entry 34) – Low Yield

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers containing **ketone or keto-enol groups conjugated with the carboxylic acid on an aromatic system** tend to give a **high yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Conjugated ketones can delocalize electron density and participate in chelation, enhancing coordination.

    - **Examples**:
      - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Entry 16) – High Yield
      - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 8) – High Yield

    - **Counter-Example**:
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Entry 27) – Low Yield (Aliphatic ketone may not effectively coordinate)

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups ortho to the carboxyl group** tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Ortho-hydroxyl groups can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds, reducing availability for metal coordination.

    - **Example**:
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 18) – Low Yield
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Entry 26) – Low Yield (Hydroxyl may be involved in intramolecular interactions)

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers with **flexible aliphatic linkers connecting non-coordinating aromatic groups to the carboxylic acid** tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Flexible linkers may prevent proper alignment of coordinating groups, and non-coordinating aromatics may not contribute beneficially.

    - **Examples**:
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30) – Low Yield
      - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (Entry 25) – High Yield (Exception due to ketone group enhancing coordination)

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- **Suggestion 1**: **Rule 1 Implementation** – In the current code for Rule 1, the pattern for side chain functional groups (`'compiled_side_patterns'`) is not specifically connected to the side chain of the alpha-amino acid. As a result, the code may match these functional groups anywhere in the molecule, leading to false positives or negatives. To improve accuracy, modify the SMARTS patterns to ensure that the side chain functional groups are attached directly to the alpha-carbon of the amino acid backbone. For example, adjust the patterns to include the connection from the alpha-carbon to the side chain functional groups:

  ```python
  # Modified side chain patterns connected to alpha-carbon
  side_chain_patterns = [
      '[NX3H2][CX4H]([#6])[CX3](=O)[OX1-,OX2H1]-[*]-[CX3](=O)[OX1-,OX2H1]',  # Side chain carboxylic acid
      '[NX3H2][CX4H]([#6])[CX3](=O)[OX1-,OX2H1]-[*]-[OX2H]',  # Side chain hydroxyl group
      '[NX3H2][CX4H]([#6])[CX3](=O)[OX1-,OX2H1]-[*]-[SX2][#6]'  # Side chain thioether group
  ]
  ```

- **Suggestion 2**: **Rule 2 Pattern Expansion** – The SMARTS pattern for Rule 2 currently only includes specific electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para-position (e.g., nitro, haloalkyl). To make this rule more comprehensive, expand the list of EWGs to include other common groups like cyano (`-C≡N`), trifluoromethyl (`-CF₃`), or sulfonyl groups. Adjust the pattern to include a broader range of EWGs:

  ```python
  # Expanded EWG pattern for Rule 2
  ewg = ['[N+](=O)[O-]', '[F,Cl,Br,I]', '[CX3](=O)[OX1-,OX2H1]', '[C](F)(F)F', '[CX2]#N', '[SX4](=O)(=O)[#6]']
  # Adjusted SMARTS pattern
  '[c]1cc([CX3](=O)[OX1-,OX2H1])cc([$(N(=O)=O),$(F),$(Cl),$(Br),$(I),$(C(F)(F)F),$(C#N),$(S(=O)(=O)[#6])])c1'
  ```

- **Suggestion 3**: **Rule 3 Pattern Specificity** – Similar to Rule 2, the SMARTS pattern for Rule 3 should ensure that electron-donating groups (EDGs) are precisely identified at the para-position. Currently, the pattern may not capture all possible EDGs like amino (`-NH₂`) or alkoxy groups. Update the pattern to include a broader range of EDGs:

  ```python
  # Expanded EDG pattern for Rule 3
  edg = ['[OX2H]', '[OX2][#6]', '[CH3]', '[NX3H2]']
  # Adjusted SMARTS pattern
  '[c]1cc([CX3](=O)[OX1-,OX2H1])cc([OX2H,$(OC),$(CH3),$(NH2)])c1'
  ```

- **Suggestion 4**: **Rule 5 Chain Length Flexibility** – The SMARTS pattern for Rule 5 specifies an exact chain length (C5). However, the rule is intended for medium chain lengths (C5–C8). Modify the pattern to match aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths from 5 to 8 carbons:

  ```python
  # Modified pattern to include chains from C5 to C8
  '[CX3](=O)[OX1-,OX2H1][CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H2,CX4H3,CX4H2][CX4H3,CX4H2]'
  ```

- **Suggestion 5**: **Rule 7 Specificity for Multiple Ethers** – The current pattern for Rule 7 may not accurately detect multiple ether linkages in longer chains or in different positions. Refine the pattern to identify molecules with two or more ether linkages in the aliphatic chain, regardless of their exact position:

  ```python
  # General pattern for multiple ethers in aliphatic chains
  '[#6]-[OX2]-[#6]-[OX2]-[#6]'
  ```

- **Suggestion 6**: **Rule 8 Proximity Clarification** – In Rule 8, the code should ensure that the thiol or thioether groups are proximal (adjacent) to the carboxylic acid group. The current patterns may not enforce this proximity strictly. Adjust the SMARTS patterns to specify that these groups are directly connected to the carbon adjacent to the carboxylic acid:

  ```python
  # Modified patterns for proximity
  '[CX3](=O)[OX1-,OX2H1][CX4H]([SX2H])[#6]'  # Thiol adjacent to alpha-carbon
  '[CX3](=O)[OX1-,OX2H1][CX4H]([SX2][#6])[#6]'  # Thioether adjacent to alpha-carbon
  ```

- **Suggestion 7**: **Rule 11 Amide Bond Recognition** – The pattern for Rule 11 may not capture all instances where amide bonds are adjacent to the carboxylic acid group, especially in cyclic structures or when the amide is part of a peptide bond. Expand the pattern to include these cases:

  ```python
  # Enhanced amide pattern adjacent to carboxylic acid
  '[CX3](=O)[NX3][CX3](=O)[OX1-,OX2H1]'  # Including both linear and cyclic structures
  ```

- **Suggestion 8**: **General Pattern Verification** – Verify that all SMARTS patterns are correctly formatted and do not contain syntax errors that could prevent them from matching as intended. Use RDKit's `Chem.MolFromSmarts` and test each pattern individually to ensure they are valid.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Substructure Match Overlaps** – In the current implementation, substructure matches may overlap or be counted multiple times. Ensure that when applying patterns, the code accounts for unique matches and does not double-count functional groups.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Hydrogen Atom Specification** – Be cautious with hydrogen atom specifications in SMARTS patterns (e.g., `[H1]`, `[H2]`). These can be affected by the hydrogen suppression in the molecular representation. Use explicit hydrogens or consider using `Chem.AddHs` to ensure accurate matching.

- **Suggestion 11**: **Stereochemistry Considerations** – The current SMARTS patterns may not account for stereochemistry, which could be important for certain rules (e.g., Rule 1 with alpha-amino acids). If stereochemistry is relevant, include it in the patterns or preprocess the molecules to standardize stereochemistry.

- **Suggestion 12**: **Testing Against Known Examples** – For each rule, test the SMARTS patterns against the known examples and counter-examples provided in the rules. Ensure that the patterns match the examples they are supposed to and do not match the counter-examples.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Quantify Functional Groups and Create Numerical Features**

  Develop a systematic method to quantify functional groups present in the modifiers directly from their SMILES representations. For each modifier, calculate numerical counts of specific functional groups such as carboxylic acids, amines, hydroxyls, thiols, ethers, and halogens. This quantification allows the creation of a feature matrix that can be used for statistical analysis or machine learning models to predict yields.

  - *Implementation*: Use cheminformatics tools (e.g., RDKit) to parse SMILES strings and identify functional groups through substructure searches or SMARTS patterns.
  - *Example*: Instead of stating “Modifiers that are α-amino acids with side chains capable of additional metal coordination tend to give a high yield,” specify the exact counts:
    - **Number of carboxylate groups**
    - **Number of coordinating heteroatoms (O, N, S)**
    - **Position of functional groups relative to the carboxyl group**

- **Advice 2**: **Include Electronic and Steric Descriptors**

  Calculate electronic descriptors (e.g., Hammett sigma constants, partial charges) and steric descriptors (e.g., molar volume, topological polar surface area) for substituents on aromatic rings or aliphatic chains. Incorporate these descriptors into the rules to quantify electron-donating or electron-withdrawing effects and steric hindrance.

  - *Implementation*: Assign numerical values to substituents based on known electronic parameters. Use molecular modeling to estimate partial charges.
  - *Example*: Modify Rule 2 and Rule 3 to include sigma constants:
    - “Modifiers with a para-substituent having a Hammett sigma value > +0.3 tend to give a high yield.”
    - “Modifiers with a para-substituent having a Hammett sigma value < –0.1 tend to give a low yield.”

- **Advice 3**: **Standardize Chain Length Measurements**

  For aliphatic chains, explicitly define chain length as a numerical feature and assess how it correlates with yield. Identify the optimal chain length range for high yield and incorporate this into the rules.

  - *Implementation*: Extract chain length directly from the SMILES by counting carbon atoms in the longest continuous chain.
  - *Example*: Revise Rule 5:
    - “Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a chain length between C5 and C8 (inclusive) tend to give a high yield.”

- **Advice 4**: **Utilize Structural Alerts and Substructure Matching**

  Implement specific SMARTS patterns to identify substructures that positively or negatively impact the yield. Create binary features indicating the presence or absence of these substructures.

  - *Implementation*: Use SMARTS strings to search for features like ortho-hydroxybenzoic acids, pyridine rings adjacent to carboxyl groups, or thiol groups near carboxyl groups.
  - *Example*: For Rule 6:
    - “Modifiers containing a pyridine ring with the nitrogen atom at position 3 relative to the carboxyl group (identified by SMARTS pattern ‘n1ccccc1C(=O)O’) tend to give a high yield.”

- **Advice 5**: **Consolidate and Generalize Rules**

  Combine rules with overlapping concepts to reduce complexity and redundancy. Generalize rules where possible to cover broader categories, making them easier to apply and translate into features.

  - *Implementation*: Identify common themes among rules, such as coordination ability or electronic effects, and create umbrella rules.
  - *Example*: Merge Rules 2, 3, and 10 into a generalized electronic effect rule:
    - “Modifiers with strongly electron-withdrawing substituents adjacent to the carboxyl group tend to give a high yield, while those with electron-donating substituents tend to give a low yield.”

- **Advice 6**: **Incorporate Distance Metrics for Functional Groups**

  Define numerical features based on the distance between functional groups and key sites (e.g., carboxylic acid group). This includes the number of atoms separating functional groups, which may influence coordination ability.

  - *Implementation*: Calculate distances within the molecular graph derived from the SMILES.
  - *Example*: Modify Rule 12:
    - “Modifiers with amino or hydroxyl groups located more than four atoms away from the carboxylic acid group tend to give a low yield.”

- **Advice 7**: **Calculate and Use Molecular Descriptors**

  Utilize molecular descriptors such as molecular weight, logP (octanol-water partition coefficient), hydrogen bond donor/acceptor counts, and rotatable bond counts. These descriptors can capture properties affecting solubility, permeability, and flexibility.

  - *Implementation*: Use cheminformatics software to compute descriptors for each modifier.
  - *Example*: Identify thresholds for descriptors that correlate with high yield:
    - “Modifiers with logP values between X and Y tend to give a high yield.”

- **Advice 8**: **Develop a Numerical Scoring System**

  Create a scoring system where modifiers are assigned points based on the presence of beneficial features (e.g., coordination sites, optimal chain length) and penalties for detrimental features (e.g., electron-donating substituents, steric hindrance). Sum the scores to predict the likelihood of achieving a high yield.

  - *Implementation*: Assign weightings to each feature based on its observed impact on yield.
  - *Example*: A modifier receives:
    - +2 points for each additional coordination site near the carboxyl group
    - –1 point for each electron-donating group adjacent to the carboxyl group
    - Predict high yield if total score ≥ threshold value

- **Advice 9**: **Rephrase Rules for Clarity and Actionability**

  Simplify the language of the rules to make them more precise and actionable. Use clear structural descriptors that can be directly searched in molecular structures.

  - *Implementation*: Replace ambiguous terms with explicit structural definitions.
  - *Example*: Change Rule 14:
    - From: “Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups ortho to the carboxyl group tend to give a low yield.”
    - To: “Modifiers where a phenolic hydroxyl group is directly bonded to the same benzene ring and adjacent to the carboxyl group tend to give a low yield.”

- **Advice 10**: **Leverage Machine Learning for Rule Refinement**

  Use the existing dataset to train machine learning models that can identify patterns and correlations not immediately apparent. Feature importance from models like random forests can highlight which molecular features are most predictive of yield.

  - *Implementation*: Prepare a numerical feature matrix based on the above advice and split the data into training and testing sets.
  - *Example*: Use the model to validate and potentially adjust the weightings in the numerical scoring system from Advice 8.

- **Advice 11**: **Add Exceptions and Limitations to Rules**

  Explicitly state any known exceptions to the rules and define the conditions under which a rule applies. This helps prevent misclassification and improves the reliability of predictions.

  - *Implementation*: Review the dataset for outliers or exceptions and incorporate them into the rules.
  - *Example*: In Rule 15, note the exception:
    - “Modifiers with flexible aliphatic linkers connecting non-coordinating aromatic groups to the carboxylic acid tend to give a low yield, *unless* an additional coordinating group like a ketone is present to enhance coordination (as in Entry 25).”

- **Advice 12**: **Standardize Nomenclature and Structural Representations**

  Ensure consistent representation of molecular structures, functional groups, and substituent positions to avoid confusion and facilitate automated processing.

  - *Implementation*: Adopt IUPAC nomenclature where possible and specify positions using numbering systems.
  - *Example*: Instead of “Modifiers containing aldehyde groups ortho or para to the carboxylic acid,” specify:
    - “Modifiers where an aldehyde group is attached to the benzene ring at the position immediately adjacent (ortho) or opposite (para) to the carboxyl group.”

- **Advice 13**: **Include 3D Structural Considerations**

  For features where spatial orientation matters (e.g., steric hindrance due to bulky groups), consider generating 3D conformations of the modifiers and calculating descriptors like steric energy or molecular volume.

  - *Implementation*: Use molecular modeling software to generate conformations and compute 3D descriptors.
  - *Example*: Account for the effect of ortho-substituents causing steric hindrance that might block coordination sites.

- **Advice 14**: **Automate Feature Extraction and Rule Application**

  Develop scripts or software tools that can automatically extract features from SMILES and apply the refined rules to predict yields. This increases efficiency and reduces the potential for human error.

  - *Implementation*: Integrate cheminformatics libraries (e.g., RDKit) into a workflow for feature extraction and rule evaluation.
  - *Example*: Create a pipeline that reads SMILES strings, computes features per the advised rules, and outputs predicted yield categories.

- **Advice 15**: **Validate and Iterate on the Rules**

  Continuously test the refined rules against experimental data, and update them based on new findings. Incorporate feedback loops to improve predictive accuracy over time.

  - *Implementation*: Use cross-validation techniques and periodically reassess the rules as more data becomes available.
  - *Example*: If certain modifiers consistently defy predictions, investigate and adjust rules or descriptors accordingly.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains containing additional coordinating functional groups (e.g., carboxylate, hydroxyl, or heteroatom-containing rings)** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Side chains with additional coordination sites enhance metal-ligand interactions, stabilizing the catalyst and improving reactivity.
   
   - **Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Entry 0) – High Yield (Glutamic acid; extra carboxylate)
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Entry 2) – High Yield (Aspartic acid; extra carboxylate)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Entry 14) – High Yield (Tryptophan; indole nitrogen)

   - **Counter-Example**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Entry 12) – Low Yield (Phenylalanine; non-coordinating side chain)

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., nitro, halogens, keto groups) directly attached to the ring** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group and enhance coordination ability.
   
   - **Examples**:
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Entry 1) – High Yield
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Entry 20) – High Yield
     - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Entry 16) – High Yield
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 8) – High Yield

   - **Counter-Example**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 22) – Low Yield (Methyl group is electron-donating)

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxyl) directly attached to the ring** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing coordination ability.

   - **Examples**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 22) – Low Yield
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30) – Low Yield
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 18) – Low Yield (Hydroxyl in ortho position)
     - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Entry 26) – Low Yield

   - **Exception**:
     - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Entry 7) – High Yield (Exception possibly due to the aliphatic linker increasing flexibility)

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length chains (C5–C8) and no additional functional groups** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Optimal chain length allows effective interaction with the catalyst surface without steric hindrance.

   - **Example**:
     - **Octanoic acid** (Entry 5) – High Yield

   - **Counter-Examples**:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Entry 29) – Low Yield (Hydroxyl group may interfere with coordination)
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Entry 31) – Low Yield (Amino group may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorably interact)

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms adjacent to the carboxyl group in the ring** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms can serve as additional coordination sites, enhancing metal binding and catalyst performance.

   - **Examples**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Entry 21) – High Yield
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 15) – High Yield

   - **Counter-Example**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 11) – Low Yield (Pyridyl group at para-position may not effectively coordinate due to steric factors)

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing **functional groups capable of strong metal coordination (e.g., thiol, thioether, multiple adjacent hydroxyls) in proximity to the carboxylate group** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: These groups enhance coordination to the metal center, stabilizing the catalyst.

   - **Examples**:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 17) – High Yield (Thiol group)
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Entry 9) – High Yield (Multiple hydroxyl groups enabling chelation)

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers with **multiple ether linkages or flexible polar chains in the molecule** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Ether oxygens are poor coordinating ligands and increase solubility in the solvent, reducing catalyst interaction.

   - **Examples**:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 10) – Low Yield
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32) – Low Yield

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **amide bonds adjacent to the carboxylic acid group** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Amide groups can reduce coordination ability due to resonance stabilization and may alter binding geometry unfavorably.

   - **Examples**:
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 33) – Low Yield
     - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (Entry 23) – Low Yield

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., perfluorinated chains)** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Strong electron-withdrawing substituents decrease electron density on the carboxylate, hindering effective metal coordination.

   - **Example**:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Entry 13) – Low Yield

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing **aldehyde groups on an aromatic ring in positions that can interfere with coordination** tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Aldehyde groups can form competing interactions or deactivate catalysts through side reactions.

    - **Examples**:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19) – Low Yield
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 18) – Low Yield

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: Modify the code logic so that all patterns within a group must match simultaneously for the group to be considered a match. Currently, the code sets `group_match` to `True` if any pattern in the group matches, which leads to false positives. Ensure that `group_match` is only `True` when all patterns in the group are found in the molecule.

- **Suggestion 2**: Correct the implementation of `min_counts` to accurately enforce the minimum number of occurrences required for each group. The current code sums the total matches without ensuring that each pattern meets individual counts. Adjust the code to count matches for each pattern separately and verify that the counts meet the specified thresholds.

- **Suggestion 3**: For rules with multiple pattern groups (e.g., Rule 1), ensure that the code only considers the rule a match if **all** groups satisfy their respective matching criteria. If any group does not meet the criteria, the rule should not be applied to the molecule.

- **Suggestion 4**: Adjust the initialization of the `match` variable for each rule. Instead of starting with `match = True`, initialize it as `True` and set it to `False` if any required condition is not met. This prevents unintended defaults to `True` when patterns are not properly matched.

- **Suggestion 5**: Use combined SMARTS patterns for functional groups that need to be present together. For example, for an amino acid backbone, create a single SMARTS pattern that captures both the amino group and the carboxylic acid group in the correct relative positions. This reduces complexity and potential mismatches.

- **Suggestion 6**: Revise the SMARTS patterns to accurately represent the functional groups described in the natural language rules. Verify that patterns for electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups include all relevant substituents and are specific enough to avoid false matches.

- **Suggestion 7**: Update the code to ensure that `exclude_patterns` are correctly applied. If an `exclude_pattern` matches, the code should immediately set `match = False` for that rule, preventing the rule from being incorrectly applied.

- **Suggestion 8**: Include explicit checks that all necessary substructures are present in the molecule for a rule to apply. For instance, ensure that a carboxylic acid group is present when required and linked appropriately to other functional groups.

- **Suggestion 9**: Add detailed comments and documentation within the code to explain the logic and flow of pattern matching. This will make it easier to identify and fix logical errors and improve the maintainability of the code.

- **Suggestion 10**: After implementing the corrections, validate the feature matrix by manually checking a diverse set of SMILES against the rules. Compare the expected outcomes with the matrix values to ensure that the transformation accurately reflects the rules.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

After reviewing the current rule metrics and comparing them with the reference metrics from previous iterations, several observations can be made regarding the performance of the current rules.

---

**1. Support**

- **Trend**: The **train support** has increased significantly over iterations:
  - **First Iteration**: 0.0234
  - **Second Iteration**: 0.0571
  - **Current Iteration**: 0.2743
- **Interpretation**: An increase in support indicates that the rules now apply to a larger portion of the dataset. While higher support is generally positive, it must be balanced with confidence and lift to ensure the rules are meaningful and predictive.

---

**2. Confidence**

- **Trend**:
  - **First Iteration**: 0.5833
  - **Second Iteration**: 0.7146
  - **Current Iteration**: 0.5041
- **Comparison with Reference Metrics**:
  - **Previous Train Confidence**: 0.6352 and 0.5396
- **Interpretation**: The confidence initially increased but has now decreased below the levels seen in the reference metrics. A decline in confidence suggests that the rules are less accurate in predicting the desired outcome (high yield) when they apply.

---

**3. Lift**

- **Trend**:
  - **First Iteration**: 1.1649
  - **Second Iteration**: 1.4427
  - **Current Iteration**: 1.0173
- **Comparison with Reference Metrics**:
  - **Previous Train Lift**: 1.2048 and 1.0559
- **Interpretation**: Lift measures the effectiveness of a rule in predicting the outcome compared to random chance. A lift greater than 1 indicates a useful rule. The initial high lift values suggested strong predictive rules, but the current lift is barely above 1, indicating the rules' predictive power is now similar to random chance.

---

**4. Leverage**

- **Trend**:
  - **First Iteration**: 0.0090
  - **Second Iteration**: 0.0217
  - **Current Iteration**: -0.0034
- **Interpretation**: Leverage indicates the difference between the observed support and expected support if the items were independent. The negative leverage in the current iteration suggests a weaker association than expected by chance.

---

**5. Comparison of Trends**

- **Support Increase vs. Confidence & Lift Decrease**: As support increased, both confidence and lift decreased. This inverse relationship suggests that the rules have become more general, applying to more data points but losing specificity and predictive strength.
- **Previous vs. Current Metrics**: The previous rules had higher confidence and lift but lower support. The current rules have higher support but lower confidence and lift. This shift indicates a trade-off between the breadth of applicability and the accuracy of the predictions.

---

**Conclusion on Local Minimum and Iterations**

Given the diminishing confidence and lift values despite increased support, it appears we may have reached a local minimum in terms of rule performance. The current rules do not significantly improve predictive power over random chance, as indicated by the lift value approaching 1. Further iterations using the current approach may yield limited improvements, suggesting that alternative strategies should be considered.

---

**Suggestions for Improving the Current Rules**

To enhance the performance of the rules, focus should be placed on improving confidence and lift, even if it means sacrificing some support. Below are strategies to achieve this:

1. **Reevaluate Rule Specificity**

   - **Increase Specificity**: Refine rules to target more specific chemical features associated with high yields, even if they apply to fewer cases.
   - **Filter Out General Rules**: Remove or modify rules that are too general and contribute to lower confidence and lift.

2. **Prioritize High-Lift Rules**

   - **Select Rules with Lift > 1.2**: Focus on rules that significantly outperform random chance.
   - **Combine High-Lift Rules**: Integrate multiple high-lift rules to cover more data points while maintaining predictive strength.

3. **Analyze and Prune Ineffective Rules**

   - **Evaluate Each Rule Individually**: Determine the impact of each rule on overall metrics.
   - **Remove Low-Performance Rules**: Eliminate rules that consistently show low confidence and lift or negatively impact leverage.

4. **Incorporate Additional Features**

   - **Use More Descriptors**: Consider additional chemical descriptors or molecular properties that may better capture the factors influencing yield.
   - **Employ Feature Selection Techniques**: Use statistical methods to identify the most predictive features.

5. **Adjust Rule Generation Parameters**

   - **Modify Support and Confidence Thresholds**: Set higher thresholds to prioritize rules with stronger associations.
   - **Experiment with Different Algorithms**: Try alternative rule-mining algorithms that might capture non-linear relationships.

6. **Test and Validate**

   - **Use Cross-Validation**: Ensure the rules generalize well to unseen data by evaluating them on separate validation sets.
   - **Monitor Overfitting**: Be cautious of rules that perform well on training data but poorly on test data.

7. **Investigate Exceptions and Outliers**

   - **Study Counter-Examples**: Analyze modifiers that do not follow the expected pattern to understand underlying reasons.
   - **Revise Rules Accordingly**: Adjust rules to account for exceptions or revise assumptions.

8. **Iterative Refinement**

   - **Continuous Improvement**: Use insights from each iteration to refine rules progressively.
   - **Set Clear Objectives**: Define acceptable thresholds for support, confidence, and lift to guide rule development.

---

**Final Thoughts**

While the current rules have expanded their applicability (increased support), they have lost predictive power (decreased confidence and lift). To improve the model:

- **Balance Support and Confidence**: Strive for rules that have both reasonable support and high confidence.
- **Enhance Predictive Power**: Focus on rules that provide meaningful insights and have a significant impact on predicting high yields.
- **Avoid Over-Generalization**: Ensure that in pursuing higher support, the rules do not become so general that they cease to be useful predictors.

By implementing these strategies, it is expected that the performance of the rules can be improved, leading to better predictive accuracy and more valuable insights for the catalytic problem at hand.

ML Commenter Message:
**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

Based on the latest training results, the classification model achieved an accuracy of **0.6** in a 5-fold cross-validation. This performance is lower compared to previous iterations, where validation accuracies ranged from **0.6286** to **0.8286**. The decrease in accuracy suggests that the current set of rules may not be effectively capturing the underlying patterns that correlate with the experimental outcomes.

**Comparison with Previous Iterations:**

- **Previous Accuracies:**
  - Validation Accuracies ranged from **0.68** to **0.8286**.
  - Test Accuracies were around **0.75**.

- **Current Accuracy:**
  - Validation Accuracy is **0.6**.

This decline indicates that the modifications made to the rules in the current iteration may have adversely affected the model's predictive capabilities. It suggests that the model is possibly underfitting, failing to capture essential features necessary for accurate predictions.

**Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting**

- **Underfitting:** The model's reduced accuracy implies it may not be complex enough to represent the data adequately. The current rules might be too generalized or not sufficiently discriminative to capture the nuances in the dataset.

- **Evidence of Underfitting:**
  - **Reduced Accuracy:** A drop from previous accuracies indicates the model isn't performing as well on unseen data.
  - **Consistent Misclassifications:** Certain molecules are consistently mispredicted, suggesting that important features are not being captured.

**Analysis of SHAP Values**

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values provide insights into how each feature (rule) contributes to the model's predictions. By analyzing these values, we can identify which rules are influencing the predictions and how they might be causing discrepancies.

**Discrepancies Identified:**

1. **Underestimation Cases (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**

   - **Molecule:** `C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N`
     - **Predicted Loading:** Low
     - **Experimental Loading:** High
     - **Rule10 SHAP Value:** **-0.0833** (Negative contribution to high loading)
   - **Molecule:** `C([C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](C(=O)O)O)O)O)O)O`
     - **Predicted Loading:** Low
     - **Experimental Loading:** High
     - **Rule10 SHAP Value:** **-0.0833**

   **Interpretation:**
   - **Rule10** is contributing negatively to the prediction of high loading for these molecules.
   - The negative SHAP values suggest that **Rule10** is causing the model to underestimate the loading.

2. **Overestimation Cases (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**

   - **Molecule:** `CC1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=O)O`
     - **Predicted Loading:** High
     - **Experimental Loading:** Low
     - **Rule10 SHAP Value:** **0.1154** (Positive contribution to high loading)
   - **Molecule:** `C1=CC(=CC=C1CCC(=O)O)O`
     - **Predicted Loading:** High
     - **Experimental Loading:** Low
     - **Rule10 SHAP Value:** **0.1154**

   **Interpretation:**
   - **Rule10** is contributing positively to the prediction of high loading for these molecules.
   - The positive SHAP values indicate that **Rule10** is causing the model to overestimate the loading.

**Insights from SHAP Analysis:**

- **Rule10** has significant SHAP values (both positive and negative), indicating it heavily influences the model's predictions.
- In cases where the model's predictions do not align with the experimental values, **Rule10** often has the highest SHAP value, either contributing to underestimation or overestimation.
- This pattern suggests that **Rule10** may not be accurately capturing the relationship between specific molecular features and the catalytic performance.

**Evaluation of Rule Effectiveness**

- **Current Rules' Effectiveness:** The current rules, particularly **Rule10**, appear to be less effective in accurately predicting the modifier's loading on the catalyst.
- **Possible Conflicts:** There may be overlaps or contradictions between rules, causing confusion in the model.
- **Generalization Issues:** The model might be over-relying on certain rules without adequately considering others, leading to poor generalization on unseen data.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

To enhance the model's performance and address the identified issues, the following improvements to the current rules are recommended:

1. **Refine Rule10:**

   - **Issue with Rule10:**
     - It's contributing significantly to incorrect predictions.
     - The rule might be too broad or not accurately defined.
   - **Suggested Refinements:**
     - **Specify Positions:** Limit the rule to aldehyde groups in specific positions that interfere with coordination.
     - **Consider Exceptions:** Identify and exclude cases where aldehyde groups do not negatively impact the catalytic performance.
     - **Re-evaluate Examples:** Ensure that the examples and counter-examples used to define the rule accurately reflect the data.

2. **Adjust Rules with High Negative SHAP Values:**

   - **Underestimated Loadings:**
     - For molecules with predicted low loading but experimentally high loading, rules with high negative SHAP values should be adjusted.
   - **Action Steps:**
     - **Reassess the Rationale:** Examine the rationale behind these rules to ensure they're scientifically sound.
     - **Update the Rules:** Modify the rules to reduce their negative impact on the prediction of high loading.

3. **Improve Generalization:**

   - **Avoid Overfitting/Underfitting:**
     - Ensure that rules are neither too specific (overfitting) nor too general (underfitting).
   - **Balanced Rule Complexity:**
     - Strike a balance between rule complexity and generality to capture essential features without introducing noise.
   - **Incorporate Statistical Insights:**
     - Consider using statistical methods to validate the significance of each rule.

4. **Use SHAP Analysis for Rule Refinement:**

   - **Identify Problematic Rules:**
     - Utilize SHAP values to pinpoint which rules are consistently contributing to incorrect predictions.
   - **Iterative Improvement:**
     - Continuously refine rules based on SHAP insights and re-evaluate model performance.
   - **Cross-Validate Changes:**
     - Test rule adjustments using cross-validation to ensure improvements are consistent across different data splits.

5. **Review and Update Other Rules:**

   - **Rule Overlaps:**
     - Check for overlaps or contradictions between rules that might confuse the model.
   - **Complementary Rules:**
     - Ensure that rules complement rather than contradict each other.
   - **Rule Clarity:**
     - Clearly define each rule with precise criteria and well-chosen examples and counter-examples.

6. **Consider New Features:**

   - **Additional Molecular Descriptors:**
     - Incorporate other relevant molecular features that may contribute to catalytic performance.
   - **Data-Driven Rule Generation:**
     - Use exploratory data analysis to discover new patterns that can be formulated into rules.

**Conclusion**

The current set of rules, particularly **Rule10**, appears to be negatively impacting the model's performance by contributing to incorrect predictions. By refining **Rule10** to be more specific and adjusting other rules that cause underestimations or overestimations, the model's accuracy can be improved. Leveraging insights from the SHAP analysis allows for targeted modifications to the rules, enhancing their effectiveness and the model's predictive capabilities.

Moving forward, it's crucial to maintain a balance between rule specificity and generalization to prevent overfitting or underfitting. Continuous evaluation and iterative refinement of the rules, guided by performance metrics and SHAP analysis, will help in developing a robust model that accurately predicts the catalytic performance of modifiers.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

---

**Overview**

In the recent analysis of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction of aliphatic alcohols, the goal is to optimize the yield by understanding how different molecular modifiers affect the catalyst Hf-TPY-MOL(Fe). The current set of rules formulated to predict the yield based on molecular structures has shown some limitations in predictive performance, as indicated by various metrics and SHAP analysis.

---

**Key Findings from Metrics and Analysis**

1. **Decrease in Confidence and Lift:**
   - **Confidence** has dropped from earlier iterations (from ~0.71 to ~0.50).
   - **Lift** has decreased to nearly 1 (~1.02), indicating the rules are barely better than random chance.

2. **Increase in Support with Decreased Predictive Power:**
   - **Support** increased significantly (from ~0.023 to ~0.274), meaning the rules apply to more data points.
   - However, the increased support has come at the cost of specificity, reducing overall predictive accuracy.

3. **Negative Leverage:**
   - The negative leverage value suggests the association between the rules and high yield is weaker than expected by chance.

4. **Model Accuracy Decline:**
   - The 5-fold cross-validation accuracy decreased to **0.6** from previous values as high as **0.8286**.
   - This decline indicates potential underfitting, where the model fails to capture essential patterns.

5. **SHAP Analysis Insights:**
   - **Rule10** significantly contributes to incorrect predictions.
     - **Overestimation:** It falsely predicts high yield for some modifiers with low experimental yield.
     - **Underestimation:** It predicts low yield for modifiers that experimentally have high yield.
   - Other rules may also not be accurately capturing the relationship between molecular features and yield.

---

**Directions and Suggestions for Improving Current Rules**

1. **Refine Pattern Matching Logic in Code:**
   - **Ensure Simultaneous Matching:** Modify the code so that all patterns within a group must match simultaneously for a rule to apply.
   - **Accurate `min_counts` Implementation:** Verify that each pattern meets the individual count thresholds before considering a group match.
   - **Correct Application of Exclusion Patterns:** Update the code to set `match = False` immediately when an exclusion pattern is found.

2. **Reevaluate and Revise Specific Rules:**
   - **Rule10 Adjustment:**
     - **Clarify Positions Affected:** Specify that aldehyde groups in positions ortho or para to the carboxyl group interfere with coordination.
     - **Consider Modifiers' Structural Context:** Exclude cases where aldehyde groups do not hinder coordination due to steric factors.
   - **Enhance Specificity in Rules:**
     - **Rules 1 and 2:** Ensure the rules capture the precise functional groups and their positions that influence yield.
     - **Rules with Electron-Donating/Electron-Withdrawing Groups:** Revise SMARTS patterns to accurately reflect the electronic effects on coordination.

3. **Balance Rule Specificity and Generality:**
   - **Avoid Over-Generalization:** Refrain from broad rules that apply to many molecules but lack predictive power.
   - **Focus on High-Lift Rules:** Prioritize rules with lift significantly greater than 1 to improve predictive accuracy.

4. **Incorporate Additional Molecular Descriptors:**
   - **Use Other Chemical Features:** Consider incorporating properties such as steric hindrance, chelation ability, and electronic factors.
   - **Apply Feature Selection Techniques:** Use statistical methods to identify and utilize the most predictive molecular features.

5. **Analyze and Prune Ineffective Rules:**
   - **Identify Low-Performance Rules:** Use SHAP values and model metrics to find rules contributing to incorrect predictions.
   - **Remove or Modify These Rules:** Adjust or eliminate rules that consistently reduce model accuracy.

6. **Iterative Testing and Validation:**
   - **Cross-Validation:** Continuously test rules on different subsets of data to ensure they generalize well.
   - **Monitor for Overfitting and Underfitting:** Ensure rules are neither too specific (overfitting) nor too broad (underfitting).

7. **Enhance Rule Definition and Examples:**
   - **Provide Precise Definitions:** Ensure each rule is clearly defined with specific chemical rationale.
   - **Use Accurate Examples and Counter-Examples:** Select representative molecules that accurately reflect the rule's intent.

8. **Improve Code Documentation:**
   - **Add Comments and Explanations:** Clearly explain the logic behind pattern matching and rule application in the code.
   - **Facilitate Maintenance and Future Modifications:** Well-documented code aids in identifying and fixing issues promptly.

9. **Leverage SHAP Analysis for Rule Refinement:**
   - **Use SHAP Values to Identify Issues:** Focus on rules with high SHAP values contributing to mispredictions.
   - **Adjust Rules Accordingly:** Refine or rewrite these rules to better align model predictions with experimental outcomes.

10. **Validate Feature Matrix:**
    - **Manual Verification:** Select a diverse set of SMILES and verify that the feature matrix accurately reflects the application of rules.
    - **Ensure Consistency:** Confirm that patterns are correctly matched and that the rules are applied as intended.

---

**Possibility for Further Optimization**

Yes, there is significant potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. The current challenges stem from issues such as:

- **Underfitting Due to Over-Generalization:** The rules may be too broad, capturing more data points at the expense of specificity and predictive power.
- **Incorrect Pattern Matching:** Logical errors in the code may cause rules to apply incorrectly.
- **Ineffective Rules:** Certain rules, like **Rule10**, are contributing to incorrect predictions and need refinement.

By addressing these issues through the suggestions provided, the rules can be optimized to improve model accuracy and predictive reliability while avoiding overfitting.

---

**Conclusion**

To enhance the predictive performance of the model and accurately capture the relationship between molecular modifiers and catalytic yield, it is essential to refine the current rules and adjust the code implementing them. Focusing on specificity, accurate pattern matching, and the incorporation of meaningful molecular descriptors will lead to a more robust and reliable model.

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains containing additional coordinating functional groups (e.g., carboxylate, hydroxyl, or heteroatom-containing rings)** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Side chains with additional coordination sites enhance metal-ligand interactions, stabilizing the catalyst and improving reactivity.
   
   - **Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Entry 0) – High Yield (Glutamic acid; extra carboxylate)
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Entry 2) – High Yield (Aspartic acid; extra carboxylate)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Entry 14) – High Yield (Tryptophan; indole nitrogen)

   - **Counter-Example**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Entry 12) – Low Yield (Phenylalanine; non-coordinating side chain)

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., nitro, halogens, keto groups) directly attached to the ring** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group and enhance coordination ability.
   
   - **Examples**:
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Entry 1) – High Yield
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Entry 20) – High Yield
     - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Entry 16) – High Yield
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 8) – High Yield

   - **Counter-Example**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 22) – Low Yield (Methyl group is electron-donating)

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxyl) directly attached to the ring** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing coordination ability.

   - **Examples**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 22) – Low Yield
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30) – Low Yield
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 18) – Low Yield (Hydroxyl in ortho position)
     - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Entry 26) – Low Yield

   - **Exception**:
     - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Entry 7) – High Yield (Exception possibly due to the aliphatic linker increasing flexibility)

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length chains (C5–C8) and no additional functional groups** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Optimal chain length allows effective interaction with the catalyst surface without steric hindrance.

   - **Example**:
     - **Octanoic acid** (Entry 5) – High Yield

   - **Counter-Examples**:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Entry 29) – Low Yield (Hydroxyl group may interfere with coordination)
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Entry 31) – Low Yield (Amino group may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorably interact)

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms adjacent to the carboxyl group in the ring** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms can serve as additional coordination sites, enhancing metal binding and catalyst performance.

   - **Examples**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Entry 21) – High Yield
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 15) – High Yield

   - **Counter-Example**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 11) – Low Yield (Pyridyl group at para-position may not effectively coordinate due to steric factors)

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing **functional groups capable of strong metal coordination (e.g., thiol, thioether, multiple adjacent hydroxyls) in proximity to the carboxylate group** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: These groups enhance coordination to the metal center, stabilizing the catalyst.

   - **Examples**:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 17) – High Yield (Thiol group)
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Entry 9) – High Yield (Multiple hydroxyl groups enabling chelation)

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers with **multiple ether linkages or flexible polar chains in the molecule** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Ether oxygens are poor coordinating ligands and increase solubility in the solvent, reducing catalyst interaction.

   - **Examples**:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 10) – Low Yield
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32) – Low Yield

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **amide bonds adjacent to the carboxylic acid group** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Amide groups can reduce coordination ability due to resonance stabilization and may alter binding geometry unfavorably.

   - **Examples**:
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 33) – Low Yield
     - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (Entry 23) – Low Yield

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., perfluorinated chains)** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Strong electron-withdrawing substituents decrease electron density on the carboxylate, hindering effective metal coordination.

   - **Example**:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Entry 13) – Low Yield

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing **aldehyde groups on an aromatic ring in positions that can interfere with coordination** tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Aldehyde groups can form competing interactions or deactivate catalysts through side reactions.

    - **Examples**:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19) – Low Yield
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 18) – Low Yield

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: Refine the pattern matching logic in the code to ensure that **all patterns within a rule must match simultaneously** (logical AND). This will prevent partial matches and improve the specificity of the rules.

- **Advice 2**: Correct the implementation of `min_counts` by ensuring that **each pattern meets its individual count threshold** before the rule is considered a match. This will make the rules more accurate and prevent unintended matches.

- **Advice 3**: Update the code to **immediately set `match = False` when an exclusion pattern is found**. This ensures that molecules with exclusion features do not satisfy the rule, improving the precision of rule application.

- **Advice 4**: Reevaluate **Rule 10** by clarifying that **aldehyde groups ortho or para to the carboxyl group** interfere with coordination and lead to low yield. Modify the SMARTS patterns to specifically target these positions.

- **Advice 5**: Enhance the specificity of **Rules 1 and 2** by revising the SMARTS patterns to **accurately reflect the positions and types of functional groups** (e.g., electron-withdrawing groups directly attached to the aromatic ring) that influence yield.

- **Advice 6**: Revise rules involving electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., **Rules 2 and 3**) to ensure that the SMARTS patterns **accurately capture electronic effects** on coordination, including the influence of substituent positions on the aromatic ring.

- **Advice 7**: **Analyze and modify ineffective rules** identified by SHAP analysis (e.g., **Rule 10**) that contribute to incorrect predictions. Adjust or eliminate these rules to improve overall model accuracy.

- **Advice 8**: Balance rule specificity and generality by **avoiding overly broad rules** that apply to many molecules but lack predictive power. Focus on creating rules with a higher **lift value** to enhance predictive accuracy.

- **Advice 9**: Incorporate additional molecular descriptors into the rules, such as **steric hindrance, chelation ability, and electronic characteristics**. This will help capture essential patterns influencing yield.

- **Advice 10**: Implement iterative testing and validation, including **cross-validation and SHAP analysis**, to continually assess and refine the rules. This will ensure that the rules generalize well and do not underfit or overfit the data.

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains containing polar or coordinating functional groups (e.g., additional carboxylate, hydroxyl, or indole rings)** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: The presence of polar side chains enhances metal-ligand interactions through additional coordination sites, stabilizing the catalyst.

   - **Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Entry 0) – High Yield (Glutamic acid; extra carboxylate group)
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Entry 2) – High Yield (Aspartic acid; extra carboxylate group)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Entry 14) – High Yield (Tryptophan; indole nitrogen)

   - **Counter-Example**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Entry 12) – Low Yield (Phenylalanine; non-coordinating hydrophobic side chain)

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., nitro, halogen, keto groups) directly attached to the aromatic ring** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group and enhance its ability to coordinate with metal centers.

   - **Examples**:
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Entry 1) – High Yield (Bromomethyl group)
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Entry 20) – High Yield (Nitro group)
     - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Entry 16) – High Yield (Ketone groups within the fused ring)

   - **Counter-Example**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 22) – Low Yield (Methyl group is electron-donating)

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxyl) attached to the aromatic ring** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing its coordination ability with metal centers.

   - **Examples**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 22) – Low Yield (Methyl substituent)
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30) – Low Yield (Hydroxyl group)
     - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Entry 26) – Low Yield (Hydroxyl group)

   - **Exception**:
     - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Entry 7) – High Yield (Hydroxyphenyl group separated by a longer aliphatic chain, reducing electron-donating impact on the carboxylate)

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length chains (C6–C8) and no additional functional groups** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: These modifiers can effectively interact with the catalyst surface without introducing steric hindrance or interfering functionalities.

   - **Example**:
     - **Octanoic acid** (Entry 5) – High Yield (Eight-carbon chain)

   - **Counter-Examples**:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Entry 29) – Low Yield (Hydroxyl group may interfere with coordination)
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Entry 31) – Low Yield (Amino group may introduce unfavorable interactions)

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms in positions favorable for coordination (e.g., adjacent or orthogonal to the carboxyl group)** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in the ring can serve as additional coordination sites, enhancing metal binding and catalyst performance.

   - **Examples**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Entry 21) – High Yield (Nitrogen atom adjacent to carboxyl group)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 15) – High Yield (Pyrazole ring with coordinating nitrogen)

   - **Counter-Example**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 11) – Low Yield (Pyridyl group at para-position may not effectively coordinate due to steric factors)

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing **functional groups capable of strong metal coordination (e.g., thiol, multiple adjacent hydroxyls) near the carboxylate group** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: These groups can chelate the metal center, increasing catalyst stability and reactivity.

   - **Examples**:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 17) – High Yield (Thiol group enhances coordination)
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Entry 9) – High Yield (Multiple hydroxyls for chelation)

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers with **multiple ether linkages or flexible polar chains (e.g., polyether chains)** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Ether oxygens are less effective as coordinating ligands and increase solubility in the solvent, reducing interactions with the catalyst surface.

   - **Examples**:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 10) – Low Yield (Multiple ether linkages)
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32) – Low Yield (Flexible ether-containing chain)

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **amide bonds adjacent to the carboxylic acid group** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Amide groups can reduce coordination ability due to resonance delocalization of the lone pair on the nitrogen, altering binding geometry unfavorably.

   - **Examples**:
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 33) – Low Yield (Acetamido group adjacent to carboxylate)
     - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Entry 26) – Low Yield (Amide linkage affects coordination)

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **perfluorinated carboxylic acids (carboxylic acids with perfluoroalkyl chains)** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Strong electron-withdrawing effects of perfluoroalkyl groups decrease electron density on the carboxylate, hindering effective metal coordination.

   - **Example**:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Entry 13) – Low Yield (Perfluorinated chain)

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing **aldehyde groups on an aromatic ring, especially when adjacent to coordinating groups like hydroxyls** tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Aldehyde groups may interfere with metal coordination or participate in side reactions, reducing catalyst effectiveness.

    - **Examples**:
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 18) – Low Yield (Aldehyde and hydroxyl groups may chelate unfavorably)
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19) – Low Yield (Aldehyde group adjacent to carboxylate)

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: **Rule 1** is clear and well-defined, allowing for easy identification of modifiers fitting the criteria of α-amino acids with polar or coordinating side chains. The property insight is strong, as it links the enhanced metal-ligand interactions to the presence of additional coordination sites provided by polar functional groups. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures (the α-amino acid backbone and specific side chains), fulfilling the complexity criterion. With at least three supporting data points (Entries 0, 2, and 14) and a clear counter-example (Entry 12), the coverage is adequate. Overall, the rule achieves a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 2** is clearly stated, focusing on aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents directly attached to the ring. The property insight is solid, explaining how increased acidity enhances metal coordination. The complexity is appropriate, addressing specific substituents and their positions. Coverage is sufficient with multiple examples (Entries 1, 16, and 20) and a counter-example (Entry 22), satisfying the coverage criterion. The rule maintains a good balance, effectively linking structural features to yield outcomes.

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 3** is clear, outlining that electron-donating substituents on aromatic carboxylic acids lead to low yields. The property insight logically explains the decreased acidity and coordination ability. Complexity is appropriate, considering the type of substituents. The rule is supported by several data points (Entries 22, 26, and 30) and acknowledges an exception (Entry 7), which demonstrates depth in understanding. The coverage is adequate, and the balance between simplicity and explanatory power is well-maintained.

- **Comment 4**: **Rule 4** is straightforward, specifying medium-length straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups. The property insight is acceptable, but somewhat general. The coverage is limited, with only one supporting example (Entry 5) and few modifiers matching the criteria, which diminishes its strength. To improve coverage, the rule could be expanded to include similar chain lengths or slightly varied functional groups, enhancing its applicability without sacrificing clarity.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** offers clarity in identifying heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms positioned favorably for coordination. The property insight is strong, highlighting the role of nitrogen in metal binding. Complexity is satisfactory, considering specific positions of heteroatoms. With two supporting examples (Entries 15 and 21) and a counter-example (Entry 11), the coverage meets the minimum requirement but could be strengthened by additional data points. The balance is acceptable, though extending coverage would enhance the rule's robustness.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** is somewhat broad, encompassing modifiers with functional groups capable of strong metal coordination near the carboxylate group. While the property insight is solid, the clarity could be improved by specifying which functional groups (e.g., thiols, multiple adjacent hydroxyls) are included. The coverage is minimal, relying on two examples (Entries 9 and 17). To enhance the rule, it could be refined to focus on specific functional groups and include more supporting data, thereby improving clarity and coverage.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** is clear in its description of modifiers with multiple ether linkages or flexible polar chains leading to low yields. The property insight effectively explains the reduced catalyst interaction. Complexity is appropriate, considering the impact of multiple ether groups. Coverage is limited but acceptable with two supporting examples (Entries 10 and 32). The balance between complexity and coverage is reasonable, but the rule could be strengthened by identifying additional examples to increase its applicability.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** clearly identifies modifiers with amide bonds adjacent to the carboxylic acid as leading to low yields. The property insight is logical, addressing resonance effects on coordination. Complexity is sufficient, focusing on the specific structural arrangement. Coverage is minimal, with two examples (Entries 26 and 33). Enhancing the rule with more data points or exploring related structures could improve coverage and strengthen its predictive power.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** is clear but has very limited coverage, supported by only one data point (Entry 13). The property insight is reasonable, but the lack of additional examples weakens the rule's reliability. To meet the coverage criterion and improve the rule, more data points involving perfluorinated carboxylic acids would be needed, if available in the dataset.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** is clear in stating that modifiers with aldehyde groups on aromatic rings, especially adjacent to coordinating groups, lead to low yields. The property insight is sound, explaining potential interference with metal coordination. Complexity is appropriate. Coverage meets the minimum with two examples (Entries 18 and 19). The rule balances clarity and complexity well, but additional supporting data would enhance its reliability and adherence to the coverage criterion.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains containing polar or coordinating functional groups (e.g., additional carboxylate, hydroxyl, or indole rings)** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: The presence of polar side chains enhances metal-ligand interactions through additional coordination sites, stabilizing the catalyst.

   - **Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Entry 0) – High Yield (Glutamic acid; extra carboxylate group)
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Entry 2) – High Yield (Aspartic acid; extra carboxylate group)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Entry 14) – High Yield (Tryptophan; indole nitrogen)

   - **Counter-Example**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Entry 12) – Low Yield (Phenylalanine; non-coordinating hydrophobic side chain)

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., nitro, halogen, keto groups) directly attached to the aromatic ring** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group and enhance its ability to coordinate with metal centers.

   - **Examples**:
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Entry 1) – High Yield (Bromomethyl group)
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Entry 20) – High Yield (Nitro group)
     - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Entry 16) – High Yield (Ketone groups within the fused ring)

   - **Counter-Example**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 22) – Low Yield (Methyl group is electron-donating)

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxyl) attached to the aromatic ring** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing its coordination ability with metal centers.

   - **Examples**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 22) – Low Yield (Methyl substituent)
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30) – Low Yield (Hydroxyl group)
     - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Entry 26) – Low Yield (Hydroxyl group)

   - **Exception**:
     - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Entry 7) – High Yield (Hydroxyphenyl group separated by a longer aliphatic chain, reducing electron-donating impact on the carboxylate)

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length chains (C6–C8) and no additional functional groups** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: These modifiers can effectively interact with the catalyst surface without introducing steric hindrance or interfering functionalities.

   - **Example**:
     - **Octanoic acid** (Entry 5) – High Yield (Eight-carbon chain)

   - **Counter-Examples**:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Entry 29) – Low Yield (Hydroxyl group may interfere with coordination)
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Entry 31) – Low Yield (Amino group may introduce unfavorable interactions)

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms in positions favorable for coordination (e.g., adjacent or orthogonal to the carboxyl group)** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in the ring can serve as additional coordination sites, enhancing metal binding and catalyst performance.

   - **Examples**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Entry 21) – High Yield (Nitrogen atom adjacent to carboxyl group)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 15) – High Yield (Pyrazole ring with coordinating nitrogen)

   - **Counter-Example**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 11) – Low Yield (Pyridyl group at para-position may not effectively coordinate due to steric factors)

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing **functional groups capable of strong metal coordination (e.g., thiol, multiple adjacent hydroxyls) near the carboxylate group** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: These groups can chelate the metal center, increasing catalyst stability and reactivity.

   - **Examples**:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 17) – High Yield (Thiol group enhances coordination)
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Entry 9) – High Yield (Multiple hydroxyls for chelation)

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers with **multiple ether linkages or flexible polar chains (e.g., polyether chains)** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Ether oxygens are less effective as coordinating ligands and increase solubility in the solvent, reducing interactions with the catalyst surface.

   - **Examples**:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 10) – Low Yield (Multiple ether linkages)
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32) – Low Yield (Flexible ether-containing chain)

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **amide bonds adjacent to the carboxylic acid group** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Amide groups can reduce coordination ability due to resonance delocalization of the lone pair on the nitrogen, altering binding geometry unfavorably.

   - **Examples**:
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 33) – Low Yield (Acetamido group adjacent to carboxylate)
     - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Entry 26) – Low Yield (Amide linkage affects coordination)

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **perfluorinated carboxylic acids (carboxylic acids with perfluoroalkyl chains)** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Strong electron-withdrawing effects of perfluoroalkyl groups decrease electron density on the carboxylate, hindering effective metal coordination.

   - **Example**:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Entry 13) – Low Yield (Perfluorinated chain)

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing **aldehyde groups on an aromatic ring, especially when adjacent to coordinating groups like hydroxyls** tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Aldehyde groups may interfere with metal coordination or participate in side reactions, reducing catalyst effectiveness.

    - **Examples**:
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 18) – Low Yield (Aldehyde and hydroxyl groups may chelate unfavorably)
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19) – Low Yield (Aldehyde group adjacent to carboxylate)

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- **Suggestion 1**: Review and revise the SMARTS patterns for accuracy. The current SMARTS patterns may be too restrictive or incorrectly defined, leading to no matches. For example, in Rule 1, the `alpha_amino_acid` pattern `"[NX3][CHX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H1]"` may not match common α-amino acids due to incorrect atom specifications. Consider simplifying it to match any amino acid backbone, such as `"[NX3][CHX4][CX3](=O)[O]"`.

- **Suggestion 2**: Test each SMARTS pattern individually against known example molecules from the rules to ensure they correctly identify the intended structures. Use RDKit's `HasSubstructMatch` function on the example SMILES to validate each pattern.

- **Suggestion 3**: Adjust the side chain patterns to be more inclusive. For Rule 1, the `side_chain_polar_group` patterns might be too narrow. Expand them to include other polar groups mentioned in the rule, such as alcohols and amines, e.g., `"[C][OX2H]"` for hydroxyl groups and `"[C][NX3H2]"` for amino groups.

- **Suggestion 4**: Modify the code logic to ensure correct application of logical operators. Ensure that the code requires all necessary patterns to match (logical AND between different pattern groups) and any of the patterns within a group to match (logical OR within a group). Verify that the current implementation aligns with this logic.

- **Suggestion 5**: Include tautomeric and ionic forms in the SMARTS patterns to account for different representations of functional groups. For example, carboxylic acids can be present as carboxylates in some SMILES strings. Adjust patterns to include both protonated and deprotonated forms, e.g., `"[CX3](=O)[OX1H1,OX1-]"`.

- **Suggestion 6**: Simplify overly specific SMARTS patterns to prevent missing valid matches. For instance, in Rule 4, instead of specifying exact chain lengths in patterns like `"[CH3][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][C](=O)[OX1H1]"`, use a more general pattern that matches any aliphatic carboxylic acid with chain lengths in the desired range, such as `"[CH3][CH2]{4,6}[C](=O)[OX1H1]"`.

- **Suggestion 7**: Expand exclude patterns to cover all possible interfering functional groups. In Rule 4, additional functional groups might not be limited to hydroxyl, amino, and thiol groups. Consider including other polar groups like ethers and halogens in the `exclude_patterns`.

- **Suggestion 8**: Cross-reference the SMARTS patterns with standard definitions or use predefined SMARTS from reliable sources to ensure accuracy. Utilize the "Examples for SMARTS" provided to refine patterns and improve pattern matching.

- **Suggestion 9**: Incorporate explicit hydrogens in SMARTS patterns where necessary or adjust matching settings to account for implicit hydrogens. Incorrect handling of hydrogens can lead to missed matches, especially in patterns involving amino or hydroxyl groups.

- **Suggestion 10**: Add diagnostic output to the code to log which SMARTS patterns are being matched or not for each molecule. This will help identify where mismatches are occurring and facilitate debugging and correction of the patterns.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Translate Qualitative Rules into Quantifiable Features**  
  Rephrase each rule to specify exact structural features or functional groups that can be directly identified from SMILES strings. For instance, instead of stating "modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups tend to give a high yield," specify the exact electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, cyano, halogens) and their positions relative to the carboxyl group.

- **Advice 2**: **Utilize SMARTS Patterns for Functional Group Identification**  
  Define functional groups and structural motifs using SMARTS notation. This allows for programmatic detection of these features in SMILES strings using cheminformatics tools like RDKit, facilitating the generation of a numeric feature matrix.

- **Advice 3**: **Create Binary Feature Flags for Specific Structural Elements**  
  For each modifier, generate a binary vector indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of specific functional groups or structural features mentioned in the rules (e.g., additional carboxylate groups, indole rings, pyridine nitrogen atoms). This approach simplifies the feature matrix and makes it suitable for machine learning models.

- **Advice 4**: **Quantify Electronic Effects Using Substituent Constants**  
  Assign numerical values to substituents based on known electronic parameters such as Hammett sigma constants for aromatic systems or Taft parameters for aliphatic systems. This quantification enables a numerical representation of electron-donating or electron-withdrawing effects in the feature matrix.

- **Advice 5**: **Incorporate Molecular Descriptors and Topological Indices**  
  Calculate molecular descriptors (e.g., molecular weight, Log P, topological polar surface area (TPSA), hydrogen bond donors and acceptors) using the SMILES strings. Include these numerical values in the feature matrix to capture physicochemical properties influencing the yield.

- **Advice 6**: **Standardize Functional Group Categories**  
  Create a standardized list of functional groups and structural features based on the modifiers in the dataset. Categorize similar groups together (e.g., all halogens as one category) to reduce complexity and ensure consistent feature extraction across different modifiers.

- **Advice 7**: **Simplify and Consolidate Overlapping Rules**  
  Merge similar rules to eliminate redundancy. For example, combine Rules 2 and 5 by creating a general rule for modifiers with heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of coordination. This streamlines the rules and focuses on features that can be quantified.

- **Advice 8**: **Specify the Position of Functional Groups Relative to Key Moieties**  
  Clearly define the positions of functional groups (ortho, meta, para) relative to the carboxylate or other coordinating groups. Positional information can be encoded numerically or as binary features, aiding in the precise computation of the feature matrix.

- **Advice 9**: **Exclude Ambiguous Language from Rules**  
  Remove subjective terms like "tend to" or "may," and replace them with definitive criteria. For example, specify thresholds (e.g., "Modifiers with a Log P greater than 2 result in high yield") to create clear, quantifiable rules.

- **Advice 10**: **Provide Computational Implementation Guidelines**  
  Offer guidance on how to implement the feature extraction using cheminformatics libraries. Include example code snippets or workflows demonstrating how to parse SMILES strings, detect functional groups using SMARTS patterns, and compute molecular descriptors.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxyl groups or nitrogen-containing heterocycles (e.g., indole rings)** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Extra carboxyl groups and nitrogen heterocycles enhance metal coordination through multiple binding sites, stabilizing the catalyst and improving efficiency.

   - **Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Entry 0) – High Yield (Glutamic acid; additional carboxylate group)
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Entry 2) – High Yield (Aspartic acid; additional carboxylate group)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Entry 14) – High Yield (Tryptophan; indole nitrogen)

   - **Counter-Example**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Entry 12) – Low Yield (Phenylalanine; lacks additional coordinating groups)

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., nitro, halogen, ketone groups) directly attached to the aromatic ring** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylate, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers and stabilize the catalyst.

   - **Examples**:
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Entry 1) – High Yield (Bromomethyl group)
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Entry 20) – High Yield (Nitro group)
     - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Entry 16) – High Yield (Ketone groups within the fused ring)

   - **Counter-Example**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 22) – Low Yield (Methyl group is electron-donating)

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxyl groups) attached to the aromatic ring** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylate, weakening metal coordination and reducing catalyst effectiveness.

   - **Examples**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 22) – Low Yield (Methyl substituent)
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30) – Low Yield (Hydroxyl group)
     - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Entry 26) – Low Yield (Hydroxyl group)

   - **Exception**:
     - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Entry 7) – High Yield (Hydroxyphenyl group separated by an aliphatic chain, reducing electron-donating effect on the carboxylate)

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers containing **additional coordinating functional groups such as thiols or multiple adjacent hydroxyls near the carboxylate group** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: These functional groups can chelate the metal center, forming more stable complexes and enhancing catalytic activity.

   - **Examples**:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 17) – High Yield (Thiol group enhances coordination)
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Entry 9) – High Yield (Multiple hydroxyls for chelation)

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating nitrogen atoms in positions favorable for metal binding (e.g., ortho or para to the carboxyl group)** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in the ring can serve as additional coordination sites, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and catalyst performance.

   - **Examples**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Entry 21) – High Yield (Nitrogen atom adjacent to carboxyl group)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 15) – High Yield (Pyrazole ring with coordinating nitrogen)

   - **Counter-Example**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 11) – Low Yield (Pyridyl group may not effectively coordinate due to steric factors or unfavorable positioning)

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (C6–C8) without additional functional groups** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: The optimal chain length balances hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst surface and effective metal coordination through the carboxylate group.

   - **Example**:
     - **Octanoic acid** (Entry 5) – High Yield (Eight-carbon chain)

   - **Counter-Examples**:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Entry 29) – Low Yield (Hydroxyl group may interfere with coordination)
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Entry 31) – Low Yield (Amino group may introduce unfavorable interactions)

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing **flexible polar chains with ether linkages or multiple amine groups** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Ether oxygens and amine groups may not coordinate effectively with metal centers and can increase solubility in the solvent, reducing interaction with the catalyst surface.

   - **Examples**:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 10) – Low Yield (Multiple ether linkages)
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32) – Low Yield (Flexible ether-containing chain with amine group)

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **amide or peptide bonds adjacent to the carboxylic acid group** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Amide groups can reduce coordination ability due to resonance delocalization of the lone pair on nitrogen, altering binding geometry and weakening metal interaction.

   - **Examples**:
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 33) – Low Yield (Acetamido group adjacent to carboxylate)
     - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Entry 26) – Low Yield (Amide linkage affects coordination)

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **strongly electron-withdrawing perfluoroalkyl chains attached to the carboxyl group** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Perfluoroalkyl groups significantly decrease electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, hindering effective metal coordination.

   - **Example**:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Entry 13) – Low Yield (Perfluorinated chain)

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing **aldehyde groups on an aromatic ring, especially when adjacent to coordinating groups like hydroxyls, or on aliphatic chains** tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Aldehyde groups may interfere with metal coordination or participate in side reactions, reducing catalyst effectiveness.

    - **Examples**:
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 18) – Low Yield (Aldehyde and hydroxyl groups may chelate unfavorably)
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19) – Low Yield (Aldehyde group adjacent to carboxylate)
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Entry 27) – Low Yield (Aldehyde group on aliphatic chain)

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **dicarboxylic acids or polycarboxylic acids with carboxyl groups separated by a short linker** tend to give a **high yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Multiple carboxylate groups can coordinate simultaneously with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability through chelation.

    - **Examples**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Entry 0) – High Yield (Dicarboxylic acid)
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Entry 2) – High Yield (Dicarboxylic acid)
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Entry 27) – Low Yield (Exception due to ketone interference)

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids fused with additional carbonyl groups within the ring structure** tend to give a **high yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Additional carbonyl groups can participate in resonance stabilization and metal coordination, enhancing catalytic activity.

    - **Example**:
      - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Entry 16) – High Yield (Fused ketone groups)

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **non-coordinating bulky or hydrophobic side chains near the carboxyl group** tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Bulky side chains may cause steric hindrance, and hydrophobic groups may reduce effective interaction with the metal center.

    - **Examples**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Entry 12) – Low Yield (Phenyl group is bulky and non-coordinating)
      - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (Entry 25) – High Yield (Exception due to ketone enhancing coordination)

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids containing hydroxyl or amino groups distant from the carboxylate** tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: While polar, these groups may not effectively coordinate due to distance from the carboxylate and can introduce solubility issues or interfere with catalyst binding.

    - **Examples**:
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Entry 29) – Low Yield (Hydroxyl group distant from carboxylate)
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Entry 34) – Low Yield (Amino group distant from carboxylate)

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers with **polyether chains or multiple flexible linkages increasing conformational freedom** tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Increased flexibility can reduce effective binding to the catalyst surface and decrease metal coordination efficiency.

    - **Examples**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 10) – Low Yield (Polyether chain)
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32) – Low Yield (Flexible ether-containing chain)

The property insight is reasonable, suggesting aldehydes may interfere with metal coordination. The rule is sufficiently complex and is supported by at least three data points (Entries 18, 19, 27).

- **Comment 11**:

  This rule is clear, indicating that dicarboxylic acids with carboxyl groups separated by short linkers tend to give a high yield. The property insight is appropriate, explaining enhanced coordination through chelation. The rule is supported by two data points (Entries 0, 2), though an exception is noted (Entry 27), demonstrating good coverage.

- **Comment 12**:

  While the rule is clear and the property insight is valid, the coverage is limited, with only one example (Entry 16). Therefore, the rule's support is minimal, affecting its overall robustness.

- **Comment 13**:

  The rule is clear and provides reasonable property insight. However, coverage is limited, with only one supporting data point (Entry 12) and an exception (Entry 25). This reduces the reliability of the rule.

- **Comment 14**:

  This rule is clear and provides valid property insight regarding the distance of polar groups from the carboxylate. The rule considers combinations of substructures and is supported by data (Entries 29 and 34), indicating satisfactory coverage.

- **Comment 15**:

  The rule is clear and provides appropriate property insight about flexibility reducing effective binding to the catalyst. It considers structural features and is supported by data (Entries 10 and 32), satisfying the coverage criterion.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxyl groups or nitrogen-containing heterocycles (e.g., indole rings)** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Extra carboxyl groups and nitrogen heterocycles enhance metal coordination through multiple binding sites, stabilizing the catalyst and improving efficiency.

   - **Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Entry 0) – High Yield (Glutamic acid; additional carboxylate group)
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Entry 2) – High Yield (Aspartic acid; additional carboxylate group)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Entry 14) – High Yield (Tryptophan; indole nitrogen)

   - **Counter-Example**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Entry 12) – Low Yield (Phenylalanine; lacks additional coordinating groups)

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., nitro, halogen, ketone groups) directly attached to the aromatic ring** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylate, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers and stabilize the catalyst.

   - **Examples**:
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Entry 1) – High Yield (Bromomethyl group)
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Entry 20) – High Yield (Nitro group)
     - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Entry 16) – High Yield (Ketone groups within the fused ring)

   - **Counter-Example**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 22) – Low Yield (Methyl group is electron-donating)

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxyl groups) attached to the aromatic ring** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylate, weakening metal coordination and reducing catalyst effectiveness.

   - **Examples**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 22) – Low Yield (Methyl substituent)
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30) – Low Yield (Hydroxyl group)
     - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Entry 26) – Low Yield (Hydroxyl group)

   - **Exception**:
     - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Entry 7) – High Yield (Hydroxyphenyl group separated by an aliphatic chain, reducing electron-donating effect on the carboxylate)

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers containing **additional coordinating functional groups such as thiols or multiple adjacent hydroxyls near the carboxylate group** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: These functional groups can chelate the metal center, forming more stable complexes and enhancing catalytic activity.

   - **Examples**:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 17) – High Yield (Thiol group enhances coordination)
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Entry 9) – High Yield (Multiple hydroxyls for chelation)

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating nitrogen atoms in positions favorable for metal binding (e.g., ortho or para to the carboxyl group)** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in the ring can serve as additional coordination sites, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and catalyst performance.

   - **Examples**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Entry 21) – High Yield (Nitrogen atom adjacent to carboxyl group)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 15) – High Yield (Pyrazole ring with coordinating nitrogen)

   - **Counter-Example**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 11) – Low Yield (Pyridyl group may not effectively coordinate due to steric factors or unfavorable positioning)

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (C6–C8) without additional functional groups** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: The optimal chain length balances hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst surface and effective metal coordination through the carboxylate group.

   - **Example**:
     - **Octanoic acid** (Entry 5) – High Yield (Eight-carbon chain)

   - **Counter-Examples**:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Entry 29) – Low Yield (Hydroxyl group may interfere with coordination)
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Entry 31) – Low Yield (Amino group may introduce unfavorable interactions)

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing **flexible polar chains with ether linkages or multiple amine groups** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Ether oxygens and amine groups may not coordinate effectively with metal centers and can increase solubility in the solvent, reducing interaction with the catalyst surface.

   - **Examples**:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 10) – Low Yield (Multiple ether linkages)
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32) – Low Yield (Flexible ether-containing chain with amine group)

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **amide or peptide bonds adjacent to the carboxylic acid group** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Amide groups can reduce coordination ability due to resonance delocalization of the lone pair on nitrogen, altering binding geometry and weakening metal interaction.

   - **Examples**:
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 33) – Low Yield (Acetamido group adjacent to carboxylate)
     - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Entry 26) – Low Yield (Amide linkage affects coordination)

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **strongly electron-withdrawing perfluoroalkyl chains attached to the carboxyl group** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Perfluoroalkyl groups significantly decrease electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, hindering effective metal coordination.

   - **Example**:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Entry 13) – Low Yield (Perfluorinated chain)

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing **aldehyde groups on an aromatic ring, especially when adjacent to coordinating groups like hydroxyls, or on aliphatic chains** tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Aldehyde groups may interfere with metal coordination or participate in side reactions, reducing catalyst effectiveness.

    - **Examples**:
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 18) – Low Yield (Aldehyde and hydroxyl groups may chelate unfavorably)
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19) – Low Yield (Aldehyde group adjacent to carboxylate)
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Entry 27) – Low Yield (Aldehyde group on aliphatic chain)

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **dicarboxylic acids or polycarboxylic acids with carboxyl groups separated by a short linker** tend to give a **high yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Multiple carboxylate groups can coordinate simultaneously with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability through chelation.

    - **Examples**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Entry 0) – High Yield (Dicarboxylic acid)
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Entry 2) – High Yield (Dicarboxylic acid)
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Entry 27) – Low Yield (Exception due to ketone interference)

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids fused with additional carbonyl groups within the ring structure** tend to give a **high yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Additional carbonyl groups can participate in resonance stabilization and metal coordination, enhancing catalytic activity.

    - **Example**:
      - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Entry 16) – High Yield (Fused ketone groups)

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **non-coordinating bulky or hydrophobic side chains near the carboxyl group** tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Bulky side chains may cause steric hindrance, and hydrophobic groups may reduce effective interaction with the metal center.

    - **Examples**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Entry 12) – Low Yield (Phenyl group is bulky and non-coordinating)
      - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (Entry 25) – High Yield (Exception due to ketone enhancing coordination)

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids containing hydroxyl or amino groups distant from the carboxylate** tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: While polar, these groups may not effectively coordinate due to distance from the carboxylate and can introduce solubility issues or interfere with catalyst binding.

    - **Examples**:
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Entry 29) – Low Yield (Hydroxyl group distant from carboxylate)
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Entry 34) – Low Yield (Amino group distant from carboxylate)

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers with **polyether chains or multiple flexible linkages increasing conformational freedom** tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Increased flexibility can reduce effective binding to the catalyst surface and decrease metal coordination efficiency.

    - **Examples**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 10) – Low Yield (Polyether chain)
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32) – Low Yield (Flexible ether-containing chain)

- **Suggestion 1**: **Revise Rule 1 SMARTS patterns**. The current SMARTS pattern for Rule 1 may not accurately capture α-amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxyl groups or nitrogen-containing heterocycles. Specifically, modify the pattern to ensure it matches amino acids like glutamic acid and tryptophan. For example, adjust the pattern to detect side chains with extra carboxyl groups (`[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]`) or nitrogen heterocycles (e.g., indole ring `[nH]1ccccc1`). Incorporate branching in the SMARTS to account for side chains.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Align SMILES entries with rule examples**. Ensure that the SMILES strings correspond to the correct entries mentioned in the rules' examples and counter-examples. Discrepancies in indexing may lead to incorrect labeling in the feature matrix. Cross-reference the SMILES list with the entries in the rules to maintain consistency.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Update Rule 4 to separate functional groups**. In Rule 4, differentiate between thiol groups and multiple adjacent hydroxyls by creating separate patterns for each (`[SX2H]` for thiols and `[OX2H][CX4][OX2H]` for adjacent hydroxyls). This ensures that modifiers with either functional group are correctly identified according to the rule.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Improve exclude pattern logic**. In rules using `exclude_patterns` (e.g., Rule 6), verify that the logic correctly excludes molecules with undesired functional groups. The current implementation may not effectively prevent matching molecules that should be excluded. Refine the code to ensure that if any exclude pattern matches, the rule does not apply to that molecule.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Refine electron-withdrawing and donating group patterns**. For Rules 2 and 3, enhance the SMARTS patterns to more accurately represent electron-withdrawing (`[c][N+](=O)[O-]`, `[c][C](=O)[C]`) and electron-donating groups (`[c][OH]`, `[c][OCH3]`, `[c][CH3]`) on aromatic rings. This specificity will improve the correct identification of substituents directly attached to the aromatic ring.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Add exception handling in rules**. Incorporate known exceptions directly into the rule logic. For instance, in Rule 3, Entry 7 is an exception due to the aliphatic chain separating the hydroxyl group from the aromatic ring. Modify the code to account for such cases, perhaps by adding additional patterns that exclude these specific structures.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Validate and test SMARTS patterns individually**. Before integrating patterns into the rules, test each SMARTS pattern against a set of molecules to ensure it matches the intended functional groups. This step helps catch errors in pattern definitions.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Enhance Rule 6 chain length detection**. Modify the SMARTS pattern for medium-chain aliphatic acids to dynamically detect chain lengths between C6 and C8. Use quantifiers in SMARTS (`{4,6}`) to specify the number of carbon atoms in the chain, accounting for variability in chain length.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Integrate logical operators correctly**. In Rule 1 and others, ensure that additional patterns are correctly combined using logical OR (`|`) and AND (`&`) operations where appropriate. The current code may not correctly apply these logical combinations, leading to incorrect matches.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Improve code documentation and readability**. Add comments explaining each SMARTS pattern and the reasoning behind it. Clear documentation helps in verifying the correctness of patterns and logic applied, making maintenance and future updates more manageable.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Performance**

Based on the provided metrics, we will compare the performance of the current rules against the previous reference metrics, focusing particularly on **confidence** and **lift**, which are critical indicators of rule quality in predictive models.

---

**Previous Rule Metrics (Reference):**

- **Train Confidence:** [0.6352, 0.5396]
  - *Average Train Confidence:* (0.6352 + 0.5396) / 2 = **0.5874**
  
- **Train Lift:** [1.2048, 1.0559]
  - *Average Train Lift:* (1.2048 + 1.0559) / 2 = **1.1304**

---

**Current Rule Metrics:**

1. **First Iteration:**

   - **Train Support:** 0.0234
   - **Train Confidence:** 0.5833
   - **Train Lift:** 1.1649
   - **Train Leverage:** 0.0090

2. **Second Iteration:**

   - **Train Support:** 0.0571
   - **Train Confidence:** 0.7146
   - **Train Lift:** 1.4427
   - **Train Leverage:** 0.0217

3. **Third Iteration:**

   - **Train Support:** 0.2743
   - **Train Confidence:** 0.5041
   - **Train Lift:** 1.0173
   - **Train Leverage:** -0.0034

4. **Overall Current Metrics:**

   - **Train Support:** 0.0429
   - **Train Confidence:** 0.7767
   - **Train Lift:** 1.5643
   - **Train Leverage:** 0.0171

---

**Performance Comparison:**

**1. Confidence:**

- **Improvement Observed:** The **current average train confidence** has increased from the reference value of **0.5874** to **0.7767**.
  
  - This indicates that when the rule conditions are met, the likelihood of achieving a high yield has increased substantially.
  
- **Implication:** The higher confidence suggests that the current rules are more reliable in predicting high yields given that their conditions are satisfied.

**2. Lift:**

- **Significant Increase:** The **current average train lift** has risen from **1.1304** (reference) to **1.5643**.
  
  - A lift value significantly greater than 1 indicates a strong association between the rule conditions and the high yield outcome.
  
- **Implication:** The higher lift means that the rule conditions are far more predictive of high yields than random chance, enhancing their usefulness in the catalytic process.

**3. Support:**

- **Decrease Noted:** The **current train support** is **0.0429**, which is lower than the previous averages (**0.1667**, **0.1845**).
  
  - This suggests that while the rules are more confident and have higher lift, they apply to a smaller subset of the data.
  
- **Implication:** The rules may be highly effective but only for a limited number of cases.

**4. Leverage:**

- **Positive Value:** The **current train leverage** is **0.0171**, which is an improvement over the previous negative leverage (-0.0041 in one of the previous metrics).
  
  - Positive leverage indicates that the rules have a stronger association than expected by chance.

---

**Determining Local Minimum and Iteration Sufficiency:**

- **Evidence of Improvement:** The consistent increase in confidence and lift across iterations demonstrates that the rules are improving in their predictive power.
  
- **Diminishing Returns:** However, the incremental gains between iterations may suggest approaching a point of diminishing returns, which could indicate a local minimum.

- **Need for Test Metrics:** Without test set metrics for the current rules, it's difficult to fully assess whether overfitting is occurring or if the improvements generalize beyond the training data.

- **Recommendation:** It may be prudent to perform additional iterations focusing on increasing support while maintaining high confidence and lift or to validate the current rules against a test dataset to ensure that a local minimum hasn't been prematurely accepted.

---

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules:**

1. **Increase Rule Coverage (Support):**

   - **Strategy:** Modify existing rules or create new ones that cover a larger portion of the dataset to increase support without significantly reducing confidence and lift.
     
     - **Example:** Investigate patterns among the cases not currently covered by the rules to identify additional predictive features.

2. **Include Test Metrics Evaluation:**

   - **Action:** Compute the test set metrics for the current rules.
     
     - **Reasoning:** This will help assess the generalization capability of the rules and ensure that the high performance is not limited to the training data.

3. **Assess Overfitting:**

   - **Analysis:** High confidence and lift on training data without corresponding test metrics may indicate potential overfitting.
     
     - **Solution:** Simplify complex rules or remove overly specific conditions that may not generalize well.

4. **Refine Low-Performing Rules:**

   - **Focus:** Identify rules with low or negative leverage and lift close to 1 (e.g., **Rule 3**, **Rule 14**, **Rule 15**).
     
     - **Approach:** Re-evaluate these rules for their contribution to the overall model and consider revising or consolidating them.

5. **Optimize Rule Specificity:**

   - **Balance:** Ensure that rules are neither too broad (decreasing confidence and lift) nor too narrow (reducing support).
     
     - **Method:** Adjust conditions to include relevant cases while filtering out exceptions that negatively impact performance.

6. **Utilize Feature Importance:**

   - **Technique:** Analyze feature importance scores from a complementary model (e.g., decision tree) to identify the most predictive modifiers.
     
     - **Application:** Use this information to refine rule conditions, focusing on the most impactful molecular features.

7. **Consider Interaction Effects:**

   - **Investigation:** Examine potential interactions between different molecular features that could be included in the rules.
     
     - **Implementation:** Develop rules that capture these interactions to improve predictive accuracy.

8. **Consistency Checks:**

   - **Validation:** Verify that the examples and counter-examples provided for each rule are correctly classified according to the current data.
     
     - **Correction:** Address any inconsistencies that may undermine the reliability of the rules.

9. **Documentation and Clarity:**

   - **Enhancement:** Ensure that the rationale behind each rule is clearly articulated and supported by the data.
     
     - **Benefit:** Improves interpretability and facilitates further refinement by other researchers.

10. **Iterative Testing:**

    - **Process:** Continue iterating on rule development, testing changes against both training and test data to monitor performance trends.
      
      - **Goal:** Identify when performance metrics plateau to determine if a local minimum has been reached.

---

**Conclusion:**

The current rules show a significant improvement in confidence and lift compared to the previous metrics, indicating enhanced predictive performance. However, lower support suggests that these rules apply to a smaller portion of the data. To improve the rules further:

- **Aim to increase support** while maintaining high confidence and lift.
- **Validate** the rules using test metrics to ensure generalizability.
- **Refine and optimize** the rules by focusing on their applicability and predictive power.

Continued iterations, incorporating these recommendations, should help in achieving the optimal balance between rule coverage and predictive accuracy, ultimately enhancing the effectiveness of the catalytic problem research program.

**Comments on Accuracies**

The current 5-fold cross-validation accuracy of the classification model is **71.43%**, as obtained in the latest iteration. Comparing this with previous accuracy metrics:

- **Previous Accuracies**:
  - Validation Accuracies ranged from **60%** to **82.86%**.
  - Test Accuracies fluctuated between **62.5%** and **75%**.

While the current validation accuracy of **71.43%** is respectable, it represents a slight decrease from the highest previously observed accuracy of **82.86%**. This suggests that the performance of the model has not consistently improved across iterations and may have reached a plateau or a local minimum.

**Analysis Based on SHAP Values**

To evaluate the effectiveness of the current rules and identify areas for improvement, we examine the SHAP values for molecules where the predicted loading disagrees with the experimental value. Specifically, we focus on cases where:

- **Predicted Loading is High but Experimental Value is Low** (Overestimation).
- **Predicted Loading is Low but Experimental Value is High** (Underestimation).

     - **Rule 10**: +0.00523

**Insights from SHAP Analysis**

- **Rule 8** consistently contributes positively to the high-loading prediction in cases where the experimental value is low, indicating overestimations.
- **Rule 9** shows a significant negative SHAP value for the molecule with an underestimated loading, suggesting underestimations.
- **Rule 3** and **Rule 10** contribute small positive SHAP values but are less significant compared to Rule 8 and Rule 9 in these discrepancies.
- **Rule 4** often has a negative SHAP value but is relatively small in magnitude.

**Assessing Overfitting/Underfitting**

The decrease in validation accuracy from the previous high of **82.86%** to **71.43%** may indicate potential overfitting in earlier iterations or underfitting in the current model. The fluctuations in accuracy suggest that the model's performance is sensitive to the rules applied, and the current set may not generalize well across all data.

**Interpretation of Accuracy Improvements**

Given that the current accuracy does not surpass previous performance and shows discrepancies in predictions, it suggests that further refinement of the rules is necessary. The SHAP analysis highlights specific rules contributing to misclassifications, providing direction for improvement.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

Based on the analysis, the following suggestions aim to refine the current rules to improve model performance:

1. **Re-examine Rule 8**: This rule appears to cause overestimations in several cases where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low.

   - **Current Rule 8**:

     > **Modifiers containing amide or peptide bonds adjacent to the carboxylic acid group tend to give a low yield**.

   - **Observation**: Despite Rule 8 indicating a tendency for low yield when amide or peptide bonds are present adjacent to the carboxyl group, the SHAP values suggest it contributes positively to high-loading predictions for molecules with amide linkages, leading to overestimations.

   - **Recommendation**:

     - **Refine Rule 8 to better capture the influence of amide groups**. Consider adjusting the rule to account for cases where amide or peptide bonds may not significantly reduce the yield or may even contribute to higher yields due to specific structural contexts.
     - **Modify Rule 8** to include exceptions or additional conditions that differentiate between when amide groups lead to high or low yields.

2. **Adjust Rule 9**: The negative SHAP value for Rule 9 in an underestimated case suggests it may be overly penalizing certain structures.

   - **Current Rule 9**:

     > **Modifiers with strongly electron-withdrawing perfluoroalkyl chains attached to the carboxyl group tend to give a low yield**.

   - **Observation**: Rule 9 significantly contributes to underestimating the loading for molecules with perfluorinated chains.

   - **Recommendation**:

     - **Reassess the impact of perfluoroalkyl groups**. Consider that the strong electron-withdrawing effect may not always lead to low yields and that other structural factors could mitigate this effect.
     - **Refine Rule 9** to incorporate additional context, such as the proximity of other coordinating groups or the overall molecular polarity.

3. **Fine-tune Rule 3**: Although the SHAP values for Rule 3 are small, it consistently contributes to misclassifications.

   - **Current Rule 3**:

     > **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents attached to the aromatic ring tend to give a low yield**.

   - **Observation**: Rule 3 contributes positively to high-loading predictions even in molecules where the experimental yield is low.

   - **Recommendation**:

     - **Specify the influence of different electron-donating groups**. Not all electron-donating groups may have the same effect; for example, methoxy groups may differ from alkyl groups.
     - **Consider the position of substituents** on the aromatic ring (ortho, meta, para) and how this affects coordination.

4. **Evaluate Rule 10**: This rule contributes positively to high-loading predictions but may need refinement.

   - **Current Rule 10**:

     > **Modifiers containing aldehyde groups on an aromatic ring or aliphatic chains tend to give a low yield**.

   - **Observation**: Despite indicating a tendency for low yield, Rule 10 contributes to high-loading predictions, which may contribute to overestimations.

   - **Recommendation**:

     - **Clarify the conditions under which aldehyde groups impact yield**. Perhaps the negative effect is more pronounced when aldehyde groups are adjacent to other functional groups.
     - **Adjust Rule 10** to consider the overall molecular environment surrounding the aldehyde group.

5. **Incorporate Additional Structural Factors**:

   - Consider **steric hindrance**, **molecular flexibility**, and **overall polarity** in the rules, as these factors can significantly influence catalytic performance.
   - Introduce new rules or modify existing ones to account for **spatial arrangement** of functional groups, **chelation potential**, and **hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance**.

6. **Address Overfitting/Underfitting**:

   - **Simplify overly complex rules** that may cause overfitting by being too specific to certain molecules in the training set.
   - Ensure that the rules are **general enough** to apply to new, unseen data while capturing key structural features influencing yield.

7. **Iterative Refinement and Evaluation**:

   - After modifying the rules, **re-evaluate the model performance** using cross-validation to assess improvements.
   - Use the **SHAP analysis** in subsequent iterations to monitor the impact of rule adjustments on predictions.

**Conclusion**

The current set of rules provides a solid foundation for predicting the loading of modifiers on catalysts. However, the analysis reveals that certain rules, particularly Rule 8 and Rule 9, may contribute to misclassifications due to their current formulations. By refining these rules to better represent the underlying chemical principles and addressing the identified discrepancies, we can enhance the model's predictive accuracy and generalizability. Continued iterative refinement, guided by SHAP analysis and domain expertise, will be essential in developing a robust model capable of accurately predicting catalyst performance across diverse molecular structures.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

The current task involves refining a set of rules derived from SMILES strings to predict the catalytic performance of modified catalysts in a radical-mediated δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. The primary goal is to optimize and control the yield of this reaction by understanding how different molecular modifiers impact key parameters such as modifier loading on the catalyst, the Fe to Hf fraction, and ultimately the reaction yield.

**Analysis of Current Rule Performance**

The analysis of the current rules, based on the provided metrics and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values, indicates:

- **Improved Confidence and Lift**: The current rules show higher confidence and lift compared to previous iterations, suggesting they are more reliable in predicting high yields when their conditions are met.
- **Low Support**: The current rules apply to a smaller subset of molecules, indicating that while they are effective, they do not cover a significant portion of the data.
- **Accuracy Concerns**: There is fluctuation in validation accuracy across iterations, with the current accuracy of 71.43% being lower than previous highs (e.g., 82.86%). This suggests that the model's performance may be sensitive to the rules applied and may not generalize well.

**SHAP Analysis Feedback**

The SHAP analysis reveals:

- **Overestimations**: Certain rules (especially Rule 8) contribute to predicting high modifier loading in cases where the experimental value is low.
- **Underestimations**: Other rules (particularly Rule 9) may cause underestimation of the modifier loading, leading to low predicted values when the experimental value is high.
- **Inconsistent Rule Contributions**: Some rules contribute positively or negatively in ways that do not align with the experimental outcomes, indicating a need for refinement.

**Suggestions to Improve Current Rules**

1. **Revise Rule 1 SMARTS Patterns**:
   - **Issue**: The SMARTS patterns may not accurately capture α-amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxyl groups or nitrogen-containing heterocycles.
   - **Action**: Modify the patterns to include specific side chains and heterocycles. For example, include patterns for indole rings (`[nH]1ccccc1`) and extra carboxyl groups (`[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]`).

2. **Align SMILES Entries with Rule Examples**:
   - **Issue**: Discrepancies between SMILES entries and rule examples may lead to incorrect labeling.
   - **Action**: Cross-reference the SMILES list with rule entries to ensure consistency and correct indexing.

3. **Update Rule 4 to Separate Functional Groups**:
   - **Issue**: Rule 4 combines thiols and adjacent hydroxyls, which may not be equally effective in enhancing coordination.
   - **Action**: Create separate SMARTS patterns for thiols (`[SX2H]`) and adjacent hydroxyls (`[OX2H][CX4][OX2H]`), allowing more precise identification.

4. **Improve Exclude Pattern Logic**:
   - **Issue**: Current logic may not effectively exclude molecules with undesired functional groups.
   - **Action**: Refine the code to ensure that if any exclude pattern matches, the rule does not apply to that molecule.

5. **Refine Electron-Withdrawing and Donating Group Patterns**:
   - **Issue**: Patterns may not accurately represent these groups on aromatic rings.
   - **Action**: Enhance SMARTS patterns for electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., `[c][N+](=O)[O-]`, `[c][C](=O)[C]`) and electron-donating groups (e.g., `[c][OH]`, `[c][OCH3]`, `[c][CH3]`), increasing specificity.

6. **Add Exception Handling in Rules**:
   - **Issue**: Some rules do not account for known exceptions, leading to misclassifications.
   - **Action**: Incorporate exceptions directly into the rule logic. For example, modify Rule 3 to exclude compounds where the electron-donating group is separated by an aliphatic chain.

7. **Validate and Test SMARTS Patterns Individually**:
   - **Issue**: Potential errors in pattern definitions may lead to incorrect matches.
   - **Action**: Test each SMARTS pattern against a set of molecules to ensure they match intended functional groups accurately.

8. **Enhance Rule 6 Chain Length Detection**:
   - **Issue**: The pattern may not dynamically detect chain lengths between C6 and C8.
   - **Action**: Use quantifiers in SMARTS (e.g., `{4,6}`) to specify the number of carbon atoms, accounting for variations in chain length.

9. **Integrate Logical Operators Correctly**:
   - **Issue**: Logical combinations in patterns may not be correctly applied.
   - **Action**: Ensure that patterns are correctly combined using logical OR (`|`) and AND (`&`) where appropriate.

10. **Improve Code Documentation and Readability**:
    - **Issue**: Lack of comments may hinder understanding and maintenance.
    - **Action**: Add comments explaining each SMARTS pattern and the reasoning behind it, facilitating future updates.

11. **Re-Examine Rule 8**:
    - **Issue**: Rule 8 may cause overestimations by contributing positively to high-loading predictions in molecules where the experimental yield is low.
    - **Action**: Refine Rule 8 to better capture the influence of amide groups, possibly by adjusting conditions or adding exceptions.

12. **Adjust Rule 9**:
    - **Issue**: Rule 9 may overly penalize certain structures, leading to underestimations.
    - **Action**: Reassess the impact of perfluoroalkyl groups and refine the rule to consider the overall molecular context.

13. **Fine-Tune Rule 3**:
    - **Issue**: Rule 3 may not account for variations in the influence of different electron-donating groups.
    - **Action**: Specify the effects of various electron-donating groups and consider the positions of substituents on the aromatic ring.

14. **Evaluate Rule 10**:
    - **Issue**: Rule 10 contributes to high-loading predictions despite indicating a tendency for low yield.
    - **Action**: Clarify the conditions under which aldehyde groups impact yield and adjust the rule accordingly.

15. **Incorporate Additional Structural Factors**:
    - **Issue**: Important factors like steric hindrance, molecular flexibility, and overall polarity may be overlooked.
    - **Action**: Introduce rules or modify existing ones to account for these factors.

**Possibility for Further Optimization without Overfitting**

Yes, there is potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. The suggestions provided aim to refine the rules by:

- **Improving Specificity**: Enhancing SMARTS patterns to more accurately capture relevant functional groups and molecular features.
- **Increasing Support**: Modifying rules to cover a larger portion of the dataset while maintaining high confidence and lift.
- **Avoiding Overfitting**: Generalizing rules where appropriate and incorporating exceptions to prevent rules from being overly specific to the training data.
- **Validating Changes**: Continuously testing the impact of rule adjustments on both training and test datasets to ensure generalizability.

By addressing the identified issues and implementing the suggested improvements, the rules can become more effective and reliable predictors of catalytic performance.

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxyl groups or nitrogen-containing heterocycles (e.g., indole rings)** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Extra carboxyl groups and nitrogen heterocycles enhance metal coordination through multiple binding sites, stabilizing the catalyst and improving efficiency.

   - **Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Entry 0) – High Yield (Glutamic acid; additional carboxylate group)
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Entry 2) – High Yield (Aspartic acid; additional carboxylate group)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Entry 14) – High Yield (Tryptophan; indole nitrogen)

   - **Counter-Example**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Entry 12) – Low Yield (Phenylalanine; lacks additional coordinating groups)

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., nitro, halogen, ketone groups) directly attached to the aromatic ring** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylate, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers and stabilize the catalyst.

   - **Examples**:
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Entry 1) – High Yield (Bromomethyl group)
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Entry 20) – High Yield (Nitro group)
     - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Entry 16) – High Yield (Ketone groups within the fused ring)

   - **Counter-Example**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 22) – Low Yield (Methyl group is electron-donating)

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxyl groups) attached to the aromatic ring** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylate, weakening metal coordination and reducing catalyst effectiveness.

   - **Examples**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 22) – Low Yield (Methyl substituent)
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30) – Low Yield (Hydroxyl group)
     - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Entry 26) – Low Yield (Hydroxyl group)

   - **Exception**:
     - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Entry 7) – High Yield (Hydroxyphenyl group separated by an aliphatic chain, reducing electron-donating effect on the carboxylate)

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers containing **additional coordinating functional groups such as thiols or multiple adjacent hydroxyls near the carboxylate group** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: These functional groups can chelate the metal center, forming more stable complexes and enhancing catalytic activity.

   - **Examples**:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 17) – High Yield (Thiol group enhances coordination)
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Entry 9) – High Yield (Multiple hydroxyls for chelation)

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating nitrogen atoms in positions favorable for metal binding (e.g., ortho or para to the carboxyl group)** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in the ring can serve as additional coordination sites, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and catalyst performance.

   - **Examples**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Entry 21) – High Yield (Nitrogen atom adjacent to carboxyl group)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 15) – High Yield (Pyrazole ring with coordinating nitrogen)

   - **Counter-Example**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 11) – Low Yield (Pyridyl group may not effectively coordinate due to steric factors or unfavorable positioning)

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (C6–C8) without additional functional groups** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: The optimal chain length balances hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst surface and effective metal coordination through the carboxylate group.

   - **Example**:
     - **Octanoic acid** (Entry 5) – High Yield (Eight-carbon chain)

   - **Counter-Examples**:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Entry 29) – Low Yield (Hydroxyl group may interfere with coordination)
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Entry 31) – Low Yield (Amino group may introduce unfavorable interactions)

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing **flexible polar chains with ether linkages or multiple amine groups** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Ether oxygens and amine groups may not coordinate effectively with metal centers and can increase solubility in the solvent, reducing interaction with the catalyst surface.

   - **Examples**:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 10) – Low Yield (Multiple ether linkages)
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32) – Low Yield (Flexible ether-containing chain with amine group)

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **amide or peptide bonds adjacent to the carboxylic acid group** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Amide groups can reduce coordination ability due to resonance delocalization of the lone pair on nitrogen, altering binding geometry and weakening metal interaction.

   - **Examples**:
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 33) – Low Yield (Acetamido group adjacent to carboxylate)
     - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** (Entry 26) – Low Yield (Amide linkage affects coordination)

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **strongly electron-withdrawing perfluoroalkyl chains attached to the carboxyl group** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Perfluoroalkyl groups significantly decrease electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, hindering effective metal coordination.

   - **Example**:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Entry 13) – Low Yield (Perfluorinated chain)

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing **aldehyde groups on an aromatic ring, especially when adjacent to coordinating groups like hydroxyls, or on aliphatic chains** tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Aldehyde groups may interfere with metal coordination or participate in side reactions, reducing catalyst effectiveness.

    - **Examples**:
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 18) – Low Yield (Aldehyde and hydroxyl groups may chelate unfavorably)
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19) – Low Yield (Aldehyde group adjacent to carboxylate)
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Entry 27) – Low Yield (Aldehyde group on aliphatic chain)

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **dicarboxylic acids or polycarboxylic acids with carboxyl groups separated by a short linker** tend to give a **high yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Multiple carboxylate groups can coordinate simultaneously with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability through chelation.

    - **Examples**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Entry 0) – High Yield (Dicarboxylic acid)
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Entry 2) – High Yield (Dicarboxylic acid)
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Entry 27) – Low Yield (Exception due to ketone interference)

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids fused with additional carbonyl groups within the ring structure** tend to give a **high yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Additional carbonyl groups can participate in resonance stabilization and metal coordination, enhancing catalytic activity.

    - **Example**:
      - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Entry 16) – High Yield (Fused ketone groups)

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **non-coordinating bulky or hydrophobic side chains near the carboxyl group** tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Bulky side chains may cause steric hindrance, and hydrophobic groups may reduce effective interaction with the metal center.

    - **Examples**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Entry 12) – Low Yield (Phenyl group is bulky and non-coordinating)
      - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (Entry 25) – High Yield (Exception due to ketone enhancing coordination)

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids containing hydroxyl or amino groups distant from the carboxylate** tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: While polar, these groups may not effectively coordinate due to distance from the carboxylate and can introduce solubility issues or interfere with catalyst binding.

    - **Examples**:
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Entry 29) – Low Yield (Hydroxyl group distant from carboxylate)
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Entry 34) – Low Yield (Amino group distant from carboxylate)

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers with **polyether chains or multiple flexible linkages increasing conformational freedom** tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Increased flexibility can reduce effective binding to the catalyst surface and decrease metal coordination efficiency.

    - **Examples**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 10) – Low Yield (Polyether chain)
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32) – Low Yield (Flexible ether-containing chain)

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Revise Rule 1 SMARTS Patterns to Accurately Capture Target Modifiers**

  - **Action**: Modify the SMARTS patterns in Rule 1 to include side chains with additional carboxyl groups and nitrogen-containing heterocycles such as indole rings.
    - **Include Patterns**:
      - Additional carboxyl groups in side chains: `[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]` adjacent to the α-carbon.
      - Indole ring: `[nH]1cccc2c1cccc2` or simplified as `[nH]1ccccc1` for the indole nitrogen.
    - **Revised SMARTS Pattern Example**:
      - `'[NX3;H2][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` (for α-amino acids) AND (`[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]` OR `[nH]1ccccc1` in side chain).

- **Advice 2**: **Ensure Consistency Between SMILES Entries and Rule Examples**

  - **Action**: Cross-reference the SMILES entries in the dataset with the rule examples and counter-examples to verify that the correct molecules are associated with each rule.
    - **Steps**:
      - Match each SMILES string to its corresponding molecule name and entry number.
      - Confirm that the examples provided in each rule correspond to the correct entries in the dataset.
      - Update any mismatches in the indices or molecule names.

- **Advice 3**: **Separate Rule 4 into Distinct Rules for Thiols and Multiple Hydroxyls**

  - **Action**: Split Rule 4 into two separate rules to distinguish between the effects of thiol groups and multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups.
    - **Rule for Thiol Groups**:
      - **SMARTS Pattern**: `[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CX4][CX4][SX2H]`
      - **Rationale**: Thiol groups enhance coordination through sulfur, which can chelate the metal center.
    - **Rule for Multiple Adjacent Hydroxyls**:
      - **SMARTS Pattern**: `[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CX4]([OX2H])[CX4]([OX2H])`
      - **Rationale**: Multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxylate can form chelates with the metal center.

- **Advice 4**: **Improve Exclude Pattern Logic in Rule Application**

  - **Action**: Refine the code logic so that the presence of any exclude pattern prevents the rule from applying to a molecule.
    - **Implementation**:
      - Use logical AND (`&`) operations to ensure that the rule's include patterns apply only when none of the exclude patterns are present.
      - For example, in the code:
        ```python
        if include_pattern.match(molecule) and not exclude_pattern.match(molecule):
            # Apply rule
        ```
      - Ensure all exclude patterns are tested, and if any match, the rule is not applied.

- **Advice 5**: **Enhance SMARTS Patterns for Electron-Withdrawing and Electron-Donating Groups**

  - **Action**: Update the SMARTS patterns in Rule 2 and Rule 3 to more accurately capture electron-withdrawing and electron-donating substituents on aromatic rings.
    - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups** (Rule 2):
      - **Patterns**:
        - Nitro groups: `[c][N+](=O)[O-]`
        - Halogens: `[c][F,Cl,Br,I]`
        - Carbonyl groups: `[c][CX3](=O)`
      - **Revised Rule**: Aromatic carboxylic acids with these substituents directly attached to the ring tend to give high yield.
    - **Electron-Donating Groups** (Rule 3):
      - **Patterns**:
        - Hydroxyl groups: `[c][OH]`
        - Methoxy groups: `[c][OCH3]`
        - Methyl groups: `[c][CH3]`
      - **Revised Rule**: Aromatic carboxylic acids with these substituents attached to the ring tend to give low yield.

- **Advice 6**: **Incorporate Exception Handling into Rules to Account for Known Outliers**

  - **Action**: Modify rules to include exceptions where certain structural features override the general trend.
    - **Example**:
      - In Rule 3 (electron-donating groups leading to low yield), add an exception for cases where the electron-donating group is separated from the aromatic ring by an aliphatic chain, reducing its electron-donating effect.
      - **Implementation**:
        - Add an exclusion in the rule's logic for molecules where the substituent is not directly attached to the ring.

- **Advice 7**: **Individually Validate and Test Each SMARTS Pattern**

  - **Action**: Test each SMARTS pattern against known molecules to ensure they accurately identify the intended functional groups.
    - **Steps**:
      - Compile a list of molecules with known functional groups that should match each pattern.
      - Use cheminformatics tools (e.g., RDKit) to apply the SMARTS patterns.
      - Verify that the patterns match the correct molecules and do not match unintended ones.
      - Adjust patterns as necessary based on testing results.

- **Advice 8**: **Improve Chain Length Detection in Rule 6 Using Quantifiers**

  - **Action**: Use SMARTS quantifiers to specify the desired carbon chain lengths in aliphatic carboxylic acids.
    - **SMARTS Pattern**: `[CH3][CH2]{4,6}[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]`
      - This pattern matches aliphatic carboxylic acids with carbon chains of 6 to 8 carbons (including the carboxyl carbon).
    - **Rationale**: Ensures that the rule specifically targets medium-chain aliphatic acids associated with high yield.

- **Advice 9**: **Ensure Correct Use of Logical Operators in SMARTS Patterns**

  - **Action**: Review and correct the use of logical OR (`|`) and AND (`;`) operators in SMARTS patterns to accurately combine conditions.
    - **Implementation**:
      - Use parentheses to group conditions when necessary.
      - For example, to match an aromatic ring with either a nitro or halogen substituent:
        - `[cH]1[cH][cH][cH][cH][cH]1[c](=[O])[O;H]` AND (`[c][N+](=O)[O-]` OR `[c][F,Cl,Br,I]`)
      - Ensure that the overall logic reflects the intended chemical reasoning.

- **Advice 10**: **Enhance Code Documentation and Readability**

  - **Action**: Add clear comments and explanations to the code detailing the purpose and rationale behind each SMARTS pattern and rule.
    - **Implementation**:
      - Before each pattern definition, include a comment explaining what the pattern matches and why.
      - Document the reasoning for include and exclude patterns.
      - Provide examples of molecules that match or do not match each pattern.

- **Advice 11**: **Refine Rule 8 to Better Capture the Influence of Amide Groups**

  - **Action**: Adjust Rule 8 to account for the possible resonance delocalization in amide groups that can affect metal coordination.
    - **Considerations**:
      - Amide groups may not always reduce coordination ability; the impact depends on their position relative to the carboxyl group.
      - **Revised SMARTS Pattern**: Focus on amides directly adjacent to the carboxyl group: `[CX3](=O)[NX3][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]`
      - **Add Exceptions**: Identify cases where amide groups do not interfere significantly and adjust the rule accordingly.

- **Advice 12**: **Reassess Rule 9 Regarding Perfluoroalkyl Chains**

  - **Action**: Refine Rule 9 to consider the overall molecular context of perfluoroalkyl groups.
    - **Implementation**:
      - Determine if perfluoroalkyl chains always hinder metal coordination or if there are exceptions.
      - Modify the rule to apply only when the perfluoroalkyl group is directly attached to the carboxyl group.
      - **SMARTS Pattern**: `[CX3](C(F)(F)F)(F)(F)[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]`

- **Advice 13**: **Fine-Tune Rule 3 to Account for Substituent Position and Type**

  - **Action**: Specify the influence of different electron-donating groups and their positions on the aromatic ring.
    - **Implementation**:
      - Differentiate between ortho, meta, and para positions relative to the carboxyl group.
      - Recognize that substituents in certain positions may have a greater effect on electron donation.
      - Update SMARTS patterns to reflect positional specificity.

- **Advice 14**: **Evaluate and Adjust Rule 10 on Aldehyde Groups**

  - **Action**: Clarify the conditions under which aldehyde groups impact yield and adjust Rule 10 accordingly.
    - **Considerations**:
      - Determine if the aldehyde group participates in side reactions or interferes with metal coordination.
      - Modify the rule to specify the impact of aldehyde groups when adjacent to coordinating groups.
      - **SMARTS Pattern**: `[CX3H1](=O)[c][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]`

- **Advice 15**: **Incorporate Additional Structural Factors into the Rules**

  - **Action**: Modify existing rules or introduce new ones to account for steric hindrance, molecular flexibility, and overall polarity.
    - **Implementation**:
      - Identify molecular features that contribute to steric hindrance, such as bulky groups near the coordination sites.
      - Consider the effect of long flexible chains that may reduce effective binding.
      - Add patterns or adjust rules to account for these factors, improving predictive accuracy.

** End of Advice **
---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxyl groups or nitrogen-containing heterocycles (e.g., indole rings)** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Extra carboxylate groups and nitrogen heterocycles enhance metal coordination through chelation, stabilizing the catalyst and improving efficiency.

   - **Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid; additional carboxylate group)
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid; additional carboxylate group)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan; indole nitrogen)

   - **Counter-Example**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine; lacks additional coordinating groups) – Low Yield

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., nitro, halogens) directly attached to the aromatic ring** tend to give a **high yield**, whereas those with **electron-donating substituents (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxyl groups)** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylate, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity, weakening metal coordination.

   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Bromomethyl group)
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Nitro group)
   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Methyl group is electron-donating)
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Hydroxyl group is electron-donating)

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating nitrogen atoms in positions favorable for metal binding (e.g., adjacent to the carboxyl group)** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in the ring can serve as additional coordination sites, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and catalyst performance.

   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nitrogen atom adjacent to carboxyl group)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Pyrazole ring with coordinating nitrogen)
   - **Low Yield Counter-Example**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Pyridyl group may not effectively coordinate due to unfavorable positioning)

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-chain lengths (C6–C8) and no additional polar functional groups** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: The optimal chain length facilitates hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst surface while the carboxylate group effectively coordinates with the metal center.

   - **High Yield Example**:
     - **Octanoic acid** (Eight-carbon chain)
   - **Low Yield Counter-Example**:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Presence of amino group may interfere with coordination)

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing **additional coordinating functional groups such as thiols or multiple adjacent hydroxyls near the carboxylate group** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: These functional groups can chelate the metal center, forming more stable complexes and enhancing catalytic activity.

   - **Examples**:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Thiol group enhances coordination)
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Multiple hydroxyls for chelation)

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids fused with additional carbonyl groups within the ring structure** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Additional carbonyl groups can participate in resonance stabilization and metal coordination, enhancing catalytic activity.

   - **Example**:
     - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Fused ketone groups)

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing **functional groups that hinder metal coordination, such as aldehyde groups adjacent to the carboxylate, amide bonds near the carboxylate, or strongly electron-withdrawing perfluoroalkyl groups**, tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Aldehydes may interfere with coordination or participate in side reactions; amide groups can reduce coordination ability due to resonance delocalization; perfluoroalkyl groups excessively decrease electron density on the carboxylate oxygen.

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Aldehyde group adjacent to carboxylate)
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Amide group adjacent to carboxylate)
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Perfluorinated chain)

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers with **bulky, non-coordinating substituents near the carboxylate group**, such as **aromatic rings without additional coordinating groups**, tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Bulky groups can introduce steric hindrance, reducing the effectiveness of metal coordination and catalyst performance.

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine; bulky phenyl group)
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Bulky aromatic ring with electron-donating hydroxyl group)

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **flexible polar chains with ether linkages (polyether chains) or multiple amino groups** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Ether oxygens and amino groups may not coordinate effectively and can increase solubility in the solvent, reducing interaction with the catalyst surface.

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Multiple ether linkages)
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Flexible ether-containing chain with amino group)

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **long aliphatic chains containing polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl or amino groups) distant from the carboxylate** tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Polar groups far from the carboxylate may not effectively participate in metal coordination and can interfere with catalyst interaction or solubility.

    - **Low Yield Examples**:
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Hydroxyl group distant from carboxylate)
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Amino group distant from carboxylate)

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **linear dicarboxylic acids without additional interfering functional groups may give variable yields depending on chain length**, with shorter chains potentially giving a **high yield** and longer or more substituted chains giving a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Two carboxylate groups can enhance coordination, but longer chains or additional groups may introduce steric hindrance or alter coordination geometry.

    - **High Yield Potential**:
      - **Modifiers with short dicarboxylic chains (e.g., succinic acid)**
    - **Low Yield Example**:
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Ketone group may interfere with coordination)

**End of Rules**
---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows for straightforward determination of high-yield modifiers when they are **α-amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxyl groups or nitrogen-containing heterocycles**. It provides excellent property insight by linking the presence of chelating groups to enhanced metal coordination. The rule considers combinations of substructures (amino acid backbone and specific side chains) and is well-supported by multiple data points (entries 0, 2, and 14 with high yield; entry 12 as a counter-example). The balance between complexity and coverage is effective.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear in its distinction between **electron-withdrawing and electron-donating substituents** on aromatic carboxylic acids, leading to high or low yields, respectively. The property insight is solid, explaining how substituents influence acidity and coordination ability. The rule combines substructures (aromatic ring, carboxylate, and substituents) and is backed by several data points (entries 1 and 20 for high yield; entries 22 and 30 for low yield). The balance between complexity and coverage is well-maintained.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 provides a clear description of **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating nitrogen atoms in favorable positions**, leading to high yield. The property insight is appropriate, highlighting the role of nitrogen atoms in metal coordination. It considers positional isomerism, and is supported by data (entries 15 and 21 with high yield; entry 11 as a counter-example). The rule balances complexity and coverage effectively.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear regarding **aliphatic carboxylic acids of medium chain length (C6–C8) without additional polar functional groups** leading to high yield. However, the coverage is limited, with only one high-yield example (entry 5) and a counter-example (entry 31). The rule lacks sufficient data points to strongly support it. The balance between complexity and coverage could be improved to enhance its reliability.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear and relates modifiers with **additional coordinating functional groups such as thiols or multiple adjacent hydroxyls near the carboxylate** to high yield. The property insight is sound, focusing on chelation enhancing metal coordination. The rule combines substructures effectively and is supported by data (entries 9 and 17 with high yield). The balance between complexity and coverage is acceptable.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is specific but may lack clarity due to its narrow focus on **aromatic carboxylic acids fused with additional carbonyl groups within the ring structure**. The coverage is limited, with only one supporting data point (entry 16). Therefore, the rule may not be well-supported by the data, and the balance between complexity and coverage is suboptimal.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear in identifying **functional groups that hinder metal coordination**, predicting low-yield modifiers accordingly. The property insight is valid, explaining how certain groups interfere with coordination. It considers combinations of substructures and is supported by multiple data points (entries 13, 19, and 33 with low yield). The balance between complexity and coverage is good.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 lacks clarity due to its broad definition of **"bulky, non-coordinating substituents near the carboxylate group"**. It may not consistently predict yields, as there is a high-yield example (entry 7) that contradicts the rule. The coverage is inconsistent, and the balance between complexity and coverage could be improved to avoid contradictions.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear regarding modifiers with **flexible polar chains with ether linkages or multiple amino groups** leading to low yield. The property insight is appropriate, focusing on decreased catalyst interaction. It considers combinations of substructures and is supported by data (entries 10 and 32 with low yield). The balance between complexity and coverage is acceptable.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 clearly states that modifiers with **long aliphatic chains containing polar groups distant from the carboxylate** result in low yield. The property insight is reasonable, explaining how distant polar groups may not aid coordination and could interfere with catalyst interaction. It is supported by data (entries 29 and 34 with low yield). The balance between complexity and coverage is good.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is ambiguous, stating that modifiers **may give variable yields depending on chain length**, with no clear guidelines. The coverage is limited, with only one low-yield example (entry 27) and no high-yield examples. The rule lacks clarity, sufficient data support, and the balance between complexity and coverage is poor.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxyl groups or nitrogen-containing heterocycles (e.g., indole rings)** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Extra carboxylate groups and nitrogen heterocycles enhance metal coordination through chelation, stabilizing the catalyst and improving efficiency.

   - **Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid; additional carboxylate group)
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid; additional carboxylate group)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan; indole nitrogen)

   - **Counter-Example**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine; lacks additional coordinating groups) – Low Yield

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., nitro, halogens) directly attached to the aromatic ring** tend to give a **high yield**, whereas those with **electron-donating substituents (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxyl groups)** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylate, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity, weakening metal coordination.

   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Bromomethyl group)
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Nitro group)
   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Methyl group is electron-donating)
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Hydroxyl group is electron-donating)

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating nitrogen atoms in positions favorable for metal binding (e.g., adjacent to the carboxyl group)** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in the ring can serve as additional coordination sites, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and catalyst performance.

   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nitrogen atom adjacent to carboxyl group)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Pyrazole ring with coordinating nitrogen)
   - **Low Yield Counter-Example**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Pyridyl group may not effectively coordinate due to unfavorable positioning)

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-chain lengths (C6–C8) and no additional polar functional groups** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: The optimal chain length facilitates hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst surface while the carboxylate group effectively coordinates with the metal center.

   - **High Yield Example**:
     - **Octanoic acid** (Eight-carbon chain)
   - **Low Yield Counter-Example**:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Presence of amino group may interfere with coordination)

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing **additional coordinating functional groups such as thiols or multiple adjacent hydroxyls near the carboxylate group** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: These functional groups can chelate the metal center, forming more stable complexes and enhancing catalytic activity.

   - **Examples**:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Thiol group enhances coordination)
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Multiple hydroxyls for chelation)

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids fused with additional carbonyl groups within the ring structure** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Additional carbonyl groups can participate in resonance stabilization and metal coordination, enhancing catalytic activity.

   - **Example**:
     - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Fused ketone groups)

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing **functional groups that hinder metal coordination, such as aldehyde groups adjacent to the carboxylate, amide bonds near the carboxylate, or strongly electron-withdrawing perfluoroalkyl groups**, tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Aldehydes may interfere with coordination or participate in side reactions; amide groups can reduce coordination ability due to resonance delocalization; perfluoroalkyl groups excessively decrease electron density on the carboxylate oxygen.

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Aldehyde group adjacent to carboxylate)
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Amide group adjacent to carboxylate)
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Perfluorinated chain)

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers with **bulky, non-coordinating substituents near the carboxylate group**, such as **aromatic rings without additional coordinating groups**, tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Bulky groups can introduce steric hindrance, reducing the effectiveness of metal coordination and catalyst performance.

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine; bulky phenyl group)
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Bulky aromatic ring with electron-donating hydroxyl group)

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **flexible polar chains with ether linkages (polyether chains) or multiple amino groups** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Ether oxygens and amino groups may not coordinate effectively and can increase solubility in the solvent, reducing interaction with the catalyst surface.

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Multiple ether linkages)
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Flexible ether-containing chain with amino group)

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **long aliphatic chains containing polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl or amino groups) distant from the carboxylate** tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Polar groups far from the carboxylate may not effectively participate in metal coordination and can interfere with catalyst interaction or solubility.

    - **Low Yield Examples**:
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Hydroxyl group distant from carboxylate)
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Amino group distant from carboxylate)

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **linear dicarboxylic acids without additional interfering functional groups may give variable yields depending on chain length**, with shorter chains potentially giving a **high yield** and longer or more substituted chains giving a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Two carboxylate groups can enhance coordination, but longer chains or additional groups may introduce steric hindrance or alter coordination geometry.

    - **High Yield Potential**:
      - **Modifiers with short dicarboxylic chains (e.g., succinic acid)**
    - **Low Yield Example**:
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Ketone group may interfere with coordination)

Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: **Modify the 'hydroxyl_group' SMARTS pattern to exclude hydroxyl groups that are part of carboxylic acids.** Currently, the pattern `'[OX2H]'` matches any hydroxyl group, including those in carboxylic acids. To prevent this, adjust the pattern to exclude hydroxyls bound to carbonyl carbons. Use the pattern `'[OX2H][#6;!$(C=O)]'`, which matches hydroxyl groups attached to carbons that are not part of a carbonyl group.

- **Suggestion 2**: **In Rule 6, ensure that the 'thiol' or 'hydroxyl_group' is adjacent to the carboxylic acid group.** The natural language rule specifies that these functional groups should be near the carboxylate group to enhance chelation. Modify the code to check for adjacency between the carboxylic acid and the thiol or hydroxyl groups. This can be done by defining a SMARTS pattern that matches a carboxylic acid connected to a carbon bearing the thiol or hydroxyl group.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Adjust the 'hydroxyl_group' count in Rule 6 to consider adjacency and multiplicity correctly.** Instead of simply counting any two hydroxyl groups, modify the code to look for multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups (vicinal diols) near the carboxylate group. Use a SMARTS pattern like `'[C;!$(C=O)]([OX2H])[C;!$(C=O)]([OX2H])'` to detect vicinal diols.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Exclude carboxylic acid hydroxyls from being counted in the 'hydroxyl_on_aromatic' pattern in Rule 3.** Similar to Suggestion 1, ensure that hydroxyl groups counted as electron-donating substituents are not part of carboxylic acids. Adjust the pattern `'[c][OX2H]'` to `'[c][OX2H;!$(O=C[O])]'` to exclude carboxylic acid hydroxyls.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Refine the 'no_polar_groups' condition in Rule 5 to accurately detect the presence of polar functional groups.** Currently, the code checks for any occurrence of polar groups, which might miss some functional groups or incorrectly include others. Expand the list of polar groups and ensure comprehensive detection by including additional patterns for amines, amides, hydroxyls, thiols, and ethers.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Implement checks for chain length and functional group absence in aliphatic chains for Rule 5 correctly.** Ensure that the code accurately calculates the longest carbon chain length and confirms the absence of polar groups along that chain. Use RDKit's `Chem.rdMolDescriptors.CalcMolFormula` and `Chem.rdchem.Mol.GetNumAtoms()` functions to aid in this process.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Add explicit handling for ring structures and fused ring systems in Rules 1, 3, and 6.** For modifiers involving aromatic or heteroaromatic rings with coordinating atoms, ensure that the SMARTS patterns accurately capture the specific ring positions and substitutions as described in the rules.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Include additional SMARTS patterns for functional groups mentioned in the rules but not present in the code.** For example, in Rule 7, patterns for perfluoroalkyl groups should be comprehensive enough to detect various lengths of fluorinated chains. Expand the 'perfluoroalkyl' pattern to cover more cases.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Review and correct the numbering and naming of the rules in the code to match the natural language rules.** Ensure consistency between the rule numbers in the code, the feature matrix columns, and the original rules to avoid confusion during analysis.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Add comments and documentation within the code for clarity.** Provide explanations for each SMARTS pattern and the logic behind each rule implementation. This will make the code easier to understand and maintain.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxyl groups or nitrogen-containing heterocycles (e.g., indole rings)** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Extra carboxylate groups and nitrogen heterocycles enhance metal coordination through chelation, stabilizing the catalyst and improving efficiency.

   - **Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid; additional carboxylate group)
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid; additional carboxylate group)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan; indole nitrogen)

   - **Counter-Example**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine; lacks additional coordinating groups) – Low Yield

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., nitro, halogens) directly attached to the aromatic ring** tend to give a **high yield**, whereas those with **electron-donating substituents (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxyl groups)** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylate, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity, weakening metal coordination.

   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Bromomethyl group)
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Nitro group)
   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Methyl group is electron-donating)
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Hydroxyl group is electron-donating)

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating nitrogen atoms in positions favorable for metal binding (e.g., adjacent to the carboxyl group)** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in the ring can serve as additional coordination sites, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and catalyst performance.

   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nitrogen atom adjacent to carboxyl group)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Pyrazole ring with coordinating nitrogen)
   - **Low Yield Counter-Example**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Pyridyl group may not effectively coordinate due to unfavorable positioning)

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-chain lengths (C6–C8) and no additional polar functional groups** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: The optimal chain length facilitates hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst surface while the carboxylate group effectively coordinates with the metal center.

   - **High Yield Example**:
     - **Octanoic acid** (Eight-carbon chain)
   - **Low Yield Counter-Example**:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Presence of amino group may interfere with coordination)

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing **additional coordinating functional groups such as thiols or multiple adjacent hydroxyls near the carboxylate group** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: These functional groups can chelate the metal center, forming more stable complexes and enhancing catalytic activity.

   - **Examples**:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Thiol group enhances coordination)
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Multiple hydroxyls for chelation)

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids fused with additional carbonyl groups within the ring structure** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Additional carbonyl groups can participate in resonance stabilization and metal coordination, enhancing catalytic activity.

   - **Example**:
     - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Fused ketone groups)

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing **functional groups that hinder metal coordination, such as aldehyde groups adjacent to the carboxylate, amide bonds near the carboxylate, or strongly electron-withdrawing perfluoroalkyl groups**, tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Aldehydes may interfere with coordination or participate in side reactions; amide groups can reduce coordination ability due to resonance delocalization; perfluoroalkyl groups excessively decrease electron density on the carboxylate oxygen.

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Aldehyde group adjacent to carboxylate)
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Amide group adjacent to carboxylate)
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Perfluorinated chain)

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers with **bulky, non-coordinating substituents near the carboxylate group**, such as **aromatic rings without additional coordinating groups**, tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Bulky groups can introduce steric hindrance, reducing the effectiveness of metal coordination and catalyst performance.

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine; bulky phenyl group)
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Bulky aromatic ring with electron-donating hydroxyl group)

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **flexible polar chains with ether linkages (polyether chains) or multiple amino groups** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Ether oxygens and amino groups may not coordinate effectively and can increase solubility in the solvent, reducing interaction with the catalyst surface.

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Multiple ether linkages)
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Flexible ether-containing chain with amino group)

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **long aliphatic chains containing polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl or amino groups) distant from the carboxylate** tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Polar groups far from the carboxylate may not effectively participate in metal coordination and can interfere with catalyst interaction or solubility.

    - **Low Yield Examples**:
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Hydroxyl group distant from carboxylate)
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Amino group distant from carboxylate)

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **linear dicarboxylic acids without additional interfering functional groups may give variable yields depending on chain length**, with shorter chains potentially giving a **high yield** and longer or more substituted chains giving a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Two carboxylate groups can enhance coordination, but longer chains or additional groups may introduce steric hindrance or alter coordination geometry.

    - **High Yield Potential**:
      - **Modifiers with short dicarboxylic chains (e.g., succinic acid)**
    - **Low Yield Example**:
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Ketone group may interfere with coordination)

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: The code does not correctly implement the logical combinations specified in the rules' "logic" fields. For example, in **Rule 1**, the code checks if all patterns match simultaneously (`alpha_amino_acid` **and** `additional_carboxyl` **and** `nitrogen_heterocycle`), whereas the rule's logic is `alpha_amino_acid` **and** (`additional_carboxyl` **or** `nitrogen_heterocycle`). The code should be modified to correctly interpret and apply the logical operators (`and`, `or`) according to each rule's logic statement.

- **Suggestion 2**: Introduce a function to evaluate the logical expressions for each rule. You can represent the logic using Boolean algebra or create a parser that understands the logical syntax defined in the "logic" field. This function should be able to handle combinations of `and`, `or`, and parentheses to accurately reflect the intended rule logic.

- **Suggestion 3**: Modify the pattern matching code to store the results of each individual pattern match and then combine these results according to the rule's logic. For example, for **Rule 1**, you can perform individual substructure searches for `alpha_amino_acid`, `additional_carboxyl`, and `nitrogen_heterocycle`, store their Boolean results, and then evaluate `alpha_amino_acid and (additional_carboxyl or nitrogen_heterocycle)`.

- **Suggestion 4**: Update the patterns to ensure they accurately represent the chemical features described in the rules. For instance, in **Rule 2**, the pattern for electron-withdrawing substituents (`[c][F,Cl,Br,I,N+]`) may not capture all relevant groups such as nitro groups. Modify the pattern to include nitro groups by adding `[c][N+](=O)[O-]` or by using a more general pattern that captures other electron-withdrawing groups like cyano (`-C#N`), carbonyls (`-C(=O)R`), and sulfonyls (`-S(=O)_2R`).

- **Suggestion 5**: For **Rule 2**, consider creating separate patterns for high-yield and low-yield modifiers based on the substituents. Add a rule for electron-donating groups directly attached to the aromatic ring (e.g., `[c][OH,CH3,OCH3,NH2]`) with a prediction of `-1` to capture the low-yield cases.

- **Suggestion 6**: Check all SMARTS patterns for syntactical correctness and chemical validity. Ensure that each pattern corresponds accurately to the chemical feature it is intended to represent. For example, review patterns like `[CX3](=O)[OX1H]` to confirm they appropriately match carboxylic acid groups.

- **Suggestion 7**: Expand the patterns to cover tautomeric and resonance forms where applicable. Some functional groups may exist in different resonance structures or tautomeric forms that the current patterns might not capture. Use RDKit's tautomer enumeration or adjust SMARTS patterns to be more inclusive.

- **Suggestion 8**: Incorporate more comprehensive patterns for heterocycles in **Rule 1** and **Rule 3**. Instead of a simple `[n]` for any nitrogen heterocycle, specify patterns for common nitrogen-containing rings (e.g., indole, pyridine, pyrazole) to improve specificity.

- **Suggestion 9**: For rules involving chain lengths (e.g., **Rule 4**, **Rule 10**), modify the patterns to use variable repetition counts rather than fixed chain lengths. Use SMARTS syntax to specify ranges (e.g., `[CH2]` repeated `{4,6}` times for chain lengths C6–C8) to match all relevant chain lengths.

- **Suggestion 10**: After correcting the logic implementation, test the updated code with known examples and counter-examples from the rules to verify that the patterns and logic correctly predict the intended outcomes (1, -1, or 0). This validation step will help ensure that the feature matrix accurately reflects the rules.

- **Suggestion 11**: Ensure that the code handles cases where multiple rules may apply to the same molecule. Decide whether multiple matching rules should have additive effects, or whether certain rules have precedence over others, and implement this logic accordingly.

- **Suggestion 12**: Consider using RDKit's chemical feature factory or substructure search capabilities that allow for more complex matching, including recursive SMARTS, to capture more intricate molecular features described in the rules.

- **Suggestion 13**: For better maintainability and readability, document each pattern and its intended match thoroughly within the code. This practice helps collaborators understand the reasoning behind each pattern and facilitates future modifications.

- **Suggestion 14**: Implement error handling for cases where a SMARTS pattern fails to compile or a substructure search raises an exception. This addition will prevent the entire process from failing silently and will provide useful feedback for debugging.

- **Suggestion 15**: Review the code's handling of stereochemistry. If stereochemistry is relevant to the rules (e.g., specific enantiomers), ensure the SMARTS patterns include chiral specifications where necessary.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxyl groups or nitrogen-containing heterocycles (e.g., indole rings)** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Extra carboxylate groups and nitrogen heterocycles enhance metal coordination through chelation, stabilizing the catalyst and improving efficiency.

   - **Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid; additional carboxylate group)
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid; additional carboxylate group)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan; indole nitrogen)

   - **Counter-Example**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine; lacks additional coordinating groups) – Low Yield

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., nitro, halogens) directly attached to the aromatic ring** tend to give a **high yield**, whereas those with **electron-donating substituents (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxyl groups)** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylate, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity, weakening metal coordination.

   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Bromomethyl group)
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Nitro group)
   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Methyl group is electron-donating)
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Hydroxyl group is electron-donating)

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating nitrogen atoms in positions favorable for metal binding (e.g., adjacent to the carboxyl group)** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in the ring can serve as additional coordination sites, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and catalyst performance.

   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nitrogen atom adjacent to carboxyl group)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Pyrazole ring with coordinating nitrogen)
   - **Low Yield Counter-Example**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Pyridyl group may not effectively coordinate due to unfavorable positioning)

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-chain lengths (C6–C8) and no additional polar functional groups** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: The optimal chain length facilitates hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst surface while the carboxylate group effectively coordinates with the metal center.

   - **High Yield Example**:
     - **Octanoic acid** (Eight-carbon chain)
   - **Low Yield Counter-Example**:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Presence of amino group may interfere with coordination)

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing **additional coordinating functional groups such as thiols or multiple adjacent hydroxyls near the carboxylate group** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: These functional groups can chelate the metal center, forming more stable complexes and enhancing catalytic activity.

   - **Examples**:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Thiol group enhances coordination)
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Multiple hydroxyls for chelation)

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids fused with additional carbonyl groups within the ring structure** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Additional carbonyl groups can participate in resonance stabilization and metal coordination, enhancing catalytic activity.

   - **Example**:
     - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Fused ketone groups)

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing **functional groups that hinder metal coordination, such as aldehyde groups adjacent to the carboxylate, amide bonds near the carboxylate, or strongly electron-withdrawing perfluoroalkyl groups**, tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Aldehydes may interfere with coordination or participate in side reactions; amide groups can reduce coordination ability due to resonance delocalization; perfluoroalkyl groups excessively decrease electron density on the carboxylate oxygen.

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Aldehyde group adjacent to carboxylate)
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Amide group adjacent to carboxylate)
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Perfluorinated chain)

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers with **bulky, non-coordinating substituents near the carboxylate group**, such as **aromatic rings without additional coordinating groups**, tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Bulky groups can introduce steric hindrance, reducing the effectiveness of metal coordination and catalyst performance.

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine; bulky phenyl group)
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Bulky aromatic ring with electron-donating hydroxyl group)

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **flexible polar chains with ether linkages (polyether chains) or multiple amino groups** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Ether oxygens and amino groups may not coordinate effectively and can increase solubility in the solvent, reducing interaction with the catalyst surface.

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Multiple ether linkages)
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Flexible ether-containing chain with amino group)

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **long aliphatic chains containing polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl or amino groups) distant from the carboxylate** tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Polar groups far from the carboxylate may not effectively participate in metal coordination and can interfere with catalyst interaction or solubility.

    - **Low Yield Examples**:
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Hydroxyl group distant from carboxylate)
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Amino group distant from carboxylate)

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **linear dicarboxylic acids without additional interfering functional groups may give variable yields depending on chain length**, with shorter chains potentially giving a **high yield** and longer or more substituted chains giving a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Two carboxylate groups can enhance coordination, but longer chains or additional groups may introduce steric hindrance or alter coordination geometry.

    - **High Yield Potential**:
      - **Modifiers with short dicarboxylic chains (e.g., succinic acid)**
    - **Low Yield Example**:
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Ketone group may interfere with coordination)

ML Commenter Message:
**Comments on the Accuracies of the Validation and Training Sets:**

The previous iterations showed relatively consistent validation accuracies around 76%, with test accuracies ranging from 62.5% to 75%. Specifically:

- **Previous Accuracies:**
  - Validation Accuracies: [0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]; Test Accuracy: 0.75
  - Validation Accuracies: [0.76, 0.68, 0.72, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]; Test Accuracy: 0.75
  - Validation Accuracies: [0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]; Test Accuracies: 0.625

In the current iteration, the 5-fold cross-validation accuracy is:

- **Current Accuracy:**
  - Validation Accuracy: **57.14%**

This represents a significant decrease from previous validation accuracies. The drop suggests that the changes made in the current iteration have negatively impacted the model's performance.

**Analysis Based on SHAP Values Calculated on the Validation Set:**

The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis provides insight into how each rule contributes to the model's predictions. Specifically, it helps identify which rules are influencing the predictions, especially in cases where the model makes incorrect predictions.

**Key Observations from SHAP Analysis:**

1. **Overestimated Loadings (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**

   - **Molecules with Overestimation:**
     - **C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O**
     - **C(CCCC(=O)O)CCCN**
     - **C1=CC(=CC=C1CCC(=O)O)O**
     - **C(CCCO)CCC(=O)O**
     - **C(CCCN)CCC(=O)O**

   - **Rule Involved:**
     - **Rule 7** consistently shows a **positive SHAP value** for high loading in these cases.

   - **Interpretation:**
     - Rule 7 is contributing significantly to the incorrect prediction of high loading when the experimental value is low.
     - The positive SHAP values indicate that Rule 7 is pushing the prediction towards high loading.

2. **Underestimated Loadings (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**

   - **Molecules with Underestimation:**
     - **C([C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](C(=O)O)O)O)O)O)O**
     - **C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N**
     - **C([C@@H](C(=O)O)N)C(=O)O**

   - **Rules Involved:**
     - **Rule 7** shows a **positive SHAP value** but may not be sufficient to predict high loading.
     - **Rule 10** (from previous iterations) sometimes shows a negative contribution.

   - **Interpretation:**
     - There may be missing factors or interactions not captured by the current rules leading to underestimation.

**Assessment of the Effectiveness of Current Rules:**

- The decrease in validation accuracy suggests that the current set of rules is **not effective enough** and may have introduced errors.
- **Rule 7** appears to be problematic, as it contributes positively to high loading predictions even when the experimental loading is low.
- There may be an **over-reliance on certain rules**, leading to incorrect predictions.
- The model may be **underfitting**, as it is not capturing the complexity of the data adequately.

**Analysis of Overfitting/Underfitting:**

- The decrease in accuracy without a corresponding increase in variance suggests **underfitting**.
- The model, based on the current rules, lacks the capacity to capture all relevant patterns in the data.
- The **consistent misclassifications** indicate that the rules may be too simplistic or not properly aligned with the underlying chemistry.

**Interpretation of Accuracy Improvements:**

- The decreased accuracy indicates that the recent changes have **not improved** the model.
- The model may have moved away from a solution that adequately captured the key features influencing catalyst loading.
- Further iterations are necessary to refine the rules and enhance the model's performance.

**Deriving Insights from SHAP Analysis:**

- **Rule 7** has a significant impact on predictions, often leading to incorrect high loading predictions.
- The positive SHAP values of Rule 7 in overestimated cases suggest it is **overemphasizing certain features**.
- **Rule 7 Definition Recap:**

  - *Modifiers containing functional groups that hinder metal coordination, such as aldehyde groups adjacent to the carboxylate, amide bonds near the carboxylate, or strongly electron-withdrawing perfluoroalkyl groups, tend to give a low yield.*

- Despite Rule 7 intending to predict low yield, its positive SHAP values indicate it may be incorrectly contributing to high yield predictions.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

1. **Refine Rule 7:**

   - **Issue Identified:**
     - Rule 7 is intended to identify modifiers that should result in low loading but is contributing to high loading predictions.
   - **Action Items:**
     - **Re-express Rule 7** to more accurately capture the intended effect on loading.
     - **Clarify the Scope:**
       - Ensure that the rule clearly defines the structural features that hinder metal coordination.
     - **Adjust Rule Implementation:**
       - Verify that the computational implementation of Rule 7 aligns with its chemical rationale.
     - **Add Specificity:**
       - Include additional conditions or exceptions to prevent misclassification.

2. **Review and Adjust Other Problematic Rules:**

   - **Identify Rules with High Negative SHAP Values in Underestimated Loadings:**
     - Investigate any rules contributing to low predictions when the experimental loading is high.
   - **Fine-Tune Rule Contributions:**
     - Adjust the weighting or influence of such rules to improve prediction accuracy.

3. **Enhance Generalization:**

   - **Avoid Overfitting to Specific Cases:**
     - Ensure that rules are not too narrowly defined based on specific examples.
   - **Incorporate Additional Data:**
     - Consider expanding the dataset to include more diverse examples, improving the model's ability to generalize.

4. **Incorporate Additional Rules or Features:**

   - **Address Missing Chemical Insights:**
     - Analyze misclassified molecules to identify patterns or features not captured by current rules.
   - **Introduce New Rules:**
     - For example, consider rules that account for **steric hindrance**, **hydrogen bonding potential**, or **solubility effects**.

5. **Iterative Rule Refinement:**

   - **Use SHAP Analysis Iteratively:**
     - Continually use SHAP insights to adjust rules and evaluate their effectiveness.
   - **Validate Changes:**
     - After modifying rules, retrain the model and assess performance improvements.

6. **Improve Model Complexity if Necessary:**

   - **Consider Advanced Algorithms:**
     - If rules-based models are insufficient, explore machine learning models that can capture nonlinear relationships.
   - **Feature Engineering:**
     - Extract additional molecular descriptors (e.g., electronic properties, molecular orbitals) to enhance the feature matrix.

7. **Engage with Domain Experts:**

   - **Consult Chemists:**
     - Collaborate with chemists to validate the chemical rationale behind rules.
   - **Update Rules Based on Expert Feedback:**
     - Ensure rules are scientifically grounded and reflect current understanding.

   - **Check for Data Errors:**
     - Ensure that the experimental values are accurate and consistent.
   - **Balance the Dataset:**
     - Address any class imbalance that might be affecting the model's learning.

**Concluding Remarks:**

The current decrease in model performance highlights the need for careful refinement of the rules governing the feature matrix. By focusing on problematic rules like Rule 7 and incorporating insights from SHAP analysis, we can improve the model's predictive accuracy. Iterative refinement, combined with domain expertise and robust validation, will be key to developing a more effective set of rules that better capture the complex relationships influencing catalyst loading.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions to Optimize Current Rules:**

The current set of rules for predicting the yield of the remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction using different molecular modifiers has led to a decrease in model performance. Specifically, the validation accuracy has dropped from approximately 76% in previous iterations to 57.14% in the current iteration. SHAP analysis indicates that certain rules, particularly **Rule 7**, are contributing to incorrect predictions by overestimating the yield for certain modifiers.

**Key Issues Identified:**

1. **Incorrect Implementation of Logical Operators:**
   - The logical combinations specified in the rules are not correctly implemented in the code. For example, **Rule 1** should apply when an α-amino acid has either an additional carboxyl group or a nitrogen heterocycle, but the code currently requires both conditions to be met simultaneously.

2. **Misaligned Rule Implementation:**
   - The computational implementation of some rules, such as **Rule 7**, does not align with their intended chemical rationale. Rule 7, intended to predict low yield modifiers, is instead contributing positively to high yield predictions.

3. **Inadequate SMARTS Patterns:**
   - Some SMARTS patterns may not accurately capture all relevant chemical features. For instance, **Rule 2** does not include nitro groups in its pattern for electron-withdrawing substituents, potentially missing important matches.

4. **Overreliance on Problematic Rules:**
   - The model relies heavily on certain rules that may not be effectively predicting the yield, such as **Rule 7**, leading to misclassifications and decreased performance.

**Suggestions to Improve Current Rules:**

1. **Correct the Implementation of Logical Operators:**
   - Modify the code to correctly interpret and apply logical operators (`and`, `or`) as specified in each rule's logic statement. Implement a function that can evaluate complex logical expressions, allowing for accurate combination of individual pattern matches according to the intended logic.

2. **Refine Problematic Rules (e.g., Rule 7):**
   - Reassess **Rule 7** to ensure it accurately predicts low yield modifiers. Adjust its pattern and logic to prevent it from incorrectly contributing to high yield predictions. Ensure that the computational implementation aligns with the chemical rationale of the rule.

3. **Update and Expand SMARTS Patterns:**
   - Review and improve all SMARTS patterns for chemical accuracy and completeness. For example:
     - **Rule 2**: Expand the pattern for electron-withdrawing groups to include nitro groups (`[c][N+](=O)[O-]`) and other important electron-withdrawing substituents like cyano and carbonyl groups.
     - **Rules 1 and 3**: Enhance patterns for nitrogen-containing heterocycles to specifically target relevant structures (e.g., indole, pyridine) involved in metal coordination.

4. **Implement Accurate Pattern Matching and Logical Evaluation:**
   - Store individual pattern match results and combine them according to the rule's logical expression. This will ensure that each rule is applied correctly based on the intended chemical logic.

5. **Expand Patterns to Include Tautomeric and Resonance Forms:**
   - Use RDKit's capabilities to account for tautomeric and resonance forms of functional groups, ensuring that all relevant molecular forms are captured by the patterns.

6. **Adjust Rule Influence and Model Complexity:**
   - Balance the influence of each rule on the model's predictions. Avoid overemphasis on any single rule that could lead to misclassifications. Consider adjusting the weighting or thresholds associated with each rule.

7. **Validate and Test Modifications:**
   - After making changes, thoroughly test the updated rules with known examples and counter-examples to verify that they produce the correct predictions. Use cross-validation to ensure that the changes improve generalization without overfitting.

8. **Incorporate Additional Chemical Insights:**
   - Analyze misclassified molecules to identify missing patterns or features. Introduce new rules that capture additional chemical factors influencing yield, such as steric hindrance, hydrogen bonding potential, or specific electronic effects.

9. **Engage Domain Experts:**
   - Consult with chemists to validate the chemical rationale behind the rules and to ensure that the SMARTS patterns accurately reflect the intended molecular features.

10. **Improve Data Quality and Address Class Imbalance:**
    - Ensure the dataset is accurate and balanced. Address any discrepancies or biases that might be affecting the model's learning process.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting:**

There is substantial room for further optimization of the current rules without risking overfitting. By correcting the implementation errors and refining the rules to align more closely with chemical principles, the model's predictive accuracy can be improved. Properly applying logical operators, updating SMARTS patterns, and recalibrating the influence of each rule will enhance the model's ability to generalize from the data and produce reliable predictions.

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxyl groups or nitrogen-containing heterocycles (e.g., indole rings)** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Extra carboxylate groups and nitrogen heterocycles enhance metal coordination through chelation, stabilizing the catalyst and improving efficiency.

   - **Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid; additional carboxylate group)
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid; additional carboxylate group)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan; indole nitrogen)

   - **Counter-Example**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine; lacks additional coordinating groups) – Low Yield

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., nitro, halogens) directly attached to the aromatic ring** tend to give a **high yield**, whereas those with **electron-donating substituents (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxyl groups)** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylate, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity, weakening metal coordination.

   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Bromomethyl group)
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Nitro group)
   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Methyl group is electron-donating)
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Hydroxyl group is electron-donating)

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating nitrogen atoms in positions favorable for metal binding (e.g., adjacent to the carboxyl group)** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in the ring can serve as additional coordination sites, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and catalyst performance.

   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nitrogen atom adjacent to carboxyl group)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Pyrazole ring with coordinating nitrogen)
   - **Low Yield Counter-Example**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Pyridyl group may not effectively coordinate due to unfavorable positioning)

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-chain lengths (C6–C8) and no additional polar functional groups** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: The optimal chain length facilitates hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst surface while the carboxylate group effectively coordinates with the metal center.

   - **High Yield Example**:
     - **Octanoic acid** (Eight-carbon chain)
   - **Low Yield Counter-Example**:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Presence of amino group may interfere with coordination)

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing **additional coordinating functional groups such as thiols or multiple adjacent hydroxyls near the carboxylate group** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: These functional groups can chelate the metal center, forming more stable complexes and enhancing catalytic activity.

   - **Examples**:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Thiol group enhances coordination)
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Multiple hydroxyls for chelation)

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids fused with additional carbonyl groups within the ring structure** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Additional carbonyl groups can participate in resonance stabilization and metal coordination, enhancing catalytic activity.

   - **Example**:
     - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Fused ketone groups)

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing **functional groups that hinder metal coordination, such as aldehyde groups adjacent to the carboxylate, amide bonds near the carboxylate, or strongly electron-withdrawing perfluoroalkyl groups**, tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Aldehydes may interfere with coordination or participate in side reactions; amide groups can reduce coordination ability due to resonance delocalization; perfluoroalkyl groups excessively decrease electron density on the carboxylate oxygen.

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Aldehyde group adjacent to carboxylate)
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Amide group adjacent to carboxylate)
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Perfluorinated chain)

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers with **bulky, non-coordinating substituents near the carboxylate group**, such as **aromatic rings without additional coordinating groups**, tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Bulky groups can introduce steric hindrance, reducing the effectiveness of metal coordination and catalyst performance.

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine; bulky phenyl group)
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Bulky aromatic ring with electron-donating hydroxyl group)

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **flexible polar chains with ether linkages (polyether chains) or multiple amino groups** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Ether oxygens and amino groups may not coordinate effectively and can increase solubility in the solvent, reducing interaction with the catalyst surface.

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Multiple ether linkages)
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Flexible ether-containing chain with amino group)

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **long aliphatic chains containing polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl or amino groups) distant from the carboxylate** tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Polar groups far from the carboxylate may not effectively participate in metal coordination and can interfere with catalyst interaction or solubility.

    - **Low Yield Examples**:
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Hydroxyl group distant from carboxylate)
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Amino group distant from carboxylate)

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **linear dicarboxylic acids without additional interfering functional groups may give variable yields depending on chain length**, with shorter chains potentially giving a **high yield** and longer or more substituted chains giving a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Two carboxylate groups can enhance coordination, but longer chains or additional groups may introduce steric hindrance or alter coordination geometry.

    - **High Yield Potential**:
      - **Modifiers with short dicarboxylic chains (e.g., succinic acid)**
    - **Low Yield Example**:
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Ketone group may interfere with coordination)

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Correct the Implementation of Logical Operators in the Code**
  
  - **Action**: Modify the code to properly interpret and apply logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) as specified in each rule's logic statement.
  - **Implementation**: Instead of combining SMARTS patterns into a single pattern with logical operators, evaluate each SMARTS pattern separately. Store the boolean results of each individual pattern match and then combine these results according to the rule's logical expression using logical operators.
  - **Example**: For **Rule 1**, check separately if a molecule is an α-amino acid (`Pattern A`) and if it has either an additional carboxyl group (`Pattern B`) **or** a nitrogen-containing heterocycle (`Pattern C`). Then, apply the logic: `Pattern A and (Pattern B or Pattern C)`.

- **Advice 2**: **Refine Problematic Rules, Especially Rule 7**

  - **Action**: Reassess **Rule 7** to ensure it correctly predicts **low yield** modifiers and does not unintentionally contribute to high yield predictions.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Review the chemical rationale and ensure the SMARTS patterns accurately represent functional groups that hinder metal coordination (e.g., adjacent aldehyde groups, amide bonds near the carboxylate, perfluoroalkyl groups).
    - Adjust the logic so that the presence of these groups contributes negatively to the yield prediction.
  - **Example**: Ensure that modifiers containing aldehyde groups adjacent to the carboxylate are correctly identified and assigned a low yield prediction.

- **Advice 3**: **Update and Expand SMARTS Patterns for Accuracy and Completeness**

  - **Action**: Review all SMARTS patterns used in the rules to ensure they comprehensively capture the intended chemical features.
  - **Implementation**:
    - **Rule 2**: Expand the pattern for electron-withdrawing groups to include nitro groups (`[N+](=O)[O-]`), cyano groups (`C#N`), and carbonyl groups.
    - **Rules 1 and 3**: Enhance patterns for nitrogen-containing heterocycles by including specific substructures like indole (`c1ccc2c(c1)[nH]c3c2cccc3`) and pyridine rings.
  - **Example**: Modify the SMARTS pattern in **Rule 2** to `[$(c[#6][F,Cl,Br,I,N+](=O)[O-],c[#6]C#N)]` to include halogens, nitro, and cyano groups attached to the aromatic ring.

- **Advice 4**: **Implement Accurate Pattern Matching and Logical Evaluation**

  - **Action**: Separate pattern matching from logical evaluation to improve accuracy.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Match each SMARTS pattern individually and store the results (True/False).
    - Combine these results using logical expressions that mirror the rule's rationale.
  - **Example**: For a rule that states a high yield when both **Pattern A** and **Pattern B** are present, evaluate `result = Pattern_A_match and Pattern_B_match`.

- **Advice 5**: **Expand SMARTS Patterns to Include Tautomeric and Resonance Forms**

  - **Action**: Utilize RDKit's capabilities to account for tautomeric and resonance forms in SMARTS pattern matching.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Use generic atom and bond specifications to capture different tautomeric forms.
    - Consider using RDKit's tautomer enumeration tools to standardize molecules before pattern matching.
  - **Example**: Adjust patterns to recognize both keto and enol forms of carbonyl-containing groups.

- **Advice 6**: **Adjust Rule Influence and Balance Model Complexity**

  - **Action**: Reevaluate the weighting or contribution of each rule to the overall prediction to prevent overreliance on any single rule.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Assign weights or confidence levels to each rule based on their predictive performance.
    - Ensure that rules predicting low yield do not override multiple indicators of high yield unless strongly justified.
  - **Example**: If **Rule 7** has been leading to incorrect high yield predictions, reduce its influence or adjust its conditions to be more stringent.

- **Advice 7**: **Validate and Test Modified Rules Thoroughly**

  - **Action**: After implementing changes, test the updated rules rigorously with the dataset.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Use cross-validation techniques to assess the performance of the new rules.
    - Check predictions against known high yield and low yield examples to ensure correctness.
  - **Example**: Confirm that modifiers like **4-nitrobenzoic acid** are correctly predicted as high yield and that **4-formylbenzoic acid** is predicted as low yield after rule adjustments.

- **Advice 8**: **Incorporate Additional Chemical Insights into Rules**

  - **Action**: Analyze misclassified modifiers to identify missing features or patterns and update rules accordingly.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Identify common structural features in misclassified low or high yield modifiers.
    - Introduce new rules or modify existing ones to account for these features.
  - **Example**: If certain modifiers with ortho-substituents are consistently mispredicted, consider a new rule addressing steric hindrance due to ortho-substitution.

- **Advice 9**: **Engage with Domain Experts for Validation**

  - **Action**: Consult chemists or chemical experts to validate the chemical rationale and practical applicability of the rules.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Review the rules and their implementations with experts to ensure accuracy.
    - Incorporate their feedback into refining the rules and SMARTS patterns.
  - **Example**: Verify with a chemist whether the assumption that perfluoroalkyl groups hinder metal coordination is valid in the context of this reaction.

- **Advice 10**: **Improve Data Quality and Address Class Imbalance**

  - **Action**: Ensure the dataset used for rule development is accurate and balanced.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Verify the yield classifications for each modifier to correct any errors.
    - If necessary, augment the dataset with additional examples to balance high yield and low yield classes.
  - **Example**: If there are significantly more high yield modifiers, consider obtaining or simulating additional low yield examples to improve model training.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxyl groups or polar heterocycles** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Additional carboxylate groups and heterocyclic rings with nitrogen enhance metal chelation and stabilize the catalyst, improving efficiency.

   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid; extra carboxylate group)
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid; extra carboxylate group)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan; indole ring with nitrogen)
   - **Low Yield Counter-Example**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine; lacks additional coordinating groups) – Low Yield

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., nitro, halogens) attached directly to the aromatic ring** tend to give a **high yield**, whereas those with **electron-donating substituents (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxyl groups)** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylate, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and weaken metal coordination.

   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Bromomethyl group is electron-withdrawing)
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing)
   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Methyl group is electron-donating)
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Hydroxyl group is electron-donating)

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing **nitrogenous heterocycles capable of coordinating with metals**, such as **pyridine or pyrazole carboxylic acids**, tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles can act as additional coordination sites, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and catalyst performance.

   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nitrogen atom adjacent to the carboxyl group)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Pyrazole ring with coordinating nitrogen)
   - **Low Yield Example**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Possible unfavorable coordination geometry) – Low Yield

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that have **additional functional groups capable of chelating metals (e.g., thiols, multiple hydroxyls) in proximity to the carboxylate group** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Chelating ligands with multiple coordinating sites form more stable complexes with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Thiol group enhances coordination)
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Multiple hydroxyl groups enable chelation)

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers with **aliphatic chains of optimal length (e.g., C8) without interfering functional groups** can give a **high yield**, but longer chains or additional polar groups distant from the carboxylate tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Optimal chain length balances hydrophobic interactions and solubility, facilitating effective interaction with the catalyst. Longer chains or distant polar groups may hinder coordination or affect solubility adversely.

   - **High Yield Example**:
     - **Octanoic acid** (Eight-carbon chain provides optimal balance)
   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Hydroxyl group distant from the carboxylate)
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Amino group distant from the carboxylate)

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing **polar functional groups distant from the carboxylate group**, such as **hydroxyl or amino groups at the end of long aliphatic chains**, tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Remote polar groups may not effectively participate in metal coordination and can interfere with catalyst interaction or solubility.

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers with **bulky substituents near the carboxylate group that are non-coordinating or electron-donating**, such as **aromatic rings without additional coordinating groups**, tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Bulky groups can introduce steric hindrance, reducing the effectiveness of metal coordination and catalyst performance.

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine; bulky phenyl group)
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Bulky aromatic ring with electron-donating hydroxyl group)

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **polyether chains or multiple ether linkages** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Ether oxygens are weakly coordinating, and flexible polyether chains can increase solubility in the solvent, reducing interaction with the catalyst surface.

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Multiple ether linkages)
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Ether-containing chain with amino group)

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **strong electron-withdrawing groups that excessively decrease electron density on the carboxylate oxygen**, such as **perfluoroalkyl chains**, tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Overly electron-deficient carboxylate groups may not coordinate effectively with metal centers.

   - **Low Yield Example**:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Perfluorinated chain)

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that have **functional groups which may interfere with metal coordination**, such as **aldehyde groups or amide bonds adjacent to the carboxylate**, tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Aldehyde groups can participate in side reactions or inhibit coordination; amide groups can reduce coordination ability due to resonance delocalization.

    - **Low Yield Examples**:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Aldehyde group adjacent to carboxylate)
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Amide group near carboxylate)

The rationale provides solid physical-chemical insight into how these functional groups enhance metal chelation and stabilize the catalyst, leading to higher yields. The rule effectively combines multiple substructures, demonstrating appropriate complexity. Supported by several data points, including high-yield examples like glutamic acid and tryptophan, as well as a low-yield counter-example (phenylalanine), the rule shows strong coverage and a good balance between specificity and applicability.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 offers clear guidelines by categorizing modifiers based on the nature of substituents on aromatic carboxylic acids. The clarity in distinguishing between electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups allows for straightforward assessment of expected yield outcomes. The rationale provides insightful explanations about how substituents influence carboxylate acidity and metal coordination abilities. This rule combines considerations of aromatic structures with electronic effects, showcasing appropriate complexity. It is well-supported by multiple data points, both high and low yield, indicating robust coverage and a balanced approach.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear in its focus on modifiers containing nitrogenous heterocycles capable of coordinating with metals. The rationale offers meaningful physical-chemical insight into the role of nitrogen atoms in enhancing metal-ligand interactions and improving catalyst performance. By concentrating on specific heterocyclic structures like pyridine and pyrazole carboxylic acids, the rule displays suitable complexity. Supported by data points such as pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (high yield) and 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (low yield), the rule demonstrates good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clearly articulated, specifying that modifiers with additional chelating functional groups near the carboxylate, such as thiols and multiple hydroxyls, lead to high yields. The rationale provides adequate physical-chemical insight into how multi-dentate ligands form more stable complexes with metal centers. The rule considers combinations of substructures, showing appropriate complexity. With examples like 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid and pentahydroxyhexanoic acid yielding high results, the rule is supported by sufficient data points, indicating acceptable coverage.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 clearly describes the impact of aliphatic chain length and the absence of interfering functional groups on the yield. The rationale appropriately addresses the balance between hydrophobic interactions and solubility, explaining why an optimal chain length facilitates effective interaction with the catalyst. This rule combines considerations of chain length and functional group presence, demonstrating suitable complexity. Supported by data points such as octanoic acid (high yield) and longer-chain acids with distal polar groups (low yield), the rule exhibits good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 provides clear criteria by identifying modifiers with polar functional groups distant from the carboxylate group as tending to give low yields. The rationale offers reasonable physical-chemical insight into why remote polar groups may not effectively participate in metal coordination and may interfere with catalyst interactions. By considering the position of functional groups relative to the carboxylate, the rule displays appropriate complexity. Supported by data points like 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid and 7-aminoheptanoic acid (both low yield), the rule demonstrates sufficient coverage.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clearly defined, focusing on modifiers with bulky, non-coordinating substituents near the carboxylate that tend to give low yields. The rationale provides adequate insight into how steric hindrance from bulky groups can reduce the effectiveness of metal coordination. The rule considers both the steric and electronic nature of substituents, reflecting appropriate complexity. With data points such as phenylalanine and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid yielding low results, the rule is supported by multiple examples, indicating good coverage.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear in identifying modifiers containing polyether chains or multiple ether linkages as tending to give low yields. The rationale satisfactorily explains how such structures may increase solubility and reduce interaction with the catalyst surface. By highlighting specific structural features, the rule demonstrates suitable complexity. Supported by examples like 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid and 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid (both low yield), the rule has acceptable coverage.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 clearly states that modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups that excessively decrease electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, such as perfluoroalkyl chains, tend to give low yields. The rationale provides acceptable physical-chemical insight into how overly electron-deficient carboxylates may hinder effective metal coordination. However, the rule is supported by only one data point (nonafluoropentanoic acid), indicating limited coverage. While the clarity and insight are good, additional data would strengthen the rule's applicability and balance.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clearly defined, indicating that modifiers with functional groups interfering with metal coordination, like aldehyde groups or adjacent amide bonds, tend to give low yields. The rationale provides solid explanations about how these groups may participate in side reactions or inhibit coordination due to resonance effects. By focusing on specific interfering functional groups near the coordination site, the rule exhibits appropriate complexity. Supported by data points such as 4-formylbenzoic acid and 6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (both low yield), the rule demonstrates sufficient coverage and balance.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxyl groups or polar heterocycles** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Additional carboxylate groups and heterocyclic rings with nitrogen enhance metal chelation and stabilize the catalyst, improving efficiency.

   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid; extra carboxylate group)
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid; extra carboxylate group)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan; indole ring with nitrogen)
   - **Low Yield Counter-Example**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine; lacks additional coordinating groups) – Low Yield

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., nitro, halogens) attached directly to the aromatic ring** tend to give a **high yield**, whereas those with **electron-donating substituents (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxyl groups)** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylate, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and weaken metal coordination.

   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Bromomethyl group is electron-withdrawing)
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing)
   - **Low Yield Examples**:

     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Hydroxyl group is electron-donating)

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing **nitrogenous heterocycles capable of coordinating with metals**, such as **pyridine or pyrazole carboxylic acids**, tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles can act as additional coordination sites, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and catalyst performance.

   - **High Yield Examples**:

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that have **additional functional groups capable of chelating metals (e.g., thiols, multiple hydroxyls) in proximity to the carboxylate group** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Chelating ligands with multiple coordinating sites form more stable complexes with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Thiol group enhances coordination)
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Multiple hydroxyl groups enable chelation)

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers with **aliphatic chains of optimal length (e.g., C8) without interfering functional groups** can give a **high yield**, but longer chains or additional polar groups distant from the carboxylate tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Optimal chain length balances hydrophobic interactions and solubility, facilitating effective interaction with the catalyst. Longer chains or distant polar groups may hinder coordination or affect solubility adversely.

   - **High Yield Example**:
     - **Octanoic acid** (Eight-carbon chain provides optimal balance)
   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Hydroxyl group distant from the carboxylate)
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Amino group distant from the carboxylate)

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing **polar functional groups distant from the carboxylate group**, such as **hydroxyl or amino groups at the end of long aliphatic chains**, tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Remote polar groups may not effectively participate in metal coordination and can interfere with catalyst interaction or solubility.

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers with **bulky substituents near the carboxylate group that are non-coordinating or electron-donating**, such as **aromatic rings without additional coordinating groups**, tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Bulky groups can introduce steric hindrance, reducing the effectiveness of metal coordination and catalyst performance.

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine; bulky phenyl group)
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Bulky aromatic ring with electron-donating hydroxyl group)

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **polyether chains or multiple ether linkages** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Ether oxygens are weakly coordinating, and flexible polyether chains can increase solubility in the solvent, reducing interaction with the catalyst surface.

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Multiple ether linkages)
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Ether-containing chain with amino group)

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **strong electron-withdrawing groups that excessively decrease electron density on the carboxylate oxygen**, such as **perfluoroalkyl chains**, tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Overly electron-deficient carboxylate groups may not coordinate effectively with metal centers.

   - **Low Yield Example**:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Perfluorinated chain)

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that have **functional groups which may interfere with metal coordination**, such as **aldehyde groups or amide bonds adjacent to the carboxylate**, tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Aldehyde groups can participate in side reactions or inhibit coordination; amide groups can reduce coordination ability due to resonance delocalization.

    - **Low Yield Examples**:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Aldehyde group adjacent to carboxylate)
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Amide group near carboxylate)

Matrix Checker Message:
After careful evaluation, the transformation from language rules to the numeric feature matrix is not fully effective. Below are specific suggestions to improve the current code.

** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Update the 'carboxylic_acid' SMARTS pattern** to match both protonated and deprotonated forms. The current pattern `'[CX3](=O)[OX1H1]'` only matches the protonated carboxylic acid (-COOH). Modify it to `'[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` to match both -COOH and -COO⁻ groups.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Correct the counting of carboxyl groups in Rule 1**. Ensure that the code accurately counts multiple carboxylic acid groups by using unique matches. Use `mol.GetSubstructMatches(pattern, uniquify=True)` to prevent overlapping matches from inflating the count.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Expand the 'amino_group' SMARTS pattern** to include amino groups in different environments. The current pattern `'[NX3;H2]'` may miss amines attached to carbons with varying hybridizations. Update it to `'[NX3;H2,H1]'` to include primary and secondary amines.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Refine Rule 1 to specifically identify α-amino acids**. Incorporate a SMARTS pattern that ensures the amino group and at least one carboxyl group are on the same carbon (the α-carbon). For example, use `'[NX3;H2,H1][CX4H]([*])[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'`.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Adjust 'nitrogen_heterocycle' SMARTS pattern** to capture all relevant heterocycles. The current pattern `'[n]'` only matches aromatic nitrogen atoms. Include non-aromatic nitrogen heterocycles with a pattern like `'[N;r]'` to match any nitrogen in a ring.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Separate Rule 2 into high and low yield parts**. Currently, Rule 2 only defines high yield for electron-withdrawing groups but doesn't explicitly handle low yield for electron-donating groups. Create separate rules for each case to improve clarity and accuracy.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Define specific patterns for electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups**. For electron-withdrawing groups, include nitro (`'[NX3+](=O)[O-]'`), halogens (`'[F,Cl,Br,I]'`), and carbonyls directly attached to the aromatic ring. For electron-donating groups, include hydroxyl (`'[OX2H]'`), methoxy (`'[OX2][CH3]'`), and methyl (`'[CH3]'`) attached to the ring.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Improve Rule 2 and Rule 3 evaluations** by checking substituents directly attached to the aromatic ring. Use SMARTS patterns that specify the substituent is bound to an aromatic carbon, e.g., `'[c][N+](=O)[O-]'` for nitro groups on aromatics.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Incorporate distance checks for functional groups in Rules 5 and 6**. Use RDKit's `GetSubstructMatches` with the `useChirality` and `maxMatches` parameters, or apply molecular queries that specify the proximity of functional groups to the carboxylate.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Enhance the 'polyether_linkage' pattern** to detect longer chains. Replace `'[#6][OX2][#6][OX2][#6]'` with a recursive SMARTS pattern like `'[#6](-O-[#6]){2,}'` to match two or more consecutive ether linkages.

- **Suggestion 11**: **Update Rule 9 to detect perfluoroalkyl chains**. The current pattern only matches trifluoromethyl groups. Use a more general pattern like `'[CX4][CX2](F)(F)(F)'` or `'[CX4][CX2]([F,Cl,Br,I])[CX2]([F,Cl,Br,I])[CX3](=O)'` to match longer perfluoroalkyl chains.

- **Suggestion 12**: **Refine the 'aldehyde' and 'amide' patterns** in Rule 10. Ensure that these patterns match functional groups adjacent to the carboxylate. For aldehydes adjacent to a carboxylate, use a pattern like `'[CX3H1](=O)[#6][CX3](=O)[O;H1,-]'`.

- **Suggestion 13**: **Test and validate the updated SMARTS patterns** on known compounds. Create a validation set of molecules with expected outcomes to verify that each rule correctly identifies high and low yield modifiers.

- **Suggestion 14**: **Document any assumptions or limitations** in the code. Keep track of cases where the SMARTS patterns may not fully capture the chemical diversity described in the rules, and consider adding comments to explain these aspects.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxyl groups or polar heterocycles** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Additional carboxylate groups and heterocyclic rings with nitrogen enhance metal chelation and stabilize the catalyst, improving efficiency.

   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid; extra carboxylate group)
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid; extra carboxylate group)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan; indole ring with nitrogen)
   - **Low Yield Counter-Example**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine; lacks additional coordinating groups) – Low Yield

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., nitro, halogens) attached directly to the aromatic ring** tend to give a **high yield**, whereas those with **electron-donating substituents (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxyl groups)** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylate, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and weaken metal coordination.

   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Bromomethyl group is electron-withdrawing)
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing)
   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Methyl group is electron-donating)
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Hydroxyl group is electron-donating)

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing **nitrogenous heterocycles capable of coordinating with metals**, such as **pyridine or pyrazole carboxylic acids**, tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles can act as additional coordination sites, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and catalyst performance.

   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nitrogen atom adjacent to the carboxyl group)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Pyrazole ring with coordinating nitrogen)
   - **Low Yield Example**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Possible unfavorable coordination geometry) – Low Yield

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that have **additional functional groups capable of chelating metals (e.g., thiols, multiple hydroxyls) in proximity to the carboxylate group** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Chelating ligands with multiple coordinating sites form more stable complexes with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Thiol group enhances coordination)
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Multiple hydroxyl groups enable chelation)

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers with **aliphatic chains of optimal length (e.g., C8) without interfering functional groups** can give a **high yield**, but longer chains or additional polar groups distant from the carboxylate tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Optimal chain length balances hydrophobic interactions and solubility, facilitating effective interaction with the catalyst. Longer chains or distant polar groups may hinder coordination or affect solubility adversely.

   - **High Yield Example**:
     - **Octanoic acid** (Eight-carbon chain provides optimal balance)
   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Hydroxyl group distant from the carboxylate)
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Amino group distant from the carboxylate)

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing **polar functional groups distant from the carboxylate group**, such as **hydroxyl or amino groups at the end of long aliphatic chains**, tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Remote polar groups may not effectively participate in metal coordination and can interfere with catalyst interaction or solubility.

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers with **bulky substituents near the carboxylate group that are non-coordinating or electron-donating**, such as **aromatic rings without additional coordinating groups**, tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Bulky groups can introduce steric hindrance, reducing the effectiveness of metal coordination and catalyst performance.

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine; bulky phenyl group)
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Bulky aromatic ring with electron-donating hydroxyl group)

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **polyether chains or multiple ether linkages** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Ether oxygens are weakly coordinating, and flexible polyether chains can increase solubility in the solvent, reducing interaction with the catalyst surface.

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Multiple ether linkages)
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Ether-containing chain with amino group)

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **strong electron-withdrawing groups that excessively decrease electron density on the carboxylate oxygen**, such as **perfluoroalkyl chains**, tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Overly electron-deficient carboxylate groups may not coordinate effectively with metal centers.

   - **Low Yield Example**:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Perfluorinated chain)

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that have **functional groups which may interfere with metal coordination**, such as **aldehyde groups or amide bonds adjacent to the carboxylate**, tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Aldehyde groups can participate in side reactions or inhibit coordination; amide groups can reduce coordination ability due to resonance delocalization.

    - **Low Yield Examples**:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Aldehyde group adjacent to carboxylate)
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Amide group near carboxylate)

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For **Rule 2**, adjust the SMARTS patterns to include other electron-withdrawing substituents attached directly to the aromatic ring, such as **halomethyl groups** (e.g., bromomethyl). The current pattern `'halogen_on_aromatic': '[c][F,Cl,Br,I]'` only captures halogens attached directly to the ring, not to a methyl group on the ring. Update the pattern to include halomethyl groups: `'halomethyl_on_aromatic': '[c][CH2][F,Cl,Br,I]'` and modify the rule's evaluation to check for this pattern.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: For **Rule 2**, include **amino groups** as electron-donating substituents in the pattern for electron-donating groups attached directly to the aromatic ring. Add `'amino_on_aromatic': '[c][NX3;H2,H1]'` to the patterns and update **Rule 2.1** to include this pattern in its evaluation. This will correctly flag compounds like aminobenzoic acid as low yield according to the rule.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For **Rule 5**, the SMARTS pattern is too specific, matching only a chain of exactly eight carbons without any variation. Modify the pattern to match aliphatic chains within a range (e.g., C7-C9) and to allow for slight variations. Use a pattern like `'aliphatic_chain': '[C](-[C]){6,8}[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` to capture aliphatic chains of optimal length ending with a carboxylic acid.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: For **Rule 6**, the current code checks for both a hydroxyl group and an ether linkage, which may not capture all relevant modifiers. Modify the evaluation to check for **polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino)** that are **distant (e.g., more than three carbons away)** from the carboxylate group. Define patterns for distant polar groups, such as `'distant_hydroxyl': '[CX4][CX4][CX4][OX2H]'` and `'distant_amino': '[CX4][CX4][CX4][NX3;H2,H1]'`, and update the rule's evaluation accordingly.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: For **Rule 7**, refine the pattern to specifically match **bulky substituents near the carboxylate group**, such as aromatic rings attached directly to the alpha carbon of the carboxylic acid. Use a SMARTS pattern like `'bulky_substituent_near_carboxylate': '[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CX4][c]'` and adjust the evaluation to detect these cases while excluding compounds with coordinating groups.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Implement a **priority system** for rule evaluation to handle cases where multiple conflicting rules apply. For example, if a modifier matches both a high-yield and a low-yield rule, define a priority (e.g., high-yield rules take precedence) or develop a combined scoring mechanism to resolve conflicts.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: For **Rule 9**, expand the `'perfluoroalkyl'` pattern to match longer perfluoroalkyl chains. Use a more general pattern like `'perfluoroalkyl': '[CX4;R0][CX4;R0](F)(F)(F)[CX4;R0](F)(F)(F)[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` to capture various lengths of perfluorinated chains attached to the carboxylate.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Enhance **Rule 2** by adding comprehensive patterns for **electron-withdrawing groups** (e.g., nitro, cyano, acyl) and **electron-donating groups** (e.g., amino, alkyl, alkoxy). Define patterns like `'cyano_on_aromatic': '[c][C]#N'` and include them in the rule evaluations to improve accuracy.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: For **Rule 4**, consider additional chelating functional groups such as **phosphates or carboxylates**. Update the code to detect multiple chelating groups in proximity to the carboxylate group by defining patterns for these groups and modifying the evaluation function to count and assess their proximity.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: To accurately capture modifiers in **Rule 6** like compound 4 (`'C(CCN)CC(=O)O'`), adjust the code to identify polar functional groups that are **not adjacent** to the carboxylate. Implement a distance-based check, possibly using RDKit's graph distance functionality, to detect polar groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) that are several atoms away from the carboxylate.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: Utilize **recursive SMARTS** or **atom mapping** to establish the relationship between functional groups and the carboxylate group. This is crucial for rules where proximity matters (e.g., Rules 4, 5, 6, 7). Incorporate these techniques to ensure that functional groups are correctly identified in relation to the carboxylate.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: Include additional **test cases** using the example molecules provided in each rule to validate and refine the code. Ensure that both high-yield and low-yield examples are correctly classified according to their respective rules.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxyl groups or polar heterocycles** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Additional carboxylate groups and heterocyclic rings with nitrogen enhance metal chelation and stabilize the catalyst, improving efficiency.

   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid; extra carboxylate group)
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid; extra carboxylate group)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan; indole ring with nitrogen)
   - **Low Yield Counter-Example**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine; lacks additional coordinating groups) – Low Yield

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., nitro, halogens) attached directly to the aromatic ring** tend to give a **high yield**, whereas those with **electron-donating substituents (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxyl groups)** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylate, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and weaken metal coordination.

   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Bromomethyl group is electron-withdrawing)
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing)
   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Methyl group is electron-donating)
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Hydroxyl group is electron-donating)

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing **nitrogenous heterocycles capable of coordinating with metals**, such as **pyridine or pyrazole carboxylic acids**, tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles can act as additional coordination sites, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and catalyst performance.

   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nitrogen atom adjacent to the carboxyl group)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Pyrazole ring with coordinating nitrogen)
   - **Low Yield Example**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Possible unfavorable coordination geometry) – Low Yield

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that have **additional functional groups capable of chelating metals (e.g., thiols, multiple hydroxyls) in proximity to the carboxylate group** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Chelating ligands with multiple coordinating sites form more stable complexes with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Thiol group enhances coordination)
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Multiple hydroxyl groups enable chelation)

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers with **aliphatic chains of optimal length (e.g., C8) without interfering functional groups** can give a **high yield**, but longer chains or additional polar groups distant from the carboxylate tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Optimal chain length balances hydrophobic interactions and solubility, facilitating effective interaction with the catalyst. Longer chains or distant polar groups may hinder coordination or affect solubility adversely.

   - **High Yield Example**:
     - **Octanoic acid** (Eight-carbon chain provides optimal balance)
   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Hydroxyl group distant from the carboxylate)
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Amino group distant from the carboxylate)

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing **polar functional groups distant from the carboxylate group**, such as **hydroxyl or amino groups at the end of long aliphatic chains**, tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Remote polar groups may not effectively participate in metal coordination and can interfere with catalyst interaction or solubility.

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers with **bulky substituents near the carboxylate group that are non-coordinating or electron-donating**, such as **aromatic rings without additional coordinating groups**, tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Bulky groups can introduce steric hindrance, reducing the effectiveness of metal coordination and catalyst performance.

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine; bulky phenyl group)
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Bulky aromatic ring with electron-donating hydroxyl group)

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **polyether chains or multiple ether linkages** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Ether oxygens are weakly coordinating, and flexible polyether chains can increase solubility in the solvent, reducing interaction with the catalyst surface.

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Multiple ether linkages)
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Ether-containing chain with amino group)

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **strong electron-withdrawing groups that excessively decrease electron density on the carboxylate oxygen**, such as **perfluoroalkyl chains**, tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Overly electron-deficient carboxylate groups may not coordinate effectively with metal centers.

   - **Low Yield Example**:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Perfluorinated chain)

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that have **functional groups which may interfere with metal coordination**, such as **aldehyde groups or amide bonds adjacent to the carboxylate**, tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Aldehyde groups can participate in side reactions or inhibit coordination; amide groups can reduce coordination ability due to resonance delocalization.

    - **Low Yield Examples**:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Aldehyde group adjacent to carboxylate)
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Amide group near carboxylate)

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Enhance SMARTS patterns for electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups in Rule 2 and Rule 2.1.** The current code only checks for specific groups like nitro, halogens, methyl, methoxy, hydroxyl, and amino groups attached directly to the aromatic ring. To accurately reflect the natural language rules, expand the SMARTS patterns to include other electron-donating groups such as thiol (`-SH`) and alkoxy groups, and other electron-withdrawing groups like cyano (`-CN`) and carbonyl groups (`-C(=O)-`). For example:
  - Add `'thiol_on_aromatic': '[c][SX2H]'` to detect thiol groups on aromatic rings for Rule 2.1.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Modify Rule 4 to ensure chelating groups are in proximity to the carboxylate group.** The current code checks for thiol or multiple hydroxyl groups anywhere in the molecule, which may not align with the rule that specifies these groups should be near the carboxylate. Update the evaluation to confirm that these groups are adjacent or vicinal to the carboxylic acid. This can be done by defining SMARTS that specify the distance:
  - Use `'thiol_adjacent_to_cooh': '[CX3](=O)[O;H1,-1][CX4][SX2H]'`
  - Use substructure searches that ensure hydroxyl groups are within two bonds of the carboxylate.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Refine Rule 10 to match functional groups adjacent to the carboxylate group.** The current SMARTS patterns for aldehyde and amide groups do not ensure they are adjacent to the carboxylate. Modify the patterns to reflect adjacency:
  - `'aldehyde_adjacent_to_cooh': '[CX3](=O)[O;H1,-1][CX4][CX3H](=O)'`
  - `'amide_adjacent_to_cooh': '[CX3](=O)[O;H1,-1][CX4][CX3](=O)[NX3H2]'`

- **Suggestion 4**: **Improve detection of bulky substituents near the carboxylate in Rule 7.** The current pattern for `'bulky_substituent_near_carboxylate'` may not capture all relevant bulky groups. Expand the SMARTS to include various bulky groups such as tert-butyl, isopropyl, and aromatic rings:
  - `'bulky_near_cooh': '[CX3](=O)[O;H1,-1][CX4]([CX4,CX3,Cc])'`

- **Suggestion 5**: **Consider the spatial relationship between functional groups for all rules.** Include proximity checks in SMARTS patterns where the rules specify functional groups "in proximity" or "distant" from the carboxylate group. Utilize recursive SMARTS or atom mapping to enforce distance constraints between the carboxylate and other groups.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Use molecule sanitation and Kekulization to ensure accurate substructure matching.** Before applying rules, sanitize and Kekulize molecules to standardize bond representations. This can prevent mismatches due to different aromatic representations in SMILES strings.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Add error handling for molecules that cannot be parsed or sanitized.** In the code, when a molecule cannot be parsed by RDKit, instead of assigning a row of zeros, consider logging an error or skipping the molecule to avoid misleading results in the feature matrix.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Validate the SMARTS patterns against known examples.** Test each SMARTS pattern individually on molecules known to match or not match the corresponding rule. This will help ensure that the patterns accurately capture the intended chemical features.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Review and update the logic in rule evaluations to handle multiple functional groups correctly.** Ensure that the presence of one functional group does not incorrectly override the influence of another, especially when a rule specifies that certain groups should not be present.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Include additional descriptors or fingerprints to capture electronic and steric effects more comprehensively.** Since SMARTS patterns may not fully capture the nuances of electronic donating or withdrawing effects, consider integrating computational chemistry tools or descriptors that quantify these effects.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

Based on the provided metrics, we can evaluate the performance of the current rules by comparing them with the reference metrics from previous rule matrices. Our focus will be on **confidence** and **lift**, as they are critical indicators of rule effectiveness in predicting high yields.

---

**1. Train Confidence**

- **Previous Mean Train Confidence**: Approximately **0.5874**
  - Calculated from the reference metrics: [0.6352, 0.5396]

- **Current Train Confidence**: **0.6937**

**Commentary**:

The current train confidence of **0.6937** represents a significant improvement over the previous mean of **0.5874**. This increase indicates that, when the rule conditions are met, the likelihood of achieving a high yield has improved. Higher confidence means that the rules are more reliable in predicting the desired outcome.

---

**2. Train Lift**

- **Previous Mean Train Lift**: Approximately **1.1304**
  - Calculated from the reference metrics: [1.2048, 1.0559]

- **Current Train Lift**: **1.3747**

**Commentary**:

The current train lift of **1.3747** is notably higher than the previous mean of **1.1304**. A lift greater than 1 signifies that the rule is better at predicting the outcome than random chance. The higher the lift, the stronger the association between the rule conditions and the high yield. This improvement suggests that the current rules are more effective in capturing the underlying factors that contribute to high yields.

---

**3. Train Support**

- **Previous Mean Train Support**: Approximately **0.1756**
  - Calculated from the reference metrics: [0.1667, 0.1845]

- **Current Train Support**: **0.1091**

**Commentary**:

The train support has decreased from the previous mean of **0.1756** to **0.1091**. While this indicates that the rules now cover a smaller portion of the dataset, the trade-off with higher confidence and lift may be acceptable. Lower support with higher confidence means that, although the rules apply to fewer cases, they are more accurate when they do apply.

---

**4. Train Leverage**

- **Previous Mean Train Leverage**: Approximately **0.0124**
  - Calculated from the reference metrics: [0.0289, -0.0041]

- **Current Train Leverage**: **0.0178**

**Commentary**:

An increased positive leverage from **0.0124** to **0.0178** suggests that the current rules identify stronger associations than would be expected by chance. This enhancement indicates that the rules are effectively capturing meaningful patterns in the data.

---

**Evaluation of Iterations and Local Minimum**

The improvements in **confidence** and **lift** suggest that the current iteration has advanced the performance of the rules. However, the decrease in **support** implies that the rules have become more specific, potentially overlooking broader patterns that could apply to a larger portion of the dataset.

Determining if a local minimum has been reached requires assessing whether further iterations can yield better performance. The current metrics show progress, but the reduction in support indicates there might be room for improvement in balancing the specificity and generality of the rules.

---

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

1. **Balance Specificity and Generality**:

   - **Increase Support Without Sacrificing Confidence**:
     - Explore generalizing some rules to apply to a broader set of data points while maintaining high confidence and lift.
     - For example, identify common features among high-yield modifiers that could be included in the rules without diluting their predictive power.

2. **Refine Rule Conditions**:

   - **Eliminate Overly Specific Conditions**:
     - Review the rules for conditions that may be too restrictive.
     - Combine similar rules where appropriate to simplify the rule set and increase support.

   - **Focus on Key Functional Groups**:
     - Emphasize functional groups or structural features that have the most significant impact on yield.
     - Prioritize conditions that contribute most to confidence and lift.

3. **Incorporate Additional Data Analysis**:

   - **Feature Importance Analysis**:
     - Use statistical methods to determine which features have the strongest associations with high yield.
     - Adjust rules to include these influential features.

   - **Correlation Analysis**:
     - Identify any correlations between modifiers and yields that are not currently captured.
     - Update rules to reflect these correlations.

4. **Cross-Validation**:

   - **Test Rules on Validation Sets**:
     - Apply the current rules to a validation dataset to ensure they generalize well beyond the training data.
     - Adjust rules based on performance in validation to prevent overfitting.

5. **Iterative Optimization**:

   - **Further Iterations**:
     - Continue iterating on rule development, monitoring changes in support, confidence, lift, and leverage.
     - Utilize optimization algorithms to explore the search space more effectively.

6. **Engage Domain Expertise**:

   - **Expert Review of Rules**:
     - Have domain experts review the rules for chemical plausibility and relevance.
     - Incorporate expert feedback to refine rules in ways that may not be immediately evident from data alone.

7. **Consider the Impact of Low Yield Examples**:

   - **Analyze Low Yield Counter-Examples**:
     - Investigate why certain modifiers lead to low yields despite having seemingly favorable features.
     - Update rules to account for exceptions and improve overall accuracy.

---

**Conclusion**

The current rules demonstrate improved performance in predicting high yields, as evidenced by increased **confidence** and **lift**. However, the decreased **support** suggests that the rules are applicable to a smaller subset of data, which may limit their practical utility.

To enhance the rules further, efforts should focus on broadening their applicability without compromising their predictive strength. By balancing specificity with generality, refining rule conditions, and incorporating additional data-driven insights, the rules can achieve better overall performance.

Continued iterations, guided by both statistical metrics and domain expertise, are recommended to optimize the rules. Monitoring changes in metrics with each iteration will help determine when an optimal balance has been reached, indicating that further iterations yield diminishing returns and that a local minimum may have been approached.

ML Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Validation and Training Accuracies**

The current 5-fold cross-validation accuracy achieved by the classification model is **71.43%**. This indicates that the model correctly predicts the catalyst modifier loading for approximately 71% of the cases in the validation set. Compared to previous reference accuracies, which hovered around **76%** with test accuracies of **75%** and **62.5%**, the current model's performance is slightly lower but within a similar range.

Previous iterations showed varying validation accuracies:

- **62.86%**, **82.86%**, **60%**, **71.43%**, and **57.14%**.

This fluctuation suggests that while the model maintains moderate predictive capability, consistency and reliability can be improved.

**Assessment of Overfitting and Underfitting**

Given that the validation accuracy is not excessively high and there is variability across different iterations, the model does not appear to be overfitting. Overfitting would be indicated by a significantly higher training accuracy compared to validation accuracy, which is not evident here. However, the moderate accuracy levels and fluctuations suggest potential **underfitting**. The model may not be capturing all the underlying patterns in the data, indicating that the current set of rules might be insufficiently expressive to model the complexity of the problem fully.

**SHAP Value Analysis**

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values provide insights into how each rule contributes to the predictions for each molecule. Analyzing the SHAP values helps identify which rules positively or negatively influence the model's output, particularly in cases where there is a discrepancy between predicted and experimental values.

     - **Significant Negative SHAP Contributions:**
       - **Rule 4:** -0.0840
       - **Rule 6:** -0.0271

2. **Overestimated Loadings (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**

   - **Molecule:** *C1=CC(=CC=C1CCCCC(=O)O)O*
     - **Prediction:** Low loading
     - **Experimental:** High loading
     - **Significant Negative SHAP Contributions:**
       - **Rule 4:** -0.0840
       - **Rule 6:** -0.0271

   - **Molecule:** *C1=CC(=CC=C1C2=CC=NC=C2)C(=O)O*
     - **Prediction:** High loading
     - **Experimental:** Low loading
     - **Significant Positive SHAP Contributions:**
       - **Rule 4:** 0.5255

In cases where the model underestimates the loading (predicts low when it is high experimentally), **Rule 1**, **Rule 4**, and **Rule 6** have significant negative SHAP values. This suggests that these rules are contributing to the erroneous predictions by suppressing the model output towards low loading.

Conversely, in overestimation cases, **Rule 4** shows a significant positive contribution, indicating that it may be overemphasizing certain features leading to a high loading prediction when the experimental value is low.

**Interpretation of Accuracy Metrics**

The current validation accuracy suggests a moderate probability of improvement. While the model is able to predict correctly in over 70% of cases, the misclassifications highlight areas where the rules may not be fully capturing the relationship between molecular features and catalyst loading. The presence of both underestimations and overestimations indicates that adjustments to the rules could enhance predictive performance.

**Insights from SHAP Analysis**

The SHAP analysis indicates:

- **Rule 1** (α-amino acids with additional carboxyl/polar heterocycles) may be too restrictive or not fully accounting for all beneficial functional groups, leading to underestimations.

- **Rule 4** (additional chelating functional groups) shows both significant negative and positive contributions, suggesting inconsistent performance. It may be overemphasizing certain functional groups while neglecting others.

- **Rule 6** (polar groups distant from the carboxylate leading to low yield) consistently contributes negative SHAP values in underestimated cases, indicating that it might be penalizing modifiers that actually exhibit high loading experimentally.

**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

The current rules provide a foundational framework but demonstrate limitations in accurately predicting catalyst modifier loading:

- **Effectiveness:** The rules capture some relevant chemical features but may lack the flexibility or specificity needed for accurate predictions across diverse molecules.

- **Overfitting/Underfitting:** The model does not appear to be overfitting, as evidenced by moderate validation accuracy and consistency across folds. However, the underfitting is suggested by persistent misclassifications, indicating the rules may not be capturing all relevant patterns.

- **Discrepancies:** Significant discrepancies between predictions and experimental values highlight rules that may need refinement, particularly those with high negative or positive SHAP contributions in misclassified cases.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

To enhance the performance of the model, the following improvements to the current rules are suggested:

1. **Refine Rule 1:**

   - **Issue:** Negative SHAP contributions in underestimated cases suggest Rule 1 may be too narrow.
   - **Action:**
     - **Broaden the Scope:** Include modifiers with other coordinating functional groups beyond carboxyl groups and polar heterocycles, such as hydroxyl and amino groups, which may also enhance metal coordination.
     - **Consider Stereochemistry:** Incorporate the impact of stereochemistry on coordination, as chiral centers may influence catalytic activity.
     - **Example Adjustment:** Modify Rule 1 to include α-amino acids with side chains containing **any additional polar or coordinating functional groups**.

2. **Adjust Rule 4:**

   - **Issue:** Inconsistent SHAP contributions indicate that Rule 4 may not be adequately capturing the role of chelating groups.
   - **Action:**
     - **Clarify Functional Groups:** Specify which functional groups are considered effective chelators and ensure their effects are accurately represented.
     - **Assess Proximity and Geometry:** Consider the spatial arrangement of chelating groups relative to the carboxylate, as this affects the chelation potential.
     - **Example Adjustment:** Refine Rule 4 to account for **both the type and position of chelating groups**, emphasizing those that are proximal and favorably oriented for metal coordination.

3. **Reevaluate Rule 6:**

   - **Issue:** Persistent negative SHAP contributions suggest Rule 6 may be overly penalizing modifiers with distant polar groups that could still participate in catalysis.
   - **Action:**
     - **Incorporate Flexibility:** Recognize that molecular flexibility may allow distant polar groups to interact with the catalyst.
     - **Quantify Distance Impact:** Modify the rule to consider a range or threshold distance beyond which polar groups have diminishing effects, rather than a binary inclusion.
     - **Example Adjustment:** Adjust Rule 6 to state that **distant polar groups may contribute to low yield unless molecular flexibility allows effective interaction**.

4. **Balance Rule 2:**

   - **Issue:** Overemphasis on electron-withdrawing groups may result in overestimations.
   - **Action:**
     - **Differentiate Between Substituent Effects:** Recognize that not all electron-withdrawing groups have the same impact; some may excessively decrease electron density, hindering coordination.
     - **Incorporate Resonance and Inductive Effects:** Better account for how substituents influence the carboxylate group's ability to coordinate with metals.
     - **Example Adjustment:** Adjust Rule 2 to **consider the strength and nature of electron-withdrawing/donating groups**, possibly categorizing them based on their Hammett sigma constants.

5. **Introduce New Rules or Features:**

   - **Action:**
     - **Include Additional Descriptors:** Consider incorporating quantitative molecular descriptors such as pKa, logP, molecular flexibility, or coordination number.
     - **Leverage Computational Chemistry:** Use molecular modeling to predict interaction energies between the modifier and catalyst, incorporating these predictions into the model.
     - **Modify Rule Set Structure:** Allow for interactions between rules, recognizing that combinations of features may have synergistic or antagonistic effects.

6. **Iterative Model Refinement:**

   - **Action:**
     - **Continuous SHAP Analysis:** After adjusting the rules, re-run the SHAP analysis to evaluate the impact of changes.
     - **Focus on Misclassified Molecules:** Pay special attention to molecules that remain misclassified, seeking patterns or features that could be codified into new or adjusted rules.
     - **Update Rule Weights:** If the model allows, adjust the weighting of rules based on their predictive power and SHAP value contributions.

7. **Address Underfitting:**

   - **Action:**
     - **Increase Model Complexity:** If appropriate, consider using a more complex model that can capture nonlinear relationships.
     - **Expand the Dataset:** Incorporate more experimental data to give the model a broader basis for learning patterns.

**Conclusion**

By refining the existing rules with insights drawn from the SHAP analysis and addressing the identified issues, the model's predictive accuracy can be improved. Focusing on rules that contribute to misclassifications, such as **Rule 1**, **Rule 4**, and **Rule 6**, and adjusting them to be more inclusive or representative of the underlying chemistry, will help enhance the model's performance. Introducing additional features and allowing for a nuanced interpretation of molecular interactions will further address underfitting and lead to more accurate predictions of catalyst modifier loading.

**1. Summary of Discussions and Suggestions to Improve Current Rules**

*Summary of Discussions:*

The analysis of the current rules for predicting high yields in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction revealed both strengths and areas for improvement. The key findings are:

- **Improved Metrics:** The current rules show increased train confidence (0.6937) and lift (1.3747) compared to previous iterations, indicating better predictive performance when the rules apply.
  
- **Decreased Support:** The train support decreased to 0.1091 from a previous mean of 0.1756, suggesting the rules now cover fewer data points.

- **SHAP Analysis:** Significant discrepancies between predicted and experimental values were identified. Rules 1, 4, and 6 were highlighted as contributing to misclassifications, either underestimating or overestimating the catalyst modifier loading.

- **Validation Accuracy:** The 5-fold cross-validation accuracy is moderate at 71.43%, with fluctuations across iterations, indicating the model may not fully capture the complexity of the data.

*Suggestions to Improve Current Rules:*

1. **Refine Rule 1 (α-Amino Acids with Side Chains Containing Additional Carboxyl Groups or Polar Heterocycles):**
   - **Issue:** The rule may be too restrictive, excluding modifiers that could yield high results.
   - **Improvement:** Expand Rule 1 to include α-amino acids with side chains containing any additional polar or coordinating functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino groups). Consider the effects of stereochemistry and chiral centers on metal coordination and catalyst performance.

2. **Adjust Rule 2 (Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Electron-Withdrawing or Donating Substituents):**
   - **Issue:** Overemphasis on electron-withdrawing groups may lead to overestimations, while not all electron-donating groups equally affect yield.
   - **Improvement:** Differentiate between the strengths of electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups by incorporating Hammett sigma constants or similar parameters. Recognize that very strong electron-withdrawing groups might excessively reduce electron density on the carboxylate, hindering coordination.

3. **Refine Rule 4 (Modifiers with Additional Chelating Groups Near the Carboxylate):**
   - **Issue:** The rule may not specify the proximity required for effective chelation, leading to inconsistent predictions.
   - **Improvement:** Modify Rule 4 to ensure that chelating functional groups (e.g., thiols, hydroxyls) are in close proximity to the carboxylate group. Emphasize the importance of spatial arrangement and molecular geometry in facilitating effective metal coordination.

4. **Reevaluate Rule 6 (Modifiers with Polar Groups Distant from the Carboxylate):**
   - **Issue:** The rule might be too penalizing, undervaluing modifiers where distant polar groups still contribute positively due to molecular flexibility.
   - **Improvement:** Incorporate the concept of molecular flexibility, allowing for the possibility that distant polar groups can interact with the catalyst if the molecule's conformation permits. Adjust the rule to consider the effective distance rather than an absolute threshold.

5. **Enhance SMARTS Patterns for Functional Groups:**
   - **Suggestion:** Improve the SMARTS patterns used in computational analyses to accurately reflect functional groups and their positions relative to the carboxylate group. Include patterns for additional electron-donating and withdrawing groups, ensuring that proximity and adjacency are properly defined.

6. **Include Additional Molecular Descriptors:**
   - **Suggestion:** Integrate quantitative descriptors such as pKa values, logP (octanol-water partition coefficient), molecular flexibility, and coordination number to capture electronic and steric effects more comprehensively. These descriptors can enhance the model's ability to predict yields based on subtle molecular differences.

7. **Validate and Test SMARTS Patterns Against Known Examples:**
   - **Suggestion:** Systematically test each SMARTS pattern with molecules known to match or not match the corresponding rule. This validation ensures that patterns accurately capture the intended chemical features and that the rules are applied correctly.

8. **Balance Specificity and Generality of Rules:**
   - **Suggestion:** Adjust the rules to increase their applicability (support) without significantly sacrificing confidence and lift. By slightly generalizing overly specific rules, the model can cover more data points while maintaining predictive accuracy.

9. **Iterative Refinement with Expert Input:**
   - **Suggestion:** Engage domain experts to review the rules for chemical plausibility and relevance. Experts can provide insights into subtle chemical interactions and suggest modifications that data-driven approaches might overlook.

10. **Address Underfitting:**
    - **Suggestion:** Increase the model's complexity if necessary, perhaps by incorporating machine learning algorithms that capture nonlinear relationships. Expand the dataset to include more diverse examples, improving the model's ability to learn patterns and reduce underfitting.

**2. Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

There is a clear opportunity for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. The moderate validation accuracy and the identified discrepancies in predictions suggest that the rules are not yet fully capturing all relevant factors influencing the yield. By implementing the suggested improvements—refining rules, enhancing computational patterns, and incorporating additional molecular descriptors—the model's predictive performance can be enhanced while maintaining generalizability.

    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxyl groups or polar heterocycles** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Additional carboxylate groups and heterocyclic rings with nitrogen enhance metal chelation and stabilize the catalyst, improving efficiency.

   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid; extra carboxylate group)
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid; extra carboxylate group)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan; indole ring with nitrogen)
   - **Low Yield Counter-Example**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine; lacks additional coordinating groups) – Low Yield

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., nitro, halogens) attached directly to the aromatic ring** tend to give a **high yield**, whereas those with **electron-donating substituents (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxyl groups)** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylate, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and weaken metal coordination.

   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Bromomethyl group is electron-withdrawing)
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing)
   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Methyl group is electron-donating)
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Hydroxyl group is electron-donating)

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing **nitrogenous heterocycles capable of coordinating with metals**, such as **pyridine or pyrazole carboxylic acids**, tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles can act as additional coordination sites, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and catalyst performance.

   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nitrogen atom adjacent to the carboxyl group)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Pyrazole ring with coordinating nitrogen)
   - **Low Yield Example**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Possible unfavorable coordination geometry) – Low Yield

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that have **additional functional groups capable of chelating metals (e.g., thiols, multiple hydroxyls) in proximity to the carboxylate group** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Chelating ligands with multiple coordinating sites form more stable complexes with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Thiol group enhances coordination)
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Multiple hydroxyl groups enable chelation)

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers with **aliphatic chains of optimal length (e.g., C8) without interfering functional groups** can give a **high yield**, but longer chains or additional polar groups distant from the carboxylate tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Optimal chain length balances hydrophobic interactions and solubility, facilitating effective interaction with the catalyst. Longer chains or distant polar groups may hinder coordination or affect solubility adversely.

   - **High Yield Example**:
     - **Octanoic acid** (Eight-carbon chain provides optimal balance)
   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Hydroxyl group distant from the carboxylate)
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Amino group distant from the carboxylate)

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing **polar functional groups distant from the carboxylate group**, such as **hydroxyl or amino groups at the end of long aliphatic chains**, tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Remote polar groups may not effectively participate in metal coordination and can interfere with catalyst interaction or solubility.

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers with **bulky substituents near the carboxylate group that are non-coordinating or electron-donating**, such as **aromatic rings without additional coordinating groups**, tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Bulky groups can introduce steric hindrance, reducing the effectiveness of metal coordination and catalyst performance.

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine; bulky phenyl group)
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Bulky aromatic ring with electron-donating hydroxyl group)

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **polyether chains or multiple ether linkages** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Ether oxygens are weakly coordinating, and flexible polyether chains can increase solubility in the solvent, reducing interaction with the catalyst surface.

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Multiple ether linkages)
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Ether-containing chain with amino group)

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **strong electron-withdrawing groups that excessively decrease electron density on the carboxylate oxygen**, such as **perfluoroalkyl chains**, tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Overly electron-deficient carboxylate groups may not coordinate effectively with metal centers.

   - **Low Yield Example**:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Perfluorinated chain)

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that have **functional groups which may interfere with metal coordination**, such as **aldehyde groups or amide bonds adjacent to the carboxylate**, tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Aldehyde groups can participate in side reactions or inhibit coordination; amide groups can reduce coordination ability due to resonance delocalization.

    - **Low Yield Examples**:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Aldehyde group adjacent to carboxylate)
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Amide group near carboxylate)

**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Refine Rule 1** to include α-amino acids with side chains containing any additional polar or coordinating functional groups, not just carboxyl groups or polar heterocycles. Modify the SMARTS pattern in Rule 1 to recognize side chains with hydroxyl (`-OH`), amino (`-NH₂`), or thiol (`-SH`) groups adjacent to the α-carbon. Consider the stereochemistry by specifying chirality in the SMARTS pattern when relevant, ensuring that both D- and L- amino acids are considered if they can affect coordination and yield.

- **Advice 2**: **Adjust Rule 2** to differentiate between the strengths of electron-withdrawing and electron-donating substituents on aromatic carboxylic acids. Incorporate quantitative parameters such as Hammett sigma constants to assign thresholds for electron-withdrawing capability. Update the SMARTS patterns to specify positions of substituents relative to the carboxylate group (ortho, meta, para) and include common electron-withdrawing groups like nitro (`-NO₂`), cyano (`-CN`), and halogens, as well as electron-donating groups like methyl (`-CH₃`), methoxy (`-OCH₃`), and hydroxyl (`-OH`).

- **Advice 3**: **Refine Rule 4** by specifying that additional chelating functional groups must be in close proximity to the carboxylate group, typically within one or two atoms. Modify the SMARTS patterns to ensure these groups are adjacent (α or β positions) or form part of a chelating ring system with the carboxylate. Emphasize the importance of molecular geometry by including ring sizes and chelation angles that favor stable metal complexes.

- **Advice 4**: **Reevaluate Rule 6** to account for molecular flexibility and conformation. Modify the rule to consider that distant polar groups may contribute positively if the molecule is flexible enough to allow the polar group to interact with the metal center. Adjust the SMARTS patterns to include flexible linkers (e.g., alkyl chains) and incorporate a maximum effective distance (e.g., within 5 bonds) between the carboxylate and other coordinating groups.

- **Advice 5**: **Enhance SMARTS patterns** across all rules to accurately reflect functional groups and their positions relative to the carboxylate group. Include SMARTS patterns for additional functional groups such as aldehydes (`-CHO`), amides (`-CONH₂`), ethers (`-O-`), and thiols (`-SH`). Ensure that the patterns correctly identify the proximity of these groups to the carboxylate and distinguish between adjacent and distant positions.

- **Advice 6**: **Include additional molecular descriptors** in the rules to capture electronic and steric effects more comprehensively. Integrate properties such as:
  - **pKa values** of the carboxylic acid group to assess its acidity and coordination ability.
  - **LogP values** to consider the molecule's hydrophobicity and its effect on solubility and interaction with the catalyst.
  - **Number of potential coordination sites** to evaluate the ligand's ability to chelate the metal center.
  - **Molecular flexibility** indicators, such as the number of rotatable bonds.

- **Advice 7**: **Validate and test SMARTS patterns** against known examples. For each rule, systematically test the updated SMARTS patterns with modifiers that are known to yield high and low results to ensure accurate classification. Adjust the patterns based on these validations to correct any misclassifications.

- **Advice 8**: **Balance the specificity and generality** of the rules to increase their applicability without significantly sacrificing confidence and lift. For example, if a rule is too narrow and applies to very few compounds, consider generalizing certain conditions (e.g., allow for a range of chain lengths or functional groups) to cover more modifiers while maintaining predictive accuracy.

- **Advice 9**: **Remove redundant or conflicting rules** and consider combining similar rules to simplify the rule set. For instance, if Rules 5 and 6 both address chain length and the effect of distant polar groups, they could be integrated into a single, more comprehensive rule that accounts for both factors.

- **Advice 10**: **Incorporate findings from machine learning analyses** to inform rule refinement. Use algorithms to identify non-linear relationships and interactions between molecular features that may not be apparent from the current rules. Leverage these insights to adjust existing rules or create new ones that capture complex patterns influencing the yield.

**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains containing additional coordinating groups** such as **extra carboxylate groups or nitrogen-containing heterocycles** tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Additional coordinating groups enhance chelation with metal centers, stabilizing the catalyst and improving efficiency.

   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid; extra carboxylate group)
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid; extra carboxylate group)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan; indole ring with nitrogen)

   - **Low Yield Counter-Example**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine; lacks additional coordinating groups)

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents** (e.g., **nitro, halogens**) attached directly to the aromatic ring tend to give a **high yield**, whereas those with **electron-donating substituents** (e.g., **methyl, methoxy, hydroxyl groups**) tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylate, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and weaken metal coordination.

   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Bromomethyl group is electron-withdrawing)
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing)

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Methyl group is electron-donating)
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Hydroxyl group is electron-donating)

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing **nitrogenous heterocycles capable of coordinating with metals**, such as **pyridine or pyrazole carboxylic acids**, tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles act as additional coordination sites, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and catalyst performance.

   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid; pyridine ring with nitrogen)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Pyrazole ring with coordinating nitrogen)

   - **Low Yield Counter-Example**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Possible steric hindrance or unfavorable coordination geometry)

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that have **additional functional groups capable of chelating metals near the carboxylate group**, such as **thiols or multiple hydroxyls**, tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Chelating ligands with multiple coordinating sites form more stable complexes with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Thiol group enhances coordination)
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid; multiple hydroxyl groups enable chelation)

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** (e.g., **C6–C8 chains**) without interfering functional groups tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Optimal chain length balances hydrophobic interactions and solubility, facilitating effective interaction with the catalyst.

   - **High Yield Example**:
     - **Octanoic acid** (Eight-carbon chain provides optimal balance)

   - **Low Yield Counter-Examples**:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Hydroxyl group distant from the carboxylate)
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Amino group distant from the carboxylate)

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing **polar functional groups distant from the carboxylate group**, such as **hydroxyl or amino groups at the end of long aliphatic chains**, tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Remote polar groups may not effectively participate in metal coordination and can interfere with catalyst interaction or solubility.

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers with **bulky non-coordinating substituents adjacent to the carboxylate group**, such as **aromatic rings without additional coordinating groups**, tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Bulky groups introduce steric hindrance, reducing the effectiveness of metal coordination and catalyst performance.

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine; bulky phenyl group)
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Bulky aromatic ring with electron-donating hydroxyl group)

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **polyether chains or multiple ether linkages** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Ether oxygens are weakly coordinating, and flexible polyether chains can increase solubility in the solvent, reducing interaction with the catalyst surface.

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Multiple ether linkages)
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Ether-containing chain with amino group)

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **strong electron-withdrawing groups that excessively decrease electron density on the carboxylate oxygen**, such as **perfluoroalkyl chains**, tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Overly electron-deficient carboxylate groups may not coordinate effectively with metal centers, diminishing catalyst activity.

   - **Low Yield Example**:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Perfluorinated chain reduces electron density)

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that have **functional groups which may interfere with metal coordination**, such as **aldehyde groups, ketones, or amide bonds adjacent to the carboxylate**, tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: These groups can participate in side reactions or compete with the carboxylate for metal coordination, inhibiting catalyst function.

    - **Low Yield Examples**:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Aldehyde group adjacent to carboxylate)
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Ketone group near carboxylate)
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Amide group near carboxylate)

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Refine the rules to focus on quantifiable molecular descriptors** that can be directly extracted from SMILES strings. By specifying features such as the count of specific atoms (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur), types of functional groups, and ring systems, the rules become more amenable to numerical representation.

- **Advice 2**: **Standardize functional group categories and assign numerical codes**. Create a defined list of functional groups relevant to the reaction (e.g., carboxylic acids, amines, hydroxyls, thiols, aromatic rings, heterocycles) and encode their presence or absence numerically to facilitate feature matrix generation.

- **Advice 3**: **Incorporate physicochemical properties as rule criteria**, such as pKa values, LogP (octanol-water partition coefficient), molecular weight, and topological polar surface area (TPSA). These properties can be calculated from SMILES strings and provide numerical values for modeling.

- **Advice 4**: **Use substructure matching to define rules based on specific structural motifs**. Specify SMARTS patterns for key functional groups or substructures that influence yield, enabling automated extraction of features from SMILES data.

- **Advice 5**: **Quantify electron-withdrawing and electron-donating effects using Hammett sigma constants**. Assign numerical values to substituents based on their electronic effects, which can be summed if multiple substituents are present, providing a continuous variable for modeling yield.

- **Advice 6**: **Evaluate steric factors using molecular descriptors like molar refractivity or Sterimol parameters**. These descriptors quantify the size and shape of substituents, allowing for numerical assessment of steric hindrance near coordination sites.

- **Advice 7**: **Incorporate counts of coordinating atoms and coordination numbers**. Define rules based on the number of potential coordinating sites (e.g., lone pairs on nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur atoms) and their spatial arrangement, which can be numerically quantified.

- **Advice 8**: **Simplify complex rules by breaking them into independent, binary features**. For example, instead of a rule stating that modifiers with "bulky non-coordinating substituents adjacent to the carboxylate group give low yield," create separate binary features for "presence of bulky substituent" and "proximity to carboxylate group."

- **Advice 9**: **Prioritize rules that rely on readily computable properties from SMILES**, avoiding those that require subjective interpretation or complex chemical reasoning. This ensures that feature extraction can be automated and reproducible.

- **Advice 10**: **Reassess and consolidate existing rules to eliminate redundancies and contradictions**. For instance, if multiple rules relate to electron-withdrawing groups, consider merging them into a single rule with a quantifiable parameter, such as an overall electron-withdrawing score.

     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing **thiol groups near the carboxylate**, such as **mercapto carboxylic acids**, tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Thiol groups can form strong bonds with metal centers, enhancing coordination and catalyst stability.

   - **High Yield Example**:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Thiol group adjacent to carboxylate)

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers with **multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxylate**, such as **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids**, tend to give a **high yield**. Conversely, modifiers with **multiple ether linkages** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Adjacent hydroxyl groups can participate in chelation, enhancing coordination. Ether linkages may not contribute effectively to coordination and might increase flexibility.

   - **High Yield Example**:
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid; multiple hydroxyl groups)

     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Bulky aromatic ring with hydroxyl group)

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that have **polyether chains or multiple ether linkages**, especially when distant from the carboxylate group, tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Ether oxygen atoms are weakly coordinating, and flexible chains may reduce effective interaction with the catalyst.

    - **Low Yield Examples**:

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear in specifying that amino acids with side chains containing additional coordinating groups, such as extra carboxylate groups or nitrogen-containing heterocycles, tend to give a high yield. The rationale provides adequate physical-chemical insight by explaining how additional coordinating groups enhance chelation with metal centers, stabilizing the catalyst. The rule considers combinations of structural features (amino acid backbone and side chain functionality), satisfying the complexity criterion. It is well-supported by multiple data points in the dataset (entries 0, 2, and 14 for high yield, and entry 12 as a low yield counter-example), fulfilling the coverage requirement. Therefore, Rule 1 effectively meets all the criteria.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 clearly defines that aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing substituents lead to a high yield, while those with electron-donating substituents lead to a low yield. The rationale offers property insight by relating substituent effects to carboxylate acidity and coordination ability. The rule demonstrates complexity by considering both the aromatic system and the nature of substituents. It is supported by data points (entries 1 and 20 for high yield, entries 22 and 18 for low yield). However, there is an exception with 4-aminobenzoic acid (entry 4), which has an electron-donating amino group yet gives a high yield. This suggests that the rule may need refinement to account for cases where electron-donating groups can coordinate with metals, indicating that the coverage might not fully encompass all relevant data points.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear in identifying that modifiers containing nitrogenous heterocycles capable of coordinating with metals tend to give a high yield. The rationale provides solid property insight into the role of nitrogen atoms as additional coordination sites. The rule demonstrates complexity by focusing on specific heterocycles combined with carboxylic acids. It is supported by data points (entries 15 and 21 for high yield) and includes a counter-example (entry 11 for low yield). However, the high yield of 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid (entry 24) suggests that linker length and steric factors influence the outcome. The rule could be improved by incorporating these factors to enhance its clarity and coverage.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 clearly states that medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (C6–C8) without additional polar functional groups tend to give a high yield, while those with polar groups distant from the carboxylate give a low yield. The rationale provides property insight into how hydrophobic interactions and optimal solubility facilitate effective catalyst interaction. The rule demonstrates complexity by considering chain length and the presence or absence of functional groups. It is well-supported by data points (entry 5 for high yield; entries 29, 31, and 34 for low yield), satisfying the coverage criterion. Rule 4 effectively meets all the criteria.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear in specifying that modifiers containing thiol groups near the carboxylate tend to give a high yield. The rationale offers property insight into the strong bonding of thiol groups with metal centers. However, the rule lacks complexity as it focuses on a single functional group and has limited coverage with only one supporting data point (entry 17). To strengthen the rule, additional examples or broader functional group considerations could be included to enhance coverage and meet the criteria more effectively.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 effectively distinguishes between modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxylate, leading to high yield, and those with multiple ether linkages, leading to low yield. The rationale provides adequate property insight into the chelation ability of hydroxyl groups versus the less effective coordination of ether linkages. The rule demonstrates complexity by considering combinations of functional groups and their positions relative to the carboxylate. It is well-supported by data points (entries 6 and 9 for high yield; entries 10 and 32 for low yield), fulfilling the coverage requirement. Rule 6 meets all the criteria effectively.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 clearly states that modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxylate, or amide bonds near the carboxylate, tend to give a low yield. The rationale offers property insight into possible competition for metal coordination or interference with catalyst activity. The rule considers combinations of functional groups, indicating complexity. It is supported by multiple data points (entries 19, 27, and 33), satisfying the coverage criterion. Rule 7 effectively meets all the criteria.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 specifies that modifiers containing strong electron-withdrawing groups like perfluoroalkyl chains tend to give a low yield. While the rationale provides property insight into the electron-deficient carboxylate's reduced coordination ability, the rule lacks complexity and has limited coverage, being supported by only one data point (entry 13). To improve the rule, additional examples or a broader range of electron-withdrawing groups could be considered to enhance coverage and meet the criteria more fully.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear in indicating that modifiers with bulky aromatic side chains without additional coordinating groups tend to give a low yield due to steric hindrance. The rationale provides adequate property insight. The rule demonstrates complexity by focusing on steric effects and the absence of coordinating groups. It is supported by data points (entries 12 and 30 for low yield). However, the high yield of 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid (entry 7) suggests that the distance of the bulky group from the carboxylate may mitigate steric hindrance. Refining the rule to account for the position of the bulky group could enhance its clarity and coverage.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 clearly states that modifiers with polyether chains or multiple ether linkages, especially when distant from the carboxylate group, tend to give a low yield. The rationale provides property insight into how weakly coordinating ether oxygen atoms and chain flexibility may reduce effective catalyst interaction. The rule demonstrates complexity by considering both the presence of ether linkages and their position. It is supported by data points (entries 10 and 32 for low yield), satisfying the coverage criterion. Rule 10 effectively meets all the criteria.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with side chains containing additional coordinating groups**, such as **extra carboxylate groups or nitrogen-containing heterocycles**, tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Additional coordinating groups enhance chelation with metal centers, stabilizing the catalyst and improving its efficiency.

   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid; extra carboxylate group)
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid; extra carboxylate group)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan; indole ring containing nitrogen)

   - **Low Yield Counter-Example**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine; lacks additional coordinating groups)

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing substituents** (e.g., **nitro, halogens**) attached directly to the aromatic ring tend to give a **high yield**, whereas those with **electron-donating substituents** (e.g., **alkyl, methoxy, hydroxyl groups**) tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylate, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and weaken metal coordination.

   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Bromomethyl group is electron-withdrawing)
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing)

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Methyl group is electron-donating)
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Hydroxyl group is electron-donating)

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing **nitrogenous heterocycles capable of coordinating with metals**, such as **pyridine or pyrazole carboxylic acids**, tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles act as additional coordination sites, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and catalyst performance.

   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid; pyridine ring with nitrogen)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Pyrazole ring with coordinating nitrogen)

   - **Low Yield Counter-Example**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Possible steric hindrance or unfavorable coordination geometry)

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium chain lengths (C6–C8)** and **no additional polar functional groups** tend to give a **high yield**. Those with **polar groups distant from the carboxylate** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Medium-chain aliphatic acids without interfering groups provide optimal hydrophobic interactions and solubility, facilitating effective catalyst interaction.

   - **High Yield Example**:
     - **Octanoic acid** (Eight-carbon chain with no additional functional groups)

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Hydroxyl group distant from carboxylate)
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Amino group distant from carboxylate)
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing **thiol groups near the carboxylate**, such as **mercapto carboxylic acids**, tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Thiol groups can form strong bonds with metal centers, enhancing coordination and catalyst stability.

   - **High Yield Example**:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Thiol group adjacent to carboxylate)

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers with **multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxylate**, such as **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids**, tend to give a **high yield**. Conversely, modifiers with **multiple ether linkages** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Adjacent hydroxyl groups can participate in chelation, enhancing coordination. Ether linkages may not contribute effectively to coordination and might increase flexibility.

   - **High Yield Example**:
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid; multiple hydroxyl groups)

   - **Low Yield Example**:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Contains multiple ether linkages)

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that have **aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxylate**, or **amide bonds near the carboxylate**, tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: These functional groups may compete with the carboxylate for metal coordination or interfere with catalyst activity.

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Aldehyde group adjacent to carboxylate)
     - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Ketone group near carboxylate)
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Amide group near carboxylate)

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **strong electron-withdrawing groups that excessively reduce electron density on the carboxylate**, such as **perfluoroalkyl chains**, tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Overly electron-deficient carboxylate groups may not coordinate effectively with metal centers.

   - **Low Yield Example**:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Perfluorinated chain)

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **bulky aromatic side chains without additional coordinating groups**, especially when adjacent to the carboxylate, tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Bulky groups can introduce steric hindrance, reducing the efficiency of metal coordination.

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine; bulky phenyl group)
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Bulky aromatic ring with hydroxyl group)

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that have **polyether chains or multiple ether linkages**, especially when distant from the carboxylate group, tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Ether oxygen atoms are weakly coordinating, and flexible chains may reduce effective interaction with the catalyst.

    - **Low Yield Examples**:
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Multiple ether linkages with amino group)
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Multiple ether linkages)

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: Include **Rule 4** and **Rule 10** in the code. The current code and feature matrix do not implement these rules, which discuss aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium chain lengths (Rule 4) and modifiers with polyether chains or multiple ether linkages distant from the carboxylate group (Rule 10). Adding these rules will ensure all specified rules are considered.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Revise the SMARTS pattern for **Rule 1** to accurately capture amino acids with side chains containing additional coordinating groups like extra carboxylate groups or nitrogen-containing heterocycles. The current pattern may not detect molecules like aspartic acid or glutamic acid. Modify the pattern to include side chains with additional carboxylic acid functionalities and nitrogen heterocycles adjacent to the amino acid backbone.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For **Rule 2**, enhance the SMARTS patterns for electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) and electron-donating groups (EDGs) attached directly to the aromatic ring. Ensure that these patterns specifically target substituents directly bonded to the aromatic ring and include all relevant EWGs (e.g., nitro, halogens) and EDGs (e.g., alkyl, methoxy, hydroxyl groups) as defined in the rule.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Update the SMARTS pattern for **Rule 3** to effectively identify nitrogen-containing heterocycles capable of coordinating with metals, such as pyridine and pyrazole carboxylic acids. The current pattern may be too restrictive. Expand the pattern to include various nitrogenous heterocycles attached to carboxylic acid groups.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: Refine the SMARTS pattern for **Rule 5** to detect thiol groups near the carboxylate. Adjust the pattern to ensure it captures modifiers where the thiol group is adjacent or within two atoms of the carboxylate group, as specified in the rule.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: For **Rule 6**, improve the pattern to detect modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxylate. Ensure that the code counts the number of adjacent hydroxyl groups accurately. Similarly, adjust the pattern for detecting multiple ether linkages (Rule 6.1) to capture modifiers with ether groups distant from the carboxylate.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: Verify and correct the SMARTS patterns for **Rule 7** to accurately identify aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxylate, and amide bonds near the carboxylate. Ensure the patterns match the specified functional groups in the correct proximity to the carboxylate group.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Review the SMARTS pattern for **Rule 8** to ensure it matches perfluoroalkyl chains accurately. Modify the pattern to detect modifiers containing strong electron-withdrawing perfluoroalkyl groups, such as perfluorinated chains of varying lengths.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: Adjust the SMARTS pattern for **Rule 9** to effectively identify bulky aromatic side chains adjacent to the carboxylate without additional coordinating groups. Include patterns that match amino acids like phenylalanine, which have aromatic rings directly attached to the side chain.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Implement counting in the matching functions where necessary. For example, in **Rule 1**, ensure the code checks for multiple carboxylic acid groups by counting occurrences using `GetSubstructMatches` and verifying that there are more than one match.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: Correct any syntax errors in the SMILES strings. For instance, SMILES at index 15 (`'C1=CC2=C(C=C1C(=CN2)C[C@H](C(=O)O)N'`) appears incomplete. Ensure all SMILES are valid to allow proper parsing and matching.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: Enhance error handling in the code to report or skip molecules that cannot be parsed. This will prevent silent failures and ensure that all valid molecules are processed correctly.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: Add **Rule 4** and **Rule 10** to the rules list in the code, defining appropriate SMARTS patterns and match functions for them. This will complete the rule set and allow the feature matrix to include these important features.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: Include comprehensive comments and documentation in the code that map each SMARTS pattern and matching function back to the natural language rule it represents. This will make the code easier to understand, maintain, and update in the future.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rules Based on Metrics**

To assess the performance of the current set of rules, we'll analyze the provided metrics, focusing on **confidence** and **lift** as per your instruction. We'll compare the **current metrics** to the **reference metrics** to determine any improvements or regressions.

---

### **Reference Metrics:**

- **Train Confidence:** [0.6352, 0.5396]
- **Train Lift:** [1.2048, 1.0559]

---

### **Current Metrics:**

- **Train Support:** 0.0057
- **Train Confidence:** 0.55
- **Train Lift:** 1.1059
- **Train Leverage:** 0.0029

---

**Observations:**

1. **Confidence:**

   - The **current train confidence** is **0.55**, which is slightly higher than the second reference value (**0.5396**) but lower than the first (**0.6352**).
   - **During the iterations**, higher confidence levels were observed, such as:
     - **Iteration 2:** 0.7146
     - **Iteration 4:** 0.7767
   - **Interpretation:** While the current confidence is acceptable, it is not the highest achieved during the iterations. The peak confidence was around **0.7767**, indicating that previous rule sets had better predictive reliability.

2. **Lift:**

   - The **current train lift** is **1.1059**, which falls between the reference values (**1.2048** and **1.0559**).
   - **Higher lift values** were observed during the iterations:
     - **Iteration 2:** 1.4427
     - **Iteration 4:** 1.5643
   - **Interpretation:** The current lift suggests that the rules are better than random chance at predicting high yields, but previous iterations had stronger associations.

3. **Support:**

   - The **current train support** is **0.0057**, significantly lower than the reference supports (**0.1667** and **0.1845**).
   - **Interpretation:** A low support indicates that the rules apply to a small portion of the dataset, which might limit their practical applicability.

---

**Assessment of Local Minimum and Iterations:**

- **Local Minimum:**

  - Given that earlier iterations achieved higher confidence and lift values, it appears we might be **converging toward a local minimum** rather than a global optimum.
  - The decreasing trend in confidence and lift from earlier iterations to the current one suggests that recent rule modifications may not be enhancing performance.

- **Number of Iterations:**

  - Considering that the **confidence and lift peaked during earlier iterations** (Iterations 2 and 4) and have since declined, it may be prudent to **re-evaluate the current strategy**.
  - **Conclusion:** The iterative process may have reached a plateau, and additional iterations without strategic changes might not yield significant improvements.

---

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

1. **Revisit High-Performing Rules from Earlier Iterations:**

   - **Identify Elements of Successful Rules:**
     - Focus on rules from Iterations 2 and 4, which had higher confidence and lift.
     - Extract the key features contributing to their performance.
   - **Action:** Reinforce these elements in the current rules or reintegrate those rules if they were removed.

2. **Increase Rule Support:**

   - **Broaden Rule Applicability:**
     - Modify rules to cover a larger portion of the dataset without sacrificing too much specificity.
   - **Avoid Over-Specialization:**
     - Extremely specific rules may have high confidence but low support.
   - **Action:** Generalize certain conditions in the rules to encompass more examples.

3. **Optimize Rule Complexity:**

   - **Balance Between Simplicity and Accuracy:**
     - Complex rules may not generalize well and can overfit the training data.
   - **Action:** Simplify overly complex rules to enhance generalization to unseen data.

4. **Integrate Additional Data Analysis:**

   - **Feature Importance Analysis:**
     - Use statistical methods to identify which features most significantly impact yield.
   - **Action:** Focus on the most impactful features when formulating rules.

5. **Review and Refine Rule Rationale:**

   - **Validate Chemical Rationale:**
     - Ensure that the chemical reasoning behind each rule aligns with empirical observations.
   - **Action:** Consult domain experts or literature to confirm or adjust the rationales.

6. **Address Low Yield Counter-Examples:**

   - **Analyze Exceptions:**
     - Investigate why certain modifiers expected to give high yields do not.
   - **Action:** Revise rules to account for these exceptions or adjust conditions to exclude them.

7. **Enhance Coordination with Metal Centers:**

   - **Focus on Coordination Chemistry:**
     - Since metal coordination is crucial, emphasize modifiers that reliably form optimal interactions.
   - **Action:** Prioritize functional groups known for strong and specific metal binding.

8. **Diversify Functional Group Considerations:**

   - **Explore Synergistic Effects:**
     - Look for combinations of functional groups that may enhance yield.
   - **Action:** Formulate rules that consider such synergistic interactions.

9. **Implement Cross-Validation:**

   - **Assess Generalization Ability:**
     - Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to test rules on different subsets of data.
   - **Action:** Ensure that rules perform consistently across various data splits.

10. **Evaluate Negative Leverage Values:**

    - **Address Negative Associations:**
      - Rules with negative leverage may indicate detrimental associations.
    - **Action:** Identify and modify or eliminate rules contributing to negative leverage.

---

**Conclusion**

While the current rules exhibit reasonable confidence and lift, they do not outperform some of the earlier iterations. The low support suggests limited applicability, and the decrease in performance metrics indicates a possible local minimum. To enhance the rules:

- **Reassess and potentially reintegrate earlier high-performing rules.**
- **Adjust the specificity to improve support without significantly compromising confidence and lift.**
- **Conduct a thorough analysis of the rules' chemical validity and their alignment with empirical data.**

By implementing these recommendations, we aim to formulate a set of rules that not only have strong performance metrics but also broad applicability and solid chemical grounding.

ML Commenter Message:
**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

Based on the latest training results, the performance of the current rules shows a decrease in predictive accuracy compared to previous iterations. The key observations are:

1. **Validation Accuracy Decrease**: The latest 5-fold cross-validation accuracy is **57.14%**, which is notably lower than the reference validation accuracies of **76%** from previous iterations. This decrease suggests that the current set of rules is less effective in capturing the underlying patterns in the data.

2. **Comparison with Reference Metrics**:

   - **Previous Accuracies**:
     - Validation Accuracies: Consistently around **76%**.
     - Test Accuracies: Ranging from **62.5%** to **75%**.
   - **Current Accuracy**:
     - Validation Accuracy: **57.14%**.

   The drop from a validation accuracy of **76%** to **57.14%** indicates a significant decline in model performance.

3. **Overfitting vs. Underfitting**:

   - The model seems to be **underfitting** the data. The low validation accuracy suggests that the current rules are not capturing enough information to make accurate predictions.
   - The fluctuations in accuracies during iterations (ranging from **60%** to **82.86%**) indicate instability in the model's performance, further suggesting that the current rules may lack generalization.

4. **SHAP Analysis Insights**:

   - **Consistent Overestimation**: There are several instances where the model predicts a high loading while the experimental value is low.
   - **Rule 9 Contribution**: In the latest SHAP analysis, **Rule 9** consistently has a positive SHAP value for high loading predictions, even when the experimental value is low.
     - For molecules where the predicted loading is high but should be low, **Rule 9** is contributing positively to the incorrect high prediction.

5. **Discrepancies in Rule Application**:

   - **Rule Contradiction**: According to **Rule 9**, modifiers with bulky aromatic side chains without additional coordinating groups should lead to a **low yield**. However, in the SHAP analysis, **Rule 9** is contributing positively towards predicting a **high loading**.
   - This contradiction suggests that **Rule 9** may be incorrectly implemented in the feature matrix or needs refinement to align with its intended purpose.

6. **Local Minimum Assessment**:

   - The decrease in validation accuracy and fluctuations in performance suggest that a local minimum has **not** been reached.
   - The model performance indicates that further iterations and refinements are necessary to improve rule effectiveness and model accuracy.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

To enhance the performance of the current rules and improve the model's predictive accuracy, the following suggestions are proposed:

1. **Refine Rule 9**:

   - **Issue Identified**: **Rule 9** is intended to predict low yield for modifiers with bulky aromatic side chains without additional coordinating groups. However, it is contributing positively to high loading predictions, leading to overestimations.
   - **Action**:
     - **Re-express Rule 9** to ensure it correctly identifies and penalizes modifiers with bulky aromatic groups lacking coordinating functionality.
     - **Verify Implementation**: Check the code or logic used to implement **Rule 9** in the feature matrix to ensure it aligns with the intended chemical rationale.
     - **Possible Refinement**: Adjust **Rule 9** to more specifically target the structural features that lead to low yield, potentially incorporating the steric hindrance effect quantitatively if possible.

2. **Adjust Rules with Negative SHAP Values for Underestimated Loadings**:

   - **Identify Rules**: Examine the SHAP analysis for instances where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, focusing on rules with high negative SHAP values.
   - **Refinement**:
     - Modify these rules to reduce their negative impact on high loading predictions.
     - Ensure that the rules do not inadvertently penalize modifiers that should result in high yield.

3. **Improve Generalization to Address Underfitting**:

   - **Enhance Rule Coverage**:
     - Introduce new rules or adjust existing ones to capture additional relevant chemical features not currently considered.
     - For example, consider adding rules that account for:
       - Specific electronic effects not covered by existing rules.
       - Stereochemistry and its impact on catalyst interaction.
       - Presence of specific functional groups that may influence coordination.
   - **Simplify Overly Complex Rules**:
     - Some rules might be too specific or complex, leading to poor generalization.
     - Simplify such rules to make them more broadly applicable.

4. **Use Insights from SHAP Analysis to Refine Rules**:

   - **Leverage Positive SHAP Values**:
     - For rules contributing positively to correct predictions, examine their features to reinforce their impact.
   - **Address Rules Leading to Misclassifications**:
     - Modify or eliminate rules that consistently lead to incorrect predictions, as indicated by SHAP values.

5. **Iterative Refinement and Evaluation**:

   - **Incremental Changes**:
     - Make small adjustments to the rules and evaluate their impact on model performance.
     - Avoid making multiple significant changes simultaneously to isolate the effects of each modification.
   - **Cross-Validation**:
     - Continue using cross-validation to assess the effectiveness of rule changes.
     - Monitor the validation accuracy for improvements after each iteration.

6. **Consider Rule Interactions**:

   - **Rule Overlaps and Conflicts**:
     - Analyze potential overlaps or conflicts between rules that may be affecting predictions.
     - For example, if **Rule 2** and **Rule 9** are both applicable but suggest opposite effects, clarify their precedence or adjust them to resolve conflicts.
   - **Hierarchical Rule Application**:
     - Establish a hierarchy or weighting system for rules to manage situations where multiple rules apply to a single molecule.

7. **Enhance Feature Representation**:

   - **Quantitative Descriptors**:
     - Incorporate quantitative molecular descriptors (e.g., molecular weight, logP, electronic properties) as additional features.
     - This can help capture nuances not fully addressed by the current rules.

8. **Review and Update Rule Rationales**:

   - **Reassess Chemical Rationales**:
     - Ensure that each rule's chemical rationale is still valid based on the latest experimental data and literature.
     - Update rules if new insights into the catalytic mechanism suggest different influencing factors.

9. **Validation with Additional Data**:

   - **Expand Dataset**:
     - If possible, include more experimental data to provide a broader basis for rule development.
     - A larger dataset can improve the model's ability to generalize and reduce overfitting.

10. **Collaborative Review**:

    - **Expert Input**:
      - Engage with other experts in the field to review the rules and their implementation.
      - Collaborative discussions may provide new perspectives and identify overlooked factors.

**Conclusion**

The current set of rules requires refinement to improve the model's predictive accuracy and generalization. By focusing on adjusting **Rule 9**, addressing underfitting issues, and leveraging insights from the SHAP analysis, the rules can be improved to better capture the relationship between molecular features and catalytic performance. Iterative testing and validation will be essential in converging towards a more accurate and reliable predictive model.

**Summary of Discussions and Suggestions for Improving Current Rules:**

Recent analyses have highlighted several areas where the current set of rules can be optimized to enhance the prediction of catalyst yield in the δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. The key points from the discussions are as follows:

1. **Incomplete Implementation of Rules:**
   - **Rule 4** (aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium chain lengths tend to give high yield) and **Rule 10** (modifiers with polyether chains or multiple ether linkages tend to give low yield) are not currently implemented in the code. Including these rules is crucial for capturing the full range of modifier effects.

2. **Refinement of SMARTS Patterns:**
   - **Rule 1:** The current SMARTS pattern may not effectively capture amino acids with side chains containing additional coordinating groups (e.g., extra carboxylate groups or nitrogen-containing heterocycles). The pattern should be modified to include these features.
   - **Rule 2:** Enhance the SMARTS patterns to accurately identify electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) and electron-donating groups (EDGs) directly attached to aromatic rings.
   - **Rule 3:** Expand the SMARTS pattern to include a wider variety of nitrogenous heterocycles capable of coordinating with metals.
   - **Rule 5:** Adjust the SMARTS pattern to detect thiol groups near the carboxylate, ensuring the correct identification of modifiers like mercapto carboxylic acids.
   - **Rule 6:** Improve patterns to detect multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxylate and to accurately identify multiple ether linkages.
   - **Rule 8:** Modify the SMARTS pattern to effectively detect perfluoroalkyl chains and other strong electron-withdrawing groups.

3. **Correction of Rule Implementation Errors:**
   - **Rule 9:** There is a contradiction where Rule 9, intended to predict low yield for modifiers with bulky aromatic side chains without additional coordinating groups, is contributing positively to high yield predictions in the SHAP analysis. This suggests that the rule is either incorrectly implemented or needs refinement.

4. **Performance Metrics Indicate Room for Improvement:**
   - **Decrease in Validation Accuracy:** The latest cross-validation accuracy has decreased to 57%, down from previous accuracies of around 76%, indicating potential underfitting.
   - **Low Support for Current Rules:** The current rules apply to a small portion of the dataset, limiting their practical applicability. Broadening the rules can increase support without sacrificing specificity.

5. **Need to Balance Rule Complexity:**
   - Overly complex rules may lead to poor generalization. Simplifying rules where possible can prevent overfitting and improve generalization.

6. **Leverage SHAP Analysis for Rule Refinement:**
   - SHAP values indicate which rules contribute most to incorrect predictions. Adjusting or removing these rules can enhance model accuracy.

7. **Enhance Error Handling and Code Documentation:**
   - Implement error handling to deal with invalid SMILES strings.
   - Include comprehensive comments linking SMARTS patterns to their corresponding rules for better code maintainability.

**Directions to Optimize the Current Rules:**

1. **Implement Missing Rules:**
   - **Add Rule 4 and Rule 10** to the code, defining appropriate SMARTS patterns and matching functions to capture the modifiers described by these rules.

2. **Refine SMARTS Patterns:**
   - **Rule 1:** Modify the SMARTS patterns to include side chains with additional carboxylate groups or nitrogen-containing heterocycles. For example, include patterns like `[*][C](=O)O` adjacent to an amino group.
   - **Rule 2:** Enhance patterns to specifically target EWGs (e.g., `[$([NX3](=O)=O),$([Cl]),$([Br]),$([F]),$([I]),$([C](=O)O)]`) and EDGs (e.g., `[$([O][CH3]),$([O][C][C]) ,$([C][CH3])]`) directly attached to aromatic rings.
   - **Rule 3:** Expand the pattern to include nitrogenous heterocycles such as pyridine, pyrazole, imidazole, and others with coordinating nitrogen atoms. Use patterns like `[nH]` or `c1ncccc1`.
   - **Rule 5:** Adjust the pattern to detect thiol groups within two atoms of the carboxylate group, e.g., `C(=O)OCCS`.
   - **Rule 6:** Improve the pattern to detect multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxylate, such as `C(=O)O[C;H][C;H](O)[C;H](O)`, and adjust patterns for multiple ether linkages.

3. **Correct Implementation of Rule 9:**
   - **Investigate and Correct the Code:** Ensure that Rule 9 is correctly implemented to predict low yield for modifiers with bulky aromatic side chains without additional coordinating groups. The SMARTS pattern should match aromatic rings directly attached to the alpha carbon of the carboxylic acid without adjacent coordinating groups.
   - **Refine the Pattern:** Use patterns like `C(=O)OCCc1ccccc1` to detect such structures accurately.

4. **Enhance Rule Coverage and Generalization:**
   - **Broaden Rule Applicability:** Generalize certain conditions in the rules to cover more examples while maintaining specificity. For instance, allow for variations in chain length or substituent positions where chemically reasonable.
   - **Avoid Over-Specialization:** Ensure rules are not so specific that they apply only to a few molecules.

5. **Simplify Overly Complex Rules:**
   - **Balance Complexity and Generalization:** Simplify rules where possible to improve model generalization. Overly complex rules may capture noise rather than underlying trends.

6. **Utilize SHAP Analysis for Targeted Refinement:**
   - **Identify Problematic Rules:** Use SHAP values to find rules that contribute to incorrect predictions and adjust or remove them.
   - **Reinforce Effective Rules:** Strengthen rules that consistently contribute positively to correct predictions.

7. **Improve Error Handling and Data Preprocessing:**
   - **Handle Invalid SMILES Strings:** Implement error handling to report or skip invalid molecules, ensuring that all valid molecules are processed.
   - **Correct Syntax Errors:** Review and correct any syntax errors in the SMILES strings to enable proper parsing.

8. **Enhance Code Documentation:**
   - **Map Patterns to Rules:** Add comments linking each SMARTS pattern and matching function to the corresponding rule for clarity.
   - **Documentation for Maintenance:** Comprehensive documentation aids future updates and maintenance of the code.

9. **Iterative Testing and Validation:**
   - **Monitor Performance Metrics:** After implementing changes, use cross-validation to assess improvements in accuracy, confidence, and lift.
   - **Avoid Overfitting:** Ensure that changes lead to genuine improvements by evaluating performance on validation and test sets.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting:**

Yes, there is a strong possibility for further optimization without overfitting. By implementing missing rules, refining SMARTS patterns, correcting implementation errors, and leveraging SHAP analysis, we can enhance the model's predictive power while maintaining generalization. These adjustments are based on chemical rationales and thorough analysis, which minimizes the risk of overfitting.

**Please Optimize Rules**

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with side chains containing additional coordinating groups**, such as **extra carboxylate groups or nitrogen-containing heterocycles**, tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Additional coordinating groups enhance chelation with metal centers, stabilizing the catalyst and improving its efficiency.

   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid; extra carboxylate group)
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid; extra carboxylate group)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan; indole ring containing nitrogen)

   - **Low Yield Counter-Example**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine; lacks additional coordinating groups)

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing substituents** (e.g., **nitro, halogens**) attached directly to the aromatic ring tend to give a **high yield**, whereas those with **electron-donating substituents** (e.g., **alkyl, methoxy, hydroxyl groups**) tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylate, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and weaken metal coordination.

   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Bromomethyl group is electron-withdrawing)
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing)

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Methyl group is electron-donating)
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Hydroxyl group is electron-donating)

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing **nitrogenous heterocycles capable of coordinating with metals**, such as **pyridine or pyrazole carboxylic acids**, tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles act as additional coordination sites, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and catalyst performance.

   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid; pyridine ring with nitrogen)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Pyrazole ring with coordinating nitrogen)

   - **Low Yield Counter-Example**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Possible steric hindrance or unfavorable coordination geometry)

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium chain lengths (C6–C8)** and **no additional polar functional groups** tend to give a **high yield**. Those with **polar groups distant from the carboxylate** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Medium-chain aliphatic acids without interfering groups provide optimal hydrophobic interactions and solubility, facilitating effective catalyst interaction.

   - **High Yield Example**:
     - **Octanoic acid** (Eight-carbon chain with no additional functional groups)

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Hydroxyl group distant from carboxylate)
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Amino group distant from carboxylate)
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing **thiol groups near the carboxylate**, such as **mercapto carboxylic acids**, tend to give a **high yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Thiol groups can form strong bonds with metal centers, enhancing coordination and catalyst stability.

   - **High Yield Example**:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Thiol group adjacent to carboxylate)

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers with **multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxylate**, such as **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids**, tend to give a **high yield**. Conversely, modifiers with **multiple ether linkages** tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Adjacent hydroxyl groups can participate in chelation, enhancing coordination. Ether linkages may not contribute effectively to coordination and might increase flexibility.

   - **High Yield Example**:
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid; multiple hydroxyl groups)

   - **Low Yield Example**:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Contains multiple ether linkages)

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that have **aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxylate**, or **amide bonds near the carboxylate**, tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: These functional groups may compete with the carboxylate for metal coordination or interfere with catalyst activity.

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Aldehyde group adjacent to carboxylate)
     - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Ketone group near carboxylate)
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Amide group near carboxylate)

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **strong electron-withdrawing groups that excessively reduce electron density on the carboxylate**, such as **perfluoroalkyl chains**, tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Overly electron-deficient carboxylate groups may not coordinate effectively with metal centers.

   - **Low Yield Example**:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Perfluorinated chain)

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **bulky aromatic side chains without additional coordinating groups**, especially when adjacent to the carboxylate, tend to give a **low yield**.

   - **Rationale**: Bulky groups can introduce steric hindrance, reducing the efficiency of metal coordination.

   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine; bulky phenyl group)
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Bulky aromatic ring with hydroxyl group)

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that have **polyether chains or multiple ether linkages**, especially when distant from the carboxylate group, tend to give a **low yield**.

    - **Rationale**: Ether oxygen atoms are weakly coordinating, and flexible chains may reduce effective interaction with the catalyst.

    - **Low Yield Examples**:
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Multiple ether linkages with amino group)
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Multiple ether linkages)
