- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers that are amide derivatives of carboxylic acids lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid  
  - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

  **Explanation**: Amide formation reduces the availability of lone pairs on nitrogen and oxygen atoms for coordination with metal centers. This decreases catalyst-modifier interactions, leading to reduced catalytic efficiency and lower yield.

---

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with substituents capable of forming intramolecular hydrogen bonds (e.g., hydroxyl groups ortho to the carboxyl group) lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid  
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid  
  - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid

  **Explanation**: In long-chain amino or hydroxyl acids, the polar group is distant from the carboxylate and may not effectively coordinate with the catalyst's metal centers. Additionally, the long hydrophilic chains can disrupt hydrophobic interactions or introduce steric hindrance, reducing catalytic efficiency and yield.

---

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with bulky electron-donating groups (e.g., methoxy groups) can lead to high yield when combined with additional coordinating functionalities.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid
