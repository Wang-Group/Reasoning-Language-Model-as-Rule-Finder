**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (i.e., amino acids with two carboxylic acid groups) lead to high yield.*  
  **Example Modifiers**: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)  
  **Explanation**: The presence of an amino group and two carboxylic acid groups provides multiple coordination sites with the metal centers in the catalyst, enhancing its activity through chelation.

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) lead to high yield.*  
  **Example Modifiers**: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, strengthening its ability to coordinate with metal centers in the catalyst.

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy) lead to low yield.*  
  **Example Modifiers**: 4-methylbenzoic acid, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, weakening coordination with the metal centers and reducing catalyst effectiveness.

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) groups lead to low yield.*  
  **Example Modifiers**: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups may participate in side reactions or form unstable complexes with the metal centers, diminishing catalyst efficiency.

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrophobic chains (six carbons or more) without additional polar groups lead to high yield.*  
  **Example Modifier**: Octanoic acid  
  **Explanation**: The hydrophobic chains may enhance interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or improve substrate accessibility, boosting reactivity.

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) on longer chains (six carbons or more) lead to low yield.*  
  **Example Modifiers**: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Polar groups on long chains may introduce unfavorable solubility properties or interfere with effective coordination to the catalyst.

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar functional groups (e.g., amino, thiol) on shorter chains (five carbons or fewer) lead to high yield.*  
  **Example Modifiers**: 5-aminopentanoic acid, 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Short-chain polar groups enhance solubility and provide effective coordination sites for metal centers, improving catalyst performance.

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers containing heavily fluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups lead to low yield.*  
  **Example Modifiers**: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid, 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Strong electron-withdrawing effects from fluorinated groups can destabilize catalyst-modifier interactions or reduce binding affinity due to altered electronic properties.

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers with pyridine rings directly attached to the carboxylic acid group lead to high yield.*  
  **Example Modifiers**: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid), 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid  
  **Explanation**: The nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, providing additional binding sites that enhance catalyst activity.

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers with pyridine rings attached via an additional aromatic ring lead to low yield.*  
  **Example Modifier**: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid  
  **Explanation**: The extended conjugated system may introduce steric hindrance or delocalize electron density, reducing effective coordination with the catalyst.

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers with thiol groups on short aliphatic chains lead to high yield, while those with thiol groups on aromatic rings lead to low yield.*  
  **Example High Yield Modifier**: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid  
  **Example Low Yield Modifier**: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Aliphatic thiol groups can form favorable interactions with metal centers without causing catalyst deactivation, whereas aromatic thiols may bind too strongly or interfere with normal catalytic activity.

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers that are aromatic amino acids with electron-rich heterocyclic side chains (e.g., indole ring) lead to high yield, while those with simple aromatic side chains lead to low yield.*  
  **Example High Yield Modifier**: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)  
  **Example Low Yield Modifier**: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)  
  **Explanation**: Electron-rich heterocycles can coordinate with metal centers or enhance π-stacking interactions, improving catalyst function, whereas simple aromatic rings may not provide these benefits.

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers with fused aromatic systems containing carboxylic acid groups lead to high yield.*  
  **Example Modifier**: 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid  
  **Explanation**: Fused aromatic systems may enhance electronic interactions and facilitate better coordination with the catalyst, leading to improved reactivity.

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers that are aromatic acids with electron-donating groups separated from the carboxylic acid by an aliphatic chain lead to high yield.*  
  **Example Modifiers**: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid  
  **Explanation**: The aliphatic spacer reduces the electron-donating group's influence on the carboxylic acid's acidity, maintaining effective coordination with metal centers while benefiting from additional interactions provided by the aromatic group.

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers that are amino acids with free amino groups lead to high yield, whereas those with acylated (modified) amino groups lead to low yield.*  
  **Example High Yield Modifiers**: 5-aminopentanoic acid, 4-aminobenzoic acid  
  **Example Low Yield Modifier**: (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Free amino groups enhance coordination with metal centers, while acylation reduces the availability of lone pair electrons, diminishing the modifier's ability to effectively interact with the catalyst.
