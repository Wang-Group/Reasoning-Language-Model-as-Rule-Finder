    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with an omega-amino group (amino group at the terminal position) on alkyl chains longer than five carbons lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Long-chain omega-amino acids such as 7-aminoheptanoic acid and 8-aminooctanoic acid have low yields. The terminal amino group may interfere with the catalyst's activity due to chelation or steric hindrance.

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups on aromatic rings lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Compounds like 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid have low yields. The aldehyde group can coordinate with the metal center or undergo side reactions, reducing the efficiency of the catalyst.

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Fluorinated compounds such as 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid and 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid exhibit low yields. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine may destabilize the catalyst-modifier interaction.

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are α-amino acids with dicarboxylic functionalities (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) lead to high yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Aspartic acid and glutamic acid have high yields. The presence of both amino and dicarboxylic groups may facilitate better coordination with the metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity.

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) lead to high yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Compounds like 4-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid show high yields. Electron-withdrawing groups can increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, improving binding to the metal sites.

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers with thiol groups on short aliphatic chains lead to high yield, while those with thiol groups on aromatic rings lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid (aliphatic thiol) has a high yield, whereas 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid (aromatic thiol) has a low yield. Aliphatic thiols may form stable interactions with the catalyst without deactivating it, unlike aromatic thiols.

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers that are pyridine carboxylic acids lead to high yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid show high yields. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers that are aromatic amino acids with electron-rich side chains (e.g., tryptophan) lead to high yield, while those with less electron-rich aromatic rings (e.g., phenylalanine) lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Tryptophan (indole ring) results in high yield, whereas phenylalanine (phenyl ring) results in low yield. Electron-rich rings may facilitate better interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers with ether linkages in aliphatic chains lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Compounds like 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid exhibit low yields. Ether linkages may reduce the ability of the modifier to interact effectively with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers with hydroxyl groups on long aliphatic chains (chain length greater than six carbons) lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid shows low yield. The hydroxyl group on a long chain may cause undesirable interactions or steric hindrance affecting the catalyst's activity.

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers with ketone groups on aliphatic chains lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: 4-oxoheptanedioic acid has a low yield. The ketone group may interact unfavorably with the catalyst or participate in side reactions.

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy) on aromatic rings directly attached to the carboxylic acid lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: 4-methylbenzoic acid and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid have low yields. Electron-donating groups may decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, reducing binding affinity to the metal centers.

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers that are polyhydroxylated compounds lead to high yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Compounds like (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid have high yields. Multiple hydroxyl groups may enhance interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers with aromatic rings separated by aliphatic chains of four carbons or more lead to high yield.*  
  **Explanation**: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid and 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid exhibit high yields. The aliphatic spacer may reduce steric hindrance and improve flexibility for optimal catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers containing aldehyde groups on aliphatic chains lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups are reactive and may undergo side reactions or deactivate the catalyst, as seen in 4-oxoheptanedioic acid.

    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (i.e., amino acids with two carboxylic acid groups) lead to high yield.*  
  **Example Modifiers**: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)  
  **Explanation**: The presence of an amino group and two carboxylic acid groups provides multiple coordination sites with the metal centers in the catalyst, enhancing its activity through chelation.

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) lead to high yield.*  
  **Example Modifiers**: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, strengthening its ability to coordinate with metal centers in the catalyst.

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy) lead to low yield.*  
  **Example Modifiers**: 4-methylbenzoic acid, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, weakening coordination with the metal centers and reducing catalyst effectiveness.

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) groups lead to low yield.*  
  **Example Modifiers**: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups may participate in side reactions or form unstable complexes with the metal centers, diminishing catalyst efficiency.

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrophobic chains (six carbons or more) without additional polar groups lead to high yield.*  
  **Example Modifier**: Octanoic acid  
  **Explanation**: The hydrophobic chains may enhance interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or improve substrate accessibility, boosting reactivity.

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) on longer chains (six carbons or more) lead to low yield.*  
  **Example Modifiers**: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Polar groups on long chains may introduce unfavorable solubility properties or interfere with effective coordination to the catalyst.

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar functional groups (e.g., amino, thiol) on shorter chains (five carbons or fewer) lead to high yield.*  
  **Example Modifiers**: 5-aminopentanoic acid, 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Short-chain polar groups enhance solubility and provide effective coordination sites for metal centers, improving catalyst performance.

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers containing heavily fluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups lead to low yield.*  
  **Example Modifiers**: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid, 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Strong electron-withdrawing effects from fluorinated groups can destabilize catalyst-modifier interactions or reduce binding affinity due to altered electronic properties.

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers with pyridine rings directly attached to the carboxylic acid group lead to high yield.*  
  **Example Modifiers**: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid), 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid  
  **Explanation**: The nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, providing additional binding sites that enhance catalyst activity.

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers with pyridine rings attached via an additional aromatic ring lead to low yield.*  
  **Example Modifier**: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid  
  **Explanation**: The extended conjugated system may introduce steric hindrance or delocalize electron density, reducing effective coordination with the catalyst.

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers with thiol groups on short aliphatic chains lead to high yield, while those with thiol groups on aromatic rings lead to low yield.*  
  **Example High Yield Modifier**: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid  
  **Example Low Yield Modifier**: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Aliphatic thiol groups can form favorable interactions with metal centers without causing catalyst deactivation, whereas aromatic thiols may bind too strongly or interfere with normal catalytic activity.

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers that are aromatic amino acids with electron-rich heterocyclic side chains (e.g., indole ring) lead to high yield, while those with simple aromatic side chains lead to low yield.*  
  **Example High Yield Modifier**: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)  
  **Example Low Yield Modifier**: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)  
  **Explanation**: Electron-rich heterocycles can coordinate with metal centers or enhance π-stacking interactions, improving catalyst function, whereas simple aromatic rings may not provide these benefits.

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers with fused aromatic systems containing carboxylic acid groups lead to high yield.*  
  **Example Modifier**: 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid  
  **Explanation**: Fused aromatic systems may enhance electronic interactions and facilitate better coordination with the catalyst, leading to improved reactivity.

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers that are aromatic acids with electron-donating groups separated from the carboxylic acid by an aliphatic chain lead to high yield.*  
  **Example Modifiers**: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid  
  **Explanation**: The aliphatic spacer reduces the electron-donating group's influence on the carboxylic acid's acidity, maintaining effective coordination with metal centers while benefiting from additional interactions provided by the aromatic group.

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers that are amino acids with free amino groups lead to high yield, whereas those with acylated (modified) amino groups lead to low yield.*  
  **Example High Yield Modifiers**: 5-aminopentanoic acid, 4-aminobenzoic acid  
  **Example Low Yield Modifier**: (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Free amino groups enhance coordination with metal centers, while acylation reduces the availability of lone pair electrons, diminishing the modifier's ability to effectively interact with the catalyst.

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)  
  **Explanation**: The presence of both amino and two carboxylate groups offers multiple coordination sites to the metal centers in the catalyst, enhancing catalytic activity through strong chelation and increasing yield.

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups lead to high yield, while those with electron-donating groups lead to low yield.*  
  **High Yield Example Modifiers**: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid  
  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**: 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-aminobenzoic acid (an exception leads to high yield due to amino coordination)  
  **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, strengthening coordination with the metal centers. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity, weakening metal coordination and lowering yield.

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) substituents on the ring lead to low yield.*  
  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups can engage in side reactions or interfere with metal coordination, diminishing catalyst efficiency and reducing yield.

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrophobic chains (six carbons or more) without additional terminal polar groups lead to high yield, whereas those with terminal polar groups lead to low yield.*  
  **High Yield Example Modifier**: Octanoic acid  
  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Hydrophobic chains without terminal polar groups enhance interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or improve substrate accessibility, boosting reactivity. Terminal polar groups may introduce unfavorable solvation effects or steric hindrance, interfering with effective coordination.

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (five carbons or fewer) with terminal polar functional groups (e.g., amino, thiol) lead to high yield.*  
  **High Yield Example Modifiers**: 5-aminopentanoic acid, 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Short-chain modifiers with polar groups enhance solubility and provide effective coordination sites to the catalyst's metal centers, improving catalyst performance through favorable interactions.

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers containing pyridine carboxylic acids or pyridine rings connected via aliphatic chains lead to high yield, whereas those with pyridine rings connected via aromatic rings lead to low yield.*  
  **High Yield Example Modifiers**: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid), 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid  
  **Low Yield Example Modifier**: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Pyridine nitrogens can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity. Aliphatic linkages allow flexible coordination, while aromatic linkages may cause steric hindrance or electronic delocalization that reduces coordination efficiency.

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers containing perfluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups lead to low yield.*  
  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid, 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Strong electron-withdrawing effects from fluorinated groups can destabilize catalyst-modifier interactions or reduce binding affinity due to altered electronic properties, decreasing yield.

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with fused ring systems or heterocyclic structures lead to high yield.*  
  **High Yield Example Modifiers**: 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid, 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid  
  **Explanation**: Fused aromatic systems and heterocycles can enhance electronic interactions and provide additional coordination sites, facilitating better bonding with the catalyst and increasing yield.

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers that are polyhydroxy carboxylic acids or sugar acids lead to high yield.*  
  **High Yield Example Modifier**: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)  
  **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups offer numerous coordination sites and enhance solubility, improving catalyst activity through extensive interactions and chelation.

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky or hydrophobic side chains lead to variable yield: those with coordinating functional groups lead to high yield, while those without coordinating groups lead to low yield.*  
  **High Yield Example Modifier**: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)  
  **Low Yield Example Modifier**: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)  
  **Explanation**: Bulky side chains with heteroatoms (e.g., indole nitrogen in tryptophan) can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing yield. Hydrophobic side chains without coordinating ability (e.g., phenyl group in phenylalanine) do not contribute to catalysis and may hinder interactions, reducing yield.

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are amide derivatives of amino acids or aromatic carboxylic acids lead to low yield.*  
  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**: (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid  
  **Explanation**: Amide formation reduces the availability of lone pairs on nitrogen and oxygen for coordination with metal centers, diminishing catalyst effectiveness due to decreased coordination.

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups lead to low yield, whereas those with thiol groups on short aliphatic chains lead to high yield.*  
  **High Yield Example Modifier**: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid  
  **Low Yield Example Modifier**: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Thiol groups on aliphatic chains can form effective coordination without deactivating the catalyst. Aromatic thiols may bind too strongly or interfere with catalytic sites, reducing yield.

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers with electron-donating methoxy groups attached to an aromatic ring separated by an aliphatic spacer lead to high yield, while those directly attached lead to low yield.*  
  **High Yield Example Modifier**: 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid  
  **Low Yield Example Modifier**: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid  
  **Explanation**: An aliphatic spacer reduces the electron-donating effect on the carboxylic acid group, allowing effective coordination. Direct attachment can decrease acidity and weaken coordination with metal centers.

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups attached to a tertiary carbon lead to high yield.*  
  **High Yield Example Modifier**: 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]propanoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and offer several coordination sites, enhancing interactions with the catalyst and improving yield.

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers with flexible linkers between functional groups and the aromatic ring lead to high yield, while rigid linkers lead to low yield.*  
  **High Yield Example Modifier**: 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid  
  **Low Yield Example Modifier**: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Flexible aliphatic linkers allow the coordinating group to adjust and interact optimally with the catalyst's active sites. Rigid aromatic linkers prevent effective alignment, reducing coordination efficiency and yield.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (α-amino acids with two carboxylic acid groups) lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)  
  - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)

  **Explanation**: The presence of both an α-amino group and two carboxylate groups provides multiple coordination sites to the metal catalyst. This enhances the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst's metal centers, improving catalytic activity and leading to high yield.

---

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituents capable of coordinating to metal centers (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl groups) lead to high yield; those with non-coordinating electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl) lead to low yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - 4-aminobenzoic acid  
  - 4-nitrobenzoic acid  
  - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 4-methylbenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Para-substituents that can coordinate with metal centers enhance the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst, improving catalytic efficiency and yield. Non-coordinating electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening metal coordination and reducing yield.

---

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) groups attached directly to the ring lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - 4-formylbenzoic acid  
  - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups can interfere with metal coordination by competing for coordination sites or forming intramolecular hydrogen bonds, diminishing the catalyst's effectiveness and reducing yield.

---

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrocarbon chains (six carbons or more) without additional polar functional groups lead to high yield; the presence of additional polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) on long chains leads to low yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - Octanoic acid

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid  
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid  
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Hydrophobic long-chain acids may enhance interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or improve substrate accessibility, boosting reactivity. Additional polar groups on long chains can introduce unfavorable solvation effects or steric hindrance, interfering with effective coordination and lowering yield.

---

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (five carbons or fewer) containing terminal amino or thiol groups lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - 5-aminopentanoic acid  
  - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Terminal amino or thiol groups in close proximity to the carboxylate can efficiently coordinate with the metal centers in the catalyst. This enhances catalyst-modifier interactions and improves catalytic performance, leading to high yield.

---

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen directly in the aromatic ring (e.g., pyridine carboxylic acids) lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)  
  - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

  **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings act as additional coordination sites for the metal centers in the catalyst. This strengthens catalyst-modifier interactions, enhancing catalytic activity and yielding higher product formation.

---

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids with multiple nitrogen atoms lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid

  **Explanation**: Multiple nitrogen atoms in heterocyclic rings provide several coordination sites, enhancing interactions with the metal centers of the catalyst and improving yield.

---

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms (e.g., indole ring in tryptophan) lead to high yield; those with aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms (e.g., phenyl group in phenylalanine) lead to low yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)

  **Explanation**: Heteroatoms in the aromatic side chain can coordinate with the metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity through additional interactions. Aromatic side chains without heteroatoms lack this coordinating ability and may hinder catalyst interactions, reducing yield.

---

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers that are carboxylic acids with perfluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid  
  - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Strong electron-withdrawing effects from fluorinated groups can decrease the basicity of coordinating atoms and destabilize catalyst-modifier interactions. This reduces the binding affinity to the metal centers, diminishing catalytic performance and yield.

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers that are sugar acids or polyhydroxy carboxylic acids lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

  **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous coordination sites and enhance solubility. This allows for extensive interactions and chelation with the catalyst's metal centers, improving catalytic efficiency and leading to high yield.

---

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a thiol group on a short chain lead to high yield; thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings lead to low yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Thiol groups on short aliphatic chains can form effective coordination with metal centers without deactivating the catalyst. Aromatic thiols may bind too strongly or interfere with catalytic sites due to their conjugated systems, reducing yield.

---

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers that are amide derivatives of carboxylic acids lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid  
  - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

  **Explanation**: Amide formation reduces the availability of lone pairs on nitrogen and oxygen atoms for coordination with metal centers. This decreases catalyst-modifier interactions, leading to reduced catalytic efficiency and lower yield.

---

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating groups attached via flexible aliphatic chains lead to high yield; those connected via rigid aromatic rings lead to low yield due to steric hindrance.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Flexible aliphatic linkers allow the coordinating group (e.g., pyridine nitrogen) to orient and coordinate effectively with the catalyst's metal centers. Rigid aromatic linkers prevent optimal alignment due to steric hindrance or reduced flexibility, diminishing coordination efficiency and lowering yield.

---

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino groups on long chains (more than six carbons) lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid  
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid

  **Explanation**: In long-chain amino acids, the amino group is distant from the carboxylate and may not effectively coordinate with the catalyst's metal centers. Additionally, the long hydrophilic chains can disrupt hydrophobic interactions or introduce steric hindrance, reducing catalytic efficiency and yield.

---

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with substituents capable of forming intramolecular hydrogen bonds (e.g., hydroxyl groups ortho to the carboxyl group) may lead to low yield due to reduced availability of coordination sites.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Intramolecular hydrogen bonding can sequester functional groups that would otherwise coordinate with the catalyst's metal centers. This reduces catalyst-modifier interactions and lowers yield.

    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (α-amino acids with two carboxylic acid groups) lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)
  - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)

  **Explanation**: The presence of an α-amino group and two carboxylic acid groups provides multiple coordination sites to the metal catalyst. This enhances metal-ligand interactions, improving catalytic activity and leading to high yield.

---

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituents capable of coordinating to metal centers (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl, pyridyl groups) lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 4-aminobenzoic acid
  - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
  - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Para-substituents that can coordinate with metal centers enhance the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst. This strengthens catalyst-modifier interactions, improving catalytic efficiency and leading to high yield.

---

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituents incapable of coordinating to metal centers or with strong electron-withdrawing groups that do not coordinate lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 4-methylbenzoic acid
  - 4-formylbenzoic acid
  - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Non-coordinating substituents or strong electron-withdrawing groups can decrease the effectiveness of metal coordination. This weakens catalyst-modifier interactions, reducing catalytic efficiency and leading to low yield.

---

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrophobic chains (six or more carbons) without additional polar functional groups lead to high yield; inclusion of polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) on long chains leads to low yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:
  - Octanoic acid

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Hydrophobic long-chain acids may enhance interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or improve substrate accessibility, boosting reactivity and leading to high yield. Additional polar groups on long chains can introduce unfavorable solvation effects or steric hindrance, interfering with effective coordination and lowering yield.

---

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (five carbons or fewer) containing amino or thiol groups lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 5-aminopentanoic acid
  - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Terminal amino or thiol groups in close proximity to the carboxylate can efficiently coordinate with the metal centers in the catalyst. This enhances catalyst-modifier interactions and improves catalytic performance, leading to high yield.

---

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen in the aromatic ring lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)
  - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
  - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

  **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings act as additional coordination sites for the metal centers in the catalyst. This strengthens catalyst-modifier interactions, enhancing catalytic activity and yielding higher product formation.

---

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms (e.g., indole ring in tryptophan) lead to high yield; those with aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms (e.g., phenyl group in phenylalanine) lead to low yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:
  - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:
  - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)

  **Explanation**: Heteroatoms in the aromatic side chain can coordinate with the metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity through additional interactions. Aromatic side chains without heteroatoms lack this coordinating ability and may hinder catalyst interactions, reducing yield.

---

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers containing strong electron-withdrawing groups such as fluorinated alkyl chains lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Strong electron-withdrawing effects from fluorinated groups decrease the basicity of coordinating atoms and destabilize catalyst-modifier interactions. This reduces the binding affinity to the metal centers, diminishing catalytic performance and leading to low yield.

---

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers that are sugar acids or polyhydroxy carboxylic acids lead to high yield due to multiple coordination sites provided by hydroxyl groups.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:
  - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

  **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous coordination sites and enhance solubility. This allows for extensive interactions and chelation with the catalyst's metal centers, improving catalytic efficiency and leading to high yield.

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers that are amide derivatives of carboxylic acids or contain peptide bonds lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
  - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

  **Explanation**: Amide formation reduces the availability of lone pairs on nitrogen and oxygen atoms for coordination with metal centers. This decreases catalyst-modifier interactions, leading to reduced catalytic efficiency and lower yield.

  **Explanation**: The presence of an α-amino group and two carboxyl groups provides multiple coordination sites, facilitating strong chelation with metal centers. This enhances catalyst stability and activity, leading to high yield.

---

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with a **para-substituted electron-donating group** (such as amino or hydroxy) and an **aliphatic side chain of four or more carbons** result in **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
  - 4-aminobenzoic acid
  - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups increase electron density on the aromatic ring, enhancing coordination with metal centers. The extended aliphatic side chain improves flexibility and accessibility, facilitating better interactions with the catalyst.

---

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms** in the aromatic ring, and **without bulky substituents**, lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)
  - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
  - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

  **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings act as coordination sites, enhancing metal-ligand interactions, resulting in improved catalytic efficiency and high yield.

---

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 3 to 5 carbons**, containing **thio (-SH) or amino (-NH2) groups**, lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - 5-aminopentanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Thio and amino groups can coordinate with metal centers. Short-chain lengths ensure minimal steric hindrance, enhancing catalyst-modifier interactions.

---

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (6 or more carbons)** with **no additional polar functional groups** result in **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:
  - Octanoic acid

  **Low Yield Examples**:
  - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid (contains hydroxyl group)
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid (contains amino group)
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid (contains amino group)

  **Explanation**: Long hydrophobic chains can enhance interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or substrate, improving reaction efficiency. Presence of polar groups may interfere with coordination or disrupt hydrophobic interactions.

---

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers that possess **multiple hydroxyl groups** (polyhydroxy carboxylic acids) lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:
  - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

  **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous coordination sites, strengthening interactions with metal centers and enhancing catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups** (such as formyl or methyl) lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 4-formylbenzoic acid
  - 4-methylbenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density on the aromatic ring, reducing its ability to coordinate with metal centers, thereby decreasing catalytic performance.

---

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers that contain **strong electron-withdrawing groups**, such as **fluorinated groups**, result in **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups reduce the electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening metal-ligand interactions and leading to reduced catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers that have **amide bonds or peptide linkages** result in **low yield** due to reduced availability of lone pairs for coordination.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
  - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Amide formation involves lone pairs on nitrogen and oxygen, reducing their availability for coordination with metals, weakening catalyst-modifier interactions.

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with substituents causing steric hindrance**, leading to decreased coordination, result in **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (bulky due to fused rings)
  - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (possible intramolecular hydrogen bonding)

  **Explanation**: Steric hindrance or intramolecular interactions reduce the accessibility of coordination sites, diminishing catalyst-modifier binding and catalytic efficiency.

---

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms** (e.g., phenylalanine) lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:
  - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)

  **Explanation**: Aromatic side chains without heteroatoms provide few coordination sites. Lack of additional interacting groups reduces metal-ligand interactions, leading to lower yield.

---

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids longer than 6 carbons containing polar functional groups**, such as amino or hydroxyl groups, lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid

  **Explanation**: The presence of polar groups may disrupt hydrophobic interactions or interfere with proper coordination with the metal center, reducing catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-donating groups**, but having a **short aliphatic side chain (3 carbons or fewer)**, lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:
  - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

  **High Yield Counterexample**:
  - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid (longer side chain, high yield)

  **Explanation**: A longer aliphatic side chain may be necessary to enhance interactions with the catalyst or substrate. Short chains might not provide sufficient flexibility or distance, resulting in lower yield.

---

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with additional aromatic rings or significant steric bulk** lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Bulky substituents can hinder coordination with the metal center due to steric effects, decreasing catalytic efficiency.

---

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers containing **intramolecular hydrogen bonding** that limits the availability of coordinating groups lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:
  - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Intramolecular hydrogen bonding can sequester potential coordinating groups, reducing their availability to interact with the metal center, leading to decreased catalytic activity.

    Current_Rules:
    After carefully analyzing the provided dataset and considering the current rules, I've identified several areas where the rules can be improved. Some of the existing rules overlap, are too specific, or do not accurately capture the trends observed in the data. Therefore, I've crafted a new set of rules that better describe the relationship between the molecular modifiers' structures and the relative high or low yield of the reaction.

**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are **α-amino dicarboxylic acids** (α-amino acids with two carboxyl groups) lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)
  - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)

  **Explanation**: The presence of an α-amino group and two carboxyl groups provides multiple coordination sites with the metal center, enhancing catalyst stability and activity, resulting in high yield.

---

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms** in the ring lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)
  - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid

  **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings act as additional coordination sites, enhancing interactions with the metal catalyst and improving catalytic efficiency.

---

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with a para-substituted electron-donating group** (such as amino, hydroxy, or methoxy groups) lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 4-aminobenzoic acid
  - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
  - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups increase electron density on the aromatic ring, enhancing coordination with the metal center and promoting catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 5 to 8 carbons** without additional polar functional groups lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:
  - Octanoic acid

  **Low Yield Counterexamples**:
  - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid (contains hydroxyl group)
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid (contains amino group)
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid (contains amino group)

  **Explanation**: Long-chain aliphatic acids can interact favorably with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst, enhancing reaction efficiency. Additional polar groups may disrupt these interactions or interfere with coordination.

---

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers containing **multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic backbone** (polyhydroxy carboxylic acids) lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:
  - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

  **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous coordination sites, strengthening interactions with the metal center and enhancing catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups** (such as formyl or methyl groups) lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 4-formylbenzoic acid
  - 4-methylbenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density on the aromatic ring, reducing its ability to coordinate with the metal center, thereby decreasing catalytic performance.

---

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers that contain **strong electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups** result in **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Fluorinated groups are highly electronegative and withdraw electron density, weakening metal-ligand interactions and leading to reduced catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers that have **amide bonds or peptide linkages** result in **low yield** due to reduced availability of lone pairs for coordination.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
  - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Amide formation involves lone pairs on nitrogen and oxygen, reducing their availability for coordination with the metal, thereby weakening catalyst-modifier interactions.

---

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with nonpolar aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms** lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:
  - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)

  **High Yield Counterexample**:
  - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan; contains an indole ring with nitrogen)

  **Explanation**: Nonpolar aromatic side chains without heteroatoms provide few coordination sites. In contrast, heteroatom-containing side chains enhance metal-ligand interactions, leading to higher yield.

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids longer than 6 carbons containing polar functional groups** (such as amino or hydroxyl groups) lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Polar groups on long aliphatic chains may disrupt hydrophobic interactions or interfere with proper coordination with the metal center, reducing catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with substituents causing steric hindrance** lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (contains bulky fused rings)

  **Explanation**: Steric hindrance from bulky substituents can reduce the accessibility of coordination sites, diminishing catalyst-modifier binding and catalytic efficiency.

---

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers that contain **intramolecular hydrogen bonding** that limits the availability of coordinating groups lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:
  - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Intramolecular hydrogen bonding can sequester potential coordinating groups, reducing their availability to interact with the metal center, leading to decreased catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers with **mercapto (-SH) groups on short aliphatic chains** lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid (Note: Exception to the trend; see explanation)

  **Explanation**: Thiol groups have strong affinity for metal centers due to the soft nature of sulfur, enhancing coordination and catalytic activity. However, in aromatic systems like 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid, steric or electronic factors might reduce effectiveness, as seen with its low yield.

---

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted large heterocyclic groups** lead to **variable yield** dependent on steric factors.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid (less steric hindrance)

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (more steric hindrance)

  **Explanation**: The size and position of heterocyclic groups affect sterics and coordination ability. Modifiers with less steric hindrance can coordinate effectively, leading to high yield, while bulky groups reduce yield.

---

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 3 to 5 carbons containing amino groups** lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:
  - 5-aminopentanoic acid

  **Low Yield Counterexamples**:
  - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid (contains ether linkages)
  - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (longer chain and acetamido group)

  **Explanation**: Short aliphatic chains with amino groups can effectively coordinate with the metal center without significant steric hindrance, enhancing catalytic activity.

---

**End of Rules**

These rules aim to cover a broad range of the dataset while providing clear guidance on predicting the yield based on structural features of the modifiers. They balance simplicity and complexity, ensuring both higher coverage and specificity where necessary. The explanations tie the observed trends to underlying physicochemical properties, such as electron density, coordination ability, steric effects, and intramolecular interactions.

I believe these updated rules more accurately reflect the relationship between the molecular modifiers and the reaction yield, providing valuable insights for optimizing and controlling the reaction conditions.---------------------------------------------------------------
