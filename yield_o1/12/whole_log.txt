**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with an omega-amino group (amino group at the terminal position) on alkyl chains longer than five carbons lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Long-chain omega-amino acids such as 7-aminoheptanoic acid and 8-aminooctanoic acid have low yields. The terminal amino group may interfere with the catalyst's activity due to chelation or steric hindrance.

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups on aromatic rings lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Compounds like 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid have low yields. The aldehyde group can coordinate with the metal center or undergo side reactions, reducing the efficiency of the catalyst.

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Fluorinated compounds such as 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid and 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid exhibit low yields. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine may destabilize the catalyst-modifier interaction.

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are α-amino acids with dicarboxylic functionalities (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) lead to high yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Aspartic acid and glutamic acid have high yields. The presence of both amino and dicarboxylic groups may facilitate better coordination with the metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity.

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) lead to high yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Compounds like 4-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid show high yields. Electron-withdrawing groups can increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, improving binding to the metal sites.

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers with thiol groups on short aliphatic chains lead to high yield, while those with thiol groups on aromatic rings lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid (aliphatic thiol) has a high yield, whereas 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid (aromatic thiol) has a low yield. Aliphatic thiols may form stable interactions with the catalyst without deactivating it, unlike aromatic thiols.

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers that are pyridine carboxylic acids lead to high yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid show high yields. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers that are aromatic amino acids with electron-rich side chains (e.g., tryptophan) lead to high yield, while those with less electron-rich aromatic rings (e.g., phenylalanine) lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Tryptophan (indole ring) results in high yield, whereas phenylalanine (phenyl ring) results in low yield. Electron-rich rings may facilitate better interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers with ether linkages in aliphatic chains lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Compounds like 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid exhibit low yields. Ether linkages may reduce the ability of the modifier to interact effectively with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers with hydroxyl groups on long aliphatic chains (chain length greater than six carbons) lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid shows low yield. The hydroxyl group on a long chain may cause undesirable interactions or steric hindrance affecting the catalyst's activity.

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers with ketone groups on aliphatic chains lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: 4-oxoheptanedioic acid has a low yield. The ketone group may interact unfavorably with the catalyst or participate in side reactions.

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy) on aromatic rings directly attached to the carboxylic acid lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: 4-methylbenzoic acid and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid have low yields. Electron-donating groups may decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, reducing binding affinity to the metal centers.

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers that are polyhydroxylated compounds lead to high yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Compounds like (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid have high yields. Multiple hydroxyl groups may enhance interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers with aromatic rings separated by aliphatic chains of four carbons or more lead to high yield.*  
  **Explanation**: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid and 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid exhibit high yields. The aliphatic spacer may reduce steric hindrance and improve flexibility for optimal catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers containing aldehyde groups on aliphatic chains lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups are reactive and may undergo side reactions or deactivate the catalyst, as seen in 4-oxoheptanedioic acid.

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and applies specifically to aliphatic carboxylic acids with an omega-amino group on chains longer than five carbons, leading to low yield. The property insight about steric hindrance or chelation is adequate. The rule considers the combination of chain length and functional groups, satisfying complexity, and is supported by two data points, meeting the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 clearly states that modifiers containing aldehyde groups on aromatic rings lead to low yield. The physical-chemical insight regarding potential coordination with metal centers or side reactions is reasonable. The rule focuses on specific functional groups, fulfilling complexity, and is supported by two data points, satisfying coverage.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear in identifying modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups as leading to low yield. The explanation about electron-withdrawing effects destabilizing catalyst interactions provides adequate property insight. The rule is specific and considers combinations of sub-structures, meeting the complexity criterion, and has coverage of two data points.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 clearly identifies that α-amino acids with dicarboxylic functionalities lead to high yield. The property insight about enhanced coordination with metal centers is strong. The rule combines multiple functional groups, satisfying complexity, and is supported by at least two data points, fulfilling the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 states that para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing groups lead to high yield. The explanation regarding increased acidity improving metal binding provides good property insight. The rule considers substitution patterns and electron effects, fulfilling complexity, and is supported by two data points.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 distinctly differentiates between modifiers with thiol groups on aliphatic chains (high yield) and those on aromatic rings (low yield). The property insight is adequate, explaining how thiol placement affects catalyst interaction. The rule considers combinations of functional groups and chain types, meeting complexity, and is backed by two data points.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is generally clear, stating that pyridine carboxylic acids lead to high yield. However, exceptions like 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid suggest the rule may need refinement for clarity. The property insight is acceptable. The rule has moderate complexity and is supported by two data points, but additional data could strengthen coverage.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 clearly distinguishes between aromatic amino acids with electron-rich side chains (high yield) and those with less electron-rich rings (low yield). The property insight about electron-rich rings enhancing catalyst interaction is solid. The rule considers combinations of structural features, fulfilling complexity, and is supported by two data points.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 lacks clarity due to limited coverage and possible exceptions; not all modifiers with ether linkages lead to low yield. The property insight is minimal, and the rule does not sufficiently consider combinations of sub-structures, falling short on complexity. It is supported by only one data point, which weakens its reliability.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear in specifying that hydroxyl groups on long aliphatic chains lead to low yield. The property insight is modest, citing steric hindrance. However, the rule has limited coverage with only one supporting data point, and may lack complexity by not considering other structural factors.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 has limited coverage with only one data point and potential contradictions, as some modifiers with ketone groups may have high yields. The property insight is insufficient, and the rule lacks complexity, considering only a single functional group. It requires more data for validation.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is clear and specifies that electron-donating groups on aromatic rings directly attached to the carboxylic acid lead to low yield. The property insight about decreased acidity affecting metal binding is strong. The rule demonstrates complexity by considering functional group effects and is supported by two data points.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 clearly states that polyhydroxylated compounds lead to high yield. The property insight is robust, highlighting enhanced interactions due to multiple hydroxyl groups. The rule considers the combination of multiple functional groups, satisfying complexity, and is supported by two data points.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 is clear and combines structural features by stating that aromatic rings separated by aliphatic chains of four carbons or more lead to high yield. The property insight regarding reduced steric hindrance and improved flexibility is strong. The rule meets complexity criteria and is supported by two data points.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 lacks sufficient coverage with only one supporting data point and may be too general. The property insight is limited, and the rule does not consider combinations of sub-structures, falling short on complexity. Additional data are needed to validate this rule.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with an omega-amino group (amino group at the terminal position) on alkyl chains longer than five carbons lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Long-chain omega-amino acids such as 7-aminoheptanoic acid and 8-aminooctanoic acid have low yields. The terminal amino group may interfere with the catalyst's activity due to chelation or steric hindrance.

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups on aromatic rings lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Compounds like 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid have low yields. The aldehyde group can coordinate with the metal center or undergo side reactions, reducing the efficiency of the catalyst.

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Fluorinated compounds such as 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid and 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid exhibit low yields. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine may destabilize the catalyst-modifier interaction.

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are α-amino acids with dicarboxylic functionalities (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) lead to high yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Aspartic acid and glutamic acid have high yields. The presence of both amino and dicarboxylic groups may facilitate better coordination with the metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity.

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) lead to high yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Compounds like 4-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid show high yields. Electron-withdrawing groups can increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, improving binding to the metal sites.

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers with thiol groups on short aliphatic chains lead to high yield, while those with thiol groups on aromatic rings lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid (aliphatic thiol) has a high yield, whereas 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid (aromatic thiol) has a low yield. Aliphatic thiols may form stable interactions with the catalyst without deactivating it, unlike aromatic thiols.

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers that are pyridine carboxylic acids lead to high yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid show high yields. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers that are aromatic amino acids with electron-rich side chains (e.g., tryptophan) lead to high yield, while those with less electron-rich aromatic rings (e.g., phenylalanine) lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Tryptophan (indole ring) results in high yield, whereas phenylalanine (phenyl ring) results in low yield. Electron-rich rings may facilitate better interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers with ether linkages in aliphatic chains lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Compounds like 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid exhibit low yields. Ether linkages may reduce the ability of the modifier to interact effectively with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers with hydroxyl groups on long aliphatic chains (chain length greater than six carbons) lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid shows low yield. The hydroxyl group on a long chain may cause undesirable interactions or steric hindrance affecting the catalyst's activity.

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers with ketone groups on aliphatic chains lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: 4-oxoheptanedioic acid has a low yield. The ketone group may interact unfavorably with the catalyst or participate in side reactions.

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy) on aromatic rings directly attached to the carboxylic acid lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: 4-methylbenzoic acid and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid have low yields. Electron-donating groups may decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, reducing binding affinity to the metal centers.

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers that are polyhydroxylated compounds lead to high yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Compounds like (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid have high yields. Multiple hydroxyl groups may enhance interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers with aromatic rings separated by aliphatic chains of four carbons or more lead to high yield.*  
  **Explanation**: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid and 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid exhibit high yields. The aliphatic spacer may reduce steric hindrance and improve flexibility for optimal catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers containing aldehyde groups on aliphatic chains lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups are reactive and may undergo side reactions or deactivate the catalyst, as seen in 4-oxoheptanedioic acid.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- **Suggestion 1**: **For Rule 1**, modify the SMARTS pattern to capture omega-amino acids with alkyl chains longer than five carbons more effectively. The current pattern `'[NX3H2][CH2]{5,}[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'` may miss molecules where the chain length is six carbons but not strictly composed of uninterrupted `[CH2]` units. Consider using a more flexible pattern like `'[NX3H2]C{5,}[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'`, which allows for any carbon chain of length five or more between the amino group and the carboxylic acid, accommodating branching or heteroatoms if appropriate.

- **Suggestion 2**: **For Rule 4**, adjust the SMARTS pattern to accurately identify α-amino acids with dicarboxylic functionalities. The current pattern `'[NX3H2][CX4H](C(=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` may be too restrictive and miss valid structures like aspartic acid and glutamic acid. Use a pattern like `'[NX3H2][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX1-,OX2H1])[CX3](=O)[OX1-,OX2H1]'` to account for variations in side chains and ensure both carboxylic acid groups are recognized, regardless of stereochemistry.

- **Suggestion 3**: **For Rule 13**, ensure that the SMARTS pattern counts the number of hydroxyl groups correctly. The pattern `'[CX4H,CH2][OX2H]'` alone may match molecules with fewer hydroxyl groups. Implement a function to count all occurrences of this substructure within a molecule and compare it against the `count_threshold`. Alternatively, use a recursive SMARTS pattern like `'[$([CX4H][OX2H])]'` and sum the matches to ensure only polyhydroxylated compounds meet or exceed the threshold.

- **Suggestion 4**: **For Rule 5**, refine the SMARTS pattern to specifically target para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing groups. The current pattern `'c1cc(ccc1C(=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])[N,O,S,F,Cl,Br,I]'` may not exclusively select para-substituted compounds or may miss some electron-withdrawing groups. Modify it to `'C1=CC([NX1,#8,#16,F,Cl,Br,I])=CC=C1C(=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` to ensure substitution at the para position and include common electron-withdrawing groups like nitro (`[N+](=O)[O-]`), cyano (`C#N`), and others.

- **Suggestion 5**: **For Rule 6**, address the exclusion of thiol groups on aromatic rings more effectively. While the current code excludes molecules matching `'[c][SX2H]'`, it might not prevent all aromatic thiols from being included. Ensure that the exclusion pattern comprehensively captures aromatic thiols by using a more general pattern like `'[a][SX2H]'` or `'[cX2][SX2H]'`. Additionally, for aliphatic thiols, specify that the thiol group is on a short chain (e.g., 2-3 carbons) by adjusting the main SMARTS pattern accordingly.

- **Suggestion 6**: **For Rule 9**, refine the SMARTS pattern to target ether linkages specifically in aliphatic chains. The current pattern `'[CX4][OX2][CX4]'` may match ether groups in various contexts, including cyclic ethers or ethers adjacent to aromatic systems. Modify the pattern to `'[CX4H2][OX2][CX4H2]'` to focus on dialkyl ethers in aliphatic chains, thus excluding cyclic or aryl ethers.

- **Suggestion 7**: **For Rule 12**, expand the SMARTS pattern to include all electron-donating groups on aromatic rings directly attached to the carboxylic acid. The current pattern `'[c][c][c]([CH3,OCH3])[c][c][c][C](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` might be too specific and miss other electron-donating groups like hydroxyl or amino groups. Use a more inclusive pattern like `'c1ccc(cc1)[C](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` where the aromatic ring has an electron-donating substituent `[c][c]([NX3H2,OX2H,CH3])[c]`.

- **Suggestion 8**: **For stereochemistry**, ensure the SMARTS patterns are not overly restrictive due to stereochemical considerations unless necessary. Some molecules contain stereochemical markers (e.g., `@@H`) that might prevent matches. Use non-stereospecific patterns or specify racemic matching to ensure that molecules are not excluded based on stereochemistry when it's not relevant to the rule.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Implement tests** for each SMARTS pattern against known examples and counter-examples. This validation step can help identify mismatches between the rule intent and the SMARTS implementation. Adjust patterns based on test outcomes to improve accuracy.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Enhance error handling** in the code to log or report SMILES strings that could not be parsed or resulted in unexpected matches. This can assist in troubleshooting and refining both the data and the SMARTS patterns.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with an omega-amino group (amino group at the terminal position) on alkyl chains longer than five carbons lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Long-chain omega-amino acids such as 7-aminoheptanoic acid and 8-aminooctanoic acid have low yields. The terminal amino group may interfere with the catalyst's activity due to chelation or steric hindrance.

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups on aromatic rings lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Compounds like 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid have low yields. The aldehyde group can coordinate with the metal center or undergo side reactions, reducing the efficiency of the catalyst.

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Fluorinated compounds such as 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid and 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid exhibit low yields. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine may destabilize the catalyst-modifier interaction.

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are α-amino acids with dicarboxylic functionalities (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) lead to high yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Aspartic acid and glutamic acid have high yields. The presence of both amino and dicarboxylic groups may facilitate better coordination with the metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity.

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) lead to high yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Compounds like 4-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid show high yields. Electron-withdrawing groups can increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, improving binding to the metal sites.

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers with thiol groups on short aliphatic chains lead to high yield, while those with thiol groups on aromatic rings lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid (aliphatic thiol) has a high yield, whereas 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid (aromatic thiol) has a low yield. Aliphatic thiols may form stable interactions with the catalyst without deactivating it, unlike aromatic thiols.

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers that are pyridine carboxylic acids lead to high yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid show high yields. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers that are aromatic amino acids with electron-rich side chains (e.g., tryptophan) lead to high yield, while those with less electron-rich aromatic rings (e.g., phenylalanine) lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Tryptophan (indole ring) results in high yield, whereas phenylalanine (phenyl ring) results in low yield. Electron-rich rings may facilitate better interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers with ether linkages in aliphatic chains lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Compounds like 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid exhibit low yields. Ether linkages may reduce the ability of the modifier to interact effectively with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers with hydroxyl groups on long aliphatic chains (chain length greater than six carbons) lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid shows low yield. The hydroxyl group on a long chain may cause undesirable interactions or steric hindrance affecting the catalyst's activity.

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers with ketone groups on aliphatic chains lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: 4-oxoheptanedioic acid has a low yield. The ketone group may interact unfavorably with the catalyst or participate in side reactions.

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy) on aromatic rings directly attached to the carboxylic acid lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: 4-methylbenzoic acid and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid have low yields. Electron-donating groups may decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, reducing binding affinity to the metal centers.

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers that are polyhydroxylated compounds lead to high yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Compounds like (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid have high yields. Multiple hydroxyl groups may enhance interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers with aromatic rings separated by aliphatic chains of four carbons or more lead to high yield.*  
  **Explanation**: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid and 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid exhibit high yields. The aliphatic spacer may reduce steric hindrance and improve flexibility for optimal catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers containing aldehyde groups on aliphatic chains lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups are reactive and may undergo side reactions or deactivate the catalyst, as seen in 4-oxoheptanedioic acid.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: **Adjust the SMARTS pattern for Rule 1**. The current pattern `"[NX3H2][CH2]{5,}[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]"` may not match molecules where the amino group is on the long alkyl chain but not directly connected (e.g., branched chains or additional substituents). Modify the SMARTS to capture any aliphatic chain longer than five carbons terminating with a carboxylic acid and having an omega-amino group. A possible improved SMARTS could be `"[NX3H2]C([CH2]){5,}C(=O)[OX2H1]"` or use wildcards to allow for branching: `"[NX3H2][C,c]([C,c]{4,})[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]"`.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: **Expand the SMARTS patterns for Rule 3**. The current patterns `"[CX4][F]"` and `"[CX4](F)(F)F"` may miss fluorinated compounds where fluorine atoms are not directly attached to a methyl or methylene group. Include patterns to capture fluorinated alkyl chains more generally, such as `"[CX4][CX4](F)"` (for fluorine on the second carbon) or use `"[C;!H0;!$(C=*)][F]"` to match any carbon (except carbonyl carbons) attached to fluorine.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: **Refine the SMARTS pattern for Rule 13**. The pattern `"[CX4][OX2H]"` with a count threshold of 3 may incorrectly match molecules with hydroxyl groups that are not part of polyhydroxylated systems (e.g., dispersed hydroxyls). To specifically target polyhydroxylated compounds, consider using a pattern that matches multiple hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons, such as `"[CX4H1]([OX2H])[CX4H1]([OX2H])[CX4H1]([OX2H])"` for three consecutive hydroxylated carbons.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: **Review the SMARTS for Rule 6 regarding exclusions**. The exclude pattern `"[a][SX2H]"` might not exclude all aromatic thiols correctly. Ensure the exclude pattern accurately captures all aromatic systems with thiol groups. Consider using `"[c][SX2H]"` or `"[c;!H0][SX2H]"` to better represent aromatic thiols.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: **Include missing rules in the code and feature matrix**. Rules 8, 10, 11, 14, and 15 are absent from the current code and feature matrix. Incorporate these rules to fully assess the modifiers according to all defined criteria.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: **Ensure consistency in rule application**. Some modifiers that should match certain rules are not flagged in the feature matrix. Implement thorough testing of each rule against all SMILES to verify correct matches. This may involve creating test cases for each rule and debugging the code where mismatches occur.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: **Use more comprehensive SMARTS patterns**. For example, in Rule 12, the pattern `c1cc([OX2H,OX2CH3,CH3])ccc1C(=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]` may not capture all electron-donating groups. Expand the electron-donating group definitions to include groups like amino (`[NX3H2,NX3H1,NX3H0]`), alkoxy (`[OX2][CX4]`), etc.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: **Handle tautomers and ionization states**. Modify the code to account for different ionization states or tautomeric forms of modifiers, which may affect the SMARTS matching. Use canonicalization or standardization steps before substructure searching.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: **Optimize substructure search performance**. Compile SMARTS patterns outside of loops where possible and consider using the `SubstructMatch()` with match parameters to enhance efficiency and accuracy.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: **Add explicit hydrogens when necessary**. RDKit may require explicit hydrogens for certain SMARTS patterns (e.g., `[NX3H2]`). Ensure molecules have explicit hydrogens added with `mol = Chem.AddHs(mol)` before matching.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with an omega-amino group (amino group at the terminal position) on alkyl chains longer than five carbons lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Long-chain omega-amino acids such as 7-aminoheptanoic acid and 8-aminooctanoic acid have low yields. The terminal amino group may interfere with the catalyst's activity due to chelation or steric hindrance.

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups on aromatic rings lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Compounds like 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid have low yields. The aldehyde group can coordinate with the metal center or undergo side reactions, reducing the efficiency of the catalyst.

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Fluorinated compounds such as 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid and 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid exhibit low yields. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine may destabilize the catalyst-modifier interaction.

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are α-amino acids with dicarboxylic functionalities (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) lead to high yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Aspartic acid and glutamic acid have high yields. The presence of both amino and dicarboxylic groups may facilitate better coordination with the metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity.

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) lead to high yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Compounds like 4-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid show high yields. Electron-withdrawing groups can increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, improving binding to the metal sites.

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers with thiol groups on short aliphatic chains lead to high yield, while those with thiol groups on aromatic rings lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid (aliphatic thiol) has a high yield, whereas 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid (aromatic thiol) has a low yield. Aliphatic thiols may form stable interactions with the catalyst without deactivating it, unlike aromatic thiols.

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers that are pyridine carboxylic acids lead to high yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid show high yields. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers that are aromatic amino acids with electron-rich side chains (e.g., tryptophan) lead to high yield, while those with less electron-rich aromatic rings (e.g., phenylalanine) lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Tryptophan (indole ring) results in high yield, whereas phenylalanine (phenyl ring) results in low yield. Electron-rich rings may facilitate better interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers with ether linkages in aliphatic chains lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Compounds like 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid exhibit low yields. Ether linkages may reduce the ability of the modifier to interact effectively with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers with hydroxyl groups on long aliphatic chains (chain length greater than six carbons) lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid shows low yield. The hydroxyl group on a long chain may cause undesirable interactions or steric hindrance affecting the catalyst's activity.

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers with ketone groups on aliphatic chains lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: 4-oxoheptanedioic acid has a low yield. The ketone group may interact unfavorably with the catalyst or participate in side reactions.

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy) on aromatic rings directly attached to the carboxylic acid lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: 4-methylbenzoic acid and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid have low yields. Electron-donating groups may decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, reducing binding affinity to the metal centers.

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers that are polyhydroxylated compounds lead to high yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Compounds like (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid have high yields. Multiple hydroxyl groups may enhance interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers with aromatic rings separated by aliphatic chains of four carbons or more lead to high yield.*  
  **Explanation**: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid and 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid exhibit high yields. The aliphatic spacer may reduce steric hindrance and improve flexibility for optimal catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers containing aldehyde groups on aliphatic chains lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups are reactive and may undergo side reactions or deactivate the catalyst, as seen in 4-oxoheptanedioic acid.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- **Suggestion 1**: **Rule 4**'s SMARTS pattern does not correctly match α-amino acids with dicarboxylic functionalities like aspartic acid and glutamic acid. The current pattern `[NX3H2][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX1-,OX2H1])[CX3](=O)[OX1-,OX2H1]` expects two carboxylic acids directly attached to the alpha carbon, which is not the case for glutamic acid where the second carboxyl group is on the side chain. To correct this, modify the SMARTS to allow the second carboxylic acid to be connected elsewhere in the molecule:
  - Revised SMARTS: `[NX3H2][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX1-,OX2H1])[#6]` combined with a separate pattern for an additional carboxylic acid `[CX3](=O)[OX1-,OX2H1]` elsewhere in the molecule.
  - Implement matching where the molecule has an alpha amino acid structure with at least two carboxyl groups, not necessarily both attached to the same carbon.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Rule 3**'s SMARTS patterns may not capture all fluorinated alkyl chains. The pattern `[C;!H0;!$(C=*)][F]` misses carbons without implicit hydrogens, such as fully substituted carbons. To improve this:
  - Use `[C][F]` to match any carbon attached to fluorine.
  - Include patterns for perfluorinated chains, such as `[*][C](F)(F)[F]` and `[*][C](F)(F)(F)` for trifluoromethyl groups.
  - Ensure the SMARTS captures all relevant fluorinated groups as per the rule.

- **Suggestion 3**: For **Rule 1**, clarify the chain length counting in the SMARTS pattern `[NX3H2][CH2]{5,}[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]`. The current pattern requires at least five CH₂ units between the amino group and the carboxyl group. If "chains longer than five carbons" means six or more carbons total (including the carboxyl carbon), adjust the pattern accordingly:
  - If including the carboxyl carbon, change the repeat count to `{4,}`.
  - If not, ensure that examples like 7-aminoheptanoic acid match the pattern.

- **Suggestion 4**: In **Rule 4**, consider protonation states. The SMARTS `[NX3H2]` requires the nitrogen to have exactly two hydrogens, missing zwitterionic forms where the amine may be protonated (e.g., `[NX3H3+]`). Modify the SMARTS to include possible protonation states:
  - Use `[NX3H2,NX3H3+]` to match both neutral and protonated amino groups.
  - Similarly, account for deprotonated carboxylates by including `[OX1-,OX2H1]` and `[OX1-,OX2H0]`.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Rule 13**'s pattern `[CX4][OX2H]` with a count threshold of 3 may incorrectly match molecules with hydroxyl groups on the same carbon. To ensure multiple hydroxyls are on different carbons:
  - Use `[CX4;$([CX4][OX2H])]` to match carbons attached to hydroxyl groups.
  - Count unique matches of `[OX2H][CX4]` to ensure hydroxyls are on separate carbons.
  - Adjust the code to count distinct hydroxylated carbons.

- **Suggestion 6**: For **Rule 7**, the SMARTS pattern `[n][c,cH][c,cH][c,cH][c,cH][c,cH]C(=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]` is too specific and may miss pyridine carboxylic acids with substituents. Simplify the SMARTS to match any pyridine ring with a carboxylic acid:
  - Use `[n][a]C(=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]` to match a nitrogen-containing aromatic ring directly attached to a carboxylic acid.
  - This adjustment captures more variations of pyridine carboxylic acids.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Rule 2**'s SMARTS `[c][CX3H](=O)` might not capture aldehyde groups if substituents are present on the aldehyde carbon. Expand the pattern to include substituted aromatic aldehydes:
  - Use `[c][CX3H0](=O)` to match both hydrogen and substituted aldehyde carbons on aromatic rings.
  - Ensure the pattern does not miss molecules where the formyl group has substituents.

- **Suggestion 8**: Add more comprehensive **error handling** in the code. When a molecule cannot be parsed (`mol is None`), instead of silently adding zeros, log the SMILES string and the error details for debugging purposes. This helps identify and correct issues with specific molecules.

- **Suggestion 9**: Include **unit tests** for each rule with known matching and non-matching SMILES examples. This ensures that SMARTS patterns are correctly implemented and helps catch mismatches between the rules and the code.

**Analysis of Current Rule Metrics with Focus on Confidence and Lift**

**Current Metrics:**

- **Train Support**: 0.0336
- **Train Confidence**: 0.6961
- **Train Lift**: 1.4058
- **Train Leverage**: 0.0082

**Reference Metrics (Previous Rule Metrics):**

- **Train Support**: [0.1667, 0.1845]
- **Test Support**: [0.0833, 0.1354]
- **Train Confidence**: [0.6352, 0.5396]
- **Test Confidence**: [0.3333, 0.4639]
- **Train Lift**: [1.2048, 1.0559]
- **Test Lift**: [0.6889, 0.9137]
- **Train Leverage**: [0.0289, -0.0041]
- **Test Leverage**: [-0.0313, -0.0339]

**Performance Comparison:**

1. **Confidence:**

   - **Current Confidence** is **0.6961**, which is **higher** than the previous train confidence values of **0.6352** and **0.5396**.
   - **Interpretation**: The current rules are predicting the outcome with greater accuracy when the rule conditions are met. A higher confidence indicates that, given the rule condition, the likelihood of the rule prediction being true is increased.

2. **Lift:**

   - **Current Lift** is **1.4058**, which exceeds the previous lift values of **1.2048** and **1.0559**.
   - **Interpretation**: A lift greater than 1 signifies a positive association between the rule condition and prediction. The higher lift in the current rules indicates that the presence of the condition increases the probability of the prediction more significantly than in previous iterations.

3. **Support:**

   - **Current Support** is **0.0336**, which is substantially lower than the previous support values of **0.1667** and **0.1845**.
   - **Interpretation**: The rules apply to a smaller portion of the dataset. While higher confidence and lift are advantageous, low support suggests that the rules may not be broadly applicable.

4. **Leverage:**

   - **Current Leverage** is **0.0082**, lower than the previous positive leverage but higher than the negative leverage value.
   - **Interpretation**: Positive leverage indicates a stronger association than expected by chance. Although the current leverage is positive, it's relatively low, suggesting a modest increase in predictive capability over random chance.

**Assessment of Local Minimum and Iteration Sufficiency:**

- **Local Minimum Consideration**:

  - The increase in confidence and lift suggests improvement in rule performance regarding precision and the strength of association.
  - However, the decreased support may indicate that the model is overfitting or focusing on niche patterns that don't generalize well.
  - It is possible that a local minimum has been reached in maximizing confidence and lift but at the expense of support.

- **Iteration Sufficiency**:

  - Given the trade-offs observed, there may be room for further iterations.
  - Enhancing support without significantly compromising confidence and lift could lead to more robust and generalizable rules.
  - Additional iterations could explore broader patterns that maintain high confidence and lift while increasing support.

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules:**

1. **Balance Between Specificity and Generalization**:

   - **Issue**: The current rules may be too specific, capturing narrow patterns that don't apply widely (low support).
   - **Solution**: Generalize some rule conditions to encompass a larger set of data points, which can increase support.
   - **Action**: Identify common features among high-yield modifiers and adjust the rules to include broader categories rather than specific compounds.

2. **Re-evaluate Rule Conditions**:

   - **Issue**: Some rule conditions might be excluding relevant data due to overly strict criteria.
   - **Solution**: Re-assess the conditions to ensure they are not unnecessarily restrictive.
   - **Action**: Consider relaxing certain parameters in the rules, such as chain length or specific functional groups, to include more data points.

3. **Combine Similar Rules**:

   - **Issue**: Multiple rules covering similar cases might dilute support across them.
   - **Solution**: Merge similar rules to consolidate support while maintaining confidence and lift.
   - **Action**: Group rules that have overlapping conditions or predictions to create more robust, higher-support rules.

4. **Feature Engineering**:

   - **Issue**: Current features used in rules might not capture all relevant patterns.
   - **Solution**: Introduce new features or descriptors that could better explain the variance in yield.
   - **Action**: Incorporate physicochemical properties, such as steric parameters or electronic effects, into the rules.

5. **Cross-Validation**:

   - **Issue**: The improvement in train metrics might not translate to unseen data.
   - **Solution**: Use cross-validation to evaluate the performance of the rules on different subsets of data.
   - **Action**: Apply k-fold cross-validation to ensure that the rules generalize well and are not overfitting to the training data.

6. **Evaluate Rule Interactions**:

   - **Issue**: Rules might be interacting in ways that affect overall model performance.
   - **Solution**: Analyze how different rules interact and influence each other.
   - **Action**: Use interaction plots or statistical tests to assess the interplay between rules and adjust them accordingly.

7. **Incremental Rule Refinement**:

   - **Issue**: Drastic changes might lead to loss of valuable insights captured by current rules.
   - **Solution**: Make incremental adjustments to the rules, monitoring how each change affects the metrics.
   - **Action**: Iteratively tweak rule conditions, assessing the impact on support, confidence, and lift after each change.

**Conclusion:**

- The current rules demonstrate improved confidence and lift, signaling stronger predictive power and association strength.
- However, the significant reduction in support indicates that these rules are applicable to a smaller portion of the dataset, potentially limiting their practical utility.
- To enhance the rules:

  - **Aim** to increase support while sustaining acceptable levels of confidence and lift.
  - **Continue Iterating**, focusing on adjusting rule specificity to encompass a broader dataset.
  - **Monitor** the effects of changes on all metrics to maintain a balance between them.

- Further iterations and refinements are suggested to achieve a set of rules that are both accurate and broadly applicable, ensuring they are valuable for practical applications in the catalytic problem being studied.

Traditional Commenter Message:
**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

**1. Evaluation of Model Accuracy**

The current validation accuracy achieved is **62.86%**, which is a significant decrease compared to the previous iterations where the validation accuracies were consistently around **76%**. The test accuracies in previous iterations ranged from **62.5% to 75%**. The drop in validation accuracy indicates that the current set of rules may not be as effective in accurately predicting the catalyst loading as before.

**2. Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting**

The notable decline in validation accuracy suggests that the model may be **underfitting** the data. This underfitting could be due to the rules being too generalized, failing to capture the underlying patterns necessary for accurate predictions. Alternatively, some rules might be contributing to systematic misclassifications, affecting the model's performance across the validation sets.

**3. Analysis of Discrepancies Using SHAP Values**

To identify which rules are contributing to misclassifications, we examined the SHAP values for molecules where the predicted loading does not match the experimental value.

**a. Overestimation Cases (Predicted High Loading, Experimental Low Loading)**

- **Molecules with Overestimated Loadings:**
  - *C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O*
  - *C(CCCC(=O)O)CCCN*
  - *CC1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=O)O*
  - *C1=CC(=CC=C1CCCCC(=O)O)O*
  - *C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)S*
  - *C(CCCO)CCC(=O)O*
  - *C(CCCN)CCC(=O)O*

- **Contributing Rules with High Positive SHAP Values:**
  - **Rule 2** consistently has the highest positive SHAP value in these cases.
  - **Rule 3** and **Rule 10** also contribute significantly in some instances.

**b. Underestimation Cases (Predicted Low Loading, Experimental High Loading)**

- No significant underestimation cases were observed in the provided data, indicating that the model predominantly overestimates high loading rather than underestimates it.

**4. Interpretation of Accuracy Decline**

The decrease in validation accuracy suggests that the current rules are not effectively discriminating between modifiers that lead to high and low catalyst loadings. The overemphasis on certain rules (e.g., Rule 2) in the model's predictions is likely causing systematic errors, resulting in lower overall accuracy.

**5. Insights from SHAP Analysis**

- **Rule 2** is contributing a significant positive SHAP value for high loading predictions, even when the experimental values are low. This indicates that **Rule 2 may be mischaracterized or overly generalized**, leading to incorrect predictions.
- **Rule 3** and **Rule 10** also show high positive SHAP values in overestimation cases, suggesting that these rules may also need refinement.
- The consistent misclassification associated with these rules points to potential flaws in how the rules are defined or applied in the feature matrix.

---

**Recommendations for Improvement**

**1. Refine Rule 2**

- **Current Issue:** Rule 2 states that modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups on aromatic rings lead to low yield. However, in the misclassified cases, Rule 2 is contributing to high loading predictions.
- **Suggested Refinement:**
  - **Reevaluate the Chemical Scope:** Ensure that Rule 2 accurately captures all modifiers with aldehyde groups on aromatic rings. There may be molecules incorrectly identified by this rule due to structural similarities or misannotations.
  - **Adjust the Rule Directionality:** Consider whether the presence of aldehyde groups on certain positions or ring systems might actually contribute to high loading in some cases. Modify the rule to account for these nuances.
  - **Implement Substructures Precisely:** Use more specific substructure queries to prevent unintended matches that could mislead the model.

**2. Adjust Rule 3**

- **Current Issue:** Rule 3 targets modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups, which are supposed to lead to low yield. However, Rule 3 is contributing positively to high loading predictions in overestimated cases.
- **Suggested Refinement:**
  - **Clarify Structural Criteria:** Ensure that Rule 3 is accurately identifying only those compounds with fluorinated groups that truly impact the catalyst loading negatively.
  - **Exclude Overlapping Features:** Check if Rule 3 overlaps with structural features in high-yield modifiers unintentionally and adjust accordingly.

**3. Reevaluate Rule 10**

- **Current Issue:** Rule 10 suggests that modifiers with hydroxyl groups on long aliphatic chains lead to low yield. Yet, it contributes to high loading predictions in misclassified molecules.
- **Suggested Refinement:**
  - **Specify Chain Lengths:** Clearly define what constitutes a "long" aliphatic chain (e.g., more than six carbons) to improve specificity.
  - **Consider Position of Hydroxyl Groups:** The position of the hydroxyl group along the chain may influence its effect. Adjust the rule to account for terminal versus internal hydroxyl groups.

**4. Improve Generalization**

- **Address Underfitting:**
  - **Introduce New Rules:** Analyze the misclassified molecules to identify new patterns or features that could be captured with additional rules.
  - **Balance Specificity and Generality:** Ensure that rules are neither too broad (leading to overgeneralization) nor too narrow (leading to overfitting to specific cases).
- **Enhance Rule Interactions:**
  - **Consider Rule Combinations:** Some modifiers may require the interplay of multiple chemical features to be accurately predicted. Implement interactions between rules where appropriate.
  - **Weight Rules Appropriately:** Adjust the importance (weights) of rules based on their overall contribution to accurate predictions.

**5. Utilize SHAP Insights for Iterative Refinement**

- **Identify Problematic Rules:** Use the SHAP analysis to pinpoint which rules consistently contribute to incorrect predictions.
- **Iterative Testing:** After refining rules, retrain the model and reassess the validation accuracy and SHAP values to observe improvements.
- **Document Changes:** Keep detailed records of rule adjustments and their effects on model performance to facilitate systematic improvement.

---

**Conclusion**

The current set of rules appears to be contributing to a decrease in model performance, primarily due to certain rules (notably Rule 2, Rule 3, and Rule 10) leading to overestimations of catalyst loading. By carefully refining these rules to more accurately reflect the underlying chemistry and addressing potential issues of underfitting, we can improve the model's predictive accuracy. Leveraging the insights from the SHAP analysis will guide the iterative refinement process, ultimately leading to a more robust and generalizable set of rules.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions to Optimize Current Rules**

The recent analysis of the catalyst modifier rules has highlighted several areas where the SMARTS (SMILES Arbitrary Target Specification) patterns and rule definitions can be improved to enhance predictive accuracy and generalizability. The key points from the discussions are as follows:

1. **Rule 1 (Aliphatic Omega-Amino Carboxylic Acids with Long Chains)**:
   - **Issue**: The current SMARTS pattern may not correctly capture omega-amino acids with chains longer than five carbons due to the way chain length is counted.
   - **Suggestion**: Adjust the SMARTS pattern to accurately represent the intended chain length, ensuring that molecules like 7-aminoheptanoic acid are correctly matched. This may involve changing the repeat count in the pattern to `{4,}` if counting includes the carboxyl carbon.

2. **Rule 2 (Aldehyde Groups on Aromatic Rings Leading to Low Yield)**:
   - **Issue**: The existing SMARTS pattern `[c][CX3H](=O)` may not capture all relevant molecules, especially if there are substituents on the aldehyde carbon.
   - **Suggestion**: Expand the SMARTS pattern to include substituted aldehyde carbons by using `[c][CX3H0](=O)`, ensuring that all aromatic aldehyde-containing modifiers are properly identified.

3. **Rule 3 (Fluorinated Alkyl Chains or Trifluoromethyl Groups Leading to Low Yield)**:
   - **Issue**: The current patterns may miss fully substituted carbons or certain fluorinated groups, leading to incomplete matching.
   - **Suggestion**: Broaden the SMARTS patterns to include any carbon attached to fluorine, such as `[C][F]`, and include specific patterns for trifluoromethyl groups like `[*][C](F)(F)[F]` and `[*][C](F)(F)(F)` to capture all relevant fluorinated modifiers.

4. **Rule 4 (α-Amino Acids with Dicarboxylic Functionalities Leading to High Yield)**:
   - **Issue**: The SMARTS pattern does not correctly match molecules like glutamic acid, where the second carboxylic acid is on the side chain rather than directly attached to the alpha carbon.
   - **Suggestion**: Modify the SMARTS pattern to allow the second carboxylic acid to be located elsewhere in the molecule. This could involve combining the alpha-amino acid pattern `[NX3H2][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX1-,OX2H1])[#6]` with an additional pattern for a second carboxylic acid `[CX3](=O)[OX1-,OX2H1]` present anywhere in the molecule.

5. **Rule 7 (Pyridine Carboxylic Acids Leading to High Yield)**:
   - **Issue**: The current SMARTS pattern is too specific and may miss pyridine carboxylic acids with substituents.
   - **Suggestion**: Simplify the SMARTS pattern to `[n][a]C(=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]` to match any pyridine ring directly attached to a carboxylic acid, capturing a broader range of relevant modifiers.

6. **Rule 13 (Polyhydroxylated Compounds Leading to High Yield)**:
   - **Issue**: The existing pattern may incorrectly match molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups on the same carbon.
   - **Suggestion**: Ensure that the SMARTS pattern counts hydroxyl groups on different carbons by matching unique `[OX2H][CX4]` substructures and adjusting the code to count distinct hydroxylated carbons.

7. **General Improvements**:
   - **Error Handling**: Implement better error handling to log SMILES strings and error details when a molecule cannot be parsed.
   - **Unit Testing**: Develop unit tests for each rule using known matching and non-matching SMILES examples to verify the correctness of SMARTS patterns.
   - **Balance Specificity and Generalization**: Adjust rules to avoid being overly specific, which can lead to low support, or too general, which can decrease confidence and lift.
   - **Re-evaluate Rule Conditions**: Ensure that rule conditions are appropriately restrictive to capture the correct modifiers without excluding relevant data.
   - **Combine Similar Rules**: Merge rules with overlapping conditions to increase support and improve the robustness of the predictions.
   - **Feature Engineering**: Incorporate additional physicochemical properties, such as steric parameters or electronic effects, to enhance the explanatory power of the rules.
   - **Cross-Validation**: Employ k-fold cross-validation to assess the performance of the rules on different subsets of data and prevent overfitting.
   - **Evaluate Rule Interactions**: Analyze how different rules interact and consider potential synergies or conflicts between them.

**Assessment of Possibility for Further Optimization**

The current performance metrics indicate that while confidence and lift have improved, support has decreased, and validation accuracy has declined from around 76% to approximately 62.86%. The SHAP analysis highlights that certain rules (notably Rule 2, Rule 3, and Rule 10) contribute significantly to misclassifications, especially in overestimation cases where the model predicts high yield but the experimental yield is low.

Given these observations, there is clear potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. Refining the SMARTS patterns, re-evaluating rule conditions, and ensuring a better balance between specificity and generality are essential steps to enhance the predictive performance of the model.

  **Explanation**: Long-chain omega-amino acids such as 7-aminoheptanoic acid and 8-aminooctanoic acid have low yields. The terminal amino group may interfere with the catalyst's activity due to chelation or steric hindrance.

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers containing aldehyde (formyl) groups on aromatic rings lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Compounds like 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid have low yields. The aldehyde group can coordinate with the metal center or undergo side reactions, reducing the efficiency of the catalyst.

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Fluorinated compounds such as 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid and 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid exhibit low yields. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine may destabilize the catalyst-modifier interaction.

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are α-amino acids with dicarboxylic functionalities (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) lead to high yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Aspartic acid and glutamic acid have high yields. The presence of both amino and dicarboxylic groups may facilitate better coordination with the metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity.

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) lead to high yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Compounds like 4-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid show high yields. Electron-withdrawing groups can increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, improving binding to the metal sites.

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers with thiol groups on short aliphatic chains lead to high yield, while those with thiol groups on aromatic rings lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid (aliphatic thiol) has a high yield, whereas 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid (aromatic thiol) has a low yield. Aliphatic thiols may form stable interactions with the catalyst without deactivating it, unlike aromatic thiols.

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers that are pyridine carboxylic acids lead to high yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid show high yields. The nitrogen in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance.

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers that are aromatic amino acids with electron-rich side chains (e.g., tryptophan) lead to high yield, while those with less electron-rich aromatic rings (e.g., phenylalanine) lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Tryptophan (indole ring) results in high yield, whereas phenylalanine (phenyl ring) results in low yield. Electron-rich rings may facilitate better interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers with ether linkages in aliphatic chains lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Compounds like 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid exhibit low yields. Ether linkages may reduce the ability of the modifier to interact effectively with the catalyst.

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers with hydroxyl groups on long aliphatic chains (chain length greater than six carbons) lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid shows low yield. The hydroxyl group on a long chain may cause undesirable interactions or steric hindrance affecting the catalyst's activity.

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers with ketone groups on aliphatic chains lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: 4-oxoheptanedioic acid has a low yield. The ketone group may interact unfavorably with the catalyst or participate in side reactions.

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy) on aromatic rings directly attached to the carboxylic acid lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: 4-methylbenzoic acid and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid have low yields. Electron-donating groups may decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, reducing binding affinity to the metal centers.

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers that are polyhydroxylated compounds lead to high yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Compounds like (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid have high yields. Multiple hydroxyl groups may enhance interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers with aromatic rings separated by aliphatic chains of four carbons or more lead to high yield.*  
  **Explanation**: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid and 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid exhibit high yields. The aliphatic spacer may reduce steric hindrance and improve flexibility for optimal catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers containing aldehyde groups on aliphatic chains lead to low yield.*  
  **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups are reactive and may undergo side reactions or deactivate the catalyst, as seen in 4-oxoheptanedioic acid.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**
- **Advice 1**: *Adjust the SMARTS pattern for **Rule 1** to accurately capture omega-amino aliphatic carboxylic acids with alkyl chains longer than five carbons.*  
  **Implementation**: Modify the chain length in the SMARTS pattern to `{5,}` if counting the carboxyl carbon or `{6,}` if excluding it. The corrected SMARTS pattern should be `[NX3H2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]` to match compounds like 7-aminoheptanoic acid.

- **Advice 2**: *Expand the SMARTS pattern for **Rule 2** to include substituted aldehyde carbons on aromatic rings.*  
  **Implementation**: Change the SMARTS pattern from `[c][CX3H](=O)` to `[c][CX3H0](=O)`, which allows for both hydrogen and substituents on the aldehyde carbon. This ensures that all aromatic aldehyde-containing modifiers, including those with substituents, are correctly identified.

- **Advice 3**: *Broaden the SMARTS patterns for **Rule 3** to include any carbon attached to fluorine atoms, capturing all relevant fluorinated modifiers.*  
  **Implementation**: Use general patterns such as `[CX4][F]` to match any carbon-fluorine bond, and include specific patterns for trifluoromethyl groups like `[*][C](F)(F)(F)` and `[*][C](F)(F)[F]`. This will ensure that fully fluorinated carbons and trifluoromethyl groups are properly matched.

- **Advice 4**: *Modify the SMARTS pattern for **Rule 4** to allow the second carboxylic acid group to be located anywhere in the molecule, accommodating compounds like glutamic acid.*  
  **Implementation**: Combine the alpha-amino acid pattern `[NX3H2][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX1-,OX2H1])[#6]` with an additional pattern for a second carboxylic acid group `[CX3](=O)[OX1-,OX2H1]` present elsewhere in the molecule. Use logical AND to ensure both features are present.

- **Advice 5**: *Simplify the SMARTS pattern for **Rule 7** to match any pyridine carboxylic acid, including those with substituents on the pyridine ring.*  
  **Implementation**: Use the pattern `[n][a][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]` to capture any pyridine ring directly attached to a carboxylic acid group, regardless of additional substituents on the ring.

- **Advice 6**: *Adjust the SMARTS pattern for **Rule 13** to count hydroxyl groups on different carbons, avoiding matches with multiple hydroxyls on the same carbon.*  
  **Implementation**: Modify the pattern to identify unique hydroxylated carbons by using `[OX2H][CX4H]` and ensure that the pattern counts distinct instances by setting the repeat count appropriately, such as `([OX2H][CX4H]){3,}` for polyhydroxylated compounds with three or more hydroxyl groups on separate carbons.

- **Advice 7**: *Implement enhanced error handling in the rule generation code to facilitate debugging.*  
  **Implementation**: Update the code to log detailed error messages, including the SMILES string of the molecule that caused the parsing error and the exception details. This will help identify and correct issues with specific molecules.

- **Advice 8**: *Develop unit tests for each rule to verify the correctness of SMARTS patterns.*  
  **Implementation**: Create a set of test cases for each rule using known matching and non-matching SMILES examples. Use these tests to validate that each SMARTS pattern correctly matches the intended modifiers.

- **Advice 9**: *Balance specificity and generality in the rules to avoid overfitting and underfitting.*  
  **Implementation**: Re-evaluate the conditions of each rule to ensure they are neither too narrow nor too broad. Adjust patterns to increase support without significantly reducing confidence and lift. This may involve relaxing certain constraints or adding additional ones based on the data.

- **Advice 10**: *Combine similar or overlapping rules to increase support and robustness.*  
  **Implementation**: Identify rules that target similar structural features, such as electron-withdrawing groups on aromatic rings, and merge them into a single, more general rule. This will improve the statistical significance and applicability of the rules.

- **Advice 11**: *Incorporate additional physicochemical features to enhance rule explanatory power.*  
  **Implementation**: Include descriptors such as steric hindrance, electronic effects (e.g., Hammett constants), or hydrophobicity (e.g., LogP) in the rule analysis. This additional information can help explain variations in yield not solely accounted for by structural patterns.

- **Advice 12**: *Employ cross-validation techniques to assess rule performance and prevent overfitting.*  
  **Implementation**: Use k-fold cross-validation to test the rules on different subsets of the data. Analyze performance metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall across folds to ensure that the rules generalize well to unseen data.

- **Advice 13**: *Evaluate interactions between different rules to improve predictive accuracy.*  
  **Implementation**: Perform an analysis to determine if certain rules interact synergistically or antagonistically. Adjust the rules to account for these interactions, such as creating combined rules or adding conditions to existing ones.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Enhance Rule 4 by Gathering More Data or Combining with Similar Modifiers**

  - *Issue*: Rule 4, which states that long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (chain length of eight carbons or more) without additional functional groups lead to high yield, is currently supported by only one data point (octanoic acid). This limited coverage weakens the rule's reliability.
  - *Recommendation*: Expand the dataset by testing additional long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (e.g., nonanoic acid, decanoic acid) to confirm if the trend holds. Alternatively, consider combining this rule with modifiers that have similar hydrophobic characteristics to increase coverage and robustness.

- **Advice 2**: **Refine Rule 7 to Account for the Position and Connectivity of Pyridine Rings**

  - *Issue*: Rule 7 suggests that modifiers with pyridine carboxylic acids or containing pyridine rings lead to high yield. However, there are contradictions in the data (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid leads to low yield), indicating that the rule may be too general.
  - *Recommendation*: Modify the rule to specify that pyridine rings directly attached to the carboxylic acid group promote high yield, while those connected through additional aromatic systems may not. Emphasize the importance of the pyridine nitrogen's ability to coordinate with the metal center without steric hindrance from adjacent groups.

- **Advice 3**: **Reevaluate Rule 8 by Considering the Position and Influence of Electron-Donating Groups**

  - *Issue*: Rule 8 states that electron-donating groups on aromatic rings directly attached to the carboxylic acid lead to low yield. However, some compounds like 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid (which has a hydroxyl group but leads to high yield) contradict this rule.
  - *Recommendation*: Refine the rule to consider the distance between the electron-donating group and the carboxylic acid. Electron-donating groups in positions that do not significantly decrease the carboxylic acid's acidity may not affect the yield negatively. Incorporate steric effects and resonance influence in the rule's criteria.

- **Advice 4**: **Revise Rule 10 to Address Inconsistencies with Ether Linkages**

  - *Issue*: Rule 10 states that modifiers with ether linkages in their aliphatic chains lead to low yield, but there are inconsistencies in the data (e.g., some ether-containing compounds yield high).
  - *Recommendation*: Adjust the rule to specify the effect of ether linkage position and frequency. For example, multiple ether linkages or those positioned near functional groups critical for metal coordination may disrupt interactions. Include considerations for chain flexibility and how it impacts the catalyst-modifier binding.

- **Advice 5**: **Modify Rule 12 to Include Context of Ketone Group Position**

  - *Issue*: Rule 12 suggests that modifiers with ketone groups on aliphatic chains lead to low yield, yet compounds like 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid have ketone groups and result in high yield.
  - *Recommendation*: Refine the rule to specify that ketone groups proximal to the carboxylic acid or those that interfere with metal coordination sites lead to low yield. Ketone groups that are distal or part of a conjugated system may not negatively impact the yield.

- **Advice 6**: **Strengthen Rules Supported by Limited Data Points by Combining or Collecting More Data**

  - *Issue*: Rules like 9, 13, 14, and 15 are based on single data points, limiting their general applicability.
  - *Recommendation*: Combine these rules under broader categories or gather more experimental data to support them. For example, merge Rules 9 and 13 into a rule about multiple hydrogen bond donors enhancing yield, and verify with additional modifiers exhibiting these features.

- **Advice 7**: **Consider Steric Hindrance and Molecular Size in Rule Formulation**

  - *Issue*: Some rules do not account for the impact of bulky groups or overall molecular size on catalyst interaction and yield.
  - *Recommendation*: Incorporate considerations of steric factors into existing rules. For instance, bulky side chains may hinder effective coordination with the metal center. Modify rules to reflect that optimal yield is achieved with modifiers that balance functional group reactivity and minimal steric interference.

- **Advice 8**: **Integrate Electronic and Steric Effects in Rules Regarding Substituted Aromatic Rings**

  - *Issue*: Substituted aromatic rings with various groups have differing effects on yield that are not fully captured in the current rules.
  - *Recommendation*: Develop rules that simultaneously consider electronic (electron-withdrawing or -donating nature) and steric effects of substituents on aromatic rings. Use Hammett constants or other quantitative measures to better predict the impact on yield.

- **Advice 9**: **Expand the Descriptor Set to Include Molecular Geometry and Flexibility**

  - *Issue*: Current rules focus on functional groups but may overlook the importance of molecular geometry and flexibility.
  - *Recommendation*: Include descriptors related to molecular conformation, such as the ability of the modifier to adopt conformations favorable for catalyst binding. Rules could consider whether rigid or flexible modifiers enhance yield based on their fit within the catalyst's active site.

- **Advice 10**: **Utilize Computational Modeling to Predict and Validate Rules**

  - *Issue*: Some trends may not be apparent from experimental data alone.
  - *Recommendation*: Employ computational chemistry methods (e.g., molecular docking, density functional theory) to model interactions between modifiers and the catalyst. This approach can provide insights into binding modes and energy profiles, aiding in the refinement of rules and prediction of high-yield modifiers.

**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Translate Qualitative Rules into Quantifiable Descriptors**

  Convert the existing qualitative rules into quantifiable molecular descriptors that can be directly extracted from SMILES strings. For example, instead of stating "electron-withdrawing groups increase acidity," quantify the electron-withdrawing capacity using Hammett sigma constants or calculate the pKa values of the carboxylic acid groups.

- **Advice 2**: **Use Structural Fingerprints for Feature Generation**

  Employ structural fingerprints (e.g., Morgan fingerprints) to represent the presence or absence of specific substructures and functional groups numerically. This allows the rules to be based on binary vectors indicating the presence of features like amino groups, carboxylic acids, aromatic rings, etc.

- **Advice 3**: **Standardize Functional Group Classification**

  Create a standardized classification system for functional groups and structural motifs. Categorize modifiers based on quantifiable features such as the number of carboxylic acid groups, amino groups, hydroxyl groups, fluorinated carbons, chain length, and ring systems. This standardization facilitates consistent numerical encoding.

- **Advice 4**: **Incorporate Molecular Descriptors Calculated from SMILES**

  Utilize software tools (e.g., RDKit, Mordred) to calculate molecular descriptors such as molecular weight, LogP, topological polar surface area (TPSA), hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, rotatable bonds, and aromatic ring counts. These descriptors can serve as numerical features correlating with the reaction yield.

- **Advice 5**: **Quantify Electronic Effects Using Calculated Properties**

  Incorporate calculated electronic properties like HOMO-LUMO gap, partial charges, and dipole moments to quantify the electron-donating or withdrawing nature of substituents. This helps in numerically representing rules related to electronic effects on yield.

- **Advice 6**: **Reduce Rule Overlaps and Exceptions**

  Simplify the rule set by minimizing overlaps and clearly defining exceptions. For instance, if certain modifiers are exceptions to a rule, create separate rules or criteria for them based on quantifiable features to avoid ambiguity in numerical encoding.

- **Advice 7**: **Implement Hierarchical or Decision Tree-Based Rules**

  Organize the rules into a hierarchical structure or decision tree where each node represents a quantifiable criterion. This approach aids in sequentially applying numerical thresholds or conditions to classify modifiers effectively.

  Design a template for the numeric feature matrix that includes all relevant quantifiable features identified from the modifiers. Ensure that each modifier can be systematically encoded into this matrix based on computed descriptors from their SMILES strings.

- **Advice 11**: **Provide Clear Guidelines for Feature Computation**

  Document the methods and tools used for computing each molecular descriptor to ensure reproducibility and consistency. Clearly define how each feature is calculated from the SMILES representation.

- **Advice 12**: **Validate and Iterate the Rules**

  Test the revised rule set and numeric feature matrix on the existing dataset to validate their effectiveness in predicting yields. Gather feedback from the results to further refine the rules and descriptors.

  - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid (Low Yield)  
  The rule is clear, complex, and supported by data.

- **Comment 12**:  
  **Rule 12** highlights that aromatic amino acids with electron-rich heterocycles lead to high yield, while simple aromatics lead to low yield. The property insight is good, considering coordination and π-stacking. Supported by:  
  - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (High Yield)  
  - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Low Yield)  
  The rule meets clarity, complexity, and coverage criteria effectively.

- **Comment 13**:  
  **Rule 13** asserts that modifiers with fused aromatic systems containing carboxylic acid groups lead to high yield. While the explanation is acceptable, coverage is limited:  
  - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid (High Yield)  
  Only one data point supports this rule; more examples are needed for stronger coverage.

- **Comment 14**:  
  **Rule 14** states that aromatic acids with electron-donating groups separated by an aliphatic chain lead to high yield. The explanation about spacing reducing electronic effects is sound. Supported by:  
  - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid (High Yield)  
  - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid (High Yield)  
  The rule is clear, complex, and well-supported.

- **Comment 15**:  
  **Rule 15** differentiates between modifiers with free amino groups (high yield) and acylated amino groups (low yield). The property insight is solid, considering coordination availability. Supported by:  
  - 5-aminopentanoic acid (High Yield)  
  - 4-aminobenzoic acid (High Yield)  
  - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (Low Yield)  
  The rule is comprehensive, clear, and well-supported.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (i.e., amino acids with two carboxylic acid groups) lead to high yield.*  
  **Example Modifiers**: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)  
  **Explanation**: The presence of an amino group and two carboxylic acid groups provides multiple coordination sites with the metal centers in the catalyst, enhancing its activity through chelation.

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) lead to high yield.*  
  **Example Modifiers**: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, strengthening its ability to coordinate with metal centers in the catalyst.

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy) lead to low yield.*  
  **Example Modifiers**: 4-methylbenzoic acid, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, weakening coordination with the metal centers and reducing catalyst effectiveness.

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) groups lead to low yield.*  
  **Example Modifiers**: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups may participate in side reactions or form unstable complexes with the metal centers, diminishing catalyst efficiency.

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrophobic chains (six carbons or more) without additional polar groups lead to high yield.*  
  **Example Modifier**: Octanoic acid  
  **Explanation**: The hydrophobic chains may enhance interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or improve substrate accessibility, boosting reactivity.

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) on longer chains (six carbons or more) lead to low yield.*  
  **Example Modifiers**: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Polar groups on long chains may introduce unfavorable solubility properties or interfere with effective coordination to the catalyst.

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar functional groups (e.g., amino, thiol) on shorter chains (five carbons or fewer) lead to high yield.*  
  **Example Modifiers**: 5-aminopentanoic acid, 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Short-chain polar groups enhance solubility and provide effective coordination sites for metal centers, improving catalyst performance.

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers containing heavily fluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups lead to low yield.*  
  **Example Modifiers**: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid, 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Strong electron-withdrawing effects from fluorinated groups can destabilize catalyst-modifier interactions or reduce binding affinity due to altered electronic properties.

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers with pyridine rings directly attached to the carboxylic acid group lead to high yield.*  
  **Example Modifiers**: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid), 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid  
  **Explanation**: The nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, providing additional binding sites that enhance catalyst activity.

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers with pyridine rings attached via an additional aromatic ring lead to low yield.*  
  **Example Modifier**: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid  
  **Explanation**: The extended conjugated system may introduce steric hindrance or delocalize electron density, reducing effective coordination with the catalyst.

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers with thiol groups on short aliphatic chains lead to high yield, while those with thiol groups on aromatic rings lead to low yield.*  
  **Example High Yield Modifier**: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid  
  **Example Low Yield Modifier**: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Aliphatic thiol groups can form favorable interactions with metal centers without causing catalyst deactivation, whereas aromatic thiols may bind too strongly or interfere with normal catalytic activity.

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers that are aromatic amino acids with electron-rich heterocyclic side chains (e.g., indole ring) lead to high yield, while those with simple aromatic side chains lead to low yield.*  
  **Example High Yield Modifier**: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)  
  **Example Low Yield Modifier**: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)  
  **Explanation**: Electron-rich heterocycles can coordinate with metal centers or enhance π-stacking interactions, improving catalyst function, whereas simple aromatic rings may not provide these benefits.

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers with fused aromatic systems containing carboxylic acid groups lead to high yield.*  
  **Example Modifier**: 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid  
  **Explanation**: Fused aromatic systems may enhance electronic interactions and facilitate better coordination with the catalyst, leading to improved reactivity.

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers that are aromatic acids with electron-donating groups separated from the carboxylic acid by an aliphatic chain lead to high yield.*  
  **Example Modifiers**: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid  
  **Explanation**: The aliphatic spacer reduces the electron-donating group's influence on the carboxylic acid's acidity, maintaining effective coordination with metal centers while benefiting from additional interactions provided by the aromatic group.

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers that are amino acids with free amino groups lead to high yield, whereas those with acylated (modified) amino groups lead to low yield.*  
  **Example High Yield Modifiers**: 5-aminopentanoic acid, 4-aminobenzoic acid  
  **Example Low Yield Modifier**: (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Free amino groups enhance coordination with metal centers, while acylation reduces the availability of lone pair electrons, diminishing the modifier's ability to effectively interact with the catalyst.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: **Revise the SMARTS patterns for positional specificity on aromatic rings.**  
  For Rule 2 and Rule 3, the current SMARTS patterns do not correctly specify para-substitution on the benzene ring. Modify the SMARTS to explicitly define the para-substituted position relative to the carboxylic acid group. For example, for para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing groups, use:  
  ```python
  benzene_ring_with_cooh = 'c1ccc(cc1)C(=O)O'  # Benzoic acid
  para_electron_withdrawing = '[cH]1ccc([cH])cc1[N+](=O)[O-]'  # Para-nitrobenzoic acid as an example
  ```
  Combine these patterns using the appropriate SMARTS syntax to ensure that the EWG is at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: **Correct the logic for combining patterns within each rule.**  
  In the current code, the patterns within a rule are treated as separate groups in a list, which may not correctly enforce the required logical relationships (AND vs. OR conditions). Ensure that all required patterns within a rule are matched simultaneously on the same substructure. Use recursive SMARTS or atom mapping to ensure that connected patterns are matched correctly.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: **Use atom mapping to link functional groups in the SMARTS patterns.**  
  For rules requiring specific spatial relationships between functional groups (e.g., para-substitution), use SMARTS atom mapping numbers to link atoms. For example:  
  ```python
  para_substitution = 'c1cc([#6])[c]c([#6])c1C(=O)O'  # Where [#6] is the substituent at the para position
  ```
  This ensures that the substituent is at the correct position relative to the carboxylic acid group.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: **Separate patterns that should be matched using OR logic.**  
  For rules where the presence of any one of multiple functional groups satisfies the rule (e.g., electron-withdrawing groups like nitro, halogens, trifluoromethyl), combine these using a single SMARTS pattern that includes all possibilities within square brackets:
  ```python
  ewg = '[N+](=O)[O-]', '[F,Cl,Br,I]', 'C(F)(F)F'  # Define each EWG pattern
  ewg_pattern = '[$([N+](=O)[O-]),$(F),$(Cl),$(Br),$(I),$(C(F)(F)F)]'  # Combine using OR logic
  ```
  Incorporate this combined pattern into the main SMARTS for the rule.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: **Ensure exclude patterns are correctly implemented and connected to the main structure.**  
  When excluding certain functional groups, make sure the exclude patterns are correctly specified and that they are properly connected to the parts of the molecule of interest. Use SMARTS to define the unwanted groups and verify their absence in the relevant substructures.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: **Validate and test each SMARTS pattern individually.**  
  Before integrating the patterns into the main code, test each SMARTS pattern against known molecules to ensure they match or exclude appropriately. Use RDKit's `Draw.MolFromSmarts()` and `mol.HasSubstructMatch()` functions to visualize and confirm the patterns' effectiveness.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: **Adjust the counting mechanism for substructures where necessary.**  
  For rules that depend on the number of certain functional groups (e.g., Rule 1 requiring at least two carboxylic acid groups), verify that the counting logic accurately reflects the rule. Use `mol.GetSubstructMatches()` and check the length of the matches against the required count.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: **Handle chiral centers and stereochemistry explicitly if relevant.**  
  If the rules depend on specific stereochemistry (e.g., L-amino acids), ensure the SMARTS patterns include chiral specifications. Use '@' symbols in SMARTS to denote chirality where necessary.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: **Simplify complex patterns by breaking them into smaller, more manageable components.**  
  For complicated rules, consider decomposing the SMARTS patterns into smaller parts that can be combined logically. This approach can make the patterns easier to write, read, and debug.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: **Include error handling for molecules that cannot be parsed or matched.**  
  Ensure the code gracefully handles molecules that RDKit cannot parse or for which pattern matching fails due to errors. Provide informative messages or default values to maintain robustness.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: **Document each rule and its corresponding code thoroughly.**  
  Provide clear comments and explanations for each SMARTS pattern and code block associated with a rule. This documentation will aid in understanding, maintenance, and future modifications of the code.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: **Update the code to reflect any corrections in the rules themselves.**  
  If any inconsistencies or ambiguities are found in the natural language rules, clarify and correct them before implementing the patterns. Ensure that the code aligns precisely with the intended meaning of each rule.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rules Based on Metrics**

The current rule metrics are as follows:

- **Train Support**: 13.49%
- **Train Confidence**: 64.57%
- **Train Lift**: 1.2966
- **Train Leverage**: 0.01229

**Comparison with Previous Metrics**

1. **Support**:
   - **Previous Train Supports**: 16.67% and 18.45%
   - **Current Train Support**: 13.49%
   - *Analysis*: The current support is slightly lower than the previous averages. However, compared to the earlier iteration where the support was 3.36%, there is a significant improvement. This indicates that the current rules cover a larger portion of the dataset than in the immediate past iteration, but still less than the initial benchmarks.

2. **Confidence**:
   - **Previous Train Confidences**: 63.52% and 53.96%
   - **Current Train Confidence**: 64.57%
   - *Analysis*: The current confidence is higher than both previous references, showing an improvement in the accuracy of the rules. Compared to the immediate past iteration's confidence of 69.61%, there is a slight decrease, which may be due to the trade-off between increasing support and maintaining high confidence.

3. **Lift**:
   - **Previous Train Lifts**: 1.2048 and 1.0559
   - **Current Train Lift**: 1.2966
   - *Analysis*: The current lift surpasses previous reference lifts, indicating that the rules are more effective at predicting high yield than before. There's a slight decrease from the immediate past iteration's lift of 1.4058, which again could be attributed to the balance between support and lift.

4. **Leverage**:
   - **Previous Train Leverages**: 0.0289 and -0.0041
   - **Current Train Leverage**: 0.01229
   - *Analysis*: The current leverage is positive, suggesting a stronger association than expected by chance. Although it is lower than the highest previous leverage, it is an improvement over negative or near-zero values, indicating that the rules contribute meaningful predictive power beyond random chance.

**Interpretation of Metrics**

- **Trade-off Between Support and Confidence/Lift**: The increase in support suggests that the rules apply to a wider set of data points, but this often comes with a slight decrease in confidence and lift. This is a common trade-off where more general rules (higher support) may be less precise (slightly lower confidence and lift).

- **Strength of the Rules**:
  - The **confidence** level of 64.57% implies that when the rule conditions are met, there is a 64.57% chance of achieving a high yield. This is a strong indication of rule reliability.
  - The **lift** of 1.2966 means that the probability of achieving high yield when the rule conditions are met is approximately 29.66% higher than the baseline probability. This shows a meaningful improvement over random chance.

**Assessment of Local Minimum and Iterations**

- **Local Minimum**:
  - The metrics have shown fluctuations across iterations, with improvements in some areas and slight reductions in others. The current iteration has achieved a better balance between support and confidence compared to previous iterations.
  - The plateauing of significant metric improvements suggests that a local minimum might be approaching, but given that each metric hasn't stabilized completely, more refinement could still yield better results.

- **Number of Iterations**:
  - Considering the metrics are still changing and haven't fully converged, additional iterations may be beneficial. As long as adjustments to the rules continue to produce measurable changes in the metrics, it indicates that there is still room for optimization.

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

1. **Enhance Specificity of High-Impact Rules**:
   - Identify rules with the highest lift and confidence, even if their support is lower. Focusing on these can improve the overall predictive power.
   - For example, revisit **Rule 1** and **Rule 9** which involve amino acids and pyridine rings, respectively. These seem chemically significant and may benefit from further specificity to increase lift and confidence.

2. **Combine Overlapping Rules**:
   - Look for rules that may cover similar chemical features and combine them to increase support without sacrificing confidence.
   - For instance, **Rule 11** and **Rule 7** both address modifiers with thiol groups on aliphatic chains. Combining insights from these rules may enhance their collective performance.

3. **Refine or Remove Less Effective Rules**:
   - Evaluate rules with lower confidence and lift, such as those that might be contributing to the decrease in metrics.
   - Rules like **Rule 6** and **Rule 8**, which deal with modifiers leading to low yields, could be refined to better distinguish between high and low yield modifiers or possibly be excluded if they don't contribute positively to the model.

4. **Incorporate Additional Data Features**:
   - Analyze whether other molecular descriptors or features could be included to improve rule accuracy.
   - For example, considering stereochemistry, molecular orbital energies, or solubility parameters might provide new insights.

5. **Utilize Statistical Techniques**:
   - Apply techniques such as chi-squared testing or correlation analysis to statistically validate the significance of each rule.
   - This can help prioritize rules that have the most significant impact on yield.

6. **Cross-Validate with Test Data**:
   - If test metrics are available, evaluate the rules against unseen data to assess their generalizability.
   - Adjust rules based on their performance on test data to prevent overfitting to the training data.

7. **Iterative Refinement**:
   - Continue the iterative process, making small adjustments and monitoring how each change affects the metrics.
   - Focus on one metric at a time to understand its sensitivity to changes in the rules.

**Conclusion**

The current rules have improved upon previous iterations by balancing support and confidence, achieving higher lift than earlier benchmarks. While there is evidence that progress is being made towards an optimal set of rules, the slight fluctuations in metrics suggest that further refinement is possible. By focusing on enhancing high-impact rules, removing or adjusting less effective ones, and possibly integrating additional molecular features, the performance of the rules can be improved. Continuing with a few more iterations while closely monitoring the metrics will help determine if a local minimum has been reached and if the rules have been sufficiently optimized.

Traditional Commenter Message:
**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

**1. Evaluate Effectiveness:**
  
The current set of rules shows an improvement in model performance compared to previous iterations. The validation accuracy has increased from the previously reported averages (e.g., 0.75) to the current validation accuracy of **0.7714**. This suggests that the modifications made to the rules have enhanced the model's ability to predict the loading of modifiers on the catalyst correctly.

**Comparison with Previous Metrics:**

- **Previous Validation Accuracies:** Averaged around 0.75.
- **Current Validation Accuracy:** 0.7714.

The increase in validation accuracy indicates that the current rules are more effective than before. However, while the overall accuracy has improved, discrepancies still exist between predicted and experimental values for certain molecules, suggesting that there is room for further refinement.

**2. Assess Overfitting/Underfitting:**

Given that the validation accuracy has improved without a significant drop in test accuracy (assuming consistent test results), it suggests that the model is not overfitting to the training data. However, the presence of consistent misclassifications for certain molecules indicates potential underfitting in specific areas. The model may not be capturing all the complexities of the relationships between modifier structures and catalyst loading.

**3. Analyze Discrepancies:**

We have identified several molecules where the predicted loading does not match the experimental value. Specifically, there are molecules where the predicted loading is **high**, but the experimental value is **low**.

**Molecules with Predicted High Loading but Experimental Low Loading:**

1. **C(=O)(C(C(C(C(F)(F)F)(F)F)(F)F)(F)F)O**
   - **SHAP Values:**
     - Rule17: **0.08796** (Highest)
     - Rule4: 0.04800
     - Rule6: 0.04793
     - Rule8: -0.08049

2. **C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O**
   - **SHAP Values:**
     - Rule17: **0.09380** (Highest)
     - Rule4: 0.05143
     - Rule6: 0.05140
     - Rule8: 0.00336

3. **CC1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=O)O**
   - **SHAP Values:**
     - Rule17: **0.07679** (Highest)
     - Rule6: 0.07652
     - Rule4: 0.05450
     - Rule8: 0.02903

4. **C1=CC(=CC=C1CCC(=O)O)O**
   - **SHAP Values:**
     - Rule17: **0.07679** (Highest)
     - Rule6: 0.07652
     - Rule4: 0.05450
     - Rule8: 0.02903

5. **C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N**
   - **SHAP Values:**
     - Rule6: **0.07350** (Highest)
     - Rule17: 0.06514
     - Rule8: 0.03402
     - Rule4: 0.02734

6. **C(COCCOCCN)C(=O)O**
   - **SHAP Values:**
     - Rule6: **0.07457** (Highest)
     - Rule8: 0.03854
     - Rule17: 0.03802
     - Rule4: 0.02744

7. **C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)S**
   - **SHAP Values:**
     - Rule17: **0.09461** (Highest)
     - Rule4: 0.05422
     - Rule8: 0.03602
     - Rule6: 0.02943

8. **C1=CC(=CC=C1C2=CC=NC=C2)C(=O)O**
   - **SHAP Values:**
     - Rule17: **0.09461** (Highest)
     - Rule4: 0.05422
     - Rule8: 0.03602
     - Rule6: 0.02943

In these cases, **Rule17** and **Rule6** consistently have the highest positive SHAP values contributing to the overestimation of catalyst loading. This suggests that these rules may be overly generalized or not accurately capturing the structural nuances that differentiate between high and low experimental loadings for these molecules.

**4. Interpret Accuracy Improvements:**

The increase in validation accuracy to **0.7714** indicates that the current rules have improved the model's performance. This suggests a positive trend and highlights the probability of improvement due to the recent adjustments in the rules. However, the presence of misclassifications in certain molecules indicates that some rules may need further refinement to enhance predictive accuracy.

**5. Derive Insights from SHAP Analysis:**

The SHAP analysis provides valuable insights into which rules are contributing the most to incorrect predictions. Specifically:

- **Rule17**: Often has the highest positive SHAP value in cases where the model overestimates the loading (predicted high, experimental low).
- **Rule6**: Also shows high positive SHAP values in some incorrect predictions.

This indicates that **Rule17** and **Rule6** may be too broadly defined or may not account for specific exceptions, leading to overestimation in certain cases.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

**1. Refine Rule17:**

- **Current Rule17** (Note: Rule17 is not explicitly listed in the current rules provided. Assuming it's an existing rule in the iterative process.)

- **Action:**
  - **Review the scope of Rule17** to identify if it's too general or if certain structural features are causing misclassification.
  - **Incorporate exceptions** for molecules where the rule does not hold, possibly by adding additional conditions or qualifiers.
  - **Examine the molecules** where Rule17 contributes to incorrect predictions to identify common structural features.

**2. Adjust Rule6:**

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) on longer chains (six carbons or more) lead to low yield.*

- **Action:**
  - **Reassess the definition of "longer chains":** Determine if six carbons is the appropriate cutoff or if adjustments are needed.
  - **Analyze exceptions:** Look at molecules where Rule6 leads to overestimation and see if there are additional functional groups or structural aspects that should be considered.
  - **Consider interaction effects:** There may be compounds where polar groups on longer chains do not negatively affect yield due to other stabilizing features.

**3. Incorporate Structural Nuances:**

- **Identify Common Features in Misclassified Molecules:**
  - Many misclassified molecules have **aromatic rings**, **aldehyde groups**, or **substituted aromatic systems**.
  - Consider refining rules to account for the influence of these groups, especially in the context of adjacent functional groups.

**4. Improve Generalization:**

- **Prevent Overfitting:**
  - Ensure that the rules are not too narrowly defined based on specific training data.
  - Introduce cross-validation techniques and possibly incorporate a more diverse dataset to enhance the model's ability to generalize.

**5. Utilize SHAP Insights:**

- While SHAP values should not directly dictate rule changes, they can highlight areas where the model's behavior does not align with experimental results.
- **Investigate High SHAP Values:**
  - For rules with consistently high SHAP values in misclassifications (e.g., Rule17, Rule6), delve deeper into the chemical rationale behind these rules.
  - **Validate the rules chemically:** Consult with chemists to understand if the rules make sense from a mechanistic standpoint or if modifications are warranted.

**6. Add New Rules or Modify Existing Ones:**

- **Consider Adding Specificity:**
  - Modify rules to include or exclude certain functional groups or structural motifs that affect yield.
- **Example:**
  - If aromatic carboxylic acids with certain substituents are misclassified, adjust rules to account for the electron-donating or withdrawing effects of these substituents.

**7. Reevaluate Molecule Assignments:**

- **Assess the Experimental Data:**
  - Ensure that the experimental values are accurate and consistent.
  - Possible discrepancies in the data could lead to misclassifications.

**8. Collaborate with Domain Experts:**

- **Chemists and Material Scientists:**
  - Work with experts to gain insights into why certain modifiers perform differently.
  - Use their expertise to refine rules based on chemical behavior and reaction mechanisms.

**Conclusion**

The current rules have improved the model's predictive accuracy, indicating that they are moving in the right direction. However, specific rules (notably Rule17 and Rule6) may need refinement to reduce the number of misclassifications. By analyzing the discrepancies and utilizing insights from the SHAP analysis, the rules can be adjusted to better capture the nuanced relationships between modifier structures and catalyst loading. Collaboration with domain experts and careful reevaluation of the rules will further enhance the model's performance and predictive capabilities.

**Summary of Discussions and Suggestions for Rule Optimization**

In the recent analysis, the performance of the current set of rules for predicting the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction has shown improvement over previous iterations. Key points from the discussion are as follows:

1. **Performance Metrics Improvement**:
   - **Validation Accuracy**: Increased to 77.14% from previous averages around 75%.
   - **Train Support**: Slightly decreased to 13.49% but still acceptable.
   - **Train Confidence**: Improved to 64.57%, indicating more reliable predictions when the rule conditions are met.
   - **Train Lift**: Increased to 1.2966, showing that the rules are more effective than random chance in predicting high yield.
   - **Train Leverage**: Positive value of 0.01229 suggests meaningful predictive power.

2. **SHAP Analysis Insights**:
   - Certain rules, especially **Rule17** and **Rule6**, have high SHAP values contributing to incorrect predictions where the model overestimates the yield.
   - Misclassifications often involve molecules where the predicted yield is high, but the experimental yield is low.

3. **Rule Effectiveness**:
   - While some rules contribute positively to the model's performance, others may be too broad or not specific enough, leading to inaccuracies.

**Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

To further enhance the accuracy and reliability of the model, the following suggestions are proposed:

1. **Revise and Refine Specific Rules**:
   - **Rule17**: Review and refine this rule to address its overgeneralization. Analyze molecules where Rule17 leads to incorrect predictions to identify common structural features that could be incorporated as additional conditions or exceptions.
   - **Rule6**: Reassess the definition of "longer chains" and consider adjusting the carbon chain length cutoff. Examine whether additional functional groups or structural nuances affect the rule's applicability.

2. **Improve SMARTS Patterns**:
   - **Enhance Positional Specificity**: Modify SMARTS patterns to explicitly define the position of substituents relative to functional groups (e.g., para-substitution on benzene rings). Use atom mapping to ensure accurate spatial relationships.
   - **Correct Logical Relationships**: Ensure that the combination of patterns within each rule correctly reflects logical AND/OR conditions. Patterns that should be matched simultaneously must be properly connected.

3. **Adjust Pattern Logic and Structure**:
   - **Combine Similar Functional Groups**: For rules involving multiple electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) or electron-donating groups (EDGs), create combined SMARTS patterns using OR logic to simplify and capture all relevant possibilities.
   - **Implement Exclude Patterns Accurately**: When certain functional groups should be excluded, make sure the SMARTS patterns accurately prevent their inclusion in substructure matches.

4. **Validate and Test SMARTS Patterns Individually**:
   - Test each SMARTS pattern against known molecules to verify correct matching and exclusion. Utilize RDKit's visualization tools to confirm pattern effectiveness before integrating them into the main code.

5. **Refine Counting Mechanisms**:
   - For rules dependent on the number of functional groups (e.g., two carboxylic acid groups), ensure the substructure matching and counting accurately reflect the rule's requirements.

6. **Consider Stereochemistry**:
   - If stereochemistry affects the reaction outcome, include chiral specifications in the SMARTS patterns where applicable. Use '@' symbols to denote chirality in SMARTS.

7. **Simplify Complex Patterns**:
   - Break down complex SMARTS patterns into smaller components that can be logically combined. This approach improves readability and ease of debugging.

8. **Incorporate Additional Molecular Features**:
   - Explore integrating other molecular descriptors, such as steric factors, solubility parameters, or electronic properties, to enhance the model's predictive capabilities.

9. **Collaborate with Domain Experts**:
   - Engage with chemists or material scientists to gain deeper insights into the reaction mechanisms and modifier-catalyst interactions. Their expertise can guide the refinement of rules based on chemical reasoning.

10. **Document Rules Thoroughly**:
    - Provide clear explanations and comments for each rule and its corresponding code. Thorough documentation facilitates maintenance and future enhancements.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

Based on the analysis, there is a clear indication that further optimization of the current rules is possible without overfitting. The metrics have shown improvements, but they have not yet plateaued, suggesting that the model has not reached its maximum potential performance. The discrepancies identified, particularly involving certain rules that contribute to misclassifications, highlight areas where refinement can lead to better generalization and accuracy.

Given that overfitting occurs when a model is excessively complex and tailored to the training data, the proposed optimizations focus on improving specificity and correcting generalizations in the rules. By refining the rules to more accurately reflect the chemical realities and ensuring they are based on sound mechanistic understanding, the risk of overfitting is minimized.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**
- **Advice 1**: **Revise Rule 6 to Address Overgeneralization**

  Modify **Rule 6** to account for exceptions where long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple polar groups lead to high yield. Specifically:

  - **Current Rule 6**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) on longer chains (six carbons or more) lead to low yield.
  - **Revised Rule 6**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a single polar functional group (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) on longer unbranched chains (seven carbons or more) lead to low yield.

  **Implementation**:
  - Adjust the carbon chain length cutoff from six to seven carbons to improve specificity.
  - Include conditions in the SMARTS pattern to exclude molecules with multiple polar functional groups or branching.

- **Advice 2**: **Incorporate Exceptions for Polyhydroxylated Chains**

  Add a new rule or amend existing rules to capture that aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups on long chains (e.g., sugar acids like gluconic acid) lead to high yield.

  **Implementation**:
  - Create a SMARTS pattern that matches aliphatic chains with multiple hydroxyl groups.
  - Example SMARTS: `C(=O)OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` (representing polyhydroxylated chains).

- **Advice 3**: **Enhance Positional Specificity in SMARTS Patterns**

  Modify SMARTS patterns to explicitly define the position of functional groups relative to the carboxylic acid. For example:

  - Ensure that polar functional groups are positioned at the omega (terminal) position on long chains for low yield modifiers.
  - Use atom indexing to specify positions in SMARTS patterns.

  **Implementation**:
  - Example SMARTS for Rule 6: `O=C(O)CCCCCCC[NX3;H2]` (amino group on the seventh carbon).

- **Advice 4**: **Correct Logical Relationships in SMARTS Patterns**

  Review and adjust the logical operators in the SMARTS patterns to accurately reflect the intended conditions:

  - Use `[C]` and `[O]` with appropriate logical connectors (`&`, `|`, `!`) to combine substructures.
  - Ensure that AND conditions use semicolons (`;`) and OR conditions use commas (`,`).

  **Implementation**:
  - Verify that patterns like `[$([NX3;H2]),$([OX2H])]` correctly match either an amino group or a hydroxyl group.

- **Advice 5**: **Combine Similar Functional Groups Using OR Logic**

  Simplify SMARTS patterns by grouping similar electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups:

  - Create a single pattern that includes all relevant substituents using OR logic.
  - Example: `[$([N+](=O)[O-]),$(F),$(Cl),$(Br),$(I)]` to represent common electron-withdrawing groups.

- **Advice 6**: **Implement Accurate Exclude Patterns**

  Ensure that SMARTS patterns correctly exclude unwanted functional groups:

  - Use the negation operator (`!`) to prevent matching of specific substructures.
  - Example: `[!$(c1ccccc1)]` to exclude aromatic rings.

- **Advice 7**: **Validate and Test SMARTS Patterns Individually**

  Before integrating into the main code:

  - Test each SMARTS pattern against a set of known molecules to confirm correct matches.
  - Use cheminformatics tools like RDKit to visualize substructure matches.
  - Adjust patterns based on testing outcomes.

- **Advice 8**: **Refine Counting Mechanisms in SMARTS Patterns**

  For rules requiring a specific number of functional groups:

  - Use recursive SMARTS or explicit counts to match the exact number.
  - Example: `[CX3](=O)[OX1H0][#6]~[#6]~[CX3](=O)[OX1H0]` to match two carboxylic acid groups.

- **Advice 9**: **Consider Stereochemistry Where Relevant**

  If stereochemistry influences the reaction outcome:

  - Incorporate chiral specifications in SMARTS patterns using `@` symbols.
  - Example: `C[C@H](N)C(=O)O` for L-amino acids.

- **Advice 10**: **Simplify Complex SMARTS Patterns**

  Break down complex patterns into smaller, modular components:

  - Define reusable fragments and combine them logically.
  - Improves readability and ease of maintenance.

  **Implementation**:
  - Define `[CarboxylicAcid]=O)[O;H1]` once and reference it in multiple rules.

- **Advice 11**: **Incorporate Additional Molecular Descriptors**

  Enhance rules by considering:

  - Steric hindrance: Include branching or bulky group patterns.
  - Solubility parameters: Integrate logP calculations if relevant.
  - Electronic properties: Use partial charge estimations.

- **Advice 12**: **Review and Revise Rule Corresponding to Rule17**

  Identify the rule equivalent to **Rule17** (possibly a numbering mismatch):

  - Analyze misclassified molecules associated with this rule.
  - Adjust the rule by adding specificity or exceptions.

  **Implementation**:
  - If Rule17 corresponds to modifiers with certain heterocycles, refine the rule to distinguish between activating and deactivating heterocycles.

- **Advice 13**: **Collaborate with Domain Experts**

  Engage chemists to:

  - Provide insights on reaction mechanisms.
  - Validate the chemical rationale behind each rule.
  - Suggest additional molecular features influencing yield.

- **Advice 14**: **Document Rules Thoroughly**

  For each rule:

  - Provide clear explanations and justifications.
  - Include example modifiers and counterexamples.
  - Comment the code with details on SMARTS pattern logic and intended matches.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (amino acids with two carboxylic acid groups) lead to high yield.*  
  **Example Modifiers**: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)  
  **Explanation**: The presence of both amino and two carboxyl groups provides multiple coordination sites with the metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity through chelation.

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) lead to high yield.*  
  **Example Modifiers**: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, strengthening coordination with metal centers in the catalyst.

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxyl) lead to low yield unless the substituent is separated from the carboxylic acid by an aliphatic chain longer than two carbons, which leads to high yield.*  
  **High Yield Example Modifiers**: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid  
  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**: 4-methylbenzoic acid, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid  
  **Explanation**: An aliphatic spacer reduces the electron-donating group's influence on the carboxylic acid's acidity, maintaining effective coordination while benefiting from additional interactions provided by the aromatic group.

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) groups lead to low yield.*  
  **Example Modifiers**: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups may engage in side reactions or form unstable complexes with metal centers, diminishing catalyst efficiency.

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrophobic chains (six carbons or more) without additional polar groups lead to high yield.*  
  **Example Modifier**: Octanoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Hydrophobic chains can enhance interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or improve substrate accessibility, boosting reactivity.

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) on longer chains (six carbons or more) lead to low yield.*  
  **Example Modifiers**: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Polar groups on long chains may introduce unfavorable solubility or steric hindrance, interfering with effective coordination to the catalyst.

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar functional groups (e.g., amino, thiol) on shorter chains (five carbons or fewer) lead to high yield.*  
  **Example Modifiers**: 5-aminopentanoic acid, 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Short-chain polar groups enhance solubility and provide effective coordination sites, improving catalyst performance.

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers containing heavily fluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups lead to low yield.*  
  **Example Modifiers**: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid, 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Strong electron-withdrawing effects from fluorinated groups can destabilize catalyst-modifier interactions or reduce binding affinity due to altered electronic properties.

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers with pyridine rings directly attached to the carboxylic acid group or via an aliphatic chain lead to high yield, whereas those attached via an aromatic ring lead to low yield.*  
  **High Yield Example Modifiers**: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid), 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid  
  **Low Yield Example Modifier**: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Direct or aliphatic linkage allows the pyridine nitrogen to coordinate effectively with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity. Aromatic linkage may introduce steric hindrance or electron delocalization, reducing coordination efficiency.

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers with thiol groups on short aliphatic chains (five carbons or fewer) lead to high yield, while those with thiol groups on aromatic rings lead to low yield.*  
  **High Yield Example Modifier**: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid  
  **Low Yield Example Modifier**: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Aliphatic thiol groups can form favorable interactions without deactivating the catalyst, whereas aromatic thiols may bind too strongly or interfere with catalytic activity.

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are aromatic amino acids with electron-rich heterocyclic side chains lead to high yield, while those with simple aromatic side chains lead to low yield.*  
  **High Yield Example Modifier**: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)  
  **Low Yield Example Modifier**: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)  
  **Explanation**: Electron-rich heterocycles can coordinate with metal centers or enhance π-stacking interactions, improving catalyst function, whereas simple aromatic rings lack these interactions.

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers with fused aromatic systems containing carboxylic acid groups lead to high yield.*  
  **Example Modifier**: 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid  
  **Explanation**: Fused aromatic systems may enhance electronic interactions and facilitate better coordination with the catalyst, leading to improved reactivity.

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers that are aromatic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., hydroxyl, methoxy) separated from the carboxylic acid by an aliphatic chain longer than two carbons lead to high yield.*  
  **Example Modifiers**: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid  
  **Explanation**: The aliphatic spacer reduces electron-donating effects on acidity, maintaining coordination while the distant electron-donating groups enhance interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers that are amino acids with free amino groups lead to high yield, whereas those with acylated amino groups lead to low yield.*  
  **High Yield Example Modifiers**: 5-aminopentanoic acid, 4-aminobenzoic acid  
  **Low Yield Example Modifier**: (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Free amino groups enhance coordination with metal centers, while acylation diminishes lone pair availability, reducing interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers that are sugar acids or sugar derivatives with multiple hydroxyl groups lead to high yield.*  
  **Example Modifiers**: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous coordination sites and enhance solubility, improving catalyst activity through extensive interaction.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows us to predict high yield modifiers when they are α-amino dicarboxylic acids. The property insight is strong, linking multiple coordination sites to enhanced catalyst activity. The rule combines substructures (amino and two carboxylic acid groups), satisfying complexity. It is supported by two data points, achieving acceptable coverage.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is precise in identifying para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing groups leading to high yield. The chemical rationale regarding increased acidity and stronger coordination is solid. The rule appropriately considers functional group substitution patterns, meeting complexity criteria. It is supported by at least two data points.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is detailed and clearly distinguishes between modifiers based on the presence of electron-donating groups and the length of the aliphatic spacer. The explanation about the spacer reducing electronic effects is insightful. It incorporates multiple structural features, fulfilling complexity requirements. The rule is well-supported by several data points, ensuring good coverage.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is straightforward in associating aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups to low yield, and the explanation about side reactions or unstable complexes is valid. While it focuses on a single functional group, it is specific enough, and is backed by two data points.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 lacks sufficient coverage, as only one data point (octanoic acid) supports it. Despite being clear and providing good property insight, the rule does not meet the minimum data point requirement for coverage.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear and explains why polar groups on long aliphatic chains lead to low yield. It combines chain length and functional group presence, satisfying complexity. With at least three supporting data points, the coverage is adequate.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 effectively identifies modifiers with polar groups on short chains leading to high yield. The explanation is sound, and the rule considers combined structural features, showing appropriate complexity. It is supported by two data points.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear about heavily fluorinated modifiers leading to low yield. The property insight regarding electron-withdrawing effects is convincing. The rule addresses specific functional groups, and is supported by two data points, meeting coverage criteria.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 distinguishes modifiers based on the linkage of the pyridine ring, with solid chemical reasoning about coordination efficiency. It involves multiple structural considerations, fulfilling complexity, and has sufficient supporting data.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is explicit and explains the differing effects of thiol groups on aliphatic vs. aromatic chains. The property insight is reasonable, and the rule shows complexity by considering both chain type and functional group. Despite limited data points, it meets the minimal coverage requirement.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 clearly differentiates between aromatic amino acids based on their side chains, with acceptable property insight. It considers combined features (aromaticity and heterocyclic content), satisfying complexity. Coverage is minimal but acceptable.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 lacks sufficient coverage, with only one data point supporting it. While the property insight is plausible, the rule does not meet the minimum data point requirement, reducing its reliability.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 overlaps significantly with Rule 3, as both address aromatic acids with electron-donating groups separated by aliphatic chains leading to high yield. The redundancy suggests that the rules could be consolidated. The rule is clear and supported by data, but may not be necessary as a separate rule.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 effectively relates the presence of free amino groups to high yield and acylated amino groups to low yield. The chemical reasoning is sound. The rule considers functional group modifications, satisfying complexity, with sufficient data support.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 is not adequately supported, with only one data point. Although the property insight about multiple hydroxyl groups is insightful, the lack of coverage limits its validity.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (amino acids with two carboxylic acid groups) lead to high yield.*  
  **Example Modifiers**: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)  
  **Explanation**: The presence of both amino and two carboxyl groups provides multiple coordination sites with the metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity through chelation.

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) lead to high yield.*  
  **Example Modifiers**: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, strengthening coordination with metal centers in the catalyst.

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxyl) lead to low yield unless the substituent is separated from the carboxylic acid by an aliphatic chain longer than two carbons, which leads to high yield.*  
  **High Yield Example Modifiers**: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid  
  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**: 4-methylbenzoic acid, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid  
  **Explanation**: An aliphatic spacer reduces the electron-donating group's influence on the carboxylic acid's acidity, maintaining effective coordination while benefiting from additional interactions provided by the aromatic group.

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) groups lead to low yield.*  
  **Example Modifiers**: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups may engage in side reactions or form unstable complexes with metal centers, diminishing catalyst efficiency.

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrophobic chains (six carbons or more) without additional polar groups lead to high yield.*  
  **Example Modifier**: Octanoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Hydrophobic chains can enhance interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or improve substrate accessibility, boosting reactivity.

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) on longer chains (six carbons or more) lead to low yield.*  
  **Example Modifiers**: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Polar groups on long chains may introduce unfavorable solubility or steric hindrance, interfering with effective coordination to the catalyst.

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar functional groups (e.g., amino, thiol) on shorter chains (five carbons or fewer) lead to high yield.*  
  **Example Modifiers**: 5-aminopentanoic acid, 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Short-chain polar groups enhance solubility and provide effective coordination sites, improving catalyst performance.

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers containing heavily fluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups lead to low yield.*  
  **Example Modifiers**: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid, 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Strong electron-withdrawing effects from fluorinated groups can destabilize catalyst-modifier interactions or reduce binding affinity due to altered electronic properties.

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers with pyridine rings directly attached to the carboxylic acid group or via an aliphatic chain lead to high yield, whereas those attached via an aromatic ring lead to low yield.*  
  **High Yield Example Modifiers**: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid), 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid  
  **Low Yield Example Modifier**: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Direct or aliphatic linkage allows the pyridine nitrogen to coordinate effectively with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity. Aromatic linkage may introduce steric hindrance or electron delocalization, reducing coordination efficiency.

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers with thiol groups on short aliphatic chains (five carbons or fewer) lead to high yield, while those with thiol groups on aromatic rings lead to low yield.*  
  **High Yield Example Modifier**: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid  
  **Low Yield Example Modifier**: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Aliphatic thiol groups can form favorable interactions without deactivating the catalyst, whereas aromatic thiols may bind too strongly or interfere with catalytic activity.

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are aromatic amino acids with electron-rich heterocyclic side chains lead to high yield, while those with simple aromatic side chains lead to low yield.*  
  **High Yield Example Modifier**: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)  
  **Low Yield Example Modifier**: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)  
  **Explanation**: Electron-rich heterocycles can coordinate with metal centers or enhance π-stacking interactions, improving catalyst function, whereas simple aromatic rings lack these interactions.

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers with fused aromatic systems containing carboxylic acid groups lead to high yield.*  
  **Example Modifier**: 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid  
  **Explanation**: Fused aromatic systems may enhance electronic interactions and facilitate better coordination with the catalyst, leading to improved reactivity.

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers that are aromatic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., hydroxyl, methoxy) separated from the carboxylic acid by an aliphatic chain longer than two carbons lead to high yield.*  
  **Example Modifiers**: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid  
  **Explanation**: The aliphatic spacer reduces electron-donating effects on acidity, maintaining coordination while the distant electron-donating groups enhance interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers that are amino acids with free amino groups lead to high yield, whereas those with acylated amino groups lead to low yield.*  
  **High Yield Example Modifiers**: 5-aminopentanoic acid, 4-aminobenzoic acid  
  **Low Yield Example Modifier**: (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Free amino groups enhance coordination with metal centers, while acylation diminishes lone pair availability, reducing interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers that are sugar acids or sugar derivatives with multiple hydroxyl groups lead to high yield.*  
  **Example Modifiers**: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous coordination sites and enhance solubility, improving catalyst activity through extensive interaction.

Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: **Improve Positional Specificity in SMARTS Patterns**  
  The current code lacks positional specificity for substituents on the aromatic ring in Rules 2 and 3. To accurately identify para-substituted benzoic acids, modify the SMARTS patterns to enforce substituent positions. For example, use the SMARTS pattern `c1ccc(cc1)[C](=O)[OX2H1]` for benzoic acid and combine it with patterns that specify substituents at the para position (e.g., position 4). Implement SMARTS that define the para position explicitly, such as `[$(c1ccc(cc1)[C](=O)[OX2H1])]` and use recursive SMARTS or atom mapping to ensure correct positional matching.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Correct the Implementation of Electron-Withdrawing and Electron-Donating Groups (EWG/EDG)**  
  The code currently defines EWGs and EDGs but does not effectively utilize them in pattern matching. Combine the EWG and EDG patterns into single SMARTS strings using logical OR (`|`) operations. For instance, define EWGs as a single SMARTS pattern like `[$([NX3+](=O)[O-]),$([CX3](=O)[OX1-,OX2H0]),$(C[F,Cl,Br,I]),$(C(F)(F)F)]`. Apply these patterns directly to the positions of interest on the aromatic ring. Ensure that these group patterns are correctly integrated into the overall SMARTS used for substructure searches.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Implement Positional Matching Logic in the Code**  
  The code mentions positions (e.g., 'para') in the rule descriptions but does not have logic to enforce or check for these positions. Incorporate code that can identify substituents at specific positions relative to the carboxylic acid group on the aromatic ring. Utilize RDKit's capabilities to map atom indices and define relationships between them. For example, after finding the carboxylic acid, search for substituents at the para position by identifying atoms that are four bonds away in the ring system.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Handle Conditional Predictions with Explicit Logic**  
  For rules with conditional outcomes (e.g., Rule 3), explicitly program the conditions in the code. For Rule 3, determine the length of the aliphatic chain separating the electron-donating group from the carboxylic acid. Use substructure searches to identify and measure chain lengths, perhaps by counting the number of carbon atoms in the connecting chain. Then, apply the appropriate prediction based on the chain length as per the rule.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Refine SMARTS Patterns for Specific Functional Groups**  
  Some SMARTS patterns may be too general or overly simplistic, leading to incorrect matches. Review and refine SMARTS definitions for functional groups like carboxylic acids, amino groups, aldehydes, thiols, etc., to ensure they accurately represent the intended chemical structures. Use RDKit's predefined SMARTS or consult reliable chemical SMARTS pattern repositories to improve accuracy.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Include Error Handling for Unparsable Molecules**  
  The code currently skips molecules that cannot be parsed by RDKit by appending a row of zeros. Implement error handling to log or report these cases for review. This will help identify issues with specific SMILES strings and improve data quality.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Test and Validate Each Rule Individually**  
  Before applying all rules to the dataset, test each rule individually with known molecules (both positive and negative examples) to ensure the SMARTS patterns and logic correctly identify the intended structures. This step will help catch errors in pattern definitions and logical conditions early.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Optimize the Use of RDKit Functions**  
  Utilize RDKit's advanced features, such as atom mapping, molecule queries, and substructure search options like `mol.GetSubstructMatches()` with constraints, to enhance pattern matching. This can improve the precision of matches, especially when dealing with complex ring systems or specific functional group positions.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Comment and Document the Code Thoroughly**  
  Add comments and documentation within the code to explain the purpose of each SMARTS pattern, the logic behind each rule implementation, and any assumptions made. This will make the code more understandable and maintainable for future revisions.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Consider Stereochemistry if Relevant**  
  If stereochemistry is important for certain rules (e.g., α-amino acids), ensure that the SMARTS patterns account for chiral centers where necessary. RDKit allows for chiral SMARTS matching, which can enhance the specificity of pattern recognition.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify Rules into Quantifiable Structural Features**
  
  Reformulate the current rules to focus on specific, quantifiable structural features that can be directly extracted from SMILES strings. For example, instead of describing modifiers qualitatively (e.g., "Modifiers with long hydrophobic chains"), specify the exact chain length or number of carbons. This makes the rules more precise and facilitates numerical feature generation.

- **Advice 2**: **Define Clear Numerical Thresholds and Parameters**

  Incorporate numerical thresholds within the rules for features like chain length, number of functional groups, or position of substituents. For instance, specify that modifiers with aliphatic chains of **exactly six or more carbons** lead to high yield. This precision enables the creation of a numeric feature matrix based on these defined parameters.

- **Advice 3**: **Standardize Functional Group Definitions**

  Use standardized definitions for functional groups and chemical features that are recognized in cheminformatics software. Assign specific identifiers or counts to functional groups (e.g., count of carboxylic acid groups, presence of amino groups at specific positions) to allow for automatic extraction from SMILES.

- **Advice 4**: **Utilize Computational Molecular Descriptors**

  Integrate well-established molecular descriptors (e.g., molecular weight, LogP, topological polar surface area, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors) into the rules. These descriptors can be calculated directly from SMILES and provide quantitative data that correlate with the yield.

- **Advice 5**: **Reframe Qualitative Terms into Quantitative Measures**

  Replace qualitative terms like "electron-withdrawing" or "electron-donating" with quantitative parameters such as Hammett sigma constants or calculated partial charges. This conversion allows for numerical representation and comparison of electronic effects among modifiers.

- **Advice 6**: **Merge and Consolidate Overlapping Rules**

  Identify and combine rules that have overlapping features to reduce redundancy. For example, merge rules related to chain length and presence of polar groups by creating a matrix of chain length versus functionality, which can be numerically represented.

- **Advice 7**: **Create a Hierarchical Rule Structure**

  Organize the rules hierarchically, starting from general features to more specific ones. This structure enables the stepwise extraction of features and simplifies the computational modeling process.

- **Advice 8**: **Clarify Spatial Relationships in Modifiers**

  Specify the positions of functional groups relative to reference points in the molecule. For example, indicate that an amino group is at the alpha position relative to the carboxylic acid. Positional information can be numerically coded and extracted from SMILES.

- **Advice 9**: **Incorporate Steric and Electronic Descriptor Calculations**

  Include descriptors that quantify steric hindrance (e.g., Van der Waals volume) and electronic properties (e.g., HOMO-LUMO gap, dipole moment) which can influence yield. These can be calculated using computational chemistry tools interfaced with SMILES.

- **Advice 10**: **Facilitate Machine Learning Compatibility**

  Adjust the rules to align with features commonly used in machine learning models. This includes binary indicators for the presence or absence of certain substructures, counts of specific atom types, or numerical values of calculated properties, enabling seamless integration into predictive algorithms.

- **Advice 11**: **Provide Exemplary SMILES for Each Rule**

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: Revise the rules to focus on quantifiable molecular descriptors that can be directly computed from SMILES strings. Utilize features such as the number of specific atoms (e.g., N, O, S), counts of functional groups (e.g., carboxylic acids, amino groups), ring counts, and aliphatic chain lengths. This will facilitate the creation of a numerical feature matrix for each modifier.

- **Advice 2**: Define rules using specific numerical thresholds or ranges instead of qualitative terms. For example, replace "long hydrophobic chains (six carbons or more)" with "aliphatic chains containing ≥6 carbon atoms." This makes the rules more precise and easier to implement computationally.

- **Advice 3**: Implement SMARTS patterns to precisely identify structural features within the modifiers. SMARTS allows for the specification of substructures, which can be programmatically matched to SMILES strings to generate binary features indicating the presence or absence of these substructures.

- **Advice 4**: Incorporate calculated physicochemical properties as features, such as LogP (octanol-water partition coefficient), molecular weight, topological polar surface area, and hydrogen bond donors/acceptors. These properties are numerically quantifiable and can impact the reaction yield.

- **Advice 5**: Use electronic descriptors like Hammett sigma constants to quantify electron-donating or -withdrawing effects of substituents. This numerical approach replaces qualitative descriptions like "electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity."

- **Advice 6**: Create binary features for the presence of specific functional groups or moieties (e.g., amino group, hydroxyl group, nitro group, aldehyde group). Generate these features directly from the molecular structure using cheminformatics tools.

- **Advice 7**: Utilize molecular fingerprints (e.g., ECFP6, MACCS keys) to represent the modifiers numerically. Fingerprints encode structural information and can be directly used in machine learning models to predict yields.

- **Advice 8**: Streamline the rules by clustering modifiers with similar structures and reactivities, reducing complexity. For instance, group all modifiers with free amino groups regardless of chain length and quantify their effect numerically.

- **Advice 9**: Introduce numerical parameters for steric factors, such as branchiness or steric hindrance indices. Quantifying steric bulk can help correlate structural features with reaction outcomes.

- **Advice 10**: Incorporate descriptors for coordination ability, such as the number of potential coordination sites (e.g., total number of donor atoms like N and O) to reflect the modifier's ability to interact with metal centers.

- **Advice 11**: Develop a standardized data extraction protocol to automatically generate the numerical feature matrix from SMILES strings. This ensures consistency and reproducibility in data representation.

- **Advice 12**: Align the rules with commonly used cheminformatics software features to leverage existing tools for feature calculation. This includes software like RDKit, which can compute a wide range of molecular descriptors from SMILES inputs.

- **Advice 13**: Reevaluate and possibly remove rules that are based on complex or abstract chemical concepts difficult to quantify numerically (e.g., "enhance interactions with hydrophobic regions"). Replace them with descriptors that can be calculated or measured.

- **Advice 14**: Incorporate experimental conditions as numerical features if applicable, such as modifier loading ratios, Fe/Hf ratios, and Fe loading amounts, to capture their impact on yield alongside molecular features.

- **Advice 15**: Utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze the numerical features and identify which are most predictive of high or low yield. This data-driven approach can refine the rules based on statistical significance.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (amino acids with two carboxylic acid groups) lead to high yield.*  
  **High Yield Example Modifiers**: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)  
  **Explanation**: The presence of both amino and two carboxylate groups offers multiple coordination sites to the metal centers in the catalyst, enhancing catalytic activity through strong chelation and increasing yield.

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups lead to high yield, while those with electron-donating groups lead to low yield.*  
  **High Yield Example Modifiers**: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid  
  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**: 4-methylbenzoic acid, 4-aminobenzoic acid (an exception leads to high yield due to amino coordination)  
  **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, strengthening coordination with the metal centers. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity, weakening metal coordination and lowering yield.

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) substituents on the ring lead to low yield.*  
  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups can engage in side reactions or interfere with metal coordination, diminishing catalyst efficiency and reducing yield.

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrophobic chains (six carbons or more) without additional terminal polar groups lead to high yield, whereas those with terminal polar groups lead to low yield.*  
  **High Yield Example Modifier**: Octanoic acid  
  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Hydrophobic chains without terminal polar groups enhance interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or improve substrate accessibility, boosting reactivity. Terminal polar groups may introduce unfavorable solvation effects or steric hindrance, interfering with effective coordination.

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (five carbons or fewer) with terminal polar functional groups (e.g., amino, thiol) lead to high yield.*  
  **High Yield Example Modifiers**: 5-aminopentanoic acid, 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Short-chain modifiers with polar groups enhance solubility and provide effective coordination sites to the catalyst's metal centers, improving catalyst performance through favorable interactions.

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers containing pyridine carboxylic acids or pyridine rings connected via aliphatic chains lead to high yield, whereas those with pyridine rings connected via aromatic rings lead to low yield.*  
  **High Yield Example Modifiers**: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid), 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid  
  **Low Yield Example Modifier**: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Pyridine nitrogens can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity. Aliphatic linkages allow flexible coordination, while aromatic linkages may cause steric hindrance or electronic delocalization that reduces coordination efficiency.

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers containing perfluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups lead to low yield.*  
  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid, 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Strong electron-withdrawing effects from fluorinated groups can destabilize catalyst-modifier interactions or reduce binding affinity due to altered electronic properties, decreasing yield.

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with fused ring systems or heterocyclic structures lead to high yield.*  
  **High Yield Example Modifiers**: 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid, 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid  
  **Explanation**: Fused aromatic systems and heterocycles can enhance electronic interactions and provide additional coordination sites, facilitating better bonding with the catalyst and increasing yield.

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers that are polyhydroxy carboxylic acids or sugar acids lead to high yield.*  
  **High Yield Example Modifier**: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)  
  **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups offer numerous coordination sites and enhance solubility, improving catalyst activity through extensive interactions and chelation.

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers that are amino acids with bulky or hydrophobic side chains lead to variable yield: those with coordinating functional groups lead to high yield, while those without coordinating groups lead to low yield.*  
  **High Yield Example Modifier**: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)  
  **Low Yield Example Modifier**: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)  
  **Explanation**: Bulky side chains with heteroatoms (e.g., indole nitrogen in tryptophan) can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing yield. Hydrophobic side chains without coordinating ability (e.g., phenyl group in phenylalanine) do not contribute to catalysis and may hinder interactions, reducing yield.

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are amide derivatives of amino acids or aromatic carboxylic acids lead to low yield.*  
  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**: (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid  
  **Explanation**: Amide formation reduces the availability of lone pairs on nitrogen and oxygen for coordination with metal centers, diminishing catalyst effectiveness due to decreased coordination.

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups lead to low yield, whereas those with thiol groups on short aliphatic chains lead to high yield.*  
  **High Yield Example Modifier**: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid  
  **Low Yield Example Modifier**: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Thiol groups on aliphatic chains can form effective coordination without deactivating the catalyst. Aromatic thiols may bind too strongly or interfere with catalytic sites, reducing yield.

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers with electron-donating methoxy groups attached to an aromatic ring separated by an aliphatic spacer lead to high yield, while those directly attached lead to low yield.*  
  **High Yield Example Modifier**: 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid  
  **Low Yield Example Modifier**: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid  
  **Explanation**: An aliphatic spacer reduces the electron-donating effect on the carboxylic acid group, allowing effective coordination. Direct attachment can decrease acidity and weaken coordination with metal centers.

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups attached to a tertiary carbon lead to high yield.*  
  **High Yield Example Modifier**: 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]propanoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and offer several coordination sites, enhancing interactions with the catalyst and improving yield.

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers with flexible linkers between functional groups and the aromatic ring lead to high yield, while rigid linkers lead to low yield.*  
  **High Yield Example Modifier**: 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid  
  **Low Yield Example Modifier**: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid  
  **Explanation**: Flexible aliphatic linkers allow the coordinating group to adjust and interact optimally with the catalyst's active sites. Rigid aromatic linkers prevent effective alignment, reducing coordination efficiency and yield.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For **Rule 1**, update the SMARTS pattern to specifically match α-amino dicarboxylic acids. The current patterns may not ensure that both carboxylic acid groups and the primary amine are connected to the α-carbon. Use a SMARTS pattern like `'[NX3H2][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX1H])[CX3](=O)[OX1H]'` to accurately capture the α-amino acid structure with two carboxylic acid groups attached to the α-carbon.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Ensure that the `count_threshold` logic correctly associates the patterns with their counts. In the code, when accessing `pat.GetSmarts()`, the returned SMARTS strings may not match the keys in `count_threshold` due to formatting differences. Assign unique identifiers or use the pattern variables directly as keys in `count_threshold` to prevent mismatches.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: Review the pattern matching logic, especially when multiple patterns are grouped. Ensure that the code checks for the simultaneous presence of all required substructures in a rule. Modify the logic so that a rule matches only if all its pattern groups are found in the molecule, considering any specified counts.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: For **Rule 2** and **Rule 3**, refine the SMARTS patterns to accurately detect para-substituted benzoic acids with specific substituents. Use more precise patterns that specify the para position and distinguish between electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups. For example, include SMARTS patterns that match nitro, halogen, or trifluoromethyl groups at the para position for Rule 2.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: Enhance debugging by adding detailed logging statements. For each SMILES and rule, log which patterns matched and which did not. This will help identify where the matching process is failing and facilitate correction of the SMARTS patterns or logic.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Implement the remaining rules (11 to 15) to ensure comprehensive coverage. This will provide a complete feature matrix and allow for better assessment of the transformation effectiveness across all the provided rules.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: Create unit tests using the example modifiers provided for each rule. Verify that the code correctly identifies these examples according to the rules they are associated with. This will help validate the correctness of the SMARTS patterns and matching logic.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Adjust the SMARTS patterns to account for stereochemistry when necessary. Some rules may depend on stereochemical configurations, so include chiral specifications in the patterns if required.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: Verify that the `exclude_patterns` functionality is correctly implemented. For rules that require the absence of certain groups (e.g., terminal polar groups in **Rule 5**), ensure that these groups are accurately recognized and that their presence properly excludes the molecule from matching the rule.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Simplify and combine patterns where possible to improve matching efficiency and accuracy. For example, combine related substructures into a single SMARTS pattern per rule, using logical operators to specify required and excluded features within one expression.

  - **Train Support**: 0.0686

**Analysis:**

The current train support of **0.0686** is significantly lower than the reference mean of approximately **0.1757**. This indicates that the current rules cover a smaller proportion of the training data compared to previous rules. While the support increased slightly from the lowest value in the previous iterations (**0.0336**), it remains below the earlier reference levels.

**Implication:**

- **Low Support** suggests that the rules are applicable to fewer instances in the dataset. This could be a sign of overfitting, where the rules are too specific and do not generalize well to a broader dataset.

---

### **2. Confidence**

**Reference Metrics:**

- **Train Confidence Mean**: Approximately 0.5874 (average of 0.6352 and 0.5396)
- **Previous Iterations:**
  - 0.6961
  - 0.6457
- **Current Metric:**
  - **Train Confidence**: 0.7714

**Analysis:**

The current train confidence of **0.7714** shows a notable increase compared to both the reference mean and previous iterations. This indicates that when the rule conditions are met, there is a higher probability that the rule predictions are also true.

**Implication:**

- **High Confidence** implies that the rules are more reliable when applicable. However, without adequate support, high confidence alone may not contribute significantly to the overall performance.

---

### **3. Lift**

**Reference Metrics:**

- **Train Lift Mean**: Approximately 1.1304 (average of 1.2048 and 1.0559)
- **Previous Iterations:**
  - 1.4058
  - 1.2966
- **Current Metric:**
  - **Train Lift**: 1.5538

**Analysis:**

The current train lift of **1.5538** is substantially higher than both the reference mean and previous iterations. Lift values significantly greater than 1 indicate that the rule is a strong predictor compared to random chance.

**Implication:**

- **High Lift** signifies that the presence of the rule condition(s) greatly increases the likelihood of the rule prediction(s). This suggests that the current rules are identifying strong associations within the data.

---

### **4. Leverage**

**Reference Metrics:**

- **Train Leverage Mean**: Approximately 0.0124 (average of 0.0289 and -0.0041)
- **Previous Iterations:**
  - 0.0082
  - 0.0123
- **Current Metric:**
  - **Train Leverage**: 0.0139

**Analysis:**

The current train leverage of **0.0139** is slightly higher than the previous iterations and close to the reference mean. Positive leverage indicates stronger association than expected by chance.

**Implication:**

- **Positive Leverage** confirms that the rules provide additional predictive power beyond random chance, although the increase is modest.

---

### **Overall Interpretation**

- The **increase in confidence** and **lift** suggests that the current rules are more accurate and have stronger predictive capabilities when they are applicable.
- The **decrease in support** indicates that these rules apply to a smaller portion of the dataset, potentially limiting their practical utility.
- **Leverage** remains relatively consistent, indicating that the overall strength of association is stable but not significantly improved.

---

**Assessment of Local Minimum and Iterations**

Given the current metrics:

- **Confidence** and **Lift** have improved, reaching higher levels than in previous iterations.
- **Support** has decreased, signaling a trade-off between the accuracy of the rules and their applicability.
- The pattern suggests that the optimization process is focusing on improving accuracy at the expense of coverage.

**Local Minimum Consideration:**

- A **local maximum** in terms of confidence and lift may have been reached, where further iterations are yielding diminishing returns in these metrics.
- However, the **decrease in support** raises concerns about the rules becoming too specialized, which may not be desirable.

**Iteration Sufficiency:**

- It's premature to conclude that enough iterations have been completed, as the goal should be to balance **support** with **confidence** and **lift**.
- Additional iterations may explore the possibility of improving support without substantially compromising confidence and lift.

---

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

1. **Balance Specificity and Generality:**

   - **Generalize Certain Rules:** Re-evaluate overly specific conditions in the rules to make them more broadly applicable, thereby increasing support.
   - **Example:** For rules affecting specific functional groups, consider grouping similar functional groups under broader categories if they exhibit similar behaviors.

2. **Review Rule Overlaps and Redundancies:**

   - Identify rules that may be overlapping or redundant and consolidate them to simplify the rule set.
   - This can enhance support by combining the coverage of similar rules.

3. **Incorporate Additional Data or Features:**

   - **Analyze Other Features:** Look into other molecular descriptors or properties that may impact yield, such as steric factors, electronic properties, or solvent effects.
   - Including these may help formulate rules that cover more data points with high confidence.

4. **Adjust Thresholds for Rule Inclusion:**

   - Reconsider the thresholds for metrics like confidence and support when deciding which rules to include.
   - Allowing slightly lower confidence in favor of higher support may lead to more practical and generalizable rules.

5. **Cross-Validation and Testing:**

   - Evaluate the rules on a separate validation set to assess their generalizability.
   - Ensure that the high confidence and lift are not artifacts of overfitting to the training data.

6. **Iterative Refinement:**

   - Continue with iterative refinement, focusing on increasing support while monitoring the impact on confidence and lift.
   - Employ techniques such as pruning overly specific conditions or merging similar rules.

---

**Conclusion**

The current set of rules shows improved confidence and lift, indicating strong predictive power for the instances they cover. However, the decreased support suggests that these rules are applicable to a smaller subset of the data, potentially limiting their usefulness.

To enhance the overall performance, efforts should be made to increase the support of the rules without significantly sacrificing confidence and lift. This can be achieved by generalizing certain rules, consolidating overlapping rules, and incorporating additional relevant features into the analysis. Further iterations are recommended to achieve a better balance between rule applicability and predictive accuracy.

Traditional Commenter Message:
**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

Based on the latest training results and comparing them with the reference metrics, we observe the following:

1. **Accuracy Metrics Comparison**:

   - **Reference Accuracies**:
     - Validation Accuracies range from **0.68 to 0.76**.
     - Test Accuracies range from **0.625 to 0.75**.

   - **Current Iteration Accuracies**:
     - Initial validation accuracy: **0.6286**.
     - After refining rules: **0.7714**.
     - Latest validation accuracy: **0.7143**.

   The initial drop in accuracy to **0.6286** suggests that the initial set of rules may not have been effective. However, refining the rules improved the accuracy to **0.7714**, exceeding previous validation accuracies. The slight decrease to **0.7143** indicates potential overfitting or new issues introduced by the latest rule adjustments.

2. **Effectiveness of Current Rules**:

   - The improvement in accuracy after refining the rules suggests that the rules are becoming more effective.
   - The validation accuracy of **0.7714** surpasses previous accuracies, indicating that the rules are capturing relevant patterns in the data.

3. **Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting**:

   - The fluctuation in validation accuracy suggests that while the model captures important features, it may also be overfitting to certain patterns.
   - The differences between validation accuracies imply that some rules may not generalize well across different folds of the data.

**Analysis Based on SHAP Value Calculated on the Validation Set**

Using SHAP analysis, we can identify which rules contribute most significantly to the model's predictions, especially in cases where the model's predictions do not match the experimental values.

1. **Discrepancies Analysis**:

   - **Overestimation Cases** (Predicted High, Experimental Low):

     - **Molecule**: CC1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=O)O (p-toluic acid)
       - **Rules with High Positive SHAP Values**:
         - **Rule 6**: SHAP value of **0.09896**.
         - **Rule 4**: SHAP value of **0.05028**.
         - **Rule 9** and **Rule 10** also contribute positively.

     - **Molecule**: C(=O)(C(C(C(C(F)(F)F)(F)F)(F)F)(F)F)O
       - **Rules with High Positive SHAP Values**:
         - **Rule 17**: SHAP value of **0.08796**.
         - **Rule 4** and **Rule 6** contribute positively.
         - **Rule 8**: Negative SHAP value of **-0.08049**, attempting to counteract overestimation.

   - **Underestimation Cases** (Predicted Low, Experimental High):

     - **Molecule**: C([C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](C(=O)O)O)O)O)O)O (D-gluconic acid)
       - **Rules with High Negative SHAP Values**:
         - **Rule 6**: SHAP value of **-0.30173**.
       - **Rule 9** (polyhydroxy carboxylic acids) has a small positive SHAP value, insufficient to correct the underestimation.

2. **Identification of Problematic Rules**:

   - **Rule 6** is consistently contributing to misclassifications:
     - Overestimation: It has a high positive SHAP value for molecules that experimentally have low loading.
     - Underestimation: It has a high negative SHAP value for molecules that experimentally have high loading.
   - **Rule 4**, **Rule 9**, and **Rule 10** also contribute, but their SHAP values are lower compared to **Rule 6**.

3. **Insights from SHAP Analysis**:

   - **Rule 6** appears to be too broad or misapplied, affecting both overestimations and underestimations.
   - **Rule 9**, which should boost predictions for polyhydroxy carboxylic acids, seems underrepresented in its impact.
   - The combination of rules may be interacting in ways that amplify errors for certain molecules.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

Based on the above analysis, the following suggestions are made to improve the current rules:

1. **Refine Rule 6**:

   - **Issue**: Rule 6 is causing significant misclassifications due to its broad application.
   - **Current Rule 6**: *Modifiers containing pyridine carboxylic acids or pyridine rings connected via aliphatic chains lead to high yield, whereas those with pyridine rings connected via aromatic rings lead to low yield.*
   - **Recommendation**:
     - **Narrow the Scope**: Limit the rule to specific pyridine-containing modifiers known to lead to high yield.
     - **Incorporate Substituent Effects**: Consider the electron-withdrawing or donating nature of substituents on the pyridine ring.
     - **Add Exceptions**: Identify and exclude cases where the rule does not hold, such as modifiers where pyridine's coordination is hindered.

2. **Adjust Rule 2**:

   - **Issue**: Rule 2 may not be adequately penalizing electron-donating groups, leading to overprediction of loading for certain modifiers.
   - **Current Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are para-substituted benzoic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups lead to high yield, while those with electron-donating groups lead to low yield.*
   - **Recommendation**:
     - **Strengthen the Negative Influence**: Increase the negative weighting or impact of electron-donating groups in the rule.
     - **Differentiate Between Substituents**: Explicitly list methyl groups (e.g., p-toluic acid) as examples leading to low yield.
     - **Improve Detection**: Ensure the feature extraction accurately captures the presence of electron-donating groups.

3. **Enhance Rule 9**:

   - **Issue**: Rule 9 is not sufficiently increasing the predicted loading for polyhydroxy carboxylic acids, leading to underestimation.
   - **Current Rule 9**: *Modifiers that are polyhydroxy carboxylic acids or sugar acids lead to high yield.*
   - **Recommendation**:
     - **Increase the Weight**: Amplify the positive SHAP contribution of Rule 9 to ensure it has a stronger impact on relevant molecules.
     - **Refine the Rule**: Specify conditions under which polyhydroxy acids are most effective, such as chain length or configuration.
     - **Feature Representation**: Ensure that the features used in the model capture all hydroxyl groups and their positions.

4. **Consider Interactions Between Rules**:

   - **Issue**: Rules may be interacting in unintended ways, amplifying errors.
   - **Recommendation**:
     - **Analyze Rule Combinations**: Investigate how rules collectively impact predictions for specific molecules.
     - **Introduce Interaction Terms**: If the model allows, include interaction features that account for combinations of functional groups.
     - **Adjust Rule Hierarchy**: Prioritize certain rules over others to prevent less critical rules from overshadowing more important ones.

5. **Improve Generalization to Address Overfitting**:

   - **Issue**: High SHAP values for certain rules suggest overfitting to specific features.
   - **Recommendation**:
     - **Simplify Overly Complex Rules**: Break down complex rules into simpler, more general components.
     - **Add Diversity to the Training Set**: Include more varied examples to help the model generalize better.
     - **Regularize Rule Contributions**: Implement methods to prevent any single rule from dominating the predictions.

6. **Use Insights from SHAP Analysis Iteratively**:

   - **Issue**: SHAP analysis reveals specific cases where rules fail.
   - **Recommendation**:
     - **Iteratively Refine Rules**: Use SHAP values to identify and adjust problematic rules in successive iterations.
     - **Monitor Rule Impact**: After adjustments, reassess the SHAP values to ensure improvements are achieved.
     - **Document Changes**: Keep a record of rule modifications and their effects on model performance for future reference.

**Conclusion**

By closely examining the contributions of each rule through SHAP analysis and focusing on molecules where discrepancies occur, we can identify and refine specific rules that are causing misclassifications. The recommended adjustments aim to improve the model's predictive accuracy by making the rules more precise and ensuring they generalize well across different molecules. Iterative refinement, guided by systematic analysis, will enhance the effectiveness of the rules and the overall model performance.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **
- **Advice 1**: **Refine Rule 6 to Increase Specificity**  
  Modify Rule 6 to more precisely target pyridine-containing modifiers that lead to high yield. Update the rule to specify that only pyridine carboxylic acids with aliphatic (non-aromatic) linkers of a certain length (e.g., two to four carbons) between the pyridine ring and the carboxylic acid group result in high yield. Exclude modifiers where the pyridine ring is connected via aromatic rings. Adjust the SMARTS pattern accordingly to capture these specific structural features and prevent misclassifications due to the rule being too broad.

- **Advice 2**: **Adjust Rule 2 to Better Penalize Electron-Donating Groups**  
  Strengthen Rule 2 by explicitly identifying electron-donating groups (EDGs) that decrease yield when attached to para-substituted benzoic acids. Enhance the SMARTS patterns to accurately detect EDGs such as methyl (-CH₃), methoxy (-OCH₃), and amino (-NH₂) groups at the para position. Include these groups in the negative condition of the rule to ensure they lead to low yield predictions. Provide explicit low-yield examples with EDGs to reinforce the rule.

- **Advice 3**: **Enhance Rule 9 to Increase Influence on Polyhydroxy Carboxylic Acids**  
  Amplify the positive impact of Rule 9 by refining the SMARTS patterns to accurately detect modifiers that are polyhydroxy carboxylic acids or sugar acids. Specify the minimum number of hydroxyl groups (e.g., three or more) and their proximity to the carboxylic acid group. Ensure the model correctly recognizes these modifiers by verifying that all relevant hydroxyl groups are captured in the pattern, leading to a high yield prediction.

- **Advice 4**: **Improve SMARTS Patterns for Accurate Feature Detection**  
  Review and refine the SMARTS patterns for all rules to ensure precise matching of the intended molecular features. For each rule, verify that the pattern accurately captures the functional groups and structural requirements specified. Incorporate chiral specifications where relevant to account for stereochemistry. Test the patterns against known modifiers to confirm correct inclusion or exclusion based on the rule.

- **Advice 5**: **Consider Rule Interactions and Adjust Rule Hierarchy**  
  Analyze how different rules interact and potentially conflict with each other. Adjust the hierarchy or weighting of the rules so that those with higher predictive power have greater influence on the final prediction. This can help minimize misclassifications that arise from conflicting rules. Implement a system where more critical rules override less significant ones when determining the yield prediction.

- **Advice 6**: **Iteratively Refine Rules Using SHAP Analysis**  
  Use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis to identify which rules contribute most to misclassifications. Focus on adjusting these rules in successive iterations. After each adjustment, re-evaluate the model's performance to ensure improvements without introducing new errors. Document changes and their effects to track progress and inform future refinements.

- **Advice 7**: **Implement and Test Remaining Rules (Rules 11 to 15)**  
  Develop SMARTS patterns for Rules 11 to 15 to complete the rule set and provide comprehensive coverage of relevant molecular features. For each new rule, create unit tests using example modifiers to verify correct classification. Ensure that these rules are integrated into the model without conflicting with existing rules.

- **Advice 8**: **Enhance Debugging and Logging Mechanisms**  
  Implement detailed logging for each molecule processed by the model. For every rule, log whether the SMARTS pattern matched and how it contributed to the final yield prediction. Use these logs to perform error analysis, identifying cases where rules did not behave as expected. This information can guide further refinements and help isolate issues in rule implementation.

- **Advice 9**: **Balance Specificity and Generality to Improve Support**  
  Identify rules that are overly specific and consider generalizing them to increase their support (i.e., applicability to more data points). Balance this with the need to maintain high confidence and accuracy. Look for common structural features among high-yield modifiers that can be incorporated into existing rules, thereby broadening their applicability without sacrificing predictive power.

- **Advice 10**: **Prevent Overfitting by Applying Regularization Techniques**  
  To avoid overfitting, ensure that no single rule disproportionately influences the model's predictions. Apply regularization techniques such as setting maximum thresholds for rule contributions or using weighting schemes to balance the influence of all rules. This approach helps the model generalize better to new, unseen data.

- **Advice 11**: **Incorporate Additional Data to Improve Model Generalization**  
  If possible, expand the dataset with more examples of modifiers, especially those that currently have low representation. A more diverse training set helps the model learn patterns that generalize well. Consider synthesizing new data points or sourcing additional experimental results to enhance the training data.

---

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) at the para position lead to high yield; those with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl) at the para position lead to low yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**: 4-methylbenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, strengthening coordination with the metal centers in the catalyst. This enhanced coordination improves catalytic efficiency and yield. Conversely, electron-donating groups decrease acidity, weakening metal coordination and reducing yield.

---

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) groups directly attached to the ring lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

---

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrocarbon chains (six carbons or more) without additional polar functional groups lead to high yield; the presence of additional polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) leads to low yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**: Octanoic acid

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Hydrophobic long-chain acids without polar groups may enhance interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or improve substrate accessibility, boosting reactivity. Additional polar groups may introduce unfavorable solvation effects or steric hindrance, interfering with effective coordination and lowering yield.

---

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (five carbons or fewer) containing terminal amino or thiol groups lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**: 5-aminopentanoic acid, 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Terminal amino or thiol groups close to the carboxylate can efficiently coordinate with the metal centers in the catalyst. This enhances catalyst-modifier interactions and improves catalytic performance, leading to high yield.

---

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen in the ring lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid), 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid, 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid

---

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers that contain pyridine rings connected to the carboxylic acid via flexible aliphatic chains lead to high yield; those connected via rigid aromatic rings lead to low yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**: 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Flexible aliphatic linkers allow the pyridine nitrogen to orient and coordinate effectively with the catalyst's metal centers. Rigid aromatic linkers prevent optimal alignment due to steric hindrance or reduced flexibility, diminishing coordination efficiency and lowering yield.

---

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms (e.g., indole ring in tryptophan) lead to high yield; those with aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms lead to low yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)

  **Explanation**: Heteroatoms in the aromatic side chain can coordinate with the metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity through additional interactions. Aromatic side chains without heteroatoms lack this coordinating ability and may hinder catalyst interactions, reducing yield.

---

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers that are carboxylic acids with perfluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid, 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Strong electron-withdrawing effects from fluorinated groups can decrease the basicity of coordinating atoms and destabilize catalyst-modifier interactions. This reduces the binding affinity to the metal centers, diminishing catalytic performance and yield.

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers that are sugar acids or carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons (polyhydroxy acids) lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

  **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous coordination sites and enhance solubility. This allows for extensive interactions and chelation with the catalyst's metal centers, improving catalytic efficiency and leading to high yield.

---

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a thiol group on a short chain lead to high yield; thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings lead to low yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Thiol groups on short aliphatic chains can form effective coordination with metal centers without deactivating the catalyst. Aromatic thiols may bind too strongly or interfere with catalytic sites due to their conjugated systems, reducing yield.

---

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers that are amide derivatives of carboxylic acids lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**: (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

  **Explanation**: Amide formation reduces the availability of lone pairs on nitrogen and oxygen atoms for coordination with metal centers. This decreases catalyst-modifier interactions, leading to reduced catalytic efficiency and lower yield.

---

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers with electron-donating groups attached via flexible aliphatic spacers lead to high yield; those directly attached to aromatic rings may lead to low yield due to decreased carboxylate acidity.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**: 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Aliphatic spacers attenuate the electron-donating effect on the carboxyl group, preserving its acidity and coordinating ability with metal centers. Direct attachment of electron-donating groups to the aromatic ring reduces carboxylate acidity and weakens metal coordination.

---

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino groups on long chains (more than six carbons) lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid

  **Explanation**: In long-chain amino acids, the amino group is distant from the carboxylate and may not effectively coordinate with the catalyst's metal centers. Additionally, the long hydrophilic chains can disrupt hydrophobic interactions or introduce steric hindrance, reducing catalytic efficiency and yield.

---

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers that contain both an aromatic ring and a flexible spacer to a coordinating group (e.g., hydroxy, amino) lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid

  **Explanation**: The flexible aliphatic spacer allows the coordinating group to adjust and effectively interact with the catalyst's metal centers while the aromatic ring can engage in π-π interactions. This combination enhances catalyst-modifier interactions, leading to improved catalytic performance and high yield.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (α-amino acids with two carboxylic acid groups) lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**: (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid), (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)

  **Explanation**: The presence of both an α-amino group and two carboxylate groups provides multiple coordination sites to the metal catalyst. This enhances the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst's metal centers, improving catalytic activity and leading to high yield.

---

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) at the para position lead to high yield; those with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl) at the para position lead to low yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**: 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**: 4-methylbenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, strengthening coordination with the metal centers in the catalyst. This enhanced coordination improves catalytic efficiency and yield. Conversely, electron-donating groups decrease acidity, weakening metal coordination and reducing yield.

---

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) groups directly attached to the ring lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups can interfere with metal coordination by competing for coordination sites or participating in side reactions. This diminishes the catalyst's effectiveness and reduces yield.

---

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrocarbon chains (six carbons or more) without additional polar functional groups lead to high yield; the presence of additional polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) leads to low yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**: Octanoic acid

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Hydrophobic long-chain acids without polar groups may enhance interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or improve substrate accessibility, boosting reactivity. Additional polar groups may introduce unfavorable solvation effects or steric hindrance, interfering with effective coordination and lowering yield.

---

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (five carbons or fewer) containing terminal amino or thiol groups lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**: 5-aminopentanoic acid, 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Terminal amino or thiol groups close to the carboxylate can efficiently coordinate with the metal centers in the catalyst. This enhances catalyst-modifier interactions and improves catalytic performance, leading to high yield.

---

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen in the ring lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**: Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid), 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid, 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid

  **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings can serve as additional coordination sites for the metal centers in the catalyst. This strengthens catalyst-modifier interactions, enhancing catalytic activity and yielding higher product formation.

---

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers that contain pyridine rings connected to the carboxylic acid via flexible aliphatic chains lead to high yield; those connected via rigid aromatic rings lead to low yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**: 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Flexible aliphatic linkers allow the pyridine nitrogen to orient and coordinate effectively with the catalyst's metal centers. Rigid aromatic linkers prevent optimal alignment due to steric hindrance or reduced flexibility, diminishing coordination efficiency and lowering yield.

---

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms (e.g., indole ring in tryptophan) lead to high yield; those with aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms lead to low yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)

  **Explanation**: Heteroatoms in the aromatic side chain can coordinate with the metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity through additional interactions. Aromatic side chains without heteroatoms lack this coordinating ability and may hinder catalyst interactions, reducing yield.

---

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers that are carboxylic acids with perfluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid, 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Strong electron-withdrawing effects from fluorinated groups can decrease the basicity of coordinating atoms and destabilize catalyst-modifier interactions. This reduces the binding affinity to the metal centers, diminishing catalytic performance and yield.

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers that are sugar acids or carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons (polyhydroxy acids) lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

  **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous coordination sites and enhance solubility. This allows for extensive interactions and chelation with the catalyst's metal centers, improving catalytic efficiency and leading to high yield.

---

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a thiol group on a short chain lead to high yield; thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings lead to low yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Thiol groups on short aliphatic chains can form effective coordination with metal centers without deactivating the catalyst. Aromatic thiols may bind too strongly or interfere with catalytic sites due to their conjugated systems, reducing yield.

---

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers that are amide derivatives of carboxylic acids lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**: (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

  **Explanation**: Amide formation reduces the availability of lone pairs on nitrogen and oxygen atoms for coordination with metal centers. This decreases catalyst-modifier interactions, leading to reduced catalytic efficiency and lower yield.

---

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers with electron-donating groups attached via flexible aliphatic spacers lead to high yield; those directly attached to aromatic rings may lead to low yield due to decreased carboxylate acidity.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**: 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Aliphatic spacers attenuate the electron-donating effect on the carboxyl group, preserving its acidity and coordinating ability with metal centers. Direct attachment of electron-donating groups to the aromatic ring reduces carboxylate acidity and weakens metal coordination.

---

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino groups on long chains (more than six carbons) lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid

  **Explanation**: In long-chain amino acids, the amino group is distant from the carboxylate and may not effectively coordinate with the catalyst's metal centers. Additionally, the long hydrophilic chains can disrupt hydrophobic interactions or introduce steric hindrance, reducing catalytic efficiency and yield.

---

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers that contain both an aromatic ring and a flexible spacer to a coordinating group (e.g., hydroxy, amino) lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**: 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid

  **Explanation**: The flexible aliphatic spacer allows the coordinating group to adjust and effectively interact with the catalyst's metal centers while the aromatic ring can engage in π-π interactions. This combination enhances catalyst-modifier interactions, leading to improved catalytic performance and high yield.

Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**
- **Suggestion 1**: **Implement the `alpha_amino_acid_check` function for Rule 1**. This function should verify that the amino group is alpha (adjacent) to at least one of the carboxylic acid groups. You can achieve this by checking for an amino group connected to a carbon that is directly connected to a carbonyl carbon of a carboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Implement the `para_substituent_check` function for Rule 2**. This function should identify substituents at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid on an aromatic ring. It should determine if the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG) or an electron-donating group (EDG) and assign the prediction accordingly. Define lists of SMARTS patterns for common EWGs and EDGs to assist in this classification.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Generalize the `aromatic_ring` pattern**. Replace `'c1ccccc1'` with a more inclusive pattern like `'[c]'` or `'a'` to match any aromatic carbocycle, including substituted and heteroaromatic rings. This ensures that all aromatic systems are considered in the rule evaluations.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Refine the SMARTS patterns for functional groups**. Ensure that patterns like `aldehyde_group` accurately capture aldehyde functionalities attached directly to aromatic rings. For example, modify it to `'[CH]=[O]'` and combine it with an aromatic carbon atom in the pattern.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Implement chain length calculations for aliphatic chains in Rules 4 and 5**. Use RDKit's graph traversal methods to calculate the length of the longest continuous carbon chain. This will allow you to apply the rules based on the actual chain length rather than matching a fixed pattern.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Exclude the carboxylic acid oxygens from the `polar_group` pattern**. Modify the `polar_group` pattern to avoid matching atoms that are part of the carboxylic acid group, perhaps by specifying `'[O,N,S;!$(O=C[O,N,S])]`' to exclude these from consideration in Rule 4.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Define missing SMARTS patterns used in the rules**. For Rule 7, create a pattern `'pyridine_with_aliphatic_linker'` that identifies pyridine rings connected to carboxylic acids via aliphatic chains. Similarly, define `'heteroaromatic_ring'` for Rule 8 to detect heteroaromatic side chains in amino acids.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Expand the pattern for perfluorinated alkyl chains in Rule 9**. Include a pattern like `'[CX4]([F])([F])[F]'` for trifluoromethyl groups and `'[CX4]([F])[F]'` for difluoromethylene units to capture perfluorinated chains more comprehensively.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Enhance the `adjacent_hydroxyls` pattern for Rule 10**. Modify it to detect multiple hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons, possibly using a recursive SMARTS pattern like `'[C;H0][C;H0][C;H0][OX2H]'` to capture sugars and polyhydroxy acids more effectively.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Implement functions for additional checks and complex logic**. Beyond just pattern matching, some rules require more complex structural analysis (e.g., verifying flexible linkers or the position of functional groups). Implement these checks using RDKit's capabilities to navigate and analyze molecular structures.

- **Suggestion 11**: **Include Rules 11 to 15 in the code**. Define the necessary patterns and logic for these rules to ensure the feature matrix reflects all the provided rules.

- **Suggestion 12**: **Enhance error handling and reporting**. Add logging or print statements to report when a molecule does not match a rule and why. This will help in debugging and ensuring that the rules are applied correctly.

- **Suggestion 13**: **Validate SMARTS patterns with test molecules**. Before applying the patterns to the entire dataset, test them on example molecules to ensure they match the intended functional groups and structures.

- **Suggestion 14**: **Optimize performance by compiling patterns once**. Ensure that all SMARTS patterns are compiled before the loop over molecules to improve the efficiency of the code.

- **Suggestion 15**: **Consider stereochemistry where relevant**. For amino acids and chiral centers, include stereochemical considerations if they are important for the rules.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify and Quantify Rules Using Molecular Descriptors**

  Reformulate the rules to utilize quantifiable molecular descriptors that can be directly computed from SMILES strings. For example, replace qualitative terms like "electron-withdrawing groups" with specific descriptors such as Hammett sigma constants, electronegativity, or resonance effects. This will facilitate the generation of a numeric feature matrix. Implement descriptors such as:

  - **Functional Group Counts**: Number of carboxyl groups, amino groups, hydroxyl groups, etc.
  - **Electronic Descriptors**: Hammett constants, induction, and resonance effects.
  - **Topological Descriptors**: Molecular connectivity indices, aromatic ring counts.
  - **Geometric Descriptors**: Molecular flexibility indices, chain lengths.

- **Advice 2**: **Consolidate Overlapping Rules and Remove Redundancies**

  Review the current set of rules to identify and merge overlapping or similar rules. This will reduce complexity and improve clarity. For instance:

  - Combine Rules 1, 5, and 8, which all involve amino acids with coordinating groups, into a single rule focusing on modifiers with both carboxyl and amino groups within a specific spatial arrangement.
  - Merge Rules 2 and 13 related to electronic effects of substituents on aromatic carboxylic acids.

- **Advice 3**: **Create a Hierarchical Rule Framework**

  Develop a decision-tree structure for the rules to prioritize the most significant molecular features affecting yield. Start with broad classifications and narrow down to specific characteristics. For example:

  1. **Is the modifier an aliphatic or aromatic carboxylic acid?**
     - **Aliphatic**: Proceed to chain length and functional groups.
     - **Aromatic**: Evaluate substituents' electronic effects.

  2. **Assess the Presence of Coordinating Groups**
     - Amino, hydroxyl, thiol groups and their positions relative to the carboxyl group.

  This hierarchical approach will aid in systematically generating numerical features from the SMILES strings.

- **Advice 4**: **Incorporate Physicochemical Properties**

  Include molecular properties such as:

  - **Lipophilicity (Log P)**: Correlate hydrophobicity with yield, as seen in Rules 4 and 14.
  - **Molecular Weight and Size**: Larger molecules may have steric effects impacting yield.
  - **Polar Surface Area (PSA)**: Reflects the compound's ability to interact with the catalyst through hydrogen bonding or coordination.

  These properties can be computed from SMILES and provide quantitative data for modeling.

- **Advice 5**: **Standardize Functional Group Representation**

  Ensure that functional groups are consistently represented in the rules. For example, specify whether amino groups are primary, secondary, or tertiary, as their coordination abilities differ. This precision will improve the accuracy of numerical encoding.

- **Advice 6**: **Utilize Software Tools for Descriptor Calculation**

  Employ cheminformatics software (e.g., RDKit, Chemistry Development Kit) to automatically calculate molecular descriptors from SMILES. This will streamline the process of generating the numeric feature matrix and ensure consistency across modifiers.

- **Advice 7**: **Introduce New Rules Based on Data Analysis**

  Analyze the provided dataset to identify patterns not currently captured by existing rules. For instance:

  - **Chain Branching**: Determine if branched aliphatic acids impact yield differently than linear ones.
  - **Ring Size in Heterocycles**: Examine if five-membered rings perform differently than six-membered ones.

  Incorporate these findings into new, quantifiable rules.

- **Advice 8**: **Factor in Steric Hindrance and Flexibility**

  Modify rules to consider steric factors:

  - Quantify steric bulk using descriptors like Verloop parameters or molecular volume.
  - Assess molecular flexibility by calculating rotatable bonds.

  These factors can significantly influence the modifier's ability to coordinate with the catalyst.

- **Advice 9**: **Reevaluate and Clarify Ambiguous Rules**

  Some rules may benefit from clarification to avoid confusion. For example:

  - **Rule 11**: Differentiate the effects of thiol groups in various positions and contexts more precisely.
  - **Rule 15**: Provide clear definitions of "flexible spacers" (e.g., specific chain lengths).

- **Advice 10**: **Align Rules with Mechanistic Insights**

  Ensure that the rules reflect the underlying chemical mechanisms impacting yield. If certain functional groups enhance yield due to specific interactions with the catalyst, emphasize this in the rules and quantify accordingly.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (α-amino acids with two carboxylic acid groups) lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)  
  - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)

  **Explanation**: The presence of both an α-amino group and two carboxylate groups provides multiple coordination sites to the metal catalyst. This enhances the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst's metal centers, improving catalytic activity and leading to high yield.

---

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituents capable of coordinating to metal centers (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl groups) lead to high yield; those with non-coordinating electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl) lead to low yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - 4-aminobenzoic acid  
  - 4-nitrobenzoic acid  
  - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 4-methylbenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Para-substituents that can coordinate with metal centers enhance the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst, improving catalytic efficiency and yield. Non-coordinating electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening metal coordination and reducing yield.

---

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) groups attached directly to the ring lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - 4-formylbenzoic acid  
  - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups can interfere with metal coordination by competing for coordination sites or forming intramolecular hydrogen bonds, diminishing the catalyst's effectiveness and reducing yield.

---

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrocarbon chains (six carbons or more) without additional polar functional groups lead to high yield; the presence of additional polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) on long chains leads to low yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - Octanoic acid

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid  
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid  
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Hydrophobic long-chain acids may enhance interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or improve substrate accessibility, boosting reactivity. Additional polar groups on long chains can introduce unfavorable solvation effects or steric hindrance, interfering with effective coordination and lowering yield.

---

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (five carbons or fewer) containing terminal amino or thiol groups lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - 5-aminopentanoic acid  
  - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Terminal amino or thiol groups in close proximity to the carboxylate can efficiently coordinate with the metal centers in the catalyst. This enhances catalyst-modifier interactions and improves catalytic performance, leading to high yield.

---

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen directly in the aromatic ring (e.g., pyridine carboxylic acids) lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)  
  - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

  **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings act as additional coordination sites for the metal centers in the catalyst. This strengthens catalyst-modifier interactions, enhancing catalytic activity and yielding higher product formation.

---

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids with multiple nitrogen atoms lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid

  **Explanation**: Multiple nitrogen atoms in heterocyclic rings provide several coordination sites, enhancing interactions with the metal centers of the catalyst and improving yield.

---

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms (e.g., indole ring in tryptophan) lead to high yield; those with aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms (e.g., phenyl group in phenylalanine) lead to low yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)

  **Explanation**: Heteroatoms in the aromatic side chain can coordinate with the metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity through additional interactions. Aromatic side chains without heteroatoms lack this coordinating ability and may hinder catalyst interactions, reducing yield.

---

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers that are carboxylic acids with perfluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid  
  - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Strong electron-withdrawing effects from fluorinated groups can decrease the basicity of coordinating atoms and destabilize catalyst-modifier interactions. This reduces the binding affinity to the metal centers, diminishing catalytic performance and yield.

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers that are sugar acids or polyhydroxy carboxylic acids lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

  **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous coordination sites and enhance solubility. This allows for extensive interactions and chelation with the catalyst's metal centers, improving catalytic efficiency and leading to high yield.

---

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a thiol group on a short chain lead to high yield; thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings lead to low yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Thiol groups on short aliphatic chains can form effective coordination with metal centers without deactivating the catalyst. Aromatic thiols may bind too strongly or interfere with catalytic sites due to their conjugated systems, reducing yield.

---

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers that are amide derivatives of carboxylic acids lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid  
  - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

  **Explanation**: Amide formation reduces the availability of lone pairs on nitrogen and oxygen atoms for coordination with metal centers. This decreases catalyst-modifier interactions, leading to reduced catalytic efficiency and lower yield.

---

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating groups attached via flexible aliphatic chains lead to high yield; those connected via rigid aromatic rings lead to low yield due to steric hindrance.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Flexible aliphatic linkers allow the coordinating group (e.g., pyridine nitrogen) to orient and coordinate effectively with the catalyst's metal centers. Rigid aromatic linkers prevent optimal alignment due to steric hindrance or reduced flexibility, diminishing coordination efficiency and lowering yield.

---

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino groups on long chains (more than six carbons) lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid  
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid

  **Explanation**: In long-chain amino acids, the amino group is distant from the carboxylate and may not effectively coordinate with the catalyst's metal centers. Additionally, the long hydrophilic chains can disrupt hydrophobic interactions or introduce steric hindrance, reducing catalytic efficiency and yield.

---

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with substituents capable of forming intramolecular hydrogen bonds (e.g., hydroxyl groups ortho to the carboxyl group) may lead to low yield due to reduced availability of coordination sites.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Intramolecular hydrogen bonding can sequester functional groups that would otherwise coordinate with the catalyst's metal centers. This reduces catalyst-modifier interactions and lowers yield.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (α-amino acids with two carboxylic acid groups) lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)  
  - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)

  **Explanation**: The presence of both an α-amino group and two carboxylate groups provides multiple coordination sites to the metal catalyst. This enhances the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst's metal centers, improving catalytic activity and leading to high yield.

---

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituents capable of coordinating to metal centers (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl groups) lead to high yield; those with non-coordinating electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl) lead to low yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - 4-aminobenzoic acid  
  - 4-nitrobenzoic acid  
  - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 4-methylbenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Para-substituents that can coordinate with metal centers enhance the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst, improving catalytic efficiency and yield. Non-coordinating electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening metal coordination and reducing yield.

---

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) groups attached directly to the ring lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - 4-formylbenzoic acid  
  - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups can interfere with metal coordination by competing for coordination sites or forming intramolecular hydrogen bonds, diminishing the catalyst's effectiveness and reducing yield.

---

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrocarbon chains (six carbons or more) without additional polar functional groups lead to high yield; the presence of additional polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) on long chains leads to low yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - Octanoic acid

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid  
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid  
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Hydrophobic long-chain acids may enhance interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or improve substrate accessibility, boosting reactivity. Additional polar groups on long chains can introduce unfavorable solvation effects or steric hindrance, interfering with effective coordination and lowering yield.

---

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (five carbons or fewer) containing terminal amino or thiol groups lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - 5-aminopentanoic acid  
  - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Terminal amino or thiol groups in close proximity to the carboxylate can efficiently coordinate with the metal centers in the catalyst. This enhances catalyst-modifier interactions and improves catalytic performance, leading to high yield.

---

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen directly in the aromatic ring (e.g., pyridine carboxylic acids) lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)  
  - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

  **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings act as additional coordination sites for the metal centers in the catalyst. This strengthens catalyst-modifier interactions, enhancing catalytic activity and yielding higher product formation.

---

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids with multiple nitrogen atoms lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid

  **Explanation**: Multiple nitrogen atoms in heterocyclic rings provide several coordination sites, enhancing interactions with the metal centers of the catalyst and improving yield.

---

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms (e.g., indole ring in tryptophan) lead to high yield; those with aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms (e.g., phenyl group in phenylalanine) lead to low yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)

  **Explanation**: Heteroatoms in the aromatic side chain can coordinate with the metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity through additional interactions. Aromatic side chains without heteroatoms lack this coordinating ability and may hinder catalyst interactions, reducing yield.

---

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers that are carboxylic acids with perfluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid  
  - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Strong electron-withdrawing effects from fluorinated groups can decrease the basicity of coordinating atoms and destabilize catalyst-modifier interactions. This reduces the binding affinity to the metal centers, diminishing catalytic performance and yield.

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers that are sugar acids or polyhydroxy carboxylic acids lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

  **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous coordination sites and enhance solubility. This allows for extensive interactions and chelation with the catalyst's metal centers, improving catalytic efficiency and leading to high yield.

---

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a thiol group on a short chain lead to high yield; thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings lead to low yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Thiol groups on short aliphatic chains can form effective coordination with metal centers without deactivating the catalyst. Aromatic thiols may bind too strongly or interfere with catalytic sites due to their conjugated systems, reducing yield.

---

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers that are amide derivatives of carboxylic acids lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid  
  - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

  **Explanation**: Amide formation reduces the availability of lone pairs on nitrogen and oxygen atoms for coordination with metal centers. This decreases catalyst-modifier interactions, leading to reduced catalytic efficiency and lower yield.

---

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating groups attached via flexible aliphatic chains lead to high yield; those connected via rigid aromatic rings lead to low yield due to steric hindrance.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Flexible aliphatic linkers allow the coordinating group (e.g., pyridine nitrogen) to orient and coordinate effectively with the catalyst's metal centers. Rigid aromatic linkers prevent optimal alignment due to steric hindrance or reduced flexibility, diminishing coordination efficiency and lowering yield.

---

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino groups on long chains (more than six carbons) lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid  
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid

  **Explanation**: In long-chain amino acids, the amino group is distant from the carboxylate and may not effectively coordinate with the catalyst's metal centers. Additionally, the long hydrophilic chains can disrupt hydrophobic interactions or introduce steric hindrance, reducing catalytic efficiency and yield.

---

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with substituents capable of forming intramolecular hydrogen bonds (e.g., hydroxyl groups ortho to the carboxyl group) may lead to low yield due to reduced availability of coordination sites.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Intramolecular hydrogen bonding can sequester functional groups that would otherwise coordinate with the catalyst's metal centers. This reduces catalyst-modifier interactions and lowers yield.

**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: **Generalize the 'aromatic_carboxylic_acid' SMARTS pattern.** The current pattern `'c1ccc(cc1)C(=O)O'` is too specific and may not match all aromatic carboxylic acids, especially those with substitutions on different positions of the ring. Replace it with a more inclusive pattern like `'c[c;H1]c[c;H1]c[c;H1]C(=O)O'` or even `'c1ccccc1C(=O)O'` to capture various substituted benzoic acids.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Improve detection of para-substituents for Rule 2.** The current code may not accurately identify para-substituents capable of coordinating to metal centers. Implement a method to locate the carboxyl group on the aromatic ring and then check for coordinating groups at the para position relative to it. This can be done by identifying the aromatic ring system and analyzing the relative positions of substituents using atom indices and bond connectivity.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Modify the 'long_aliphatic_chain' pattern in Rule 4 to match chains of six or more carbons.** The current pattern `'[CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2]'` only matches chains with exactly six carbons. Use a recursive SMARTS pattern or repetition quantifiers to match chains of six or more carbons, such as `'[CH2]{$,}'` (where `$` is the minimum number of repetitions, e.g., `'[CH2]{6,}'`).

- **Suggestion 4**: **Expand the 'polar_groups_on_long_chain' patterns in Rule 4.** Currently, only hydroxyl and amino groups are considered. Add patterns for other polar functional groups like thiol (`'[SX2H]'`), halogens (`'[F,Cl,Br,I]'`), and others that may affect polarity. Ensure these patterns are applied to the aliphatic chain specifically.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Generalize patterns for heteroaromatic and heterocyclic carboxylic acids in Rules 6 and 7.** The patterns `'[nH]1cccc1C(=O)O'` and `'n1nccc1C(=O)O'` are too specific and may miss other heterocycles. Use more general patterns like `'*1[n,nH][n,nH][n,nH][n,nH][n,nH]1C(=O)O'` for five-membered heteroaromatic rings with nitrogens, or consider using substructure searches that identify rings with the required heteroatoms.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Revise the patterns for amino acids with aromatic side chains in Rule 8.** The current patterns may not match all relevant amino acids. Use a more flexible approach by detecting amino acids with side chains containing aromatic rings with or without heteroatoms. You can identify the backbone of amino acids and then examine the side chain properties separately.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Improve the 'perfluorinated_chain' pattern in Rule 9.** The existing pattern may not capture all perfluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups. Use a pattern like `'[CX4]([F])[F][F]'` to detect trifluoromethyl groups and include variations to match longer perfluorinated chains, such as `'[CX4]([F])([F])[CX4]([F])([F])[F]'`.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Distinguish between flexible and rigid linkers in Rule 13 more effectively.** Analyze the connectivity between the carboxylic acid and the coordinating group to determine if the linker is aliphatic (flexible) or aromatic (rigid). Use SMARTS patterns to identify aliphatic chains (`'[CX4][CX4][CX4]'`) between functional groups and aromatic linkers (`'c'` atoms connected directly).

- **Suggestion 9**: **Enhance the detection of intramolecular hydrogen bonds in Rule 15.** The current pattern `'c1cc(O)ccc1C(=O)O'` may not capture all molecules capable of forming intramolecular hydrogen bonds. Use more generalized patterns to find ortho-substituted phenolic carboxylic acids, and consider using cheminformatics tools to predict hydrogen bond formation based on geometry.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Implement comprehensive unit tests for each rule's SMARTS patterns.** Before applying the patterns to the full dataset, test them on known compounds (both positive and negative examples) to ensure they correctly identify matching and non-matching structures. This will help validate the accuracy of each pattern and identify any gaps or errors.

**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

**Overview**

The current iteration's metrics provide insight into the effectiveness of the existing rules in predicting high yields in the catalytic problem. By comparing these metrics to the previous reference metrics, we can assess whether there has been improvement, stagnation, or decline in rule performance. The focus on **confidence** and **lift** is crucial, as these metrics indicate the predictive reliability and the strength of the association between the rule conditions and the high yield outcome.

---

**Comparison with Previous Metrics**

1. **Train Support**

   - **Previous Metrics**: 0.1667 and 0.1845
   - **Current Metrics**:
     - 0.0336
     - 0.1349
     - 0.0686
     - **Final Iteration**: 0.0171
   - **Comment**: The train support in the current rules is generally lower than in the previous metrics. This suggests that the current rules apply to a smaller portion of the training data. While low support can indicate that the rules are more specific and potentially targeting niche but important subsets, it may also limit the overall applicability of the rules.

2. **Train Confidence**

   - **Previous Metrics**: 0.6352 and 0.5396
   - **Current Metrics**:
     - 0.6961
     - 0.6457
     - **Peak**: 0.7714
     - **Final Iteration**: 0.6333
   - **Comment**: The confidence in the current rules initially increased, peaking at 0.7714, before decreasing slightly in the final iteration. Overall, the confidence values are comparable to or higher than the previous metrics, indicating that when the rule conditions are met, there is a relatively high probability of achieving a high yield. The slight decrease in the final iteration may suggest that adding new rules or modifying existing ones did not further enhance predictive reliability.

3. **Train Lift**

   - **Previous Metrics**: 1.2048 and 1.0559
   - **Current Metrics**:
     - 1.4058
     - 1.2966
     - **Peak**: 1.5538
     - **Final Iteration**: 1.2671
   - **Comment**: The lift values in the current iteration are consistently above those in the previous metrics, with a peak at 1.5538. Lift values greater than 1 indicate that the rule has a positive association with the high yield outcome, and higher values represent stronger associations. The decrease in lift in the final iteration mirrors the trend observed in confidence, suggesting that recent changes may not have strengthened the association between rule conditions and outcomes.

---

**Assessment of Iterations and Local Minimum**

- **Positive Trends**: The initial increases in confidence and lift suggest that earlier iterations were effective in improving the rules' predictive capabilities.
- **Peak Performance**: The third iteration represents a peak in both confidence (0.7714) and lift (1.5538), indicating the strongest predictive performance achieved during this cycle.
- **Decline in Final Iteration**: The decrease in both confidence and lift in the final iteration suggests that the adjustments made may have led to overfitting or introduced less effective rules.
- **Local Minimum**: The decline after a peak could indicate that a local maximum in rule performance has been reached. Further iterations without significant changes to the approach may not yield better results and could potentially degrade performance.

---

**Suggestions for Improving Current Rules**

1. **Re-evaluate Recent Rule Additions**

   - **Analysis**: The decrease in performance metrics in the final iteration implies that new or modified rules may not be contributing positively.
   - **Action**: Review the most recently added rules (e.g., Rules 13-15) to assess their individual impact on the metrics. Consider whether these rules are too specific, conflicting with existing rules, or not aligned with the underlying chemistry.

2. **Focus on High-Impact Rules**

   - **Analysis**: Rules that contributed to the peak performance (prior to the final iteration) should be identified and prioritized.
   - **Action**: Emphasize and possibly refine the rules that were present during the third iteration to maintain high confidence and lift.

3. **Increase Rule Support**

   - **Analysis**: Low support means the rules apply to a limited number of cases, which may limit their usefulness.
   - **Action**: Generalize certain rules where appropriate to cover a larger portion of the dataset without significantly compromising confidence and lift. For example, combining similar rules or broadening the criteria slightly.

4. **Validate with Test Data**

   - **Analysis**: The previous metrics include test support, confidence, and lift, which are essential for evaluating the generalizability of the rules.
   - **Action**: Calculate the current metrics on test data to ensure that the rules perform well on unseen data. High training metrics with low test metrics can indicate overfitting.

5. **Simplify Overly Complex Rules**

   - **Analysis**: Complex rules with many conditions may not generalize well and can contribute to overfitting.
   - **Action**: Simplify rules where possible, focusing on the most impactful molecular features that contribute to high yield.

6. **Incorporate Domain Knowledge**

   - **Analysis**: Utilizing chemical intuition and understanding of the catalytic process can help in formulating more effective rules.
   - **Action**: Reassess the rules in the context of chemical principles. For instance, consider whether certain functional groups consistently enhance or hinder catalytic activity and adjust the rules accordingly.

7. **Identify and Resolve Conflicting Rules**

   - **Analysis**: Conflicting rules can confuse the model and reduce overall performance.
   - **Action**: Review the rules to identify any contradictions or overlaps. Ensure that rules are consistent and mutually supportive.

8. **Regularize Rule Complexity**

   - **Analysis**: Balancing the specificity and generality of rules is crucial.
   - **Action**: Implement regularization techniques, such as penalizing overly complex rules, to prevent overfitting and promote generalizability.

---

**Conclusion**

The current set of rules shows promising predictive capabilities, with higher confidence and lift compared to previous iterations. However, the decrease in these metrics during the final iteration suggests that the model may have reached a local maximum in performance, and recent changes may not be beneficial.

By focusing on the following, we can improve the rules:

- **Refinement**: Adjust or remove rules that do not contribute positively to the metrics.
- **Generalization**: Increase the applicability of rules to cover more data without losing predictive power.
- **Validation**: Use test data to ensure that improvements in training metrics translate to better generalization.
- **Domain Expertise**: Leverage chemical knowledge to guide rule development and ensure alignment with known catalytic behavior.

Continued iteration with careful monitoring of the metrics, particularly confidence and lift, and a focus on the quality rather than the quantity of rules, will likely lead to improved performance and a more robust model.

**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

Based on the latest training results, the performance of the current set of rules shows some areas for improvement when compared to the reference metrics. The reference validation accuracies were consistently around 0.76 with test accuracies ranging from 0.625 to 0.75. In the current iteration:

- **Current 5-Fold Validation Accuracy**: 0.6857

This validation accuracy is lower than the reference baseline, indicating that the model's ability to generalize is not as strong with the current rules. The fluctuation in validation accuracies across iterations (e.g., 0.6286, 0.7714, 0.7143, and now 0.6857) suggests inconsistency in the model's performance.

**Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting**

The decrease in validation accuracy compared to the baseline suggests potential underfitting. The model may not be capturing all the relevant patterns in the data due to inadequacies in the current rules. Alternatively, the variations in accuracy across iterations could indicate that the model is overfitting to specific features captured by certain rules, thus not generalizing well to unseen data.

**Analysis Based on SHAP Values**

The SHAP analysis provides valuable insights into which rules are contributing most significantly to the model's predictions, particularly in cases where there is a discrepancy between predicted and experimental values.

- **Overestimation Cases**: Instances where the model predicts high loading but the experimental value is low.
  - **Example Molecules**:
    - **C(=O)(C(C(C(C(F)(F)F)(F)F)(F)F)(F)F)O**
    - **C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O**
    - **C(CCCC(=O)O)CCCN**
  - **Contributing Rules**:
    - **Rule 3**: SHAP values around 0.0448
    - **Rule 12**: SHAP values around 0.0900

- **Underestimation Cases**: Instances where the model predicts low loading but the experimental value is high.
  - In the current iteration, there are fewer clear examples of underestimation, but previous iterations showed discrepancies where certain rules contributed negatively to high loading predictions for molecules that should have been predicted as high.

**Interpretation of SHAP Analysis**

- **Rule 3**: Designed to predict low yield for modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups attached directly to the ring.
  - **Issue Identified**: Despite its intention, Rule 3 is contributing positively to high loading predictions in overestimation cases.
  - **Implication**: Rule 3 may not be accurately capturing the impact of aldehyde groups or may be too broadly defined, leading to incorrect application.

- **Rule 12**: Pertains to modifiers that are amide derivatives of carboxylic acids, which should lead to low yield.
  - **Issue Identified**: Rule 12 is contributing significantly to high loading predictions where the experimental values are low.
  - **Implication**: The rule may be misclassified in terms of its expected impact on yield or might be incorrectly applied to certain molecular structures.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

1. **Refine Rule 3**:
   - **Action**: Reevaluate the structural criteria of Rule 3 to ensure it correctly identifies modifiers with aldehyde groups that indeed lead to low yield.
   - **Suggestion**: Incorporate additional conditional logic to prevent Rule 3 from being applied to molecules where the aldehyde group's influence is mitigated by other functional groups or structural features.

2. **Adjust Rule 12**:
   - **Action**: Modify Rule 12 to enhance its specificity, ensuring it accurately predicts low yield for amide derivatives without contributing to high loading predictions erroneously.
   - **Suggestion**: Examine the dataset for modifiers incorrectly influenced by Rule 12 and adjust the rule to exclude cases where amide groups do not adversely affect loading.

3. **Improve Generalization**:
   - **Action**: Introduce additional rules or modify existing ones to cover molecular features not currently captured, thereby reducing underfitting.
   - **Suggestion**: Analyze misclassified molecules for common features not addressed by existing rules and develop new rules to encompass these characteristics.

4. **Address Overfitting**:
   - **Action**: Simplify overly complex rules that may be causing the model to overfit to specific training data.
   - **Suggestion**: Regularize the influence of certain rules by adjusting their weighting or modifying their scope to prevent them from dominating the model's predictions.

5. **Use SHAP Insights for Iterative Refinement**:
   - **Action**: Systematically review rules with high positive SHAP values in overestimation cases and high negative SHAP values in underestimation cases.
   - **Suggestion**: For each problematic rule, assess its impact on misclassified molecules and refine it to improve predictive accuracy.

6. **Ensure Correct Rule Application**:
   - **Action**: Verify that rules are being applied only to appropriate molecules.
   - **Suggestion**: Implement stricter conditions or additional checks within rules to prevent misapplication.

7. **Increase Dataset Diversity**:
   - **Action**: Expand the dataset to include a wider variety of modifiers.
   - **Suggestion**: Incorporate more examples, especially those that challenge existing rules, to improve the model's learning and generalization capabilities.

8. **Cross-Validation Consistency**:
   - **Action**: Ensure consistent performance across different validation folds.
   - **Suggestion**: Investigate variations in fold performance to identify potential issues with data splitting or rule applicability.

**Conclusion**

The current rules have some predictive power but are insufficiently accurate compared to the reference baseline. By refining Rules 3 and 12, improving generalization, and leveraging insights from SHAP analysis, the model's performance can be enhanced. Iterative refinement and careful validation are essential to develop a robust set of rules that accurately predict modifier loading on catalysts.

**Summary of Discussions and Suggestions for Improving Current Rules**

---

**Overview**

The primary goal is to optimize the yield of a radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction of aliphatic alcohols. The reaction utilizes various molecular modifiers that impact key parameters such as modifier/SBU loading, Fe/Hf fraction, and Fe loading, which in turn affect the yield.

Analysis of the current rules and their performance metrics has revealed areas where the rules could be improved to enhance predictive accuracy and generalizability without overfitting. The key observations are:

- **Variable Performance Metrics**: The current rules show fluctuating validation accuracies and inconsistent confidence and lift values. While some rules exhibit high confidence and lift, they often have low support, limiting their applicability.

- **SHAP Analysis Insights**: SHAP values indicate that certain rules may not be accurately capturing the relationship between molecular features and yield. Specifically, Rules 3 and 12 are contributing to mispredictions, as they sometimes positively influence predictions of high yield for modifiers that experimentally result in low yield.

---

**Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

1. **Generalize SMARTS Patterns for Broader Applicability**

   - **Issue**: Several SMARTS patterns used in the rules are too specific, causing low support and missing relevant compounds.
   - **Action**: 
     - **Rule 2**: Replace the specific pattern for aromatic carboxylic acids with a more general one, such as `'c1ccccc1C(=O)O'`, to capture a wider range of substituted benzoic acids.
     - **Rule 4**: Modify the pattern to match aliphatic chains of six or more carbons using repetition quantifiers, e.g., `'[CH2]{6,}'`.

2. **Enhance Detection of Functional Groups and Substituents**

   - **Issue**: Current rules may not accurately identify para-substituents capable of coordinating to metal centers or may miss other important functional groups.
   - **Action**: 
     - **Rule 2**: Implement a method to detect coordinating groups at the para position relative to the carboxyl group by analyzing ring substituents' positions.
     - **Rule 4**: Expand patterns to include other polar groups like thiols and halogens that may affect polarity and coordination.

3. **Refine Rules Based on SHAP Analysis**

   - **Issue**: Rules 3 and 12 are contributing to incorrect predictions.
   - **Action**:
     - **Rule 3**: Reevaluate the structural criteria to ensure it correctly identifies modifiers with aldehyde groups that lead to low yield. Adjust the rule to prevent misapplication to compounds where aldehyde groups do not interfere with metal coordination.
     - **Rule 12**: Increase specificity by defining the types of amide derivatives that reduce yield and exclude cases where amide groups do not adversely affect catalyst interaction.

4. **Generalize Heteroaromatic and Heterocyclic Patterns**

   - **Issue**: Rules 6 and 7 may miss modifiers due to overly specific patterns.
   - **Action**: Use more inclusive SMARTS patterns to detect a broader range of heterocycles with nitrogen atoms. For example, identify any five- or six-membered aromatic rings containing nitrogen atoms adjacent to a carboxylic acid group.

5. **Differentiate Between Flexible and Rigid Linkers**

   - **Issue**: Rule 13 needs better distinction between flexible aliphatic and rigid aromatic linkers.
   - **Action**: Analyze the connectivity between functional groups to determine linker flexibility. Use SMARTS patterns to identify aliphatic chains (e.g., `'[CX4][CX4][CX4]'`) and aromatic connections (e.g., direct connections between aromatic carbon atoms).

6. **Improve Detection of Intramolecular Interactions**

   - **Issue**: Rule 15 may not capture all compounds capable of forming intramolecular hydrogen bonds.
   - **Action**: Develop patterns that identify ortho-substituted phenolic carboxylic acids more generally. Consider employing computational tools to predict hydrogen bond formation based on molecular geometry.

7. **Increase Rule Support Without Compromising Confidence**

   - **Issue**: Low support limits the impact of some rules.
   - **Action**: Generalize rules where appropriate to include more compounds. For example, broaden criteria to encompass more functional groups or structural motifs that are chemically similar and relevant.

8. **Implement Comprehensive Validation and Testing**

   - **Issue**: Potential overfitting and inconsistent performance across validation folds.
   - **Action**: 
     - Use cross-validation consistently and examine the performance in each fold to identify variability.
     - Validate rules against test data to ensure they generalize well to unseen compounds.
     - Conduct unit tests for each rule's SMARTS patterns with known positive and negative examples.

9. **Simplify Complex Rules to Prevent Overfitting**

   - **Issue**: Overly complex rules may capture noise rather than meaningful patterns.
   - **Action**: Review and simplify rules by focusing on the most impactful molecular features. Remove or revise rules that are too specific or have minimal support and confidence.

10. **Leverage Chemical Domain Knowledge**

    - **Issue**: Some rules may not align well with established chemical principles.
    - **Action**: Reassess all rules in the context of chemical reactivity and coordination chemistry. Consult literature or experts to ensure that the rules are grounded in sound chemical reasoning.

---

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

There is significant potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. By generalizing SMARTS patterns, refining rules based on SHAP analysis, and ensuring the rules are underpinned by chemical knowledge, we can improve the model's predictive performance and generalizability. Simplifying overly complex rules and validating them thoroughly will help prevent overfitting.

    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (α-amino acids with two carboxylic acid groups) lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)  
  - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)

  **Explanation**: The presence of both an α-amino group and two carboxylate groups provides multiple coordination sites to the metal catalyst. This enhances the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst's metal centers, improving catalytic activity and leading to high yield.

---

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituents capable of coordinating to metal centers (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl groups) lead to high yield; those with non-coordinating electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl) lead to low yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - 4-aminobenzoic acid  
  - 4-nitrobenzoic acid  
  - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 4-methylbenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Para-substituents that can coordinate with metal centers enhance the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst, improving catalytic efficiency and yield. Non-coordinating electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening metal coordination and reducing yield.

---

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) groups attached directly to the ring lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - 4-formylbenzoic acid  
  - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups can interfere with metal coordination by competing for coordination sites or forming intramolecular hydrogen bonds, diminishing the catalyst's effectiveness and reducing yield.

---

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrocarbon chains (six carbons or more) without additional polar functional groups lead to high yield; the presence of additional polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) on long chains leads to low yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - Octanoic acid

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid  
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid  
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Hydrophobic long-chain acids may enhance interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or improve substrate accessibility, boosting reactivity. Additional polar groups on long chains can introduce unfavorable solvation effects or steric hindrance, interfering with effective coordination and lowering yield.

---

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (five carbons or fewer) containing terminal amino or thiol groups lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - 5-aminopentanoic acid  
  - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Terminal amino or thiol groups in close proximity to the carboxylate can efficiently coordinate with the metal centers in the catalyst. This enhances catalyst-modifier interactions and improves catalytic performance, leading to high yield.

---

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen directly in the aromatic ring (e.g., pyridine carboxylic acids) lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)  
  - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

  **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings act as additional coordination sites for the metal centers in the catalyst. This strengthens catalyst-modifier interactions, enhancing catalytic activity and yielding higher product formation.

---

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids with multiple nitrogen atoms lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid

  **Explanation**: Multiple nitrogen atoms in heterocyclic rings provide several coordination sites, enhancing interactions with the metal centers of the catalyst and improving yield.

---

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms (e.g., indole ring in tryptophan) lead to high yield; those with aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms (e.g., phenyl group in phenylalanine) lead to low yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)

  **Explanation**: Heteroatoms in the aromatic side chain can coordinate with the metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity through additional interactions. Aromatic side chains without heteroatoms lack this coordinating ability and may hinder catalyst interactions, reducing yield.

---

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers that are carboxylic acids with perfluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid  
  - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Strong electron-withdrawing effects from fluorinated groups can decrease the basicity of coordinating atoms and destabilize catalyst-modifier interactions. This reduces the binding affinity to the metal centers, diminishing catalytic performance and yield.

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers that are sugar acids or polyhydroxy carboxylic acids lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

  **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous coordination sites and enhance solubility. This allows for extensive interactions and chelation with the catalyst's metal centers, improving catalytic efficiency and leading to high yield.

---

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a thiol group on a short chain lead to high yield; thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings lead to low yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Thiol groups on short aliphatic chains can form effective coordination with metal centers without deactivating the catalyst. Aromatic thiols may bind too strongly or interfere with catalytic sites due to their conjugated systems, reducing yield.

---

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers that are amide derivatives of carboxylic acids lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid  
  - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

  **Explanation**: Amide formation reduces the availability of lone pairs on nitrogen and oxygen atoms for coordination with metal centers. This decreases catalyst-modifier interactions, leading to reduced catalytic efficiency and lower yield.

---

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating groups attached via flexible aliphatic chains lead to high yield; those connected via rigid aromatic rings lead to low yield due to steric hindrance.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Flexible aliphatic linkers allow the coordinating group (e.g., pyridine nitrogen) to orient and coordinate effectively with the catalyst's metal centers. Rigid aromatic linkers prevent optimal alignment due to steric hindrance or reduced flexibility, diminishing coordination efficiency and lowering yield.

---

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino groups on long chains (more than six carbons) lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid  
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid

  **Explanation**: In long-chain amino acids, the amino group is distant from the carboxylate and may not effectively coordinate with the catalyst's metal centers. Additionally, the long hydrophilic chains can disrupt hydrophobic interactions or introduce steric hindrance, reducing catalytic efficiency and yield.

---

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with substituents capable of forming intramolecular hydrogen bonds (e.g., hydroxyl groups ortho to the carboxyl group) may lead to low yield due to reduced availability of coordination sites.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Intramolecular hydrogen bonding can sequester functional groups that would otherwise coordinate with the catalyst's metal centers. This reduces catalyst-modifier interactions and lowers yield.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Generalize SMARTS Patterns to Increase Rule Support**

  - **Action**: Modify overly specific SMARTS patterns in the rules to capture a broader range of relevant compounds, thus increasing support without sacrificing confidence.
  - **Example**:
    - For **Rule 2** (aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituents), replace the specific pattern with a more general one: `[cH]1[cH][cH][cH][cH][cH]1C(=O)O` or `c1ccc(cc1)C(=O)O`. This pattern captures substituted benzoic acids more effectively.
    - For **Rule 4** (long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids), use repetition quantifiers to define long hydrocarbon chains: `C(=O)OCCCCCC` or `C(=O)O[CH2]{6,}`, matching chains with six or more carbons.

- **Advice 2**: **Enhance Detection of Para-Substituted Coordinating Groups**

  - **Action**: Refine **Rule 2** to accurately detect para-substituents capable of coordinating to metal centers by specifying the position of substituents.
  - **Example**:
    - Use SMARTS patterns that identify substituents at the para position relative to the carboxyl group, such as `c1cc(ccc1C(=O)O)[NX3;H2]` for para-amino benzoic acid or `c1cc(ccc1C(=O)O)[Br]` for para-bromo benzoic acid.

- **Advice 3**: **Refine Rules Based on SHAP Analysis to Correct Misclassifications**

  - **Action**: Adjust **Rule 3** and **Rule 12** to eliminate mispredictions indicated by SHAP analysis.
    - **Rule 3**: Ensure the SMARTS pattern for aldehyde-containing aromatic carboxylic acids only matches compounds where the aldehyde group interferes with metal coordination.
      - **Example**: Use a pattern like `c1cc(ccc1C(=O)O)C=O` to match aldehyde groups directly attached to the aromatic ring adjacent to the carboxyl.
    - **Rule 12**: Increase specificity for amide derivatives that reduce yield by focusing on amides where the amide group affects coordination.
      - **Example**: Use a pattern like `C(=O)N[C;!$(C(=O))]` to exclude amides where the nitrogen is unavailable for coordination due to resonance stabilization.

- **Advice 4**: **Generalize Heteroaromatic and Heterocyclic Patterns**

  - **Action**: Modify **Rule 6** and **Rule 7** to use inclusive SMARTS patterns that detect a wider range of nitrogen-containing heterocycles adjacent to carboxyl groups.
  - **Example**:
    - Use patterns like `[nH]1cccc1C(=O)O` for pyridine carboxylic acids.
    - For multiple nitrogen atoms, use patterns like `n1nccc1C(=O)O` to match pyrazole carboxylic acids.

- **Advice 5**: **Differentiate Flexible Aliphatic and Rigid Aromatic Linkers**

  - **Action**: In **Rule 13**, distinguish between flexible and rigid linkers by analyzing the connectivity and flexibility of the linker between the carboxyl group and coordinating substituent.
  - **Example**:
    - Flexible linker pattern: `C(=O)OCCCN` (aliphatic chain connecting to a nitrogen-containing group).
    - Rigid linker pattern: `C(=O)Oc1ccc(cc1)[N,O,S]` (aromatic ring directly connecting the carboxyl and coordinating group).

- **Advice 6**: **Improve Detection of Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonds**

  - **Action**: Enhance **Rule 15** by developing SMARTS patterns that identify ortho-hydroxyl groups capable of forming intramolecular hydrogen bonds with the carboxyl group.
  - **Example**:
    - Use a pattern like `c1c(O)cc(cc1)C(=O)O` with the hydroxyl group ortho to the carboxylate.

- **Advice 7**: **Increase Rule Support by Broadening Functional Group Criteria**

  - **Action**: Expand rules to include additional relevant functional groups, increasing support while maintaining confidence.
  - **Example**:
    - In **Rule 4**, include modifiers with polar groups such as halogens or ethers: `C(=O)OCCCC[O,N,Cl,Br,I]` to capture long-chain acids with additional polar substituents that may still lead to high yield.

- **Advice 8**: **Simplify Complex Rules to Prevent Overfitting**

  - **Action**: Review complex rules and simplify them by focusing on key structural features that significantly impact yield.
  - **Example**:
    - For rules with multiple conditions, identify the most critical functional groups and remove less impactful criteria, ensuring the rule remains general yet meaningful.

- **Advice 9**: **Implement Comprehensive Validation and Testing**

  - **Action**: Employ rigorous cross-validation and unit testing for each rule to assess performance and generalizability.
  - **Example**:
    - Perform k-fold cross-validation for the entire rule set and analyze performance metrics across folds to detect variability.
    - Create test cases for each SMARTS pattern with known high and low-yield modifiers to verify correct classification.

- **Advice 10**: **Align Rules with Chemical Domain Knowledge**

  - **Action**: Reevaluate all rules to ensure they are consistent with established chemical principles and coordination chemistry.
  - **Example**:
    - Consult literature on metal coordination preferences, ligand effects, and catalytic mechanisms to adjust rules accordingly.
    - Ensure rules account for steric and electronic factors influencing metal-ligand interactions.

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen in the aromatic ring lead to high yield; those connected via rigid aromatic linkages lead to low yield due to steric hindrance.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)  
  - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid  
  - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings act as additional coordination sites for the metal centers in the catalyst. This strengthens catalyst-modifier interactions, enhancing catalytic activity and yielding higher product formation. Rigid aromatic linkers prevent optimal alignment due to steric hindrance, diminishing coordination efficiency and lowering yield.

---

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms (e.g., indole ring in tryptophan) lead to high yield; those with aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms (e.g., phenyl group in phenylalanine) lead to low yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)

  **Explanation**: Heteroatoms in the aromatic side chain can coordinate with the metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity through additional interactions. Aromatic side chains without heteroatoms lack this coordinating ability and may hinder catalyst interactions, reducing yield.

---

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers that are perfluorinated carboxylic acids or contain trifluoromethyl groups lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid  
  - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Strong electron-withdrawing effects from fluorinated groups can decrease the basicity of coordinating atoms and destabilize catalyst-modifier interactions. This reduces the binding affinity to the metal centers, diminishing catalytic performance and yield.

---

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers that are sugar acids or polyhydroxy carboxylic acids lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

  **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous coordination sites and enhance solubility. This allows for extensive interactions and chelation with the catalyst's metal centers, improving catalytic efficiency and leading to high yield.

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers that are amide derivatives of carboxylic acids lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid  
  - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

  **Explanation**: Amide formation reduces the availability of lone pairs on nitrogen and oxygen atoms for coordination with metal centers. This decreases catalyst-modifier interactions, leading to reduced catalytic efficiency and lower yield.

---

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with substituents capable of forming intramolecular hydrogen bonds (e.g., hydroxyl groups ortho to the carboxyl group) lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Intramolecular hydrogen bonding can sequester functional groups that would otherwise coordinate with the catalyst's metal centers. This reduces catalyst-modifier interactions and lowers yield.

---

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers with thiol groups on short aliphatic chains lead to high yield; thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings lead to low yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Thiol groups on short aliphatic chains can form effective coordination with metal centers without deactivating the catalyst. Aromatic thiols may bind too strongly or interfere with catalytic sites due to their conjugated systems, reducing yield.

---

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted flexible aliphatic chains containing coordinating groups lead to high yield; those connected via rigid aromatic rings lead to low yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Flexible aliphatic linkers allow the coordinating group (e.g., pyridine nitrogen) to orient and coordinate effectively with the catalyst's metal centers. Rigid aromatic linkers prevent optimal alignment due to steric hindrance or reduced flexibility, diminishing coordination efficiency and lowering yield.

---

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino or hydroxyl groups on long chains (more than six carbons) lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid  
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid  
  - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid

  **Explanation**: In long-chain amino or hydroxyl acids, the polar group is distant from the carboxylate and may not effectively coordinate with the catalyst's metal centers. Additionally, the long hydrophilic chains can disrupt hydrophobic interactions or introduce steric hindrance, reducing catalytic efficiency and yield.

---

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers that are substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with bulky electron-donating groups (e.g., methoxy groups) can lead to high yield when combined with additional coordinating functionalities.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Bulky electron-donating groups can enhance π-interactions with the catalyst. When combined with other coordinating groups, they may improve catalyst-modifier interactions and catalytic performance, leading to high yield.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows us to unambiguously determine the yield based on the presence of α-amino dicarboxylic acids, as evidenced by data entries for aspartic acid and glutamic acid yielding high results. The rule provides adequate physical-chemical insight into how multiple coordination sites enhance catalyst interaction. It considers a combination of substructures—namely the amino group and two carboxylic acid groups—adding appropriate complexity. The rule is supported by multiple data points, ensuring good coverage.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 effectively distinguishes between modifiers with para-substituents capable of metal coordination and those with non-coordinating groups, correlating with high and low yields, respectively. This is supported by data entries showing high yields for 4-aminobenzoic acid and 4-nitrobenzoic acid, and low yield for 4-methylbenzoic acid. The rule provides clear property insight into how substituent coordination affects catalytic activity. It involves combinations of substructures, increasing complexity, and is well-supported by multiple data points.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear in identifying that aromatic carboxylic acids with non-coordinating electron-withdrawing groups lead to low yield, supported by data entries for 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid. The rule offers physical-chemical insight into how such groups interfere with metal coordination. It adds complexity by considering the combination of electron-withdrawing groups and their positioning. Coverage is sufficient with multiple data points supporting the rule.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 clearly articulates that long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar groups lead to high yield, while inclusion of polar groups on long chains leads to low yield. Supported by data entries for octanoic acid (high yield) and 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, and 8-aminooctanoic acid (low yields). The rule provides sound property insight into hydrophobic interactions and coordination effects. It combines considerations of chain length and functional groups, adding necessary complexity, and has strong coverage with multiple data points.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear and specifies that short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino or thiol groups lead to high yield, as supported by data for 5-aminopentanoic acid and 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid. The rule provides adequate physical-chemical insight into efficient coordination due to proximity of functional groups. It adds complexity by combining chain length with specific functional groups and is well-supported by data points.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 effectively differentiates modifiers based on the presence of nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic rings and the impact of rigid linkages on yield. This is supported by high yields for pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, and 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid, and low yield for 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid. The rule provides property insight into coordination via heteroatoms and steric effects of rigid linkers. It involves combinations of structural features, adding complexity, and has good coverage.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear in distinguishing amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms (high yield) from those lacking heteroatoms (low yield), supported by data for tryptophan (high yield) and phenylalanine (low yield). The rule offers physical-chemical insight into the role of heteroatoms in metal coordination. It combines considerations of amino acid structure and side-chain functionality, adding appropriate complexity, with adequate coverage from data points.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 clearly states that perfluorinated carboxylic acids or those containing trifluoromethyl groups lead to low yield, supported by data entries for nonafluoropentanoic acid and 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid. The rule provides property insight into the effects of strong electron-withdrawing groups on coordination. While it focuses on specific functional groups, it appropriately addresses their impact, and coverage is acceptable with multiple data points.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear in indicating that sugar acids or polyhydroxy carboxylic acids lead to high yield, supported by data for gluconic acid and similar compounds. The rule provides property insight into the benefits of multiple hydroxyl groups for coordination and solubility. It adds complexity by considering multiple functional groups and has sufficient coverage with supporting data points.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 clearly specifies that amide derivatives of carboxylic acids lead to low yield, supported by data entries showing low yields for such modifiers. The rule offers physical-chemical insight into how amide formation reduces coordination capabilities. It considers specific functional group transformations, adding necessary complexity, and has adequate coverage.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 identifies that modifiers capable of forming intramolecular hydrogen bonds lead to low yield, supported by data for 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid. While the rule provides some property insight into the sequestering of coordinating groups, coverage is limited with only one supporting data point, suggesting a need for more data to strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 effectively distinguishes between thiol groups on short aliphatic chains (high yield) and those directly attached to aromatic rings (low yield), supported by data entries for 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid (high yield) and 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid (low yield). The rule offers property insight into the coordination behavior of thiol groups based on their attachment. It combines chain type with functional groups, adding complexity, and has acceptable coverage.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is somewhat complex but clear, stating that flexible aliphatic chains with coordinating groups lead to high yield, while rigid aromatic linkages lead to low yield. Supported by data for 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid (high yield) and 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (low yield). The rule provides property insight into the importance of linker flexibility for effective coordination. Coverage is limited with only one high-yield example, suggesting a need for additional data to fully validate the rule.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 clearly indicates that aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino or hydroxyl groups on long chains lead to low yield, well-supported by multiple data entries. The rule provides strong property insight into ineffective coordination due to the distance of functional groups. It adds complexity by combining chain length with functional group positioning and has robust coverage.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 suggests that bulky electron-donating groups combined with coordinating functionalities can lead to high yield, supported by a single data point. While the rule offers property insight into π-interactions and coordination enhancement, it lacks clarity due to its complexity and has limited coverage with only one supporting example. Additional data would be beneficial to confirm this rule.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (alpha-amino acids with two carboxylic acid groups) lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)  
  - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)

  **Explanation**: The presence of both an α-amino group and two carboxylic acid groups provides multiple coordination sites to the metal catalyst. This enhances the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst's metal centers, improving catalytic activity and leading to high yield.

---

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituents capable of coordinating to metal centers (e.g., amino, nitro groups) lead to high yield; those with non-coordinating electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl) lead to low yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - 4-aminobenzoic acid  
  - 4-nitrobenzoic acid

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 4-methylbenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Para-substituents that can coordinate with metal centers enhance the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst, improving catalytic efficiency and yield. Non-coordinating electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening metal coordination and reducing yield.

---

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups directly attached to the ring that are not capable of coordination (e.g., aldehyde groups) lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - 4-formylbenzoic acid  
  - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Non-coordinating electron-withdrawing groups can interfere with metal coordination or deactivate catalytic sites, reducing the catalyst's effectiveness and lowering yield.

---

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrophobic chains (six carbons or more) without additional polar functional groups lead to high yield; inclusion of polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) on long chains leads to low yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - Octanoic acid

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid  
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid  
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Hydrophobic long-chain acids may enhance interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or improve substrate accessibility, boosting reactivity. Additional polar groups on long chains can introduce unfavorable solvation effects or steric hindrance, interfering with effective coordination and lowering yield.

---

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (five carbons or fewer) containing an amino or thiol group lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - 5-aminopentanoic acid  
  - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Terminal amino or thiol groups in close proximity to the carboxylate can efficiently coordinate with the metal centers in the catalyst. This enhances catalyst-modifier interactions and improves catalytic performance, leading to high yield.

---

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen in the aromatic ring lead to high yield; those connected via rigid aromatic linkages lead to low yield due to steric hindrance.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)  
  - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid  
  - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings act as additional coordination sites for the metal centers in the catalyst. This strengthens catalyst-modifier interactions, enhancing catalytic activity and yielding higher product formation. Rigid aromatic linkers prevent optimal alignment due to steric hindrance, diminishing coordination efficiency and lowering yield.

---

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms (e.g., indole ring in tryptophan) lead to high yield; those with aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms (e.g., phenyl group in phenylalanine) lead to low yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)

  **Explanation**: Heteroatoms in the aromatic side chain can coordinate with the metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity through additional interactions. Aromatic side chains without heteroatoms lack this coordinating ability and may hinder catalyst interactions, reducing yield.

---

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers that are perfluorinated carboxylic acids or contain trifluoromethyl groups lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid  
  - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Strong electron-withdrawing effects from fluorinated groups can decrease the basicity of coordinating atoms and destabilize catalyst-modifier interactions. This reduces the binding affinity to the metal centers, diminishing catalytic performance and yield.

---

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers that are sugar acids or polyhydroxy carboxylic acids lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

  **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous coordination sites and enhance solubility. This allows for extensive interactions and chelation with the catalyst's metal centers, improving catalytic efficiency and leading to high yield.

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers that are amide derivatives of carboxylic acids lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid  
  - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

  **Explanation**: Amide formation reduces the availability of lone pairs on nitrogen and oxygen atoms for coordination with metal centers. This decreases catalyst-modifier interactions, leading to reduced catalytic efficiency and lower yield.

---

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with substituents capable of forming intramolecular hydrogen bonds (e.g., hydroxyl groups ortho to the carboxyl group) lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Intramolecular hydrogen bonding can sequester functional groups that would otherwise coordinate with the catalyst's metal centers. This reduces catalyst-modifier interactions and lowers yield.

---

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers with thiol groups on short aliphatic chains lead to high yield; thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings lead to low yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Thiol groups on short aliphatic chains can form effective coordination with metal centers without deactivating the catalyst. Aromatic thiols may bind too strongly or interfere with catalytic sites due to their conjugated systems, reducing yield.

---

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted flexible aliphatic chains containing coordinating groups lead to high yield; those connected via rigid aromatic rings lead to low yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Flexible aliphatic linkers allow the coordinating group (e.g., pyridine nitrogen) to orient and coordinate effectively with the catalyst's metal centers. Rigid aromatic linkers prevent optimal alignment due to steric hindrance or reduced flexibility, diminishing coordination efficiency and lowering yield.

---

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino or hydroxyl groups on long chains (more than six carbons) lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid  
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid  
  - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid

  **Explanation**: In long-chain amino or hydroxyl acids, the polar group is distant from the carboxylate and may not effectively coordinate with the catalyst's metal centers. Additionally, the long hydrophilic chains can disrupt hydrophobic interactions or introduce steric hindrance, reducing catalytic efficiency and yield.

---

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers that are substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with bulky electron-donating groups (e.g., methoxy groups) can lead to high yield when combined with additional coordinating functionalities.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Bulky electron-donating groups can enhance π-interactions with the catalyst. When combined with other coordinating groups, they may improve catalyst-modifier interactions and catalytic performance, leading to high yield.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Adjust the Matching Logic for Rule Patterns**  
  In the current code, multiple SMARTS patterns within each rule are combined using logical 'AND', meaning a molecule must match *all* patterns to satisfy the rule. However, for many rules, the intention is that matching *any* of the patterns should satisfy the rule (logical 'OR'). Modify the code to use logical 'OR' for combining patterns within the same rule. Specifically, change the code block:
  ```python
  match = True
  for smarts in smarts_list:
      if not mol.HasSubstructMatch(smarts):
          match = False
          break
  ```
  to:
  ```python
  match = False
  for smarts in smarts_list:
      if mol.HasSubstructMatch(smarts):
          match = True
          break
  ```
  This change ensures that if a molecule matches any of the SMARTS patterns in a rule, it satisfies the rule.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Refine SMARTS Patterns for Rule 1 (α-Amino Dicarboxylic Acids)**  
  The current patterns for Rule 1 require a molecule to match both the α-amino acid pattern and a separate dicarboxylic acid pattern, which is too restrictive. Instead, create a single SMARTS pattern that captures α-amino acids with two carboxylic acid groups. For example:
  ```python
  '[NX3;H2,H1][CX4H]([CH2][CX3](=O)[OX2H1])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'  # α-Amino acid with side-chain carboxylic acid
  ```
  This pattern ensures that the amino group and both carboxylic acids are correctly positioned relative to each other, matching compounds like aspartic acid and glutamic acid.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Separate High and Low Yield Substituents in Rule 2**  
  Rule 2 combines high and low yield cases but doesn't distinguish between them in the code. Introduce separate patterns for high-yielding coordinating groups (e.g., amino, nitro) and low-yielding non-coordinating groups (e.g., methyl). Update the `predictions` dictionary to handle both cases:
  ```python
  'Rule 2_High': [patterns_for_high_yield],
  'Rule 2_Low': [patterns_for_low_yield],
  ```
  and adjust the rest of the code accordingly. This separation allows the code to assign the correct prediction based on the specific substituent present.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Improve Specificity of SMARTS Patterns in Rule 3 (Aromatic Aldehydes)**  
  The pattern `'c[C;X3]=O'` may match aldehyde groups not directly attached to the aromatic ring. Refine the pattern to ensure the aldehyde is bonded directly to the ring:
  ```python
  '[$(c-C=O)]'  # Aromatic carbon directly bonded to an aldehyde group
  ```
  Use this pattern in conjunction with an aromatic carboxylic acid pattern to match compounds like 4-formylbenzoic acid.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Enhance Rule 6 Patterns to Differentiate Linker Flexibility**  
  Rule 6 mentions that rigid aromatic linkers lead to low yield due to steric hindrance. Introduce separate patterns for flexible aliphatic linkers and rigid aromatic linkers. For example:
  ```python
  # High yield: Heteroaromatic carboxylic acid with flexible linker
  'Rule 6_High': [Chem.MolFromSmarts('[cH1][n][cH1]'), Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]')],
  # Low yield: Heteroaromatic connected via rigid aromatic linker
  'Rule 6_Low': [Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1ccc(c2nccc2)cc1'), Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]')],
  ```
  Update the prediction logic to assign high or low yield accordingly.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Adjust Rule 7 to Accurately Identify Aromatic Side Chains with Heteroatoms**  
  The current pattern for Rule 7 does not ensure that the heteroatom is part of the aromatic side chain. Modify the pattern to specifically match amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms:
  ```python
  '[NX3;H2,H1][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX2H1].*[c;n,o,s]'  # Amino acid with heteroaromatic side chain
  ```
  Additionally, separate the high and low yield cases based on the presence of heteroatoms in the side chain.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Expand Rule 8 Patterns to Cover All Perfluorinated and Trifluoromethyl Groups**  
  The current pattern may miss some perfluorinated compounds. Use a more general pattern:
  ```python
  '[CX4][F,Cl,Br,I]'  # Carbon bonded to any halogen
  '[CX3](F)(F)[F,Cl,Br,I]'  # Trifluoromethyl and other trihalogenated groups
  ```
  Ensure that perfluorinated chains and trifluoromethyl groups in various positions are detected.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Refine Chain Length Patterns in Rules 4 and 14**  
  The patterns for chain lengths should be adjusted to accurately reflect the number of carbons. For Rule 4 (long hydrophobic chains):
  ```python
  '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CH2]{5,}'  # Carboxylic acid attached to a chain of 6 or more carbons
  ```
  For Rule 14 (long chains with polar groups):
  ```python
  '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CH2]{5,}[NX3;H2,H1]',  # Amino group after 6+ carbons
  '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CH2]{5,}[OX2H1]'       # Hydroxyl group after 6+ carbons
  ```

- **Suggestion 9**: **Adjust Rule 9 Pattern to Capture Various Sugar Acids**  
  The existing pattern may be too restrictive. Use a more general pattern that matches any polyhydroxy carboxylic acid:
  ```python
  '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CH2][CHO]([OX2H])[CHO]([OX2H])[CHO]([OX2H])'  # Simplified pattern for sugar acids
  ```
  Alternatively, consider known sugar substructures or use a recursive SMARTS pattern.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Implement Conditional Predictions Within Rules**  
  For rules like Rule 12, where the prediction depends on substructure details, include explicit conditions in the code. For example:
  ```python
  if mol.HasSubstructMatch(Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CH2][SX2H]')):
      row.append(1)  # Thiol on short aliphatic chain
  elif mol.HasSubstructMatch(Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]c[SX2H]')):
      row.append(-1)  # Thiol directly on aromatic ring
  else:
      row.append(0)
  ```
  Apply similar logic to other rules with conditional outcomes.

- **Suggestion 11**: **Validate SMARTS Patterns with Test Cases**  
  For each rule, test the SMARTS patterns against known compounds (including high and low yield examples provided in the rules) to ensure they match correctly. Adjust the patterns based on the results of these tests.

- **Suggestion 12**: **Improve Comments and Documentation in Code**  
  Add detailed comments explaining each SMARTS pattern and the logic behind it. Include the chemical reasoning and examples where applicable. This will make the code more readable and maintainable.

- **Suggestion 13**: **Use RDKit Functionalities for Amino Acids and Other Common Substructures**  
  RDKit has built-in functionalities and patterns for amino acids and common biomolecules. Utilize these to improve pattern accuracy. For example:
  ```python
  Chem.MolFromSmarts('[$([NX3][CX4H]([*])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1])]')  # Generic pattern for α-amino acids
  ```

- **Suggestion 14**: **Handle Tautomeric Forms and Resonance Structures**  
  Some compounds may exist in tautomeric forms or have resonance structures that affect substructure matching. Implement code to consider these possibilities, possibly using RDKit's tautomer enumeration tools.

- **Suggestion 15**: **Consider Stereochemistry Where Relevant**  
  For rules involving specific stereochemistry (e.g., α-amino acids), include stereochemical specifications in the SMARTS patterns if needed.

- **Suggestion 16**: **Refactor Code to Allow Complex Logical Combinations**  
  For rules that require complex logic (e.g., both 'AND' and 'OR' combinations), consider representing each rule as a function or a class that encapsulates its logic. This approach allows more flexibility and clarity in defining how patterns are combined.

- **Suggestion 17**: **Ensure Consistent Use of SMARTS Atom and Bond Expressions**  
  Review all SMARTS patterns to ensure consistent and correct use of atom and bond expressions. For instance, use '[#6]' for carbon atoms instead of '[C]' to include all isotopes and charge states.

- **Suggestion 18**: **Update Prediction Logic to Reflect High and Low Yield Conditions**  
  Adjust the `predictions` dictionary and the code to handle predictions that depend on specific substructures within a rule, ensuring that high and low yield conditions are accurately reflected in the feature matrix.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (alpha-amino acids with two carboxylic acid groups) lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)  
  - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)

  **Explanation**: The presence of both an α-amino group and two carboxylic acid groups provides multiple coordination sites to the metal catalyst. This enhances the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst's metal centers, improving catalytic activity and leading to high yield.

---

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituents capable of coordinating to metal centers (e.g., amino, nitro groups) lead to high yield; those with non-coordinating electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl) lead to low yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - 4-aminobenzoic acid  
  - 4-nitrobenzoic acid

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 4-methylbenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Para-substituents that can coordinate with metal centers enhance the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst, improving catalytic efficiency and yield. Non-coordinating electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening metal coordination and reducing yield.

---

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups directly attached to the ring that are not capable of coordination (e.g., aldehyde groups) lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - 4-formylbenzoic acid  
  - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Non-coordinating electron-withdrawing groups can interfere with metal coordination or deactivate catalytic sites, reducing the catalyst's effectiveness and lowering yield.

---

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrophobic chains (six carbons or more) without additional polar functional groups lead to high yield; inclusion of polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) on long chains leads to low yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - Octanoic acid

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid  
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid  
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Hydrophobic long-chain acids may enhance interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or improve substrate accessibility, boosting reactivity. Additional polar groups on long chains can introduce unfavorable solvation effects or steric hindrance, interfering with effective coordination and lowering yield.

---

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (five carbons or fewer) containing an amino or thiol group lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - 5-aminopentanoic acid  
  - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Terminal amino or thiol groups in close proximity to the carboxylate can efficiently coordinate with the metal centers in the catalyst. This enhances catalyst-modifier interactions and improves catalytic performance, leading to high yield.

---

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen in the aromatic ring lead to high yield; those connected via rigid aromatic linkages lead to low yield due to steric hindrance.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)  
  - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid  
  - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings act as additional coordination sites for the metal centers in the catalyst. This strengthens catalyst-modifier interactions, enhancing catalytic activity and yielding higher product formation. Rigid aromatic linkers prevent optimal alignment due to steric hindrance, diminishing coordination efficiency and lowering yield.

---

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms (e.g., indole ring in tryptophan) lead to high yield; those with aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms (e.g., phenyl group in phenylalanine) lead to low yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)

  **Explanation**: Heteroatoms in the aromatic side chain can coordinate with the metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity through additional interactions. Aromatic side chains without heteroatoms lack this coordinating ability and may hinder catalyst interactions, reducing yield.

---

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers that are perfluorinated carboxylic acids or contain trifluoromethyl groups lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid  
  - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Strong electron-withdrawing effects from fluorinated groups can decrease the basicity of coordinating atoms and destabilize catalyst-modifier interactions. This reduces the binding affinity to the metal centers, diminishing catalytic performance and yield.

---

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers that are sugar acids or polyhydroxy carboxylic acids lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

  **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous coordination sites and enhance solubility. This allows for extensive interactions and chelation with the catalyst's metal centers, improving catalytic efficiency and leading to high yield.

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers that are amide derivatives of carboxylic acids lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid  
  - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

  **Explanation**: Amide formation reduces the availability of lone pairs on nitrogen and oxygen atoms for coordination with metal centers. This decreases catalyst-modifier interactions, leading to reduced catalytic efficiency and lower yield.

---

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with substituents capable of forming intramolecular hydrogen bonds (e.g., hydroxyl groups ortho to the carboxyl group) lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Intramolecular hydrogen bonding can sequester functional groups that would otherwise coordinate with the catalyst's metal centers. This reduces catalyst-modifier interactions and lowers yield.

---

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers with thiol groups on short aliphatic chains lead to high yield; thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings lead to low yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Thiol groups on short aliphatic chains can form effective coordination with metal centers without deactivating the catalyst. Aromatic thiols may bind too strongly or interfere with catalytic sites due to their conjugated systems, reducing yield.

---

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted flexible aliphatic chains containing coordinating groups lead to high yield; those connected via rigid aromatic rings lead to low yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Flexible aliphatic linkers allow the coordinating group (e.g., pyridine nitrogen) to orient and coordinate effectively with the catalyst's metal centers. Rigid aromatic linkers prevent optimal alignment due to steric hindrance or reduced flexibility, diminishing coordination efficiency and lowering yield.

---

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino or hydroxyl groups on long chains (more than six carbons) lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid  
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid  
  - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid

  **Explanation**: In long-chain amino or hydroxyl acids, the polar group is distant from the carboxylate and may not effectively coordinate with the catalyst's metal centers. Additionally, the long hydrophilic chains can disrupt hydrophobic interactions or introduce steric hindrance, reducing catalytic efficiency and yield.

---

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers that are substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with bulky electron-donating groups (e.g., methoxy groups) can lead to high yield when combined with additional coordinating functionalities.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Bulky electron-donating groups can enhance π-interactions with the catalyst. When combined with other coordinating groups, they may improve catalyst-modifier interactions and catalytic performance, leading to high yield.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: **For Rule 1**, the SMARTS pattern is too specific and does not match all α-amino dicarboxylic acids, such as glutamic acid (SMILES index 1). Adjust the SMARTS pattern to be more general:

  ```python
  '[NX3;H2][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX2H1])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
  ```

  This pattern captures an α-amino acid with two carboxylic acid groups directly attached to the alpha carbon.

- **Suggestion 2**: **For Rule 2 High**, the SMARTS pattern does not correctly match 4-nitrobenzoic acid (SMILES index 21). The nitro group in SMILES is represented as `[N+](=O)[O-]`, which may not be captured by `[NX3](=O)=O`. Update the pattern to:

  ```python
  'c1cc([CX3](=O)[OX2H1])ccc1[NX3+](=O)[OX1-]'
  ```

  This pattern accounts for the charged nitro group representation.

- **Suggestion 3**: **For Rule 6 High**, the SMARTS pattern `'[n][c]1[c][c][c][c][c]1[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'` may be too restrictive. Modify it to:

  ```python
  '[nH0][c]1[c][c][c][c][c]1[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
  ```

  This allows for any heteroaromatic ring containing nitrogen to match the pattern.

- **Suggestion 4**: **For Rule 7 High**, the SMARTS pattern does not match tryptophan-like structures due to the specific atom types used. Adjust the pattern to account for aromatic side chains with heteroatoms:

  ```python
  '[NX3;H2][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX2H1])[CX4][CX3](=[CX3])[c][n]'
  ```

  This pattern targets amino acids with side chains containing heteroaromatic rings.

- **Suggestion 5**: **For Rule 9**, the SMARTS pattern seems too specific and may not match sugar acids like gluconic acid (SMILES index 10). Broaden the pattern to include polyhydroxy carboxylic acids:

  ```python
  '[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CH2][CHOH][CHOH][CHOH][CHOH][CH2][OX2H]'
  ```

  Or consider using a recursive SMARTS pattern to match multiple hydroxyl groups.

- **Suggestion 6**: **For Rule 12 High**, the SMARTS pattern `'[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CH2]{0,4}[SX2H]'` overlaps with Rule 5. Since Rule 5 also includes thiol groups on short chains, ensure that the patterns are distinct or adjust the precedence in code to prevent conflicts.

- **Suggestion 7**: **For Rule 14**, the SMARTS pattern may not exclude modifiers with additional functional groups on long chains. Include an exclusion pattern to avoid matching molecules with polar functional groups on long aliphatic chains:

  ```python
  'exclude_patterns': ['[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CH2]{5,}[!C;!H]']
  ```

- **Suggestion 8**: **General Suggestion**, add error handling and logging to identify when molecules do not match due to parsing errors or pattern mismatches. This will help in debugging and refining the SMARTS patterns.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Re-evaluate the SMARTS patterns** for all rules to ensure they align with the chemical context of the natural language descriptions. Consider consulting cheminformatics resources or using tools like SMARTSviewer to validate patterns.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Test each pattern individually** against known examples (both positive and negative) to confirm that they match the intended structures and do not produce false positives or negatives.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Define Clear, Quantifiable Molecular Descriptors**  
  Rewrite the rules to specify clear molecular descriptors that can be directly calculated from SMILES strings. For example, instead of stating "Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids," specify "Modifiers with one alpha-amino group and two carboxylic acid groups attached to the same carbon." This precision allows for the automatic calculation of features such as counts of specific functional groups.

- **Advice 2**: **Use Functional Group Counts and Presence Indicators**  
  Reframe the rules to focus on the presence or count of specific functional groups (e.g., amino, carboxyl, hydroxyl, thiol, nitro groups), ring types (e.g., aromatic, heteroaromatic), and chain lengths. This approach facilitates the conversion of rules into numerical features like binary indicators (1 for presence, 0 for absence) or integer counts, which are easily included in a feature matrix.

- **Advice 3**: **Employ Molecular Fingerprints and Substructure Searches**  
  Utilize cheminformatics tools to translate rules into substructure queries that can be applied to SMILES strings. Molecular fingerprints (e.g., MACCS keys, Morgan fingerprints) can numerically represent the presence of specific substructures or patterns, aligning with the defined rules.

- **Advice 4**: **Integrate Standard Molecular Descriptors**  
  Include standard calculated molecular descriptors such as molecular weight, LogP (octanol-water partition coefficient), topological polar surface area (TPSA), number of rotatable bonds, and counts of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors. These descriptors are readily obtainable from SMILES strings and provide quantitative features for the feature matrix.

- **Advice 5**: **Categorize Modifiers Based on Structural Classes**  
  Group modifiers into categories based on structural similarities (e.g., amino acids, aromatic acids with coordinating substituents, long-chain aliphatic acids) and assign categorical numerical codes. This reduces complexity and allows for the inclusion of categorical variables in regression or classification models.

- **Advice 6**: **Simplify and Consolidate Overlapping Rules**  
  Review the current rules to identify and eliminate overlaps or redundancies. Consolidate similar rules to create a more streamlined set of guidelines focusing on unique structural features, thus simplifying the generation of numerical features.

- **Advice 7**: **Quantify Electronic and Steric Effects Numerically**  
  Incorporate quantitative measures of electronic effects (e.g., Hammett sigma constants for substituents) and steric hindrance (e.g., Taft steric parameters) into the feature set. These numerical values can capture the influence of substituents on reactivity and yield.

- **Advice 8**: **Define Spatial and Topological Features**  
  Include descriptors that capture the spatial arrangement of functional groups, such as the distance between coordinating atoms or the overall shape of the molecule. Graph-based descriptors or 3D molecular descriptors can provide this information numerically.

- **Advice 9**: **Automate Feature Extraction Using Software Tools**  
  Utilize cheminformatics software (e.g., RDKit, ChemAxon) to automate the extraction of defined features from SMILES strings. By aligning the rules with capabilities of these tools, feature generation becomes efficient and less prone to human error.

- **Advice 10**: **Provide Encoding Examples for Each Rule**  
  Create a reference guide showing how each rule translates into numerical features with examples. For instance, demonstrate how a modifier like 4-aminobenzoic acid is encoded based on the presence of an aromatic ring, a carboxylic acid group, and an amino group in the para position.

- **Advice 11**: **Incorporate Machine Learning-Friendly Features**  
  Adapt the rules to generate features suitable for machine learning algorithms. This includes normalizing numerical values, encoding categorical variables properly (e.g., one-hot encoding), and ensuring there are no missing values in the feature matrix.

- **Advice 12**: **Validate and Update Rules Based on Data Correlation**  
  Analyze the correlation between proposed numerical features and the reaction yield data. Modify the rules to emphasize features with strong positive or negative correlations to yield, enhancing the predictive power of the resulting models.

- **Advice 13**: **Focus on Features with High Predictive Value**  
  Prioritize features that consistently correlate with high or low yields across multiple modifiers. This may involve weighting certain features more heavily in the model or refining rules to capture the most influential structural aspects.

- **Advice 14**: **Standardize Nomenclature and Terminology**  
  Ensure consistent use of chemical terminology and nomenclature in the rules. This standardization aids in the accurate identification and coding of features when parsing SMILES strings.

- **Advice 15**: **Collaborate with Data Scientists and Chemists**  
  Encourage collaboration between chemists and data scientists to bridge the gap between chemical knowledge and data modeling. Chemists can provide insights into meaningful features, while data scientists can guide the practical aspects of feature extraction and model building.

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino or hydroxyl groups on long chains (more than six carbons) lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:  
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid  
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid  
  - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid

  **Explanation**: In long-chain amino or hydroxyl acids, the polar group is distant from the carboxylate and may not effectively coordinate with the catalyst's metal centers. Additionally, the long hydrophilic chains can disrupt hydrophobic interactions or introduce steric hindrance, reducing catalytic efficiency and yield.

---

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with bulky electron-donating groups (e.g., methoxy groups) can lead to high yield when combined with additional coordinating functionalities.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:  
  - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Bulky electron-donating groups can enhance π-interactions with the catalyst. When combined with other coordinating groups, they may improve catalyst-modifier interactions and catalytic performance, leading to high yield.

**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: *Rule 1* scores high on all criteria. It is clear and specific, allowing us to determine whether a modifier leads to high yield when it matches the description of α-amino dicarboxylic acids. The property insight is strong, explaining how multiple coordination sites enhance metal-ligand interactions. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures (α-amino group and two carboxylic acid groups), adding complexity. The rule is supported by at least two data points—(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid and (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 2**: *Rule 2* is clear in distinguishing modifiers' effects based on the type of para-substituents on aromatic carboxylic acids.

Coverage may be limited, possibly supported by only a few data points such as 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid (high yield) and 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (low yield). The balance between complexity and coverage could be improved.

- **Comment 14**: *Rule 14* clearly indicates that aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino or hydroxyl groups on long chains (more than six carbons) lead to low yield. The property insight provides reasonable explanations about the ineffective coordination due to the distance of the polar group from the carboxylate and potential steric hindrance. The rule involves combinations of chain length and functional group position, adding complexity. It is supported by several data points—7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid, and 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid. The balance between complexity and coverage is acceptable.

- **Comment 15**: *Rule 15* suggests that aromatic carboxylic acids with bulky electron-donating groups can lead to high yield when combined with additional coordinating functionalities. The property insight is reasonable, explaining how such groups can enhance π-interactions when combined with coordinating groups. However, the rule is complex, requiring multiple structural features, and coverage may be limited, potentially supported by only one data point—4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid. The balance between complexity and coverage may be suboptimal.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Quantify Molecular Features for Numerical Representation**

  Transform qualitative descriptions in the rules into quantitative molecular descriptors that can be directly computed from SMILES strings. For example:

  - **Chain Length**: Define "short" and "long" chains numerically, e.g., short-chain aliphatic acids (≤5 carbons), long-chain aliphatic acids (≥6 carbons).
  - **Functional Group Counts**: Count the number of specific functional groups (e.g., carboxylic acids, amino groups, hydroxyl groups).
  - **Position of Substituents**: Encode the position of substituents on aromatic rings numerically (e.g., ortho = 1, meta = 2, para = 3).

- **Advice 2**: **Standardize Functional Group Definitions**

  Provide clear definitions for functional groups capable of metal coordination. For instance:

  - **Metal-Coordinating Groups**: Specify groups like amino (-NH₂), pyridyl nitrogen, thiol (-SH), and carboxylate (-COO⁻) as coordinating groups.
  - **Non-Coordinating Groups**: Define groups like methyl (-CH₃), methoxy (-OCH₃), and fluorinated groups as non-coordinating or weakly coordinating.

- **Advice 3**: **Develop a Comprehensive Feature Matrix**

  Create a feature matrix where each modifier is represented by a vector of computed molecular descriptors. Potential descriptors include:

  - **Structural Descriptors**: Molecular weight, heavy atom count, number of rings, ring types (aromatic or aliphatic), and ring sizes.
  - **Functional Descriptors**: Counts of specific functional groups (e.g., carboxylic acids, amino groups), presence of heteroatoms (N, O, S).
  - **Electronic Descriptors**: Hammett sigma constants for substituents, total electron count, partial charges.
  - **Topological Descriptors**: Connectivity indices, flexibility (rotatable bond count), steric hindrance parameters.

- **Advice 4**: **Utilize Cheminformatics Tools for Descriptor Calculation**

  Employ cheminformatics software (e.g., RDKit, ChemAxon) to compute molecular descriptors directly from SMILES strings. This ensures consistency and efficiency in feature calculation.

- **Advice 5**: **Incorporate Coordination Ability into Numerical Scores**

  Assign numerical scores to functional groups based on their metal coordination strength:

  - **Coordinate Strength Scale**: For example, assign values like strong (3), moderate (2), weak (1), none (0).
  - **Aggregate Coordination Score**: Sum the coordination scores of all functional groups in a molecule to get an overall coordination ability score.

- **Advice 6**: **Define Clear Rules for Electron Donating/Withdrawing Effects**

  Quantify the electronic effects of substituents using established parameters:

  - **Hammett Constants**: Use sigma values to represent electron-donating or electron-withdrawing nature of substituents.
  - **Partial Charges**: Calculate partial charges on key atoms to assess electronic distribution.

- **Advice 7**: **Rephrase Rules Using Molecular Fingerprints**

  Convert the rules into SMARTS patterns or molecular fingerprints that can be matched directly against SMILES strings. For example:

  - **Rule for α-Amino Dicarboxylic Acids**: Identify molecules containing the SMARTS pattern for α-amino and two carboxylic acid groups.
  - **Rule for Para-Substituted Aromatic Carboxylic Acids**: Use patterns that specify substituents at the para position capable of coordination.

- **Advice 8**: **Eliminate Redundancies and Clarify Overlapping Rules**

  Review and refine the rules to ensure they are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive:

  - **Consolidate Similar Rules**: Merge rules that cover similar chemical features to simplify the rule set.
  - **Clarify Ambiguities**: Ensure that each rule has clear boundaries to prevent overlap.

- **Advice 9**: **Integrate Descriptor-Based Machine Learning Models**

  Use the computed feature matrix to train machine learning models (e.g., decision trees, random forests) that can predict yield outcomes based on molecular descriptors. This can help in uncovering complex relationships not captured by simple rules.

- **Advice 10**: **Annotate Exceptions and Special Cases**

  Identify modifiers that do not conform to the general trends and understand the reasons:

  - **Outlier Analysis**: Examine compounds that defy the rules to refine the rules or account for new factors.
  - **Adjust Rules Accordingly**: Update the rules to include new descriptors or modify existing ones based on outlier insights.

---

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrophobic chains (six or more carbons) without additional polar functional groups lead to high yield; inclusion of polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) on long chains leads to low yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:
  - Octanoic acid

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Hydrophobic long-chain acids may enhance interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or improve substrate accessibility, boosting reactivity and leading to high yield. Additional polar groups on long chains can introduce unfavorable solvation effects or steric hindrance, interfering with effective coordination and lowering yield.

---

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (five carbons or fewer) containing amino or thiol groups lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 5-aminopentanoic acid

---

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms (e.g., indole ring in tryptophan) lead to high yield; those with aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms (e.g., phenyl group in phenylalanine) lead to low yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:
  - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:
  - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)

  **Explanation**: Heteroatoms in the aromatic side chain can coordinate with the metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity through additional interactions. Aromatic side chains without heteroatoms lack this coordinating ability and may hinder catalyst interactions, reducing yield.

---

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers containing strong electron-withdrawing groups such as fluorinated alkyl chains lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Strong electron-withdrawing effects from fluorinated groups decrease the basicity of coordinating atoms and destabilize catalyst-modifier interactions. This reduces the binding affinity to the metal centers, diminishing catalytic performance and leading to low yield.

---

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers that are sugar acids or polyhydroxy carboxylic acids lead to high yield due to multiple coordination sites provided by hydroxyl groups.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:
  - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

  **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous coordination sites and enhance solubility. This allows for extensive interactions and chelation with the catalyst's metal centers, improving catalytic efficiency and leading to high yield.

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers that are amide derivatives of carboxylic acids or contain peptide bonds lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (α-amino acids with two carboxylic acid groups) lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)
  - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)

  **Explanation**: The presence of an α-amino group and two carboxylic acid groups provides multiple coordination sites to the metal catalyst. This enhances metal-ligand interactions, improving catalytic activity and leading to high yield.

---

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituents capable of coordinating to metal centers (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl, pyridyl groups) lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 4-aminobenzoic acid
  - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
  - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Para-substituents that can coordinate with metal centers enhance the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst. This strengthens catalyst-modifier interactions, improving catalytic efficiency and leading to high yield.

---

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituents incapable of coordinating to metal centers or with strong electron-withdrawing groups that do not coordinate lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 4-methylbenzoic acid
  - 4-formylbenzoic acid
  - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Non-coordinating substituents or strong electron-withdrawing groups can decrease the effectiveness of metal coordination. This weakens catalyst-modifier interactions, reducing catalytic efficiency and leading to low yield.

---

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrophobic chains (six or more carbons) without additional polar functional groups lead to high yield; inclusion of polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) on long chains leads to low yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:
  - Octanoic acid

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Hydrophobic long-chain acids may enhance interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or improve substrate accessibility, boosting reactivity and leading to high yield. Additional polar groups on long chains can introduce unfavorable solvation effects or steric hindrance, interfering with effective coordination and lowering yield.

---

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (five carbons or fewer) containing amino or thiol groups lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 5-aminopentanoic acid
  - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Terminal amino or thiol groups in close proximity to the carboxylate can efficiently coordinate with the metal centers in the catalyst. This enhances catalyst-modifier interactions and improves catalytic performance, leading to high yield.

---

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen in the aromatic ring lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)
  - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
  - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

  **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings act as additional coordination sites for the metal centers in the catalyst. This strengthens catalyst-modifier interactions, enhancing catalytic activity and yielding higher product formation.

---

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms (e.g., indole ring in tryptophan) lead to high yield; those with aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms (e.g., phenyl group in phenylalanine) lead to low yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:
  - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:
  - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)

  **Explanation**: Heteroatoms in the aromatic side chain can coordinate with the metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity through additional interactions. Aromatic side chains without heteroatoms lack this coordinating ability and may hinder catalyst interactions, reducing yield.

---

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers containing strong electron-withdrawing groups such as fluorinated alkyl chains lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Strong electron-withdrawing effects from fluorinated groups decrease the basicity of coordinating atoms and destabilize catalyst-modifier interactions. This reduces the binding affinity to the metal centers, diminishing catalytic performance and leading to low yield.

---

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers that are sugar acids or polyhydroxy carboxylic acids lead to high yield due to multiple coordination sites provided by hydroxyl groups.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:
  - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

  **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous coordination sites and enhance solubility. This allows for extensive interactions and chelation with the catalyst's metal centers, improving catalytic efficiency and leading to high yield.

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers that are amide derivatives of carboxylic acids or contain peptide bonds lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
  - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

  **Explanation**: Amide formation reduces the availability of lone pairs on nitrogen and oxygen atoms for coordination with metal centers. This decreases catalyst-modifier interactions, leading to reduced catalytic efficiency and lower yield.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- **Suggestion 1**: *Generalize the SMARTS patterns for detecting para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids in **Rule 2** and **Rule 3**. The current SMARTS patterns are too specific and may not match compounds due to differences in ring numbering or substituent positioning. Use more general patterns that identify an aromatic ring with a carboxylic acid and a substituent at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid. For example, detect any aromatic carboxylic acid with a coordinating substituent (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl, pyridyl) at the para position by using wildcard atoms and specifying the relative positions rather than exact atom indices.*

- **Suggestion 2**: *Modify the SMARTS pattern for short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids in **Rule 5**. The current pattern only matches chains with exactly four carbons (including the carboxylic carbon), which excludes five-carbon chains as per the rule definition. Update the SMARTS to match aliphatic carboxylic acids with chains of five carbons or fewer. For example, use a pattern like `[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CH2][CH2][CH2]?[CH2]?[CH2]` to include chains up to five carbons after the carboxylic carbon.*

- **Suggestion 3**: *Refine the SMARTS patterns for **Rule 6** to ensure that heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen are correctly identified. The current pattern `[n]` may match any nitrogen in an aromatic ring without ensuring it's part of a heteroaromatic system directly connected to a carboxylic acid. Combine this with the carboxylic acid pattern to ensure the carboxylic acid is attached to the heteroaromatic ring containing nitrogen. For example, use a pattern like `[$(n1cccc1),$(n1ccccc1)][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]`.*

- **Suggestion 4**: *Improve the detection of amino acids with aromatic side chains in **Rule 7**. The patterns for indole (tryptophan) and phenyl groups (phenylalanine) may not account for all representations or may miss certain tautomers and protonation states. Use more comprehensive SMARTS patterns to capture these side chains. For indole, use a pattern like `c1ccc2c(c1)[nH]c2` to detect various indole forms. For phenyl groups, ensure the pattern captures phenylalanine's side chain by including `[CH2][c]1[cH][cH][cH][cH][cH]1`.*

- **Suggestion 5**: *Review and adjust the SMARTS patterns across all rules to avoid overly specific atom mappings and ensure they are not dependent on exact atom indices or stereochemistry unless necessary. This will prevent false negatives due to minor differences in molecular representations. Utilize recursive SMARTS or smarts that focus on functional groups and connectivity rather than specific atom numbering.*

**Analysis of Current Rules Based on Metrics**

To evaluate the performance of the current rules, we will compare the provided metrics with the reference metrics, focusing on **confidence** and **lift**, as instructed. The reference metrics serve as a baseline, and improvements or declines in these values will indicate the effectiveness of the current rules.

---

**Reference Metrics (Baseline):**

- **Train Support**: 0.1667 to 0.1845
- **Train Confidence**: 0.5396 to 0.6352
- **Train Lift**: 1.0559 to 1.2048
- **Train Leverage**: -0.0041 to 0.0289

---

**Current Metrics During This Iteration:**

- **Rule 1:**
  - Train Support: 0.0336
  - Train Confidence: 0.6961
  - Train Lift: 1.4058
  - Train Leverage: 0.0082

  - **Train Confidence**: 0.6750
  - **Train Lift**: 1.3599
  - **Train Leverage**: 0.0202

---

**Performance Comparison:**

1. **Confidence:**

   - **Improvement Observed**: The current rules exhibit higher train confidence values (average around **0.6750**) compared to the reference confidence values (ranging between **0.5396** and **0.6352**).
   - **Interpretation**: A higher confidence indicates that when the conditions of the rule are met, the predicted outcome (high or low yield) occurs more frequently. This suggests that the rules are more reliable in predicting outcomes based on the given conditions.

2. **Lift:**

   - **Improvement Observed**: The current rules show higher train lift values (average around **1.3599**) compared to the reference lift values (ranging between **1.0559** and **1.2048**).
   - **Interpretation**: A lift greater than 1 indicates that the rule is better at predicting the outcome than random chance. The higher lift values suggest that the antecedent (rule conditions) increases the likelihood of the consequent (predicted outcome) more significantly in the current rules than in the reference rules.

3. **Support:**

   - **Decrease Observed**: The current rules have lower train support values (ranging from **0.0171** to **0.1349**, average around **0.0514**) compared to the reference support values (ranging between **0.1667** and **0.1845**).
   - **Interpretation**: Lower support means the rules apply to a smaller portion of the dataset. This suggests that while the rules are more confident and have higher lift, they cover fewer cases, possibly making them less generalizable.

4. **Leverage:**

   - **Consistent Positive Values**: The current rules have positive leverage values (average around **0.0202**), similar to the positive end of the reference leverage values.
   - **Interpretation**: Positive leverage indicates a stronger association between the rule's conditions and outcome than would be expected by chance. The current leverage values suggest that these associations are meaningful.

---

**Assessment of a Local Minimum and Iteration Sufficiency:**

- **Improved Confidence and Lift**: The increase in confidence and lift values implies that the rules have become more effective at predicting the desired outcomes compared to the baseline.

- **Reduced Support**: The decrease in support indicates that the rules are becoming too specific, potentially overfitting the training data. This specificity might not translate well to unseen data.

- **Potential Overfitting**: The trade-off between higher confidence/lift and lower support suggests that the model may be capturing noise or outliers rather than general patterns.

- **Iteration Sufficiency**: Given that confidence and lift have improved but at the cost of support, it may indicate that we are approaching a local minimum in terms of model performance.

---

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules:**

1. **Increase Rule Generalization:**

   - **Objective**: Modify the rules to cover a broader range of data without significantly reducing confidence and lift.
   - **Method**: Identify common features among the high-yield modifiers that have been excluded due to overly specific conditions and adjust the rules to include them.
   - **Benefit**: This should increase support while maintaining acceptable levels of confidence and lift.

2. **Balance Specificity and Coverage:**

   - **Objective**: Find an optimal balance where the rules are neither too general (low confidence/lift) nor too specific (low support).
   - **Method**: Re-evaluate thresholds or condition parameters within the rules to include more instances without introducing too much noise.
   - **Benefit**: Enhances the generalizability of the rules to new data.

3. **Evaluate Rule Redundancy and Merge Similar Rules:**

   - **Objective**: Simplify the rule set by combining rules that have similar conditions and outcomes.
   - **Method**: Analyze overlapping rules (e.g., Rules 2 and 6 both involve aromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating groups) and consider merging them.
   - **Benefit**: This can increase support and maintain high confidence and lift by capturing a broader pattern.

4. **Incorporate Validation with Test Data:**

   - **Objective**: Ensure that the improvements in metrics are not due to overfitting.
   - **Method**: Apply the current rules to a separate test dataset and evaluate the metrics (confidence, lift, support, leverage) on this new data.
   - **Benefit**: Validates the effectiveness of the rules and provides insight into their real-world applicability.

5. **Adjust Rules with Low Support:**

   - **Objective**: Reconsider rules that apply to very few cases.
   - **Method**: For rules with support below a certain threshold (e.g., less than 0.05), assess whether they can be generalized or if they should be removed.
   - **Benefit**: Improves the overall robustness and practicality of the rule set.

6. **Explore Additional Features and Conditions:**

   - **Objective**: Identify new patterns that may improve rule performance.
   - **Method**: Analyze the dataset for additional features (e.g., steric effects, solvent interactions) that could be incorporated into the rules.
   - **Benefit**: Potentially increases both the support and confidence of the rules by capturing more comprehensive patterns.

---

**Conclusion:**

The current iteration of rules demonstrates improvements in **confidence** and **lift**, indicating stronger predictive power and more significant associations between conditions and outcomes compared to the baseline reference metrics. However, the reduced **support** suggests that the rules are applicable to a smaller subset of data, which may limit their usefulness.

To enhance the performance of the current rules, focus should be on:

- **Generalizing the rules** to cover a broader range of data points.
- **Maintaining high confidence and lift** values while increasing support.
- **Preventing overfitting** by ensuring the rules are validated on unseen data.
- **Balancing specificity and coverage** to create a robust and practical rule set.

By implementing these recommendations, the rules can be refined to achieve better overall performance, ensuring they are both **effective predictors** and **widely applicable** within the dataset.

- **Iteration 4:** 0.6857
- **Current Iteration:** 0.6571

The highest validation accuracy achieved was **0.7714**. The current accuracy indicates a decrease compared to the peak performance and suggests that the model's predictive capability has not improved consistently over iterations. This fluctuation may be due to overfitting to specific data subsets or underfitting due to overly generalized rules.

**Analysis Based on SHAP Values:**

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values help identify the contribution of each rule to the model's predictions. By analyzing the SHAP values for molecules where the model's predictions do not align with experimental values, we can pinpoint which rules may need refinement.

**1. Overestimated Loadings (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**

When the model predicts a high loading but the experimental value is low, rules with high positive SHAP values are likely contributing to the overestimation.

- **Molecule:** C1=CC(=C(C=C1C=O)C(=O)O)O
  - **Predicted Loading:** High
  - **Experimental Value:** Low
  - **Notable SHAP Values:**
    - **Rule4:** +0.0540
    - **Rule8:** +0.0338
    - **Rule10:** +0.0496
  - **Analysis:** Rules **4**, **8**, and **10** have significant positive SHAP values, indicating they are major contributors to the incorrect high prediction.

- **Molecule:** CC1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=O)O
  - **Predicted Loading:** High
  - **Experimental Value:** Low
  - **Notable SHAP Values:**
    - **Rule4:** +0.0503
    - **Rule6:** +0.0990
    - **Rule7:** +0.0283
    - **Rule8:** +0.0249
    - **Rule10:** +0.0283
  - **Analysis:** Rules **4**, **6**, **7**, **8**, and **10** have high positive SHAP values, contributing to the overestimation.

**2. Underestimated Loadings (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**

When the model predicts a low loading but the experimental value is high, rules with high negative SHAP values are likely causing the underestimation.

- **Molecule:** C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O
  - **Predicted Loading:** Low
  - **Experimental Value:** High
  - **Notable SHAP Values:**
    - **Rule6:** -0.0813
    - **Rule1:** -0.0225
    - **Rule3:** -0.0226
  - **Analysis:** **Rule6** has the most significant negative SHAP value, indicating it may be suppressing the prediction incorrectly.

- **Molecule:** C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)N
  - **Predicted Loading:** Low
  - **Experimental Value:** High
  - **Notable SHAP Values:**
    - **Rule6:** -0.0813
    - **Rule1:** -0.0225
    - **Rule3:** -0.0226
  - **Analysis:** Similar to the previous molecule, **Rule6** is likely causing the underestimation.

- **Molecule:** C([C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](C(=O)O)O)O)O)O)O
  - **Predicted Loading:** Low
  - **Experimental Value:** High
  - **Notable SHAP Values:**
    - **Rule6:** -0.0813
  - **Analysis:** Again, **Rule6** is a significant negative contributor.

- **Molecule:** C1=CC=C2C(=C1)C(=CN2)C[C@H](C(=O)O)N
  - **Predicted Loading:** Low
  - **Experimental Value:** High
  - **Notable SHAP Values:**
    - **Rule7:** -0.1639
    - **Rule1:** -0.0124
    - **Rule3:** -0.0120
  - **Analysis:** **Rule7** has a large negative SHAP value, suggesting it is causing the underestimation.

**3. Consistent Issues Across Molecules:**

- **Rule6** frequently has large negative SHAP values for molecules where the model underestimates loading.
- **Rules 4**, **6**, **7**, **8**, and **10** have high positive SHAP values in cases of overestimation.
- **Rule1** occasionally shows negative SHAP values contributing to underestimation.

**Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting:**

- **Overfitting:** The fluctuation in accuracy suggests that the model may be overfitting to certain features captured by the current rules. High positive SHAP values in overestimations indicate that some rules might be too specific to the training data and not generalizing well.
- **Underfitting:** Negative SHAP values in underestimations may indicate that certain rules are too restrictive or failing to capture essential features, leading to underfitting.

**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules:**

The current rules, while comprehensive, may not effectively differentiate between modifiers that lead to high or low loading in all cases. Specifically:

- **Rule6 (Heteroaromatic Carboxylic Acids):** Appears to incorrectly penalize some molecules that should be predicted as high loading.
- **Rule7 (Amino Acids with Aromatic Side Chains):** May not account for exceptions or additional factors influencing loading.
- **Rule4, Rule8, Rule10:** Their criteria might be too broad, leading to overestimations in certain cases.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

1. **Refine Rule6:**

   - **Issue:** **Rule6** is contributing to underestimations due to high negative SHAP values.
   - **Action:** Re-express Rule6 to account for substituents or structural elements that may impact coordination with metal centers.
   - **Suggestion:** Include conditions to differentiate between different types of heteroaromatic rings or to account for steric hindrance and electronic effects of additional substituents.

2. **Adjust Rule7:**

   - **Issue:** **Rule7** has high negative SHAP values in underestimations, indicating it may not accurately predict loading for all amino acids with aromatic side chains.
   - **Action:** Modify Rule7 to consider the nature and position of coordinating heteroatoms within the aromatic side chains.
   - **Suggestion:** Clarify or redefine what constitutes a "coordinating heteroatom" and consider the influence of side chain flexibility and electronic properties.

3. **Refine Rule4:**

   - **Issue:** **Rule4** may be too general, leading to overestimations when polar functional groups are present.
   - **Action:** Narrow down the criteria to better distinguish between modifiers that genuinely lead to high yield and those that do not.
   - **Suggestion:** Specify the types of polar functional groups that negate the positive effect of long hydrophobic chains, and consider chain length thresholds more precisely.

4. **Revise Rule8 and Rule10:**

   - **Issue:** Both rules contribute to overestimations, possibly due to overly broad statements about electron-withdrawing groups and amide derivatives.
   - **Action:** Reevaluate these rules to incorporate exceptions and additional structural factors.
   - **Suggestion for Rule8:** Differentiate between the effects of various electron-withdrawing groups and their positions relative to coordination sites.
   - **Suggestion for Rule10:** Recognize that not all amide derivatives reduce yield and consider the context of amide presence in the molecule.

5. **Incorporate Additional Rules or Features:**

   - **Action:** Introduce new rules that capture missing patterns or refine existing rules with more specific descriptors.
   - **Suggestion:** Consider rules that account for:

     - **Steric Effects:** Large substituents near coordination sites may hinder binding.
     - **Electronic Effects:** The electron density on coordinating atoms affects their ability to interact with metal centers.
     - **Solubility Factors:** Modifiers that affect the solubility of the catalyst or substrates may influence loading.

6. **Improve Generalization:**

   - **Action:** Balance the specificity and generality of the rules to enhance model performance across diverse molecules.
   - **Suggestion:** Use cross-validation and regularization techniques to prevent overfitting during model training.

7. **Iterative Refinement Using SHAP Analysis:**

   - **Action:** Continuously use SHAP values to identify rules that contribute to prediction errors.
   - **Suggestion:** After adjusting the rules, retrain the model and reassess SHAP values to evaluate the impact of changes.

8. **Consider Quantitative Descriptors:**

   - **Action:** Augment rule-based features with quantitative molecular descriptors (e.g., partial charges, steric parameters).
   - **Suggestion:** Incorporate descriptors such as HOMO-LUMO gaps, dipole moments, or other computational chemistry parameters that may correlate with loading.

9. **Address Overfitting/Underfitting:**

   - **Overfitting Mitigation:**
     - Simplify overly complex rules that may be capturing noise.
     - Ensure that rules are not too tailored to the training data.
   - **Underfitting Mitigation:**
     - Add new rules or features to capture missing relationships.
     - Ensure that rules are comprehensive enough to model the complexity of the data.

10. **Validate with External Data:**

    - **Action:** Test the refined model on an independent dataset to assess generalization.
    - **Suggestion:** Use experimental data not previously used in training to evaluate model performance objectively.

**Conclusion:**

The analysis of accuracies and SHAP values indicates that certain rules within the current set are contributing to mispredictions. By refining these rules—particularly Rules **6**, **7**, **4**, **8**, and **10**—we can improve the model's predictive accuracy. Adjusting rules to better capture the nuances of molecular interactions, considering both structural and electronic factors, will enhance the model's generalization. Regularly employing SHAP analysis in an iterative refinement process will help identify problematic areas and guide effective modifications to the rule set.

---

**Note:** The recommendations aim to refine the rules based on their contribution to incorrect predictions, as indicated by SHAP values. The focus is on rules that frequently contribute to overestimations or underestimations, with the goal of improving overall model performance.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

After analyzing the current rules and their performance metrics, several key observations and suggestions have emerged to improve the prediction of the remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction yield:

1. **Improved Confidence and Lift but Reduced Support:**
   - **Observation:** The current rules exhibit higher confidence and lift compared to the previous iterations, indicating stronger associations between the rules and the desired outcomes.
   - **Concern:** The support for the current rules has decreased, meaning they apply to fewer cases in the dataset. This suggests that the rules may have become too specific, potentially overfitting the training data and reducing their generalizability.

2. **SHAP Analysis Identifies Rules Contributing to Misclassifications:**
   - **Underestimations:** Rules such as **Rule 6** (heteroaromatic carboxylic acids) and **Rule 7** (amino acids with aromatic side chains) frequently have negative SHAP values in cases where the model underpredicts yield.
   - **Overestimations:** Rules like **Rule 4**, **Rule 8**, and **Rule 10** have high positive SHAP values in cases where the model overpredicts yield.

3. **Potential Overfitting and Underfitting:**
   - The fluctuation in validation accuracies across iterations (ranging from 62.86% to 77.14%) indicates inconsistency in the model's predictive capability.
   - Overfitting may be present due to overly specific rules that capture noise rather than general patterns, while underfitting may result from rules that are too general and fail to capture essential molecular characteristics.

**Suggestions to Improve Current Rules**

To enhance the performance and generalizability of the rules without overfitting, the following suggestions are proposed:

1. **Generalize SMARTS Patterns in **Rule 2** and **Rule 3**: 
   - **Issue:** The current SMARTS patterns for detecting para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids are too specific, potentially missing relevant compounds due to variations in molecular representations.
   - **Suggestion:** Develop more general SMARTS patterns that focus on identifying an aromatic ring with a carboxylic acid group and any substituent at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid. Utilize wildcard atoms and relative positional specifications to capture a broader range of molecules.
   - **Benefit:** This will increase the support of the rules by including more compounds, improving the model's applicability and reducing the chance of overfitting.

2. **Modify SMARTS Patterns for Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids in **Rule 5**:
   - **Issue:** The current patterns match only aliphatic carboxylic acids with exactly four carbons, excluding valid modifiers with five-carbon chains.
   - **Suggestion:** Adjust the SMARTS patterns to include short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with up to five carbons after the carboxylic carbon. For example, use patterns that allow for variable chain lengths within the specified range.
   - **Benefit:** This modification will align the rule with its definition and increase the rule's support, enhancing its predictive power without sacrificing confidence.

3. **Refine SMARTS Patterns in **Rule 6**:
   - **Issue:** The pattern `[n]` may match any nitrogen in an aromatic ring without ensuring it's part of a heteroaromatic system directly connected to a carboxylic acid.
   - **Suggestion:** Combine the heteroaromatic nitrogen pattern with the carboxylic acid group to ensure specificity. For instance, use patterns like `n1cccc1C(=O)O` or `n1ccccc1C(=O)O` to match heteroaromatic rings containing nitrogen directly attached to a carboxylic acid.
   - **Benefit:** This will prevent misclassification of compounds and improve the accuracy of **Rule 6**, reducing underestimations observed in SHAP analysis.

4. **Improve Detection of Aromatic Side Chains in **Rule 7**:
   - **Issue:** Current patterns may not account for all forms of aromatic amino acids, potentially missing tautomers or different representations.
   - **Suggestion:** Utilize comprehensive SMARTS patterns that capture various forms of indole and phenyl groups. For indole rings, use patterns like `c1c[cH][cH][nH]c1` to detect different tautomers. For phenylalanine, ensure the pattern includes variations in side chain representations.
   - **Benefit:** Enhancing these patterns will reduce false negatives and improve the rule's ability to distinguish between high and low yield modifiers, addressing underestimations.

5. **Adjust **Rule 4** to Consider Polar Functional Groups More Precisely:
   - **Issue:** **Rule 4** may be too general, leading to overestimations when modifiers have polar functional groups on long aliphatic chains.
   - **Suggestion:** Explicitly specify which polar functional groups negate the positive effect of long hydrophobic chains (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) and set precise chain length thresholds. For example, define long chains as those with six or more carbons and exclude modifiers with polar groups within a certain proximity to the carboxylate group.
   - **Benefit:** This refinement will improve the rule's specificity, reducing overestimations and enhancing the model's accuracy.

6. **Reevaluate **Rule 8** and **Rule 10** for Specificity:
   - **Issue:** These rules may be too broad, leading to overestimations by not accounting for the varying effects of different electron-withdrawing groups and amide derivatives.
   - **Suggestion for **Rule 8****: Differentiate between the strength and position of electron-withdrawing groups. Modify the rule to consider the overall electronic effect on potential coordination sites.
   - **Suggestion for **Rule 10****: Recognize that not all amide derivatives reduce yield equally. Specify conditions under which amide groups significantly impact coordination (e.g., when they block key coordination sites).
   - **Benefit:** Refining these rules will reduce misclassifications and improve model reliability.

7. **Balance Specificity and Generality Across All Rules**:
   - **Suggestion:** Review all SMARTS patterns to avoid overly specific atom mappings. Focus on functional groups and connectivity rather than exact atom numbering or stereochemistry unless crucial.
   - **Benefit:** This approach prevents the rules from becoming too narrow, increasing support while maintaining high confidence and lift.

8. **Incorporate Additional Molecular Descriptors**:
   - **Suggestion:** Augment rule-based features with quantitative molecular descriptors such as partial charges, steric parameters, and solvent interactions.
   - **Benefit:** Including these descriptors can capture nuances not addressed by the current rules, improving predictive performance without overfitting.

9. **Validate Rules with External Data**:
   - **Suggestion:** Test the refined rules on an independent dataset to assess their generalizability and prevent overfitting.
   - **Benefit:** External validation ensures that improvements in metrics reflect true predictive capability rather than fitting to training data anomalies.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

There is significant potential for further optimizing the current rules without overfitting:

- **Increasing Support While Maintaining Confidence**: By generalizing the SMARTS patterns and refining the rules as suggested, we can increase the support of the rules, making them applicable to a broader range of modifiers without sacrificing confidence and lift.

- **Addressing Misclassifications Identified by SHAP Analysis**: Refining rules that contribute to underestimations and overestimations will improve model accuracy. Adjusting these rules can help balance the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.

- **Enhancing Generalizability**: By focusing on fundamental chemical principles and avoiding over-reliance on specific molecular representations, we can create rules that generalize better to new, unseen data.

- **Preventing Overfitting**: Regularization techniques and cross-validation can be employed during model training to ensure that the rules capture underlying patterns rather than noise.

**Conclusion**

Given the above analysis and suggestions, further optimization of the current rules is both possible and advisable. Implementing these recommendations will likely improve the model's predictive performance, increase its applicability, and enhance its reliability in predicting reaction yields.

**Please Optimize Rules**

    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (α-amino acids with two carboxylic acid groups) lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)
  - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)

  **Explanation**: The presence of an α-amino group and two carboxylic acid groups provides multiple coordination sites to the metal catalyst. This enhances metal-ligand interactions, improving catalytic activity and leading to high yield.

---

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituents capable of coordinating to metal centers (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl, pyridyl groups) lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 4-aminobenzoic acid
  - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
  - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Para-substituents that can coordinate with metal centers enhance the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst. This strengthens catalyst-modifier interactions, improving catalytic efficiency and leading to high yield.

---

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituents incapable of coordinating to metal centers or with strong electron-withdrawing groups that do not coordinate lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 4-methylbenzoic acid
  - 4-formylbenzoic acid
  - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Non-coordinating substituents or strong electron-withdrawing groups can decrease the effectiveness of metal coordination. This weakens catalyst-modifier interactions, reducing catalytic efficiency and leading to low yield.

---

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrophobic chains (six or more carbons) without additional polar functional groups lead to high yield; inclusion of polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) on long chains leads to low yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:
  - Octanoic acid

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Hydrophobic long-chain acids may enhance interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or improve substrate accessibility, boosting reactivity and leading to high yield. Additional polar groups on long chains can introduce unfavorable solvation effects or steric hindrance, interfering with effective coordination and lowering yield.

---

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (five carbons or fewer) containing amino or thiol groups lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 5-aminopentanoic acid
  - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Terminal amino or thiol groups in close proximity to the carboxylate can efficiently coordinate with the metal centers in the catalyst. This enhances catalyst-modifier interactions and improves catalytic performance, leading to high yield.

---

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen in the aromatic ring lead to high yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)
  - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
  - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

  **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings act as additional coordination sites for the metal centers in the catalyst. This strengthens catalyst-modifier interactions, enhancing catalytic activity and yielding higher product formation.

---

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms (e.g., indole ring in tryptophan) lead to high yield; those with aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms (e.g., phenyl group in phenylalanine) lead to low yield.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:
  - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:
  - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)

  **Explanation**: Heteroatoms in the aromatic side chain can coordinate with the metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity through additional interactions. Aromatic side chains without heteroatoms lack this coordinating ability and may hinder catalyst interactions, reducing yield.

---

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers containing strong electron-withdrawing groups such as fluorinated alkyl chains lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Strong electron-withdrawing effects from fluorinated groups decrease the basicity of coordinating atoms and destabilize catalyst-modifier interactions. This reduces the binding affinity to the metal centers, diminishing catalytic performance and leading to low yield.

---

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers that are sugar acids or polyhydroxy carboxylic acids lead to high yield due to multiple coordination sites provided by hydroxyl groups.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:
  - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

  **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous coordination sites and enhance solubility. This allows for extensive interactions and chelation with the catalyst's metal centers, improving catalytic efficiency and leading to high yield.

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers that are amide derivatives of carboxylic acids or contain peptide bonds lead to low yield.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
  - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

  **Explanation**: Amide formation reduces the availability of lone pairs on nitrogen and oxygen atoms for coordination with metal centers. This decreases catalyst-modifier interactions, leading to reduced catalytic efficiency and lower yield.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Generalize SMARTS Patterns in Rule 2 and Rule 3 to Capture a Broader Range of Para-Substituted Aromatic Carboxylic Acids**

  - **Issue**: The current SMARTS patterns for Rules 2 and 3 are too specific, potentially missing relevant modifiers due to variations in molecular structures and representations.
  
  - **Action**: Modify the SMARTS patterns to identify any aromatic carboxylic acid with a para-substituent, focusing on the functional capability of the substituent to coordinate with metal centers.
  
    - **For Rule 2 (High Yield Modifiers)**:
      - Use a more general pattern like `c1ccc([CX3](=O)[O-])cc1[a]` where `[a]` represents substituents capable of metal coordination (e.g., `[NH2]`, `[N]`, `[O]`, `[Br]`, `[Cl]`, `[F]`).
      - Example SMARTS: `c1ccc(cc1)C(=O)[O-]` with a substituent `[a]` at the para position.
  
    - **For Rule 3 (Low Yield Modifiers)**:
      - Use a similar pattern but specify substituents that are incapable of coordinating or are strong electron-withdrawing groups without lone pairs for coordination (e.g., alkyl groups, aldehydes, ketones).
      - Example SMARTS: `c1ccc([CX3](=O)[O-])cc1[R]` where `[R]` is a non-coordinating substituent like `[CH3]`, `[C=O]`, `[C]`.
  
  - **Benefit**: This generalization increases rule support by capturing more compounds with para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids, improving the model's applicability and reducing overfitting.

- **Advice 2**: **Modify SMARTS Patterns in Rule 5 to Include Short-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids with Up to Five Carbons**

  - **Issue**: The current patterns only match aliphatic carboxylic acids with exactly four carbons, excluding valid modifiers with five-carbon chains.
  
  - **Action**: Adjust the SMARTS patterns to include aliphatic chains of variable lengths up to five carbons, combined with amino or thiol groups.
  
    - Use patterns like `C(=O)[O-][CH2]{1,4}[CH2][NX3H2]` for amino groups and `C(=O)[O-][CH2]{1,4}[CH2][SX2H]` for thiol groups.
  
  - **Benefit**: Aligns the rule with its definition, increases rule support, and enhances predictive power without sacrificing confidence.

- **Advice 3**: **Refine SMARTS Patterns in Rule 6 to Specifically Detect Heteroaromatic Carboxylic Acids with Nitrogen**

  - **Issue**: The pattern `[n]` may match any nitrogen in an aromatic ring without ensuring it's part of a heteroaromatic system directly connected to a carboxylic acid group.
  
  - **Action**: Combine heteroaromatic nitrogen patterns with the carboxylic acid group in the SMARTS.
  
    - Use SMARTS like `[n][c]1[cH][cH][cH][cH]1C(=O)[O-]` to detect pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.
    - For other heteroaromatics, adjust accordingly, ensuring the nitrogen atom is part of the ring attached to the carboxylate.
  
  - **Benefit**: Prevents misclassifications, improves the accuracy of Rule 6, and reduces underestimations observed in SHAP analysis.

- **Advice 4**: **Enhance Detection of Aromatic Side Chains in Rule 7 with Comprehensive SMARTS Patterns**

  - **Issue**: Current patterns may not account for all forms of aromatic amino acids, potentially missing valid modifiers like tryptophan.
  
  - **Action**: Utilize SMARTS patterns that capture various forms of indole and phenyl groups connected to the amino acid backbone.
  
    - For tryptophan (high yield): Use SMARTS like `N[C@@H](CC1=CNC2=CC=CC=C12)C(=O)[O-]` to detect the indole side chain.
    - For phenylalanine (low yield): Use SMARTS like `N[C@@H](CC1=CC=CC=C1)C(=O)[O-]` to detect the phenyl side chain.
  
  - **Benefit**: Reduces false negatives, improves differentiation between high and low yield modifiers, and enhances rule precision.

- **Advice 5**: **Adjust Rule 4 to Precisely Address the Impact of Polar Functional Groups on Long Aliphatic Chains**

  - **Issue**: Rule 4 may be too general, leading to overestimations when polar functional groups are present on long aliphatic chains.
  
  - **Action**: Specify which polar functional groups negate the positive effect of long hydrophobic chains and set precise chain length thresholds.
  
    - Define long chains as those with six or more carbons beyond the carboxylic carbon.
    - Specify that the presence of hydroxyl (`[OH]`), amino (`[NH2]`), or other polar groups on the chain reduces yield.
    - For high yield modifiers (e.g., octanoic acid): Use SMARTS like `C(=O)[O-][CH2]{6,}` without polar groups.
    - For low yield modifiers with polar groups: Use SMARTS like `C(=O)[O-][CH2]{5,}[OH,NH2]`.
  
  - **Benefit**: Improves rule specificity, reduces overestimations, and enhances model accuracy.

- **Advice 6**: **Reevaluate Rule 8 and Rule 10 for Specificity Concerning Electron-Withdrawing Groups and Amide Derivatives**

  - **Issue**: These rules are too broad, leading to overestimations by not accounting for variations in electron-withdrawing effects and amide placements.
  
  - **Action for Rule 8**:
    - Differentiate between the strength and position of electron-withdrawing groups.
    - Specify that strong electron-withdrawing groups directly attached to potential coordination sites (e.g., perfluorinated chains) lead to low yield.
    - Use SMARTS like `C(=O)[O-][C](F)(F)F` for trifluoromethyl groups.
  
  - **Action for Rule 10**:
    - Recognize that amide groups directly adjacent to the carboxylate reduce coordination potential.
    - Use SMARTS patterns that detect amide functionalities connected to the carboxylate, such as `C(=O)N[C]` adjacent to `C(=O)[O-]`.
  
  - **Benefit**: Refines rule specificity, reduces misclassifications, and enhances model reliability.

- **Advice 7**: **Balance Specificity and Generality Across All Rules by Reviewing and Refining SMARTS Patterns**

  - **Issue**: Overly specific atom mappings can cause rules to become too narrow, while overly general patterns may miss critical details.
  
  - **Action**:
    - Remove unnecessary stereochemistry specifications and exact atom numbering unless essential.
    - Focus on key functional groups, connectivity, and relative positioning.
    - Use wildcard atoms (`*`) and recursive SMARTS to capture essential features without overcomplicating the pattern.
  
  - **Benefit**: Increases rule applicability, prevents overfitting, and ensures that rules capture fundamental chemical principles.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Combine Similar Rules to Enhance Clarity and Coverage**

  - *Combine Rules 2 and 8*: Both rules address aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituents influencing yield based on their coordinating abilities. Merge them into a single rule that differentiates between substituents that lead to high yield (coordinating groups like amino, nitro, bromomethyl, pyridyl) and those that lead to low yield (non-coordinating or electron-donating groups like methyl, aldehyde, sulfanyl).

    - **Revised Rule**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituents capable of coordinating to metal centers (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl, pyridyl groups) lead to high yield, while those with non-coordinating or electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, aldehyde, sulfanyl) lead to low yield.*

  - *Combine Rules 4 and 12*: Both rules discuss long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids and the effect of polar functional groups. Consolidate them to state that long-chain aliphatic acids without polar groups lead to high yield, whereas introduction of polar groups like hydroxyl or amino leads to low yield.

    - **Revised Rule**: *Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (six or more carbons) without additional polar functional groups lead to high yield; introducing polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) on these chains leads to low yield.*

- **Advice 2**: **Remove or Revise Rules with Insufficient Data Points**

  - *Review Rules 5, 6, 7, 9, 14, and 15*: These rules are each supported by only one data point, which is insufficient for meeting the coverage criterion. Consider removing these rules or revising them to include additional data points or broader criteria to enhance their applicability.

    - **For Example**:
      - *Rule 5 (Polyhydroxy carboxylic acids)*: Expand the rule by identifying more modifiers of this class that lead to high yield.
      - *Rule 7 (Amino acids with coordinating heteroatoms)*: Include other amino acids like histidine with imidazole side chains to strengthen the rule.

- **Advice 3**: **Generalize Rules for Greater Applicability**

  - *Broaden Specific Rules*: Generalize rules that are currently too narrow and cover only a limited number of modifiers.

    - *Example with Rule 5*: Instead of focusing solely on polyhydroxy carboxylic acids, expand the rule to include other multi-hydroxyl-containing acids that may enhance coordination due to multiple binding sites.

    - *Example with Rule 7*: Instead of limiting to amino acids with indole rings, generalize to amino acids with side chains containing nitrogen heterocycles capable of metal coordination.

- **Advice 4**: **Enhance Physical-Chemical Explanations**

  - *Strengthen the Rationales*: Provide more detailed and scientifically robust explanations for why certain structural features impact the yield. This will improve the understanding and predictive power of the rules.

    - *Include Concepts Such As*:
      - Steric effects influencing catalyst access.
      - Electronic factors like electron density and its impact on metal coordination.
      - Solvation effects and their influence on catalyst-modifier interactions.

- **Advice 5**: **Ensure Rules Strike a Balance Between Specificity and Coverage**

  - *Avoid Overly Specific Rules*: Rules should not be so narrowly defined that they apply to only one modifier. Aim for rules that encompass a class of compounds sharing common structural features influencing the yield.

    - *For Instance*: Instead of a rule only for 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid (Rule 15), consider a rule for aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating methoxy groups and additional coordinating carbonyl groups in the side chain.

- **Advice 6**: **Incorporate Additional Data to Support or Refine Rules**

  - *Collect More Data Points*: For rules with limited supporting data, gather additional experimental results to validate and strengthen the rules.

    - *Focus Areas*:
      - Polyhydroxy acids (Rule 5): Test other sugar acids.
      - Amino acids with heteroatoms (Rule 7): Evaluate modifiers like histidine and cysteine.
      - Aromatic carboxylic acids with specific substituents (Rules 9, 14, 15): Investigate similar compounds to enhance coverage.

- **Advice 7**: **Review and Optimize Rule Complexity**

  - *Simplify Overly Complex Rules*: Ensure that the rules are not unnecessarily complicated, which can hinder their practical application.

    - *Streamline Rules*: Remove redundant elements or overly detailed specifications that do not significantly contribute to differentiating between high and low yield modifiers.

- **Advice 8**: **Align Rules with Practical Synthetic Considerations**

  - *Consider Synthetic Accessibility and Stability*: Incorporate considerations about the practical aspects of modifiers, such as their stability under reaction conditions and ease of synthesis.

    - *Adjust Rules Accordingly*: If certain modifiers are prone to side reactions or degradation, reflect this in the rules to prevent their selection despite favorable theoretical properties.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 identifies amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking coordinating heteroatoms as leading to low yield. The property insight is reasonable, explaining reduced interaction with metal centers. The rule combines structural features, meeting complexity criteria. However, it is supported by only one data point (phenylalanine). Additional supporting data would enhance the coverage and validity of this rule.
- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 clearly states that modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups lead to low yield. The property insight regarding decreased basicity of coordinating atoms is valid. The rule addresses specific functional groups, satisfying complexity. It is supported by at least two data points, fulfilling the coverage criterion. The rule maintains a good balance between specificity and applicability.
- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear in defining modifiers as long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with additional polar functional groups leading to low yield. The property insight regarding unfavorable solvation or steric hindrance is plausible. The rule combines structural elements, fulfilling complexity criteria. It is supported by at least three data points, meeting the coverage requirement. The rule balances specificity and coverage effectively.
- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 identifies modifiers containing amide bonds or peptide linkages as leading to low yield. The property insight regarding decreased availability of lone pairs is valid. The rule focuses on specific bond types, satisfying complexity. It is supported by at least three data points, fulfilling the coverage criterion. The rule maintains a good balance between specificity and applicability.
- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 specifies that aromatic carboxylic acids with para-sulfanyl groups lead to low yield. The property insight is logical, considering potential side reactions. However, it is supported by only one data point, limiting its coverage. The rule may benefit from additional data points to strengthen its validity.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are **α-amino dicarboxylic acids** (α-amino acids with two carboxyl groups) lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)
  - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)

  **Explanation**: The presence of an α-amino group and two carboxyl groups allows for effective chelation with metal centers in the catalyst. This enhances metal-ligand interactions, stabilizes the catalyst, and improves catalytic activity, leading to high yield.

---

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **para-substituted amino, hydroxy, or nitro groups** lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 4-aminobenzoic acid
  - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
  - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Electron-donating or coordinating substituents at the para-position enhance the ability of the aromatic ring to interact with metal centers. This strengthens catalyst-modifier interactions and improves catalytic efficiency, resulting in high yield.

---

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms** in the aromatic ring lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)
  - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
  - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

  **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings act as additional coordination sites for metal centers. This enhances the stability of the metal-ligand complex, improves catalytic activity, and results in high yield.

---

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with chain lengths of **five carbons or fewer** containing **amino or thiol groups** lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 5-aminopentanoic acid
  - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Amino and thiol groups can effectively coordinate with the metal centers in the catalyst. Short-chain aliphatic acids with these functional groups facilitate strong metal-ligand interactions, enhancing catalyst performance and leading to high yield.

---

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids** (sugar acids) lead to **high yield** due to multiple hydroxyl groups providing several coordination sites.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:
  - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

  **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups offer numerous coordination sites, allowing for extensive chelation with metal centers. This strengthens catalyst-modifier interactions and enhances catalytic efficiency, leading to high yield.

---

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers that are **amino acids with aromatic side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms** (e.g., indole ring in tryptophan) lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:
  - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)

  **Explanation**: Heteroatoms in the aromatic side chain serve as additional coordination sites, enhancing metal-ligand interactions. This improves catalyst stability and activity, resulting in high yield.

---

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-donating methoxy groups** and a **ketone in the side chain** lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:
  - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Electron-donating methoxy groups increase electron density on the aromatic ring, facilitating better coordination with metal centers. The ketone group can also participate in metal coordination, strengthening catalyst-modifier interactions and improving catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** (six or more carbons) **without additional polar functional groups** lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:
  - Octanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Long hydrophobic chains may enhance interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or improve substrate accessibility. This can enhance catalytic activity and lead to high yield.

---

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **para-substituted non-coordinating groups** (e.g., methyl, formyl) lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 4-methylbenzoic acid
  - 4-formylbenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Non-coordinating substituents or electron-donating groups may decrease the ability of the aromatic ring to interact effectively with metal centers. This weakens catalyst-modifier interactions and reduces catalytic efficiency, leading to low yield.

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **ortho-hydroxyl and aldehyde groups** lead to **low yield** due to intramolecular interactions.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:
  - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Intramolecular hydrogen bonding between ortho-hydroxyl and aldehyde groups can reduce the availability of functional groups for metal coordination. This weakens catalyst-modifier interactions and leads to low yield.

---

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are **amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking coordinating heteroatoms** (e.g., phenyl group in phenylalanine) lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:
  - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)

  **Explanation**: Aromatic side chains without coordinating heteroatoms have limited interaction with metal centers. This reduces catalyst-modifier interactions and catalytic efficiency, leading to low yield.

---

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers containing **strong electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups** lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Strong electron-withdrawing effects from fluorinated groups decrease the basicity of coordinating atoms, destabilizing catalyst-modifier interactions. This reduces binding affinity to metal centers and diminishes catalytic performance.

---

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **additional polar functional groups** (e.g., hydroxyl, amino groups) lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Polar functional groups on long aliphatic chains can introduce unfavorable solvation effects or steric hindrance. This interferes with effective catalyst-modifier interactions and reduces catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids containing amide bonds or peptide linkages** lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
  - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
  - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]ethanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Amide formation reduces the availability of lone pairs on nitrogen and oxygen atoms for coordination with metal centers. This decreases catalyst-modifier interactions and catalytic efficiency, resulting in low yield.

---

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **para-sulfanyl groups** lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:
  - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Sulfanyl groups may form disulfide bonds or engage in undesired side reactions. This can interfere with effective metal coordination and catalyst performance, resulting in low yield.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Revise Positional Substitution in SMARTS Patterns**  
  The current SMARTS patterns for rules involving para-substitution (e.g., Rule 2) may not match intended molecules because they rely on specific atom numbering and ring representations. Modify the SMARTS patterns to account for relative positions on the aromatic ring, ensuring that para-substituted groups are correctly identified regardless of the ring numbering or representation in the SMILES. For example, use recursive SMARTS or specify the spatial relationship between substituents:

  ```python
  # For para-substituted amino group on aromatic ring
  para_amino_aromatic = 'c1cc([#6])[cH][cH][c]1[NX3;H2,H1]'
  ```

  Alternatively, consider using distance relations:

  ```python
  para_substituted_aromatic = '[cH]1[cH][cH][cH][cH][cH]1'
  para_amino = '[NX3;H2,H1]'
  # Match an amino group connected to the ring, separated by three atoms from the carboxylic acid
  ```

- **Suggestion 2**: **Utilize Topology-Based Queries for Relative Positions**  
  Implement SMARTS patterns that use topology queries to specify the relative positions of substituents on the aromatic ring. For instance, for identifying para-substituted groups, use:

  ```python
  para_substituted_aromatic = 'c1cc([#6])[cH][cH][c]1[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
  substituent = '[NX3;H2,H1,OX2H,NX3(=O)=O]'
  # Map the substituent to the appropriate position
  ```

  This approach helps in matching molecules regardless of their SMILES representation.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Apply Functional Group Counting Carefully**  
  In Rule 1, the counting of carboxylic acid groups is crucial. Ensure that the `count_patterns` are correctly implemented and that they accurately count instances of the functional group in the molecule. Verify that the SMARTS used for counting are not overly restrictive and that they match all forms (protonated and deprotonated) of carboxyl groups.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Validate SMARTS Patterns Against Known Examples**  
  Before applying the patterns to the dataset, test each SMARTS pattern against known positive and negative examples. This validation step can help identify issues with the patterns. For instance, ensure that 4-aminobenzoic acid matches the pattern for Rule 2 and adjust the pattern if it does not.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Handle Tautomeric and Resonance Forms**  
  Some molecules may exist in different tautomeric or resonance forms. Update the SMARTS patterns to be flexible enough to match these variants. For example, consider both neutral and charged forms, and use aromaticity-aware patterns to capture all relevant structures.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Improve Patterns for Heteroaromatic Rings**  
  For Rule 3, ensure that the SMARTS patterns correctly identify heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms, even if the nitrogen is not adjacent to the carboxylic acid group. Use generalized patterns that can match any position of the nitrogen atom within the aromatic ring.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Reevaluate Exclude Patterns and Logical Conditions**  
  In some rules, exclude patterns might be inadvertently preventing correct matches. Review the use of `exclude_patterns` and ensure they do not conflict with the intended matches. Additionally, check the logical conditions for matching patterns, especially when multiple patterns must be present simultaneously.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Enhance Error Handling and Reporting**  
  Modify the code to include better error handling and informative messages when a pattern fails to compile or match. This will help in identifying problematic SMARTS patterns and debugging the code more efficiently.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Consider Using ChemSMARTS Queries for Complex Patterns**  
  For complex rules involving spatial arrangements (e.g., ortho, meta, para positions), consider using RDKit's ChemSMARTS queries or additional cheminformatics toolkits that provide more advanced querying capabilities.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Document and Comment the Code Thoroughly**  
  Add detailed comments and explanations for each SMARTS pattern and code block. This documentation will make it easier for collaborators to understand the patterns' intent and maintain or modify them in the future.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are **α-amino dicarboxylic acids** (α-amino acids with two carboxyl groups) lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)
  - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)

  **Explanation**: The presence of an α-amino group and two carboxyl groups allows for effective chelation with metal centers in the catalyst. This enhances metal-ligand interactions, stabilizes the catalyst, and improves catalytic activity, leading to high yield.

---

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **para-substituted amino, hydroxy, or nitro groups** lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 4-aminobenzoic acid
  - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
  - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Electron-donating or coordinating substituents at the para-position enhance the ability of the aromatic ring to interact with metal centers. This strengthens catalyst-modifier interactions and improves catalytic efficiency, resulting in high yield.

---

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms** in the aromatic ring lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)
  - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
  - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

  **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings act as additional coordination sites for metal centers. This enhances the stability of the metal-ligand complex, improves catalytic activity, and results in high yield.

---

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with chain lengths of **five carbons or fewer** containing **amino or thiol groups** lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 5-aminopentanoic acid
  - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Amino and thiol groups can effectively coordinate with the metal centers in the catalyst. Short-chain aliphatic acids with these functional groups facilitate strong metal-ligand interactions, enhancing catalyst performance and leading to high yield.

---

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids** (sugar acids) lead to **high yield** due to multiple hydroxyl groups providing several coordination sites.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:
  - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

  **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups offer numerous coordination sites, allowing for extensive chelation with metal centers. This strengthens catalyst-modifier interactions and enhances catalytic efficiency, leading to high yield.

---

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers that are **amino acids with aromatic side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms** (e.g., indole ring in tryptophan) lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:
  - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan)

  **Explanation**: Heteroatoms in the aromatic side chain serve as additional coordination sites, enhancing metal-ligand interactions. This improves catalyst stability and activity, resulting in high yield.

---

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-donating methoxy groups** and a **ketone in the side chain** lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:
  - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Electron-donating methoxy groups increase electron density on the aromatic ring, facilitating better coordination with metal centers. The ketone group can also participate in metal coordination, strengthening catalyst-modifier interactions and improving catalytic activity.

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** (six or more carbons) **without additional polar functional groups** lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:
  - Octanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Long hydrophobic chains may enhance interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or improve substrate accessibility. This can enhance catalytic activity and lead to high yield.

---

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **para-substituted non-coordinating groups** (e.g., methyl, formyl) lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 4-methylbenzoic acid
  - 4-formylbenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Non-coordinating substituents or electron-donating groups may decrease the ability of the aromatic ring to interact effectively with metal centers. This weakens catalyst-modifier interactions and reduces catalytic efficiency, leading to low yield.

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **ortho-hydroxyl and aldehyde groups** lead to **low yield** due to intramolecular interactions.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:
  - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Intramolecular hydrogen bonding between ortho-hydroxyl and aldehyde groups can reduce the availability of functional groups for metal coordination. This weakens catalyst-modifier interactions and leads to low yield.

---

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are **amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking coordinating heteroatoms** (e.g., phenyl group in phenylalanine) lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:
  - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)

  **Explanation**: Aromatic side chains without coordinating heteroatoms have limited interaction with metal centers. This reduces catalyst-modifier interactions and catalytic efficiency, leading to low yield.

---

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers containing **strong electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups** lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Strong electron-withdrawing effects from fluorinated groups decrease the basicity of coordinating atoms, destabilizing catalyst-modifier interactions. This reduces binding affinity to metal centers and diminishes catalytic performance.

---

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **additional polar functional groups** (e.g., hydroxyl, amino groups) lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Polar functional groups on long aliphatic chains can introduce unfavorable solvation effects or steric hindrance. This interferes with effective catalyst-modifier interactions and reduces catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids containing amide bonds or peptide linkages** lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
  - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
  - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]ethanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Amide formation reduces the availability of lone pairs on nitrogen and oxygen atoms for coordination with metal centers. This decreases catalyst-modifier interactions and catalytic efficiency, resulting in low yield.

---

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **para-sulfanyl groups** lead to **low yield**.*

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Adjust the SMARTS pattern for Rule 1 to correctly match α-amino dicarboxylic acids.** The current pattern may be too restrictive, only matching amino acids where both carboxyl groups are directly attached to the α-carbon. Compounds like aspartic acid and glutamic acid have the second carboxyl group on the side chain. Modify the pattern to allow for side chains containing carboxyl groups. For example, use a pattern like `'[NX3;H2,H1][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])[CH2][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` to include side chains with carboxyl groups.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Correct the SMARTS patterns for para-substitution in Rule 2.** The current patterns may incorrectly specify the substituent positions (ortho instead of para). Adjust the patterns to ensure the substituents are at the para position relative to the carboxyl group. For example, for para-amino substitution, use `'c1ccc(cc1[NX3;H2,H1])[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'`; similarly adjust patterns for hydroxy and nitro groups.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Revise the SMARTS pattern for Rule 3 to capture a broader range of heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms.** The current pattern may be too specific. Use a more general pattern like `'[nH0,nH1][a][a][a][a][a][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` or `'[nH0,nH1][a][a][a][a][a][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` to match various heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen atoms connected to a carboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Improve the SMARTS patterns for Rule 4 to accurately capture aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer containing amino or thiol groups.** Ensure that the chain length is correctly specified and that the amino or thiol groups can be anywhere along the chain. Use patterns like `'[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][C;X4]{1,4}[C;X4][NX3;H2,H1]'` and `'[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][C;X4]{1,4}[C;X4][SX2H]'`.

- **Suggestion 5**: **For Rule 5, broaden the SMARTS pattern to match various polyhydroxy carboxylic acids (sugar acids).** The current pattern may be too specific. Use a more general pattern that matches multiple hydroxyl groups attached to adjacent carbons, such as `'[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CX4]([OX2H])[CX4]([OX2H])[CX4]([OX2H])[CX4]([OX2H])'`.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Adjust the SMARTS pattern in Rule 6 to match amino acids with aromatic side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms more generally.** Instead of only matching tryptophan, create a pattern that includes other amino acids with coordinating heteroatoms in their side chains. For example, use a pattern like `'[NX3;H2,H1][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])[CX4][c][c][#7,#8,#16]'`.

- **Suggestion 7**: **For Rule 7, ensure the SMARTS pattern accounts for ketones in the side chain adjacent to the aromatic ring with methoxy groups.** Modify the pattern to `'c1cc(OC)ccc1CC(=O)[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` and verify it matches expected structures.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Review the exclude patterns in Rule 8 to ensure they prevent matching compounds with polar functional groups.** Confirm that the exclude patterns are properly compiled and applied before checking the main pattern. Also, consider using a more general exclude pattern that captures all common polar groups.

- **Suggestion 9**: **For Rule 9, adjust the patterns to correctly represent para-substituted non-coordinating groups, ensuring accurate position specificity.** Modify the patterns to `'c1ccc(cc1C)[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` for para-methyl and `'c1ccc(cc1C=O)[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` for para-formyl substitutions.

- **Suggestion 10**: **In Rule 10, verify that the SMARTS pattern correctly captures aromatic carboxylic acids with ortho-hydroxyl and aldehyde groups.** Adjust the pattern to `'c1c([OX2H])cc([C;X3]=O)cc1[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` to account for the aldehyde group properly.

- **Suggestion 11**: **Enhance robustness by testing SMARTS patterns against known example modifiers.** Before running the full dataset, validate each pattern individually using known examples to ensure they match as intended.

- **Suggestion 12**: **Implement detailed error handling and logging in the code to identify parsing and matching issues.** If a pattern fails to compile or match, the code should log the specific error to assist in troubleshooting.

- **Suggestion 13**: **Use RDKit's predefined functional group definitions where possible, or leverage cheminformatics expertise to refine patterns.** This can improve matching accuracy and efficiency.

- **Suggestion 14**: **Consider the impact of tautomerism and resonance on substructure matching.** Modify patterns to be more inclusive of different tautomeric forms if relevant to the rules.

- **Suggestion 15**: **Ensure that the code checks for and respects stereochemistry when necessary or ignores it when it's not critical.** Some patterns may fail to match due to stereochemical differences that are irrelevant to the rule's intent.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify and Quantify Functional Groups in Rules**

  Modify the current rules to focus on easily quantifiable functional groups and structural features directly extractable from SMILES strings. For example:

  - Instead of stating "modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids," specify "modifiers containing one amino group and two carboxyl groups."
  - Replace complex descriptions with counts of functional groups (e.g., number of amino groups, carboxyl groups, hydroxyl groups).

  **Implementation**: Create rules that use counts and presence/absence of specific functional groups, facilitating the generation of a numeric feature matrix from SMILES data.

- **Advice 2**: **Utilize Molecular Descriptors and Physicochemical Properties**

  Incorporate molecular descriptors and physicochemical properties that can be calculated from SMILES strings into the rules. Focus on properties such as:

  - **Hydrogen bond donors (HBD) and acceptors (HBA)**
  - **Log P (Partition coefficient)**
  - **Topological polar surface area (TPSA)**
  - **Molecular weight**
  - **Number of rotatable bonds**

  **Implementation**: Revise the rules to include thresholds or ranges of these properties (e.g., "Modifiers with TPSA greater than 60 Å² lead to high yield").

- **Advice 3**: **Rephrase Rules to Be Based on Structural Fragments**

  Define rules using specific substructures or fragments identifiable in SMILES strings. Utilize SMARTS patterns to detect these substructures. For example:

  - Identify the presence of specific rings (e.g., pyridine ring, indole ring).
  - Detect specific side chains or substituents (e.g., methoxy groups, nitro groups).

  **Implementation**: Rewrite rules to state "Modifiers containing a pyridine ring lead to high yield," which can be directly identified and quantified from SMILES.

- **Advice 4**: **Develop Binary Feature Matrix Using Fingerprints**

  Utilize molecular fingerprinting methods (e.g., Morgan fingerprints) to convert SMILES into binary feature vectors representing the presence or absence of substructures.

  **Implementation**: Generate a binary feature matrix for all modifiers and correlate specific bits (substructures) with high or low yield, refining the rules based on statistically significant substructures.

- **Advice 5**: **Apply Machine Learning for Feature Selection**

  Use machine learning algorithms to analyze the dataset and identify the most influential features affecting the yield.

  - Perform feature selection to find descriptors that correlate strongly with the yield.
  - Use these features to refine or create new rules.

  **Implementation**: Build a predictive model using the numerical features, then extract and interpret the model to inform rule generation.

- **Advice 6**: **Create Hierarchical or Decision Tree-Based Rules**

  Organize the rules in a decision tree format where each decision node is based on a quantifiable property.

  **Implementation**: Example decision pathway:
  
  - If the modifier has ≥2 carboxyl groups → High yield
  - Else if the modifier has an aromatic ring with electron-donating groups → High yield
  - Else if the modifier contains strong electron-withdrawing groups → Low yield

- **Advice 7**: **Standardize Terminology and Definitions**

  Ensure that all terms used in the rules are standardized and clearly defined.

  - Use IUPAC nomenclature where possible.
  - Define what constitutes "long-chain" (e.g., chain length >6 carbons).

  **Implementation**: Provide a glossary or annotations for terms used in the rules to eliminate ambiguity and improve consistency.

- **Advice 8**: **Exclude Redundant or Overlapping Rules**

  Review the rules for redundancy and overlap, consolidating where appropriate.

  **Implementation**: Combine rules that have similar explanations or outcomes to simplify the rule set and make it more efficient for numerical encoding.

- **Advice 9**: **Incorporate Electronical and Steric Factors Numerically**

  Quantify electronic effects (e.g., Hammett sigma constants) and steric factors to refine the rules.

  **Implementation**: Include numerical values for electron-donating or withdrawing effects and steric hindrance in the rules, which can be calculated from the chemical structure.

- **Advice 10**: **Align Rules with Computational Chemistry Tools**

  Ensure that the rules are compatible with computational tools and software used for SMILES analysis.

  **Implementation**: Use descriptors and parameters that are commonly available in cheminformatics libraries (e.g., RDKit) to facilitate automatic feature extraction.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**:

  **Rule 1** demonstrates excellent clarity by specifically identifying modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (α-amino acids with two carboxyl groups), which is a well-defined chemical class. The property insight is strong, explaining how the α-amino group and two carboxyl groups chelate metal centers to enhance catalytic activity, aligning with known coordination chemistry principles. The rule's complexity is appropriate, as it considers the combination of functional groups (amino and dual carboxyl groups) rather than a single feature. Coverage is adequate, supported by at least two data points—(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid and (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid—both yielding high results. Overall, Rule 1 effectively meets all criteria.

- **Comment 2**:

  **Rule 2** has good clarity in describing modifiers as aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted amino, hydroxy, or nitro groups and an aliphatic side chain of four or more carbons. However, the inclusion of 4-aminobenzoic acid as an exception (due to strong amino coordination despite lacking the aliphatic side chain) slightly reduces clarity. The property insight is solid, linking electron-donating substituents and chain length to enhanced metal coordination and catalyst interaction. Complexity is evident as it combines aromatic substitution patterns with side chain length. Coverage is sufficient, with examples like 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid and 4-aminobenzoic acid showing high yield. Refining the rule to address exceptions more clearly would enhance its clarity.

- **Comment 3**:

Coverage is well-supported by high-yield examples like pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, and the low-yield exception of 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid due to bulkiness. Rule 3 effectively meets all criteria.

- **Comment 4**:

  **Rule 4** demonstrates clarity by focusing on aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer that contain amino or thiol groups. The property insight is sound, attributing high yield to effective metal coordination by amino and thiol groups without steric hindrance. Complexity is appropriate, combining chain length and functional groups. Coverage is supported by data points like 5-aminopentanoic acid and 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid, both yielding high results. Rule 4 meets all criteria satisfactorily.

- **Comment 5**:

  **Rule 5** is clear in identifying polyhydroxy carboxylic acids (sugar acids) as modifiers leading to high yield due to multiple coordination sites provided by hydroxyl groups. The property insight is adequate, relating multiple hydroxyl groups to enhanced metal chelation. Complexity is moderate, focusing on the presence of multiple hydroxyls rather than a single functional group. Coverage is acceptable, with examples like gluconic acid yielding high results. Rule 5 meets the criteria effectively.

- **Comment 6**:

  **Rule 6** specifies that amino acids with aromatic side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms (e.g., indole ring in tryptophan) lead to high yield. Clarity is good, although the rule is somewhat narrow. The property insight is strong, highlighting the role of heteroatoms in coordination. Complexity is present, considering both the amino acid structure and aromatic side chain features. Coverage is limited, primarily supported by tryptophan. Additional data points would strengthen the rule's coverage, but it meets the criteria adequately.

- **Comment 7**:

  **Rule 7** provides clarity in describing aromatic carboxylic acids with multiple electron-donating methoxy groups and a ketone in the side chain. The property insight is solid, explaining how methoxy groups and ketones enhance coordination. Complexity is high due to the combination of multiple functional groups. Coverage is limited, with 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid as the primary example. While the rule meets the criteria, expanding the dataset to include more examples would enhance coverage.

- **Comment 8**:

  **Rule 8** is clear in stating that long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (six or more carbons) without additional polar functional groups lead to high yield. The property insight is reasonable, suggesting that hydrophobic interactions and substrate accessibility contribute to high yield. Complexity is moderate, combining chain length and absence of polar groups. Coverage is supported by octanoic acid yielding high results, while low-yield exceptions like 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid emphasize the impact of polar groups. Rule 8 meets the criteria well.

- **Comment 9**:

  **Rule 9** maintains clarity by focusing on aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted non-coordinating groups (e.g., methyl, formyl) leading to low yield. The property insight is adequate, explaining that non-coordinating substituents do not enhance metal interaction. Complexity is acceptable, considering both aromatic substitution patterns and functional group properties. Coverage includes low-yield examples like 4-methylbenzoic acid and 4-formylbenzoic acid. Rule 9 effectively meets the criteria.

- **Comment 10**:

  **Rule 10** is clear in identifying modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., fluorinated groups) leading to low yield. The property insight is sound, attributing decreased coordination ability to electron-withdrawing effects. Complexity is acceptable. Coverage is supported by low-yield examples like 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid. Rule 10 meets the criteria satisfactorily.

- **Comment 11**:

  **Rule 11** displays clarity by stating that modifiers containing amide bonds or peptide linkages lead to low yield. The property insight is strong, explaining how amide formation reduces coordination ability. Complexity is appropriate, focusing on structural features that impact metal interaction. Coverage includes low-yield examples like (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid. Rule 11 effectively meets all criteria.

- **Comment 12**:

  **Rule 12** provides clarity by highlighting that aromatic carboxylic acids with substituents causing steric hindrance or intramolecular interactions lead to low yield. The property insight is robust, linking steric effects to reduced metal coordination. Complexity is present, considering both steric and electronic factors. Coverage is supported by low-yield examples like 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid. Rule 12 meets the criteria well.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Translate Qualitative Descriptors into Quantifiable Features.** Modify the rules to use numerical molecular descriptors that can be directly calculated from SMILES strings. For example, instead of terms like "bulky substituents" or "long-chain aliphatic acids," specify the exact number of carbon atoms in the chain or use molecular volume descriptors. This will allow for the generation of a numeric feature matrix suitable for computational modeling.

- **Advice 2**: **Utilize Functional Group Counts and Molecular Properties.** Reformulate the rules to include counts of specific functional groups (e.g., number of carboxylic acid groups, amino groups, hydroxyl groups) and molecular properties such as logP (partition coefficient), molecular weight, topological polar surface area (TPSA), and hydrogen bond donor/acceptor counts. These features are easily computed from SMILES and can be used to predict yield quantitatively.

- **Advice 3**: **Implement SMARTS Patterns for Substructure Identification.** Define rules using SMARTS patterns to identify specific substructures associated with high or low yield. This approach allows for precise matching of functional groups and structural motifs within the molecules, facilitating accurate and automated feature extraction.

- **Advice 4**: **Simplify and Generalize Rules for Computational Efficiency.** Reduce the complexity of the rules by focusing on the most impactful features. For instance, instead of specifying various types of coordinating groups, classify modifiers based on the presence or absence of heteroatoms capable of metal coordination (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur) and their positions relative to the carboxylic acid group.

- **Advice 5**: **Incorporate Electronic and Steric Parameters Quantitatively.** Replace vague terms like "electron-donating" or "electron-withdrawing" groups with quantifiable electronic descriptors such as Hammett sigma constants or atomic charges calculated from quantum chemical methods. Similarly, use steric parameters like Taft steric constants or molar refractivity to represent the size and steric hindrance of substituents.

- **Advice 6**: **Cluster Modifiers Based on Molecular Fingerprints.** Use molecular fingerprinting techniques (e.g., MACCS keys, Morgan fingerprints) to cluster modifiers into groups with similar structural features. Develop rules based on these clusters to predict yield outcomes, which can be readily converted into numerical features.

- **Advice 7**: **Create a Scoring System for Coordination Ability.** Develop a numerical scoring system that quantifies the coordination ability of modifiers based on the number and type of coordinating atoms, their hybridization, and spatial arrangement. This score can serve as a feature in modeling yield.

- **Advice 8**: **Leverage Machine Learning for Feature Importance.** Use machine learning algorithms to assess feature importance from calculated molecular descriptors. Identify the most significant features that correlate with high yield and refine the rules to emphasize these features.

- **Advice 9**: **Standardize Modifier Structures for Consistency.** Ensure all modifier structures are represented in a standardized format (e.g., canonical SMILES) to avoid discrepancies during feature extraction. Consistency in data representation facilitates accurate computation of molecular descriptors.

- **Advice 10**: **Integrate Solvent and Reaction Condition Parameters.** If applicable, consider incorporating solvent properties (e.g., dielectric constant) and reaction conditions (e.g., temperature, light intensity) into the rules as numerical features, as they may influence the yield and can be quantified.

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 3 to 5 carbons**, containing **thio (-SH) or amino (-NH2) groups**, lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - 5-aminopentanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Thio and amino groups can coordinate with metal centers. Short-chain lengths ensure minimal steric hindrance, enhancing catalyst-modifier interactions.

---

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (6 or more carbons)** with **no additional polar functional groups** result in **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:
  - Octanoic acid

  **Low Yield Examples**:
  - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid (contains hydroxyl group)
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid (contains amino group)
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid (contains amino group)

  **Explanation**: Long hydrophobic chains can enhance interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or substrate, improving reaction efficiency. Presence of polar groups may interfere with coordination or disrupt hydrophobic interactions.

---

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers that possess **multiple hydroxyl groups** (polyhydroxy carboxylic acids) lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:
  - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

  **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous coordination sites, strengthening interactions with metal centers and enhancing catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups** (such as formyl or methyl) lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 4-formylbenzoic acid
  - 4-methylbenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density on the aromatic ring, reducing its ability to coordinate with metal centers, thereby decreasing catalytic performance.

---

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers that contain **strong electron-withdrawing groups**, such as **fluorinated groups**, result in **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups reduce the electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening metal-ligand interactions and leading to reduced catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers that have **amide bonds or peptide linkages** result in **low yield** due to reduced availability of lone pairs for coordination.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
  - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Amide formation involves lone pairs on nitrogen and oxygen, reducing their availability for coordination with metals, weakening catalyst-modifier interactions.

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with substituents causing steric hindrance**, leading to decreased coordination, result in **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (bulky due to fused rings)
  - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (possible intramolecular hydrogen bonding)

  **Explanation**: Steric hindrance or intramolecular interactions reduce the accessibility of coordination sites, diminishing catalyst-modifier binding and catalytic efficiency.

---

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms** (e.g., phenylalanine) lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:
  - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)

  **Explanation**: Aromatic side chains without heteroatoms provide few coordination sites. Lack of additional interacting groups reduces metal-ligand interactions, leading to lower yield.

---

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids longer than 6 carbons containing polar functional groups**, such as amino or hydroxyl groups, lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid

  **Explanation**: The presence of polar groups may disrupt hydrophobic interactions or interfere with proper coordination with the metal center, reducing catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-donating groups**, but having a **short aliphatic side chain (3 carbons or fewer)**, lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:
  - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

  **High Yield Counterexample**:
  - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid (longer side chain, high yield)

  **Explanation**: A longer aliphatic side chain may be necessary to enhance interactions with the catalyst or substrate. Short chains might not provide sufficient flexibility or distance, resulting in lower yield.

---

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with additional aromatic rings or significant steric bulk** lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Bulky substituents can hinder coordination with the metal center due to steric effects, decreasing catalytic efficiency.

---

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers containing **intramolecular hydrogen bonding** that limits the availability of coordinating groups lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:
  - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Intramolecular hydrogen bonding can sequester potential coordinating groups, reducing their availability to interact with the metal center, leading to decreased catalytic activity.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **  
- **Suggestion 1**: **Revise the SMARTS pattern for Rule 1**. The current pattern for detecting α-amino dicarboxylic acids does not correctly match molecules like Aspartic acid and Glutamic acid. The pattern `alpha_amino_acid = '[NX3H2][CX4H]([*])[CX3](=O)[OX1H1]'` is too restrictive and may not account for variations in the side chain. Consider using a more general pattern that captures any side chain attached to the α-carbon:
  - Suggested pattern: `alpha_amino_acid = '[NX3H2][CX4H]([#6])[CX3](=O)[OX1H1]'`
  - This pattern ensures the α-carbon is connected to any carbon-containing side chain (`[#6]`) and a carboxyl group, which is characteristic of α-amino acids.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Correct the count condition for carboxylic acids in Rule 1**. The count pattern `(carboxylic_acid, 2)` may not be matching correctly because it requires the pattern `carboxylic_acid = '[CX3](=O)[OX1H1]'` to appear exactly twice without overlap. Modify the count condition to allow for overlapping matches or use a more precise pattern that can identify multiple carboxylic acid groups:
  - Consider using `Chem.MolFromSmarts('[#6](=O)[O;H1,-1]')` and summing occurrences.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Update the patterns for Rule 2 to accurately reflect the structural requirements**. The current patterns may not correctly identify aromatic carboxylic acids with a para-substituted electron-donating group and an aliphatic side chain of four or more carbons:
  - Define a pattern for a para-substituted aromatic ring with an electron-donating group (EDG):
    - `para_aromatic_edg = 'c1ccc([NX3H2,OX2H])cc1'` (aromatic ring with amino or hydroxyl group in para position)
  - Define a pattern for an aliphatic side chain of four or more carbons attached to the aromatic ring:
    - `aliphatic_side_chain = '[c]:[c][CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H2]'`
  - Ensure both patterns are matched in the molecule.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Adjust the pattern for heteroaromatic carboxylic acids in Rule 3**. The pattern `'[n,a][a][a][a][a][a]'` is not specific and may not match rings correctly. Use a more accurate pattern:
  - Suggested pattern: `'[n]1cccc1C(=O)O'` (heteroaromatic ring with nitrogen and a carboxylic acid group)
  - Exclude bulky substituents by adding conditions to eliminate rings with large groups.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Check the syntax and correctness of all SMARTS patterns**. Some patterns may have syntax errors or may not be valid SMARTS. Verify each pattern using RDKit's `Chem.MolFromSmarts` function to ensure they compile without errors.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Incorporate explicit hydrogen atoms where necessary**. RDKit sometimes requires explicit hydrogens in SMARTS patterns to match correctly. Use `[H]` to specify hydrogen atoms when needed.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Test each pattern individually against known matching and non-matching molecules**. Create unit tests or simple scripts that apply each SMARTS pattern to a set of test SMILES strings to verify correct behavior.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Update the exclude patterns in the rules to prevent unintended matches**. For instance, in Rule 5, the exclude pattern `'[!#6;!#1]'` may unintentionally exclude molecules that contain only carbon and hydrogen. Replace it with a pattern that specifically excludes heteroatoms:
  - Suggested pattern: `'[!#6;!#1]'` matches any atom that is not carbon or hydrogen, so confirm if this is intended.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Ensure that multiple patterns within a rule are all required (logical AND), or adjust the code to reflect the correct logical operation**. If patterns within a rule should be treated as an AND condition, make sure the code checks that all patterns match, not just any one of them.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Revise Rule 8's pattern to detect fluorinated groups correctly**. The pattern for fluorine atoms `'[F]'` may match any fluorine, including those not part of strong electron-withdrawing groups. Modify the pattern to detect perfluoroalkyl groups:
  - Suggested pattern: `'[CX4](F)(F)F'` (trifluoromethyl group)
  - Or use more general patterns for electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups.

- **Suggestion 11**: **Expand the feature matrix to include all rules applicable to the SMILES list**. The current matrix only includes Rules 1 to 8, but the SMILES list may contain modifiers that pertain to Rules 9 to 15. Including all relevant rules will provide a more comprehensive feature matrix.

- **Suggestion 12**: **Re-evaluate the logic used for matching exclude patterns**. In the code, if an exclude pattern matches, it sets `match = False` and breaks out of the loop. Ensure that this logic correctly reflects the intended behavior for each rule.

- **Suggestion 13**: **Improve error handling in the code**. Instead of silently appending zeros when an exception occurs, log the error with details about the molecule and the rule, which can help in debugging the patterns.

- **Suggestion 14**: **Use more descriptive variable names and comments in the code**. This will make the code easier to understand and maintain, especially when working collaboratively.

- **Suggestion 15**: **Consult chemical experts or use validated cheminformatics libraries for pattern definitions**. Accurate SMARTS patterns can be complex, and leveraging existing resources can improve pattern accuracy.

**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

---

**Overview**

The goal of this analysis is to evaluate the performance of the current set of rules based on the provided metrics, focusing on **confidence** and **lift**, and to compare them with the reference metrics from previous iterations. We will assess whether the current rules represent an improvement over the previous ones and determine if a local minimum has been reached, indicating that further iterations may not yield significant benefits. Finally, we will provide recommendations on how to improve the current rules.

---

---

### **2. Detailed Analysis**

#### **Confidence:**

- **Improvement Over Reference:** The current rules exhibit higher confidence levels (ranging from 0.6333 to 0.7714) compared to the reference confidence levels (0.5396 to 0.6352).
- **Interpretation:** Higher confidence indicates that when the rule conditions are met, the likelihood of correctly predicting the outcome (high or low yield) is greater with the current rules.

#### **Lift:**

- **Improvement Over Reference:** Current rules have lift values ranging from 1.2671 to 1.5538, exceeding the reference lift values (1.0559 to 1.2048).
- **Interpretation:** Lift values significantly greater than 1 suggest that the rules are more effective at predicting the outcome than random chance. The higher lift in the current rules indicates stronger associations between the rule conditions and the predictions.

#### **Support:**

- **Decrease from Reference:** The current rules generally have lower support values (0.0171 to 0.1349) compared to the reference support values (0.1667 to 0.1845).
- **Interpretation:** Lower support indicates that the rules apply to a smaller portion of the dataset. While the rules are more accurate when they apply (as shown by higher confidence and lift), they cover fewer instances.

#### **Leverage:**

- **Mixed Results:** The leverage values for the current rules are generally positive but lower than the highest reference leverage.
- **Interpretation:** Positive leverage values indicate a stronger association than expected by chance. The lower leverage in current rules suggests that, although the associations are significant, they may not be as robust across a wide range of data.

---

### **3. Assessment of Local Minimum and Iterations**

- **Local Minimum Indication:** The increase in confidence and lift alongside the decrease in support suggests that we may have reached a point where further iterations will yield rules that are highly accurate but apply to increasingly smaller subsets of data.
- **Diminishing Returns:** The marginal gains in confidence and lift may not justify the loss in support, as highly specific rules (with low support) may not be practical for general application.
- **Sufficient Iterations:** Given that the metrics have plateaued in terms of significant improvements in confidence and lift, and support is decreasing, it is reasonable to conclude that sufficient iterations have been performed.

---

### **4. Recommendations for Improvement**

#### **Balance Confidence and Support:**

- **Objective:** Aim for rules that maintain high confidence and lift while improving support.
- **Approach:**
  - **Generalize Rule Conditions:** Slightly relax some of the rule conditions to encompass a broader subset of data without significant loss in predictive power.
  - **Combine Similar Rules:** Integrate rules with similar conditions to create more general rules that apply to more instances.

#### **Enhance Rule Discovery:**

- **Objective:** Identify additional patterns that may cover larger portions of the data.
- **Approach:**
  - **Data Exploration:** Conduct further exploratory data analysis to uncover hidden associations.
  - **Feature Engineering:** Create new features or combine existing ones to reveal new patterns.

#### **Validation with Test Data:**

- **Objective:** Ensure that the rules generalize well beyond the training data.
- **Approach:**
  - **Evaluate on Test Set:** Apply the rules to a test dataset to assess their performance in terms of confidence, lift, and support.
  - **Cross-Validation:** Use cross-validation techniques to validate the robustness of the rules.

#### **Avoid Overfitting:**

- **Objective:** Prevent rules from becoming too specific to the training data.
- **Approach:**
  - **Simplify Rules:** Remove overly complex conditions that contribute little to predictive power but reduce support.
  - **Regularization Techniques:** Apply regularization methods to penalize overly complex rules.

#### **Incremental Iterations:**

- **Objective:** Fine-tune the rules based on incremental insights.
- **Approach:**
  - **Iterative Refinement:** Make small adjustments to the rules and monitor changes in metrics.
  - **Threshold Adjustment:** Adjust thresholds for metric cutoffs (e.g., minimum confidence or support levels) to find an optimal balance.

---

### **Conclusion**

The current rules demonstrate improved confidence and lift compared to the previous iterations, indicating stronger and more reliable predictive power when the rules apply. However, the decrease in support suggests that these rules are becoming too specific and cover a smaller portion of the data. This trade-off indicates that we may have reached a local minimum where further iterations will not yield significant overall improvements.

To enhance the current rules:

- **Balance the specificity and generality** by adjusting the rule conditions to improve support without substantially compromising confidence and lift.
- **Ensure the rules are validated** on test data to confirm their applicability beyond the training set.
- **Focus on rule simplification and generalization** to avoid overfitting and improve practical applicability.

By implementing these recommendations, we can develop a set of rules that not only predict the outcomes with high confidence and lift but also apply to a broader range of cases, enhancing their utility in the research program.

**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

Based on the latest training results, the performance of the current rules has declined compared to previous iterations. The validation accuracy has decreased to **57.14%**, which is significantly lower than the validation accuracies observed in earlier iterations (ranging from approximately **68% to 77%**). This decrease suggests that the current set of rules is not effectively capturing the underlying patterns necessary for accurate predictions.

In the recent SHAP analysis, we notice that **Rule 8** is the predominant contributor to the model's predictions. For many molecules, the SHAP value for Rule 8 is either approximately **0.0185** or **-0.5**, with minimal contributions from other rules. This heavy reliance on a single rule indicates that the model may not be leveraging the full spectrum of available features, potentially leading to underperformance.

**Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting**

The decline in validation accuracy and the dominance of Rule 8 in the SHAP analysis suggest that the model may be experiencing **underfitting**. Underfitting occurs when a model is too simplistic to capture the complexity of the data. In this case, the over-reliance on Rule 8 implies that the model is not adequately incorporating the diversity of molecular features represented by other rules, leading to poor generalization on the validation set.

**Analysis of Discrepancies Using SHAP Values**

- **Overestimated Loadings**: For molecules where the predicted loading is **high** but the experimental value is **low**, Rule 8 has a consistent positive SHAP value (e.g., **0.0185**). This suggests that Rule 8 may be overestimating the impact of certain features, leading to incorrect high predictions.

- **Underestimated Loadings**: Conversely, for molecules where the predicted loading is **low** but the experimental value is **high**, the SHAP value for Rule 8 is significantly negative (e.g., **-0.5**). This indicates that Rule 8 may be causing the model to undervalue features that are actually important for high loading.

The lack of diversity in SHAP values and the minimal contribution from other rules point toward an imbalance in the rule set, where Rule 8 disproportionately influences the model's predictions.

**Interpretation of Accuracy Decline**

The decrease in validation accuracy from previous iterations implies that the recent adjustments to the rules may not have improved the model and might have inadvertently reduced its predictive power. The model appears to have reached a point where further iterations without significant changes to the rule set may not yield better results, indicating a potential local minimum in performance.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

1. **Reevaluate Rule 8 for Specificity**

   - **Issue Identified**: Rule 8 currently states that modifiers containing strong electron-withdrawing groups, such as fluorinated groups, result in low yield.
   - **Action**: Refine Rule 8 to increase its specificity. Consider specifying which electron-withdrawing groups and molecular contexts truly lead to low yield. For example, not all fluorinated compounds may result in low yield, and the position or nature of the fluorine atoms could be significant.
   - **Expected Outcome**: A more precise rule will reduce misclassifications caused by overgeneralization and help the model differentiate better between high and low-yield modifiers.

2. **Incorporate Additional Rules to Capture More Features**

   - **Issue Identified**: The current rule set may be too limited, causing the model to underfit by not considering all relevant molecular features.
   - **Action**: Develop new rules that account for additional structural or electronic features known to influence catalytic activity. This could include rules about steric hindrance, specific functional group interactions, or the presence of particular heteroatoms.
   - **Expected Outcome**: Expanding the rule set will allow the model to capture a wider range of influential factors, improving its ability to generalize and increasing predictive accuracy.

3. **Adjust Rules with High SHAP Contributions to Misclassifications**

   - **Issue Identified**: Rules with high positive SHAP values for overestimated loadings or high negative SHAP values for underestimated loadings are likely contributing to prediction errors.
   - **Action**: Analyze these rules (e.g., Rule 8) to determine why they are contributing to misclassifications. Adjust their conditions or thresholds to better align with the experimental data.
   - **Expected Outcome**: Refining these rules will reduce their negative impact on the model's predictions, leading to improved accuracy.

4. **Balance the Influence of All Rules**

   - **Issue Identified**: The disproportionate influence of Rule 8 suggests an imbalance in the model.
   - **Action**: Reassess the weight or importance assigned to each rule in the feature matrix. Ensure that no single rule dominates the model unless justified by strong evidence.
   - **Expected Outcome**: A more balanced model will consider a variety of factors, reducing the risk of over-reliance on any one rule and improving overall performance.

5. **Enhance the Rule for Modifiers with Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonding (Rule 15)**

   - **Issue Identified**: Rule 15 might be underutilized, as intramolecular hydrogen bonding can significantly impact availability of coordination sites.
   - **Action**: Provide clearer definitions or examples in Rule 15 to capture more modifiers where intramolecular hydrogen bonding affects catalytic activity.
   - **Expected Outcome**: A strengthened Rule 15 could help the model better identify low-yield modifiers due to intramolecular interactions, improving prediction accuracy.

6. **Review and Refine Underperforming Rules**

   - **Issue Identified**: Other rules may not be contributing effectively to the model's predictions.
   - **Action**: Examine rules that show minimal SHAP contributions to correct predictions. Adjust them to enhance their relevance or consider removing redundant or ineffective rules.
   - **Expected Outcome**: Streamlining the rule set will help the model focus on the most predictive features, improving efficiency and accuracy.

7. **Avoid Overgeneralization in Rules**

   - **Issue Identified**: Broad rules may inadvertently include exceptions, leading to misclassifications.
   - **Action**: Add exceptions or conditions to existing rules where appropriate. For instance, specify when a rule applies or does not apply based on additional molecular features.
   - **Expected Outcome**: More nuanced rules will improve the model's ability to distinguish between similar modifiers that have different catalytic outcomes.

8. **Iterative Testing and Validation**

   - **Issue Identified**: Changes to the rules need to be validated to ensure they lead to performance improvements.
   - **Action**: Implement changes iteratively, testing the model's performance after each adjustment using cross-validation techniques.
   - **Expected Outcome**: Continuous evaluation will help track the impact of each change, allowing for data-driven refinement of the rules.

---

**Conclusion**

The current decline in validation accuracy indicates that the model's predictive ability has weakened, likely due to over-reliance on Rule 8 and underutilization of other rules. By refining Rule 8 for specificity, balancing the influence of all rules, incorporating additional rules, and carefully adjusting rules associated with misclassifications, we can improve the model's generalization and predictive accuracy. Iterative testing and validation will be crucial to ensure that adjustments lead to tangible improvements.

**Summary of Discussions and Suggestions for Optimizing Current Rules**

The current analysis highlights several issues with the existing set of rules used to predict the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. The primary concerns include inaccuracies in SMARTS (SMiles ARbitrary Target Specification) patterns, over-reliance on certain rules, decreased validation accuracy, and potential underfitting or overfitting of the model. Below are the summarized discussions and suggestions for optimizing the current rules:

1. **Revise and Validate SMARTS Patterns**

   - **Issue**: Some SMARTS patterns are either too restrictive or not accurately capturing the intended molecular features, leading to incorrect matching of molecules.
   - **Suggestions**:
     - **Rule 1 (α-Amino Dicarboxylic Acids)**:
       - **Revise the SMARTS pattern** to be more inclusive. The current pattern may not account for variations in side chains of α-amino acids like aspartic acid and glutamic acid.
       - **Suggested Pattern**: Use `[NX3H2][CX4H]([#6])[CX3](=O)[OX1H1]` to represent the α-amino group connected to any carbon-containing side chain and a carboxyl group.
     - **Rule 2 (Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Para-Substituted EDGs and Aliphatic Side Chains)**:
       - **Update the patterns** to accurately reflect structural requirements.
       - **Define Specific Patterns**:
         - For para-substituted aromatic rings with electron-donating groups: `c1ccc([NX3H2,OX2H])cc1`
         - For aliphatic side chains of four or more carbons: `c1ccc([CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H2])cc1`
     - **Rule 3 (Heteroaromatic Carboxylic Acids)**:
       - **Adjust the pattern** to correctly identify heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen atoms.
       - **Suggested Pattern**: Use `[n]1cccc1C(=O)O` to represent a nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring with a carboxylic acid group.
     - **Rules 5 and 8 (Exclusion of Heteroatoms and Detection of Fluorinated Groups)**:
       - **Modify exclusion patterns** to prevent unintended matches. Ensure that heteroatoms are appropriately excluded or included based on the rule's intent.
       - **For Fluorinated Groups**: Use patterns like `[CX4](F)(F)F` to specifically detect trifluoromethyl groups rather than any fluorine atom.

2. **Balance Specificity and Generality of Rules**

   - **Issue**: Some rules are too specific (low support) or too general (leading to misclassifications).
   - **Suggestions**:
     - **Generalize Overly Specific Rules**:
       - **Relax certain conditions** to increase support without significantly compromising confidence and lift.
       - **Combine similar rules** to create broader rules that cover more data.
     - **Add Exceptions to Overly General Rules**:
       - **Incorporate additional conditions or exclusions** to prevent unintended matches and improve accuracy.
       - For example, in Rule 8, add specificity to fluorinated groups that truly lead to low yield.

3. **Improve Model Performance Metrics**

   - **Issue**: Validation accuracy has decreased, and there is an over-reliance on certain rules (e.g., Rule 8), leading to underfitting.
   - **Suggestions**:
     - **Incorporate Additional Rules**:
       - **Develop new rules** that account for additional molecular features influencing catalytic activity, such as steric hindrance, specific functional group interactions, or the presence of particular heteroatoms.
     - **Enhance Underperforming Rules**:
       - **Reevaluate rules with high SHAP contributions** to misclassifications and adjust their conditions or thresholds accordingly.
     - **Balance Rule Influence**:
       - **Ensure equitable weighting** of all rules to prevent over-reliance on any single rule.
       - **Adjust the model** to consider a diversity of features, reducing the risk of underfitting.

4. **Verify and Correct Logical Operations**

   - **Issue**: Potential syntax errors and logical inconsistencies in the code may affect rule application.
   - **Suggestions**:
     - **Check SMARTS Syntax**:
       - **Use RDKit's `Chem.MolFromSmarts` function** to verify that all SMARTS patterns compile without errors.
     - **Adjust Logical Operators**:
       - **Ensure correct application** of logical AND/OR operations between multiple patterns within a rule.
       - **Confirm that exclude patterns** are functioning as intended and not inadvertently excluding desired matches.

5. **Enhance Error Handling and Code Readability**

   - **Issue**: Silent failures and unclear code may hinder debugging and future optimization efforts.
   - **Suggestions**:
     - **Implement Robust Error Handling**:
       - **Log errors with details** about the molecule and the rule when exceptions occur.
     - **Improve Code Documentation**:
       - **Use descriptive variable names and comments** to enhance code readability and maintainability.

6. **Iterative Testing and Validation**

   - **Issue**: Changes to the rules need to be incrementally tested to ensure they lead to performance improvements without overfitting.
   - **Suggestions**:
     - **Perform Unit Tests**:
       - **Test each pattern individually** against a set of known molecules to verify correct behavior.
     - **Use Cross-Validation**:
       - **Validate changes** using 5-fold or 10-fold cross-validation to assess the model's robustness.
     - **Monitor Performance Metrics**:
       - **Continuously evaluate** support, confidence, lift, leverage, and validation accuracy after each iteration.

7. **Avoid Overfitting by Simplifying Rules**

   - **Issue**: Overly complex rules with low support may lead to overfitting.
   - **Suggestions**:
     - **Simplify Rule Conditions**:
       - **Remove unnecessary complexity** in the rules that do not significantly contribute to predictive power.
     - **Set Thresholds for Metrics**:
       - **Establish minimum thresholds** for support and confidence to ensure rules are statistically significant and broadly applicable.

8. **Consult Chemical Expertise**

   - **Issue**: Accurate SMARTS patterns and rule conditions require deep chemical knowledge.
   - **Suggestions**:
     - **Engage with Chemists**:
       - **Collaborate with chemical experts** to validate the rules and patterns.
     - **Leverage Cheminformatics Resources**:
       - **Use validated libraries and databases** to define and test SMARTS patterns.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

There is significant potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. By refining SMARTS patterns, balancing rule specificity and generality, enhancing underperforming rules, and ensuring robust testing and validation, the model's predictive accuracy can be improved. These optimizations can lead to a better understanding of the molecular features influencing the catalytic activity, ultimately aiding in the rational design of modifiers to optimize yield.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Revise SMARTS Pattern for Rule 1**
  
  - **Issue**: The current SMARTS pattern for α-amino dicarboxylic acids is too restrictive and may not capture all relevant modifiers.
  - **Action**: Modify the SMARTS pattern to be more inclusive of α-amino dicarboxylic acids.
  - **Suggested SMARTS Pattern**: `[NX3H2][CX4H]([#6])[CX3](=O)[OX1H1]`
    - **Explanation**: This pattern represents an α-amino group (`[NX3H2]`) attached to a carbon (`[CX4H]`) with any side chain (`[#6]` for any carbon group), followed by a carboxyl group (`[CX3](=O)[OX1H1]`). It ensures that variations like aspartic acid and glutamic acid are accurately matched.

---

- **Advice 2**: **Update SMARTS Patterns for Rule 2**

  - **Issue**: The patterns for detecting aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-donating groups and an aliphatic side chain are inaccurate.
  - **Action**: Define specific SMARTS patterns for each structural feature.
  - **Suggested SMARTS Patterns**:
    - **Para-Substituted Electron-Donating Groups**: `c1ccc([NX3H2,OX2H])cc1`
      - **Explanation**: Matches aromatic rings with amino (`[NX3H2]`) or hydroxy (`[OX2H]`) groups in the para position.
    - **Aliphatic Side Chain of Four or More Carbons**: `[CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H2]`
      - **Explanation**: Represents a straight aliphatic chain of at least four methylene groups.
  - **Combine Patterns**: Use logical AND to ensure both features are present.
    - **Combined SMARTS**: `c1ccc([NX3H2,OX2H])[a][CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H2]`
    - **Note**: Adjust `[a]` to correctly connect the side chain to the aromatic ring.

---

- **Advice 3**: **Adjust SMARTS Pattern for Rule 3**

  - **Issue**: The current pattern may not correctly identify all heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms.
  - **Action**: Update the SMARTS pattern to accurately match the intended structures.
  - **Suggested SMARTS Pattern**: `[nH0]1cccc1C(=O)[OX1H]`
    - **Explanation**: Matches a nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring (`[nH0]1cccc1`) directly bonded to a carboxylic acid group (`C(=O)[OX1H]`).

---

- **Advice 4**: **Modify Exclusion Patterns in Rule 5**

  - **Issue**: Modifiers with long aliphatic chains containing heteroatoms are not properly excluded, leading to misclassifications.
  - **Action**: Adjust the SMARTS pattern to exclude modifiers with polar functional groups.
  - **Suggested SMARTS Pattern**: `CCCCCCC[CX3](=O)[OX1H]` with exclusion of heteroatoms in the chain.
    - **Exclude Pattern**: Use negative lookahead or explicit exclusion to prevent matches with heteroatoms.
    - **Example Exclusion**: `[$(CCCCCCC[!#6])]` ensures only carbon atoms are present in the chain.
  - **Implementation**: Combine inclusion and exclusion patterns to accurately match desired modifiers.

---

- **Advice 5**: **Refine SMARTS Pattern for Rule 8**

  - **Issue**: The pattern for detecting strong electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups is too broad and may incorrectly classify some modifiers.
  - **Action**: Make the SMARTS pattern more specific to fluorinated groups that affect yield.
  - **Suggested SMARTS Patterns**:
    - **Trifluoromethyl Group**: `[CX4](F)(F)F`
    - **General Fluorinated Alkyl Chains**: `[CX4][CX4](F)(F)(F)`
  - **Explanation**: These patterns specifically target modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups, improving classification accuracy.

---

- **Advice 6**: **Generalize Overly Specific Rules**

  - **Issue**: Some rules are too specific, resulting in low support and potential underfitting.
  - **Action**: Relax conditions to increase applicability without significantly reducing confidence.
  - **Example Adjustment**:
    - **Rule 4**: Expand chain length to 3–6 carbons and include both thio (-SH) and amino (-NH₂) groups.
    - **Revised Rule**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 3 to 6 carbons, containing thio (-SH) or amino (-NH₂) groups, lead to high yield.
  - **Benefit**: Increases the number of modifiers covered by the rule, enhancing model performance.

---

- **Advice 7**: **Combine Similar Low-Support Rules**

  - **Issue**: Underperforming rules with low support may not contribute meaningfully to the model.
  - **Action**: Merge similar rules to create a more robust, generalized rule.
  - **Example**:
    - **Combine Rules 13 and 14** into a single rule addressing steric hindrance and insufficient side-chain length.
    - **New Rule**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-donating groups but have short aliphatic side chains (3 carbons or fewer) or possess bulky substituents causing steric hindrance lead to low yield.
  - **Benefit**: Increases support and provides a clearer guideline based on steric factors affecting yield.

---

- **Advice 8**: **Verify Syntax and Logical Operators in SMARTS Patterns**

  - **Issue**: Incorrect syntax and improper use of logical operators can lead to misclassification.
  - **Action**:
    - **Syntax Check**: Use RDKit's `Chem.MolFromSmarts` to verify that all SMARTS patterns are syntactically correct.
    - **Logical Operators**: Ensure the correct application of AND (`&`), OR (`|`), and NOT (`!`) within patterns.
  - **Example Correction**:
    - For excluding hydroxyl groups: `[!$([OX2H])]` ensures that molecules with hydroxyl groups are not matched when they should be excluded.
  - **Benefit**: Prevents unintended matches and improves the reliability of the rules.

---

- **Advice 9**: **Implement Enhanced Error Handling and Logging**

  - **Issue**: Silent failures and lack of error information hinder debugging and optimization.
  - **Action**:
    - **Error Handling**: Add try-except blocks around pattern matching code to catch exceptions.
    - **Logging**: Record errors with details about the molecule, the rule being applied, and the nature of the error.
  - **Example Implementation**:
    - ```python
      try:
          # Pattern matching code
      except Exception as e:
          logger.error(f"Error applying rule X to molecule Y: {e}")
      ```
  - **Benefit**: Facilitates quicker identification and resolution of issues within the rule set.

---

- **Advice 10**: **Perform Iterative Testing and Validation**

  - **Issue**: Changes to rules need validation to ensure they improve performance without causing overfitting.
  - **Action**:
    - **Cross-Validation**: Use 5-fold or 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate the model after each set of changes.

Rule Generator Message:
After carefully analyzing the provided dataset and considering the current rules, I've identified several areas where the rules can be improved. Some of the existing rules overlap, are too specific, or do not accurately capture the trends observed in the data. Therefore, I've crafted a new set of rules that better describe the relationship between the molecular modifiers' structures and the relative high or low yield of the reaction.

**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are **α-amino dicarboxylic acids** (α-amino acids with two carboxyl groups) lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)
  - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)

  **Explanation**: The presence of an α-amino group and two carboxyl groups provides multiple coordination sites with the metal center, enhancing catalyst stability and activity, resulting in high yield.

---

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms** in the ring lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)
  - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid

  **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings act as additional coordination sites, enhancing interactions with the metal catalyst and improving catalytic efficiency.

---

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with a para-substituted electron-donating group** (such as amino, hydroxy, or methoxy groups) lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 4-aminobenzoic acid
  - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
  - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups increase electron density on the aromatic ring, enhancing coordination with the metal center and promoting catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 5 to 8 carbons** without additional polar functional groups lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:
  - Octanoic acid

  **Low Yield Counterexamples**:
  - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid (contains hydroxyl group)
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid (contains amino group)
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid (contains amino group)

  **Explanation**: Long-chain aliphatic acids can interact favorably with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst, enhancing reaction efficiency. Additional polar groups may disrupt these interactions or interfere with coordination.

---

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers containing **multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic backbone** (polyhydroxy carboxylic acids) lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:
  - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

  **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous coordination sites, strengthening interactions with the metal center and enhancing catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups** (such as formyl or methyl groups) lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 4-formylbenzoic acid
  - 4-methylbenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density on the aromatic ring, reducing its ability to coordinate with the metal center, thereby decreasing catalytic performance.

---

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers that contain **strong electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups** result in **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Fluorinated groups are highly electronegative and withdraw electron density, weakening metal-ligand interactions and leading to reduced catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers that have **amide bonds or peptide linkages** result in **low yield** due to reduced availability of lone pairs for coordination.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
  - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Amide formation involves lone pairs on nitrogen and oxygen, reducing their availability for coordination with the metal, thereby weakening catalyst-modifier interactions.

---

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with nonpolar aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms** lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:
  - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)

  **High Yield Counterexample**:
  - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan; contains an indole ring with nitrogen)

  **Explanation**: Nonpolar aromatic side chains without heteroatoms provide few coordination sites. In contrast, heteroatom-containing side chains enhance metal-ligand interactions, leading to higher yield.

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids longer than 6 carbons containing polar functional groups** (such as amino or hydroxyl groups) lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Polar groups on long aliphatic chains may disrupt hydrophobic interactions or interfere with proper coordination with the metal center, reducing catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with substituents causing steric hindrance** lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (contains bulky fused rings)

  **Explanation**: Steric hindrance from bulky substituents can reduce the accessibility of coordination sites, diminishing catalyst-modifier binding and catalytic efficiency.

---

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers that contain **intramolecular hydrogen bonding** that limits the availability of coordinating groups lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:
  - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Intramolecular hydrogen bonding can sequester potential coordinating groups, reducing their availability to interact with the metal center, leading to decreased catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers with **mercapto (-SH) groups on short aliphatic chains** lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid (Note: Exception to the trend; see explanation)

  **Explanation**: Thiol groups have strong affinity for metal centers due to the soft nature of sulfur, enhancing coordination and catalytic activity. However, in aromatic systems like 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid, steric or electronic factors might reduce effectiveness, as seen with its low yield.

---

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted large heterocyclic groups** lead to **variable yield** dependent on steric factors.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid (less steric hindrance)

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (more steric hindrance)

  **Explanation**: The size and position of heterocyclic groups affect sterics and coordination ability. Modifiers with less steric hindrance can coordinate effectively, leading to high yield, while bulky groups reduce yield.

---

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 3 to 5 carbons containing amino groups** lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:
  - 5-aminopentanoic acid

  **Low Yield Counterexamples**:
  - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid (contains ether linkages)
  - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (longer chain and acetamido group)

  **Explanation**: Short aliphatic chains with amino groups can effectively coordinate with the metal center without significant steric hindrance, enhancing catalytic activity.

---

**End of Rules**

These rules aim to cover a broad range of the dataset while providing clear guidance on predicting the yield based on structural features of the modifiers. They balance simplicity and complexity, ensuring both higher coverage and specificity where necessary. The explanations tie the observed trends to underlying physicochemical properties, such as electron density, coordination ability, steric effects, and intramolecular interactions.

I believe these updated rules more accurately reflect the relationship between the molecular modifiers and the reaction yield, providing valuable insights for optimizing and controlling the reaction conditions.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear in stating that modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids lead to high yield. The physical-chemical insight is strong, explaining that multiple coordination sites enhance catalyst stability and activity. The rule considers a combination of functional groups—the α-amino group and two carboxyl groups—fulfilling the complexity criterion. It is supported by two high-yield examples (aspartic acid and glutamic acid), providing good coverage. The balance between specificity and coverage is appropriate. Overall, Rule 1 is well-formulated.

---

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 clearly defines that heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms in the ring lead to high yield. The explanation provides adequate physical-chemical insight by highlighting the role of nitrogen atoms as additional coordination sites. The rule combines the structural features of heteroaromatic rings, nitrogen atoms, and carboxylic acids, satisfying the complexity criterion. With three supporting examples, the rule has strong coverage. The balance between complexity and coverage is excellent. Rule 2 is effectively constructed.

---

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 specifies that aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-donating groups lead to high yield, and it is clear and easy to apply. The physical-chemical insight is solid, explaining how electron-donating groups enhance coordination with the metal center. The rule considers multiple sub-structures, meeting the complexity criterion. Supported by three high-yield examples, the rule demonstrates good coverage. The balance between specificity and coverage is well-maintained. Rule 3 is well-formulated.

---

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 clearly states that aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 5 to 8 carbons without additional polar functional groups lead to high yield. The physical-chemical insight is reasonable, emphasizing favorable hydrophobic interactions. However, the rule is supported by only one high-yield example (octanoic acid), limiting its coverage. While it considers chain length and absence of polar groups, the limited data points reduce its robustness. The balance between complexity and coverage could be improved by including more supporting examples. Overall, Rule 4 is valid but would benefit from enhanced coverage.

---

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 clearly indicates that modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic backbone lead to high yield. The physical-chemical insight is sound, as multiple hydroxyl groups can strengthen interactions with the metal center. However, it is supported by only one example (gluconic acid), which limits its coverage. The rule considers the combination of an aliphatic backbone with multiple hydroxyl groups, satisfying the complexity criterion. To improve the balance between specificity and coverage, additional examples should be provided. Rule 5 is reasonable but needs more supporting data.

---

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 clearly states that aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups lead to low yield. The physical-chemical insight is appropriate, explaining reduced electron density and coordination ability. The rule combines structural features, fulfilling the complexity criterion. With two supporting low-yield examples, the rule has acceptable coverage. The balance between specificity and coverage is good. Rule 6 is effectively formulated.

---

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear in stating that modifiers containing strong electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups result in low yield. The physical-chemical explanation is strong, highlighting the impact of electron withdrawal on metal-ligand interactions. The rule focuses on specific functional groups, satisfying the complexity criterion. Supported by two low-yield examples, the rule has sufficient coverage. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate. Rule 7 is well-constructed.

---

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 clearly indicates that modifiers with amide bonds or peptide linkages result in low yield due to reduced availability of coordinating lone pairs. The physical-chemical insight is solid. The rule considers specific linkages, fulfilling the complexity criterion. With two supporting low-yield examples, coverage is adequate. The balance between specificity and coverage is well-maintained. Rule 8 is effectively defined.

---

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 specifies that α-amino acids with nonpolar aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms lead to low yield. The physical-chemical insight is good, explaining the lack of coordination sites. However, the rule is supported by only one low-yield example (phenylalanine), limiting coverage. The high-yield counterexample (tryptophan) helps clarify the rule but does not add to its coverage. To improve the balance between specificity and coverage, more supporting examples would be beneficial. Rule 9 is reasonable but could be strengthened with additional data.

---

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 clearly states that aliphatic carboxylic acids longer than 6 carbons containing polar functional groups lead to low yield. The physical-chemical explanation is logical, considering the disruption of hydrophobic interactions. The rule combines chain length and presence of polar groups, satisfying the complexity criterion. With three low-yield examples, the rule has good coverage. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate. Rule 10 is well-formulated.

---

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 indicates that aromatic carboxylic acids with substituents causing steric hindrance lead to low yield. While the physical-chemical insight regarding steric effects is valid, the rule lacks clarity in defining what constitutes significant steric hindrance. It is supported by only one low-yield example, limiting coverage. The complexity is acceptable, but to improve balance and clarity, more examples and a clearer definition are needed. Rule 11 requires refinement for better applicability.

---

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 specifies that modifiers containing intramolecular hydrogen bonding that limits coordinating groups lead to low yield. The physical-chemical insight is sound. However, the rule is supported by only one example, limiting its coverage. The complexity criterion is met by considering intramolecular interactions. To improve balance and robustness, additional supporting examples would be beneficial. Rule 12 is valid but needs enhanced coverage.

---

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 states that modifiers with mercapto (-SH) groups on short aliphatic chains lead to high yield. The physical-chemical insight is appropriate, highlighting sulfur's affinity for metals. However, the inclusion of 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid, which leads to low yield, creates confusion and affects clarity. With only one high-yield example, coverage is limited. To improve the rule, clarify the exception and provide additional high-yield examples. The balance between specificity and coverage needs enhancement. Rule 13 requires clarification and more data.

---

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 suggests that modifiers with para-substituted large heterocyclic groups lead to variable yield dependent on steric factors. While the physical-chemical insight is reasonable, the rule lacks predictive clarity due to its dependence on unspecified steric factors. It is supported by one high-yield and one low-yield example, limiting coverage. The complexity is higher, and the balance between complexity and coverage could be improved by providing clearer criteria and more examples. Rule 14 needs refinement for better applicability.

---

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 states that aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 3 to 5 carbons containing amino groups lead to high yield. The physical-chemical explanation is sound. However, with only one high-yield example, coverage is limited. The low-yield counterexamples clarify exceptions but highlight the need for more supporting data. The complexity criterion is met. To improve balance and robustness, additional high-yield examples fitting the criteria are needed. Rule 15 is reasonable but requires more data.

Current rules:
After carefully analyzing the provided dataset and considering the current rules, I've identified several areas where the rules can be improved. Some of the existing rules overlap, are too specific, or do not accurately capture the trends observed in the data. Therefore, I've crafted a new set of rules that better describe the relationship between the molecular modifiers' structures and the relative high or low yield of the reaction.

**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are **α-amino dicarboxylic acids** (α-amino acids with two carboxyl groups) lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)
  - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)

  **Explanation**: The presence of an α-amino group and two carboxyl groups provides multiple coordination sites with the metal center, enhancing catalyst stability and activity, resulting in high yield.

---

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms** in the ring lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)
  - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid

  **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings act as additional coordination sites, enhancing interactions with the metal catalyst and improving catalytic efficiency.

---

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with a para-substituted electron-donating group** (such as amino, hydroxy, or methoxy groups) lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 4-aminobenzoic acid
  - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
  - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups increase electron density on the aromatic ring, enhancing coordination with the metal center and promoting catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 5 to 8 carbons** without additional polar functional groups lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:
  - Octanoic acid

  **Low Yield Counterexamples**:
  - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid (contains hydroxyl group)
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid (contains amino group)
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid (contains amino group)

  **Explanation**: Long-chain aliphatic acids can interact favorably with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst, enhancing reaction efficiency. Additional polar groups may disrupt these interactions or interfere with coordination.

---

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers containing **multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic backbone** (polyhydroxy carboxylic acids) lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:
  - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

  **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous coordination sites, strengthening interactions with the metal center and enhancing catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups** (such as formyl or methyl groups) lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 4-formylbenzoic acid
  - 4-methylbenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density on the aromatic ring, reducing its ability to coordinate with the metal center, thereby decreasing catalytic performance.

---

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers that contain **strong electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups** result in **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Fluorinated groups are highly electronegative and withdraw electron density, weakening metal-ligand interactions and leading to reduced catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers that have **amide bonds or peptide linkages** result in **low yield** due to reduced availability of lone pairs for coordination.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
  - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Amide formation involves lone pairs on nitrogen and oxygen, reducing their availability for coordination with the metal, thereby weakening catalyst-modifier interactions.

---

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with nonpolar aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms** lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:
  - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)

  **High Yield Counterexample**:
  - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan; contains an indole ring with nitrogen)

  **Explanation**: Nonpolar aromatic side chains without heteroatoms provide few coordination sites. In contrast, heteroatom-containing side chains enhance metal-ligand interactions, leading to higher yield.

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids longer than 6 carbons containing polar functional groups** (such as amino or hydroxyl groups) lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Polar groups on long aliphatic chains may disrupt hydrophobic interactions or interfere with proper coordination with the metal center, reducing catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with substituents causing steric hindrance** lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (contains bulky fused rings)

  **Explanation**: Steric hindrance from bulky substituents can reduce the accessibility of coordination sites, diminishing catalyst-modifier binding and catalytic efficiency.

---

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers that contain **intramolecular hydrogen bonding** that limits the availability of coordinating groups lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:
  - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Intramolecular hydrogen bonding can sequester potential coordinating groups, reducing their availability to interact with the metal center, leading to decreased catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers with **mercapto (-SH) groups on short aliphatic chains** lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid (Note: Exception to the trend; see explanation)

  **Explanation**: Thiol groups have strong affinity for metal centers due to the soft nature of sulfur, enhancing coordination and catalytic activity. However, in aromatic systems like 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid, steric or electronic factors might reduce effectiveness, as seen with its low yield.

---

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted large heterocyclic groups** lead to **variable yield** dependent on steric factors.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid (less steric hindrance)

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (more steric hindrance)

  **Explanation**: The size and position of heterocyclic groups affect sterics and coordination ability. Modifiers with less steric hindrance can coordinate effectively, leading to high yield, while bulky groups reduce yield.

---

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 3 to 5 carbons containing amino groups** lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:
  - 5-aminopentanoic acid

  **Low Yield Counterexamples**:
  - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid (contains ether linkages)
  - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (longer chain and acetamido group)

  **Explanation**: Short aliphatic chains with amino groups can effectively coordinate with the metal center without significant steric hindrance, enhancing catalytic activity.

---

**End of Rules**

These rules aim to cover a broad range of the dataset while providing clear guidance on predicting the yield based on structural features of the modifiers. They balance simplicity and complexity, ensuring both higher coverage and specificity where necessary. The explanations tie the observed trends to underlying physicochemical properties, such as electron density, coordination ability, steric effects, and intramolecular interactions.

I believe these updated rules more accurately reflect the relationship between the molecular modifiers and the reaction yield, providing valuable insights for optimizing and controlling the reaction conditions.---------------------------------------------------------------

Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: **Correct the SMARTS patterns for positional isomerism in Rules 3 and 6**. The current patterns do not accurately specify **para-substitution** on the aromatic ring. Modify the SMARTS to ensure that the electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups and the carboxylic acid are in the **para positions** relative to each other. For example, use a pattern like `c1ccc(cc1[NX3;H2,H1,H0])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` for para-aminobenzoic acid, where the amino group and the carboxylic acid are opposite each other on the benzene ring.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Adjust SMARTS patterns to account for variable chain lengths and positions in Rules 4 and 13**. For Rule 4, update the aliphatic chain pattern to accommodate chain lengths of **5 to 8 carbons**, such as `[CH2]4,7[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]`. For Rule 13, generalize the thiol group pattern to match **short aliphatic chains of 2 to 4 carbons**, for example, `[SX2H][CH2]1,3[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]`.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Enhance the SMARTS patterns to accurately detect ortho-substitution in Rule 12**. The current pattern does not ensure that the hydroxy and formyl groups are **ortho to each other**, which is critical for intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Modify the pattern to explicitly specify ortho positions, such as `c1c([OX2H])c(ccc1)[CX3]=O` with appropriate ring numbering to ensure correct matching.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Include additional conditions or refine patterns in Rule 5 to match the intended number of hydroxyl groups**. The current condition requires at least **three hydroxyl groups**, but if the rule aims to target modifiers like **gluconic acid** with five hydroxyl groups, adjust the `hydroxyl_group_count` to **five** or specify a range, e.g., `hydroxyl_group_count >= 3`.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Revise the amide bond pattern in Rule 8 to ensure accurate detection of amide and peptide linkages**. The current pattern may not capture all types of amide bonds, especially in peptides. Use a more general pattern like `[NX3][CX3](=O)` to match any amide bond regardless of the substituents on the nitrogen and carbon atoms.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Implement comprehensive steric hindrance evaluation for Rule 14**. Since steric factors are crucial, consider integrating a method to assess **steric bulk** or use software tools that can evaluate **molecular descriptors** related to steric properties.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Thoroughly test and validate each SMARTS pattern against known examples and counterexamples**. Create a test set of molecules that are known to either match or not match each rule and ensure that the patterns correctly identify them.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Provide detailed comments and documentation within the code for clarity**. This will help collaborators understand the intent behind each pattern and condition, facilitating future modifications and maintenance.

Current rules:
After carefully analyzing the provided dataset and considering the current rules, I've identified several areas where the rules can be improved. Some of the existing rules overlap, are too specific, or do not accurately capture the trends observed in the data. Therefore, I've crafted a new set of rules that better describe the relationship between the molecular modifiers' structures and the relative high or low yield of the reaction.

**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are **α-amino dicarboxylic acids** (α-amino acids with two carboxyl groups) lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)
  - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)

  **Explanation**: The presence of an α-amino group and two carboxyl groups provides multiple coordination sites with the metal center, enhancing catalyst stability and activity, resulting in high yield.

---

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms** in the ring lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)
  - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid

  **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings act as additional coordination sites, enhancing interactions with the metal catalyst and improving catalytic efficiency.

---

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with a para-substituted electron-donating group** (such as amino, hydroxy, or methoxy groups) lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 4-aminobenzoic acid
  - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
  - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups increase electron density on the aromatic ring, enhancing coordination with the metal center and promoting catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 5 to 8 carbons** without additional polar functional groups lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:
  - Octanoic acid

  **Low Yield Counterexamples**:
  - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid (contains hydroxyl group)
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid (contains amino group)
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid (contains amino group)

  **Explanation**: Long-chain aliphatic acids can interact favorably with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst, enhancing reaction efficiency. Additional polar groups may disrupt these interactions or interfere with coordination.

---

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers containing **multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic backbone** (polyhydroxy carboxylic acids) lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:
  - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

  **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous coordination sites, strengthening interactions with the metal center and enhancing catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups** (such as formyl or methyl groups) lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 4-formylbenzoic acid
  - 4-methylbenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density on the aromatic ring, reducing its ability to coordinate with the metal center, thereby decreasing catalytic performance.

---

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers that contain **strong electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups** result in **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Fluorinated groups are highly electronegative and withdraw electron density, weakening metal-ligand interactions and leading to reduced catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers that have **amide bonds or peptide linkages** result in **low yield** due to reduced availability of lone pairs for coordination.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
  - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Amide formation involves lone pairs on nitrogen and oxygen, reducing their availability for coordination with the metal, thereby weakening catalyst-modifier interactions.

---

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with nonpolar aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms** lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:
  - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)

  **High Yield Counterexample**:
  - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan; contains an indole ring with nitrogen)

  **Explanation**: Nonpolar aromatic side chains without heteroatoms provide few coordination sites. In contrast, heteroatom-containing side chains enhance metal-ligand interactions, leading to higher yield.

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids longer than 6 carbons containing polar functional groups** (such as amino or hydroxyl groups) lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Polar groups on long aliphatic chains may disrupt hydrophobic interactions or interfere with proper coordination with the metal center, reducing catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with substituents causing steric hindrance** lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (contains bulky fused rings)

  **Explanation**: Steric hindrance from bulky substituents can reduce the accessibility of coordination sites, diminishing catalyst-modifier binding and catalytic efficiency.

---

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers that contain **intramolecular hydrogen bonding** that limits the availability of coordinating groups lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:
  - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Intramolecular hydrogen bonding can sequester potential coordinating groups, reducing their availability to interact with the metal center, leading to decreased catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers with **mercapto (-SH) groups on short aliphatic chains** lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid (Note: Exception to the trend; see explanation)

  **Explanation**: Thiol groups have strong affinity for metal centers due to the soft nature of sulfur, enhancing coordination and catalytic activity. However, in aromatic systems like 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid, steric or electronic factors might reduce effectiveness, as seen with its low yield.

---

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted large heterocyclic groups** lead to **variable yield** dependent on steric factors.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid (less steric hindrance)

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (more steric hindrance)

  **Explanation**: The size and position of heterocyclic groups affect sterics and coordination ability. Modifiers with less steric hindrance can coordinate effectively, leading to high yield, while bulky groups reduce yield.

---

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 3 to 5 carbons containing amino groups** lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:
  - 5-aminopentanoic acid

  **Low Yield Counterexamples**:
  - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid (contains ether linkages)
  - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (longer chain and acetamido group)

  **Explanation**: Short aliphatic chains with amino groups can effectively coordinate with the metal center without significant steric hindrance, enhancing catalytic activity.

---

**End of Rules**

These rules aim to cover a broad range of the dataset while providing clear guidance on predicting the yield based on structural features of the modifiers. They balance simplicity and complexity, ensuring both higher coverage and specificity where necessary. The explanations tie the observed trends to underlying physicochemical properties, such as electron density, coordination ability, steric effects, and intramolecular interactions.

I believe these updated rules more accurately reflect the relationship between the molecular modifiers and the reaction yield, providing valuable insights for optimizing and controlling the reaction conditions.---------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: **For Rule 3**, the current SMARTS pattern `"[c][c]( [c][c]( [c][c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1] ) )[NX3H2,O,NH1,OH]"` is too restrictive and may not accurately capture para-substituted electron-donating groups on aromatic carboxylic acids. This pattern attempts to represent a specific substitution pattern but may miss valid molecules. Instead, use a more general pattern that looks for aromatic carboxylic acids with a para-substituted electron-donating group:

  ```python
  "[cH]1[cH][cH][cH][cH][cH]1C(=O)O"  # Aromatic ring with carboxylic acid
  ```
  
  Then, check for para-substituted electron-donating groups (EDGs) such as hydroxyl, amino, or methoxy:

  ```python
  "[cH]1[cH][cH][c][c][cH]1C(=O)O"  # Base aromatic carboxylic acid
  ```
  
  Combine these with a separate check for EDGs at the para position:

  ```python
  "[cH]1[cH][c][c][c]([NX3H2,NX3H1,O,NH1,OH,OX2H1])[cH]1C(=O)O"
  ```

- **Suggestion 2**: **For Rule 4**, the implementation of the `no_other_heteroatoms` check may be overly restrictive. Currently, it excludes any molecule containing elements other than carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen (even those necessary for the carboxyl group). Instead, modify the check to allow oxygen atoms involved in carboxylic acid groups but exclude other heteroatoms:

  ```python
  # Allowable atomic numbers: 1 (H), 6 (C), 8 (O)
  allowed_atomic_nums = {1, 6, 8}
  for atom in mol.GetAtoms():
      if atom.GetAtomicNum() not in allowed_atomic_nums:
          match = False
          break
  ```

- **Suggestion 3**: **For Rule 5**, the pattern `"[CX4][OX2H]"` may not match all hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic backbone, especially secondary or tertiary alcohols. Adjust the pattern to include all aliphatic hydroxyl groups:

  ```python
  "[#6][OX2H]"  # Any carbon single-bonded to a hydroxyl group
  ```
  
  Additionally, ensure that the count of hydroxyl groups is correctly obtained:

  ```python
  'count_patterns': { "[#6][OX2H]": 3, "[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]": 1 }
  ```
  
  This will correctly require at least three hydroxyl groups and one carboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 4**: **For Rule 6**, the patterns may miss molecules with other electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs). Expand the patterns to include a variety of EWGs, such as nitro, cyano, or halogens:

  ```python
  "[cH]1[cH][c]( [c][c]( [c][c]C(=O)O ) )[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]"  # para-formylbenzoic acid
  "[cH]1[cH][c]( [c][c]( [c][c]C(=O)O ) )[CX4H3]"  # para-methylbenzoic acid
  "[cH]1[cH][c]( [c][c]( [c][c]C(=O)O ) )[NX3+](=O)[O-]"  # para-nitrobenzoic acid
  ```

- **Suggestion 5**: **For Rule 7**, the current patterns `"[CF3]"` and `"[C](F)(F)F"` only match trifluoromethyl groups. To capture other fluorinated groups, include patterns for perfluoroalkyl chains:

  ```python
  "[CX4;$([CF][F]),$([CF2][F]),$([CF3])]"  # Carbon attached to multiple fluorines
  ```

- **Suggestion 6**: **For Rule 8**, the pattern `"[NX3][CX3](=O)[#6]"` may match amides but could also match other structures unintentionally. Refine the pattern to specifically match amide bonds connected to carbon chains:

  ```python
  "[NX3][CX3](=O)[#6]"  # Amide bond N-C=O-C
  ```
  
  Ensure that the nitrogen is not part of a ring unless specified.

- **Suggestion 7**: **For Rule 9**, the side chain pattern `"[CX4][c]1[c][c][c][c][c]1"` may not account for different positions of the aromatic ring. Modify the pattern to match any aromatic ring bonded to the alpha carbon:

  ```python
  "[NX3][CX4][CX4][c]1[cH][cH][cH][cH][cH]1"  # Alpha amino acid with aromatic side chain
  ```
  
  Ensure that the aromatic ring lacks heteroatoms (e.g., exclude indole or phenol).

- **Suggestion 8**: **For Rule 10**, the pattern `"[CH3][CH2]{5,}[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]"` correctly identifies aliphatic carboxylic acids longer than 6 carbons. However, the pattern `"[#6][O,N,S][#6]"` may miss polar groups at different positions. Instead, search for polar functional groups anywhere in the molecule:

  ```python
  polar_functional_groups = ["[OX2H]", "[NX3;H2,H1]", "[SX2H]"]  # Hydroxyl, amino, thiol groups
  ```
  
  Use `HasSubstructMatch` for these patterns to identify polar functional groups.

- **Suggestion 9**: **For Rule 11**, the pattern `"[a][a][a]"` is too general and may not accurately detect steric hindrance. Instead, look for ortho-substituted bulky groups or fused rings adjacent to the carboxyl group:

  ```python
  "[c][c]([c][c](C(=O)O)[a])[a]"  # Aromatic carboxylic acid with adjacent fused ring
  ```

- **Suggestion 10**: **For Rule 12**, the current pattern `"[c][c](O)[c](=O)[c][c]"` may not adequately capture intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Modify the pattern to specifically look for ortho-hydroxyl and carbonyl groups:

  ```python
  "[cH]1[cH][c](O)[c](C(=O)O)[cH][cH]1"  # Ortho-hydroxybenzoic acid
  ```
  
  Also, consider the possibility of intramolecular hydrogen bonds forming between different functional groups.

- **Suggestion 11**: **For Rule 13**, the pattern `"[CH3][CH2]{0,2}[SX2H]"` may exclude valid thiol-containing modifiers. Expand the pattern to include any short aliphatic chain with a terminal thiol group:

  ```python
  "[#6]{1,3}[SX2H]"  # Aliphatic chain (1-3 carbons) ending with -SH
  ```

- **Suggestion 12**: **For Rule 14**, since the patterns list is empty, the rule is not implemented. To improve, define SMARTS patterns that capture para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with large heterocyclic groups:

  ```python
  "[cH]1[cH][c]( [c][c]( [c][c]C(=O)O ) )[a]"  # Para-substituted heterocycle
  ```
  
  Decide how to encode variable yields, possibly by assigning a value or flag indicating variability.

- **Suggestion 13**: **For Rule 15**, ensure that the amino group is correctly positioned on the aliphatic chain. Adjust the patterns:

  ```python
  "[CH3][CH2]{1,3}[CH](N)[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]"  # Short aliphatic chain with amino group and carboxylic acid
  ```
  
  Verify that the amino group is attached to the chain and not elsewhere.

- **Suggestion 14**: **General Code Improvement**: Add error handling and detailed logging to the code to catch any exceptions or mismatches during SMARTS compilation and matching. For example:

  ```python
  # When compiling patterns
  try:
      pat = Chem.MolFromSmarts(smarts)
      if pat is None:
          raise ValueError(f"Invalid SMARTS pattern: {smarts}")
  except Exception as e:
      print(f"Error compiling SMARTS {smarts} for rule {rule['number']}: {e}")
      continue  # Skip invalid patterns
  ```
  
  This will help identify and fix issues in SMARTS patterns.

- **Suggestion 15**: **SMARTS Patterns Validation**: Use a cheminformatics toolkit or SMARTS editor to validate all SMARTS patterns before implementing them in the code. Incorrect SMARTS syntax can lead to patterns not matching as intended. Testing each pattern individually will ensure accuracy.

Current rules:
After carefully analyzing the provided dataset and considering the current rules, I've identified several areas where the rules can be improved. Some of the existing rules overlap, are too specific, or do not accurately capture the trends observed in the data. Therefore, I've crafted a new set of rules that better describe the relationship between the molecular modifiers' structures and the relative high or low yield of the reaction.

**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are **α-amino dicarboxylic acids** (α-amino acids with two carboxyl groups) lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)
  - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)

  **Explanation**: The presence of an α-amino group and two carboxyl groups provides multiple coordination sites with the metal center, enhancing catalyst stability and activity, resulting in high yield.

---

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms** in the ring lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)
  - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid

  **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings act as additional coordination sites, enhancing interactions with the metal catalyst and improving catalytic efficiency.

---

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with a para-substituted electron-donating group** (such as amino, hydroxy, or methoxy groups) lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 4-aminobenzoic acid
  - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
  - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups increase electron density on the aromatic ring, enhancing coordination with the metal center and promoting catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 5 to 8 carbons** without additional polar functional groups lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:
  - Octanoic acid

  **Low Yield Counterexamples**:
  - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid (contains hydroxyl group)
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid (contains amino group)
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid (contains amino group)

  **Explanation**: Long-chain aliphatic acids can interact favorably with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst, enhancing reaction efficiency. Additional polar groups may disrupt these interactions or interfere with coordination.

---

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers containing **multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic backbone** (polyhydroxy carboxylic acids) lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:
  - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

  **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous coordination sites, strengthening interactions with the metal center and enhancing catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups** (such as formyl or methyl groups) lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 4-formylbenzoic acid
  - 4-methylbenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density on the aromatic ring, reducing its ability to coordinate with the metal center, thereby decreasing catalytic performance.

---

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers that contain **strong electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups** result in **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Fluorinated groups are highly electronegative and withdraw electron density, weakening metal-ligand interactions and leading to reduced catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers that have **amide bonds or peptide linkages** result in **low yield** due to reduced availability of lone pairs for coordination.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
  - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Amide formation involves lone pairs on nitrogen and oxygen, reducing their availability for coordination with the metal, thereby weakening catalyst-modifier interactions.

---

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with nonpolar aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms** lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:
  - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)

  **High Yield Counterexample**:
  - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan; contains an indole ring with nitrogen)

  **Explanation**: Nonpolar aromatic side chains without heteroatoms provide few coordination sites. In contrast, heteroatom-containing side chains enhance metal-ligand interactions, leading to higher yield.

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids longer than 6 carbons containing polar functional groups** (such as amino or hydroxyl groups) lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Polar groups on long aliphatic chains may disrupt hydrophobic interactions or interfere with proper coordination with the metal center, reducing catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with substituents causing steric hindrance** lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (contains bulky fused rings)

  **Explanation**: Steric hindrance from bulky substituents can reduce the accessibility of coordination sites, diminishing catalyst-modifier binding and catalytic efficiency.

---

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers that contain **intramolecular hydrogen bonding** that limits the availability of coordinating groups lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:
  - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Intramolecular hydrogen bonding can sequester potential coordinating groups, reducing their availability to interact with the metal center, leading to decreased catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers with **mercapto (-SH) groups on short aliphatic chains** lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid (Note: Exception to the trend; see explanation)

  **Explanation**: Thiol groups have strong affinity for metal centers due to the soft nature of sulfur, enhancing coordination and catalytic activity. However, in aromatic systems like 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid, steric or electronic factors might reduce effectiveness, as seen with its low yield.

---

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted large heterocyclic groups** lead to **variable yield** dependent on steric factors.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid (less steric hindrance)

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (more steric hindrance)

  **Explanation**: The size and position of heterocyclic groups affect sterics and coordination ability. Modifiers with less steric hindrance can coordinate effectively, leading to high yield, while bulky groups reduce yield.

---

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 3 to 5 carbons containing amino groups** lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:
  - 5-aminopentanoic acid

  **Low Yield Counterexamples**:
  - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid (contains ether linkages)
  - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (longer chain and acetamido group)

  **Explanation**: Short aliphatic chains with amino groups can effectively coordinate with the metal center without significant steric hindrance, enhancing catalytic activity.

---

**End of Rules**

These rules aim to cover a broad range of the dataset while providing clear guidance on predicting the yield based on structural features of the modifiers. They balance simplicity and complexity, ensuring both higher coverage and specificity where necessary. The explanations tie the observed trends to underlying physicochemical properties, such as electron density, coordination ability, steric effects, and intramolecular interactions.

I believe these updated rules more accurately reflect the relationship between the molecular modifiers and the reaction yield, providing valuable insights for optimizing and controlling the reaction conditions.---------------------------------------------------------------

Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: *For Rule 1*, the SMARTS patterns used in the code do not accurately capture all α-amino dicarboxylic acids. Modify the SMARTS patterns to ensure that the amino group is attached to the α-carbon (the carbon next to the carboxyl group) and that there are two carboxylic acid groups present. Use the following SMARTS patterns:

  - **α-amino acid backbone**: `[NX3H2][CX4H]([#6])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]`
  - **Additional carboxylic acid group**: `[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]`

  Implement a check to ensure that the molecule contains exactly two carboxylic acid groups and that they are connected appropriately within the molecule.

- **Suggestion 2**: *For Rule 2*, the code's patterns for identifying heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms are too general and may miss certain structures. Update the SMARTS patterns to include heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen atoms and ensure the carboxylic acid is directly attached to the aromatic ring. Use a SMARTS pattern like:

  - **Heteroaromatic ring with nitrogen**: `[$([nH]),n]` (matches nitrogen atoms in an aromatic ring)
  - **Carboxylic acid attached to aromatic ring**: `[a][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]`

  Combine these to ensure both features are present in the molecule.

- **Suggestion 3**: *For Rule 3*, the code does not accurately detect para-substituted electron-donating groups on aromatic carboxylic acids. Improve the SMARTS pattern to specifically match para-substitution by using ring indexing in SMARTS. For example:

  - **Aromatic ring with carboxylic acid and EDG in para position**:
    ```
    [c:1][c:2][c:3][c:4][c:5][c:6]1
    [$([c:1][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]),$([c:1][!#1])] 
    [$([c:4][OX2H]),$([c:4][NX3H2]),$([c:4][OX2][CH3])]
    ```
    This pattern ensures the carboxylic acid and the electron-donating group are positioned para to each other on the aromatic ring.

- **Suggestion 4**: *For Rule 4*, using specific SMILES strings for chain lengths is ineffective. Replace this with a SMARTS pattern that matches any aliphatic carboxylic acid with a carbon chain length of 5 to 8 carbons and no additional polar functional groups. Use:

  - **Aliphatic carboxylic acid with 5-8 carbons**: `C(CCCCC)C(=O)O`, `C(CCCCCC)C(=O)O`, etc.
  
  Instead, generalize using SMARTS:

  - `[CH3][CH2]{3,6}[CH2][C](=O)[O][H]`

  This matches linear aliphatic chains with 5 to 8 carbons ending with a carboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 5**: Ensure that the SMARTS patterns are correctly compiled and used as patterns for substructure searches. Do not use SMILES strings as patterns, as this can lead to incorrect matching. All patterns should be SMARTS strings and properly encompass the variety within each rule.

- **Suggestion 6**: Expand the code to include all 15 rules provided in the "Start of Rules" section. Each rule should be carefully translated into appropriate SMARTS patterns that accurately represent the structural descriptors mentioned.

- **Suggestion 7**: Review the exclude patterns for each rule to ensure they are not overly broad. For instance, in Rule 4, exclude patterns should not eliminate molecules that have functional groups allowed in the rule. Make sure the exclude patterns are specific to only the undesired groups.

- **Suggestion 8**: When counting substructures (e.g., the number of carboxylic acid groups in Rule 1), ensure that overlapping matches are handled correctly. Use the `mol.GetSubstructMatches()` method with the `uniq=True` parameter to avoid counting the same atom multiple times.

- **Suggestion 9**: Add unit tests or validation checks to the code using known molecules that should match or not match each rule. This will help verify that each rule is correctly implemented and can catch any logical errors in the pattern matching.

- **Suggestion 10**: For rules requiring positional specificity (like para-substitution in Rule 3), consider using more advanced SMARTS patterns or RDKit functionalities that can handle relative positioning on rings. This may involve using atom maps or recursive SMARTS to specify the exact relationship between substituents.

- **Suggestion 11**: For Rule 2 and others involving aromaticity and heteroatoms, ensure that the SMARTS patterns account for different resonance structures and tautomers. Use RDKit's aromaticity models to accurately detect aromatic heterocycles.

- **Suggestion 12**: Refactor the code to modularize the pattern matching for clarity and maintainability. This will make it easier to add new rules and modify existing ones without affecting the overall structure.

- **Suggestion 13**: Include comments and documentation within the code explaining the purpose of each SMARTS pattern and any assumptions made. This will help collaborators understand the logic behind each rule's implementation.

- **Suggestion 14**: Consider using RDKit's built-in functions for specific functional group detection, such as `rdkit.Chem.Fragments`, which can sometimes simplify pattern matching for common functional groups.

- **Suggestion 15**: After updating the code, regenerate the feature matrix and compare it to expected results to confirm that the transformation from language rules to numeric features is now accurate.

**Analysis of Current Rules Based on Metrics**

**Introduction**

The performance of the current rules can be evaluated by analyzing the provided metrics and comparing them to the reference metrics from previous iterations. Focusing on **confidence** and **lift**, we can assess how well the current rules predict high or low yields and determine if further improvements are needed.

---

**Comparison with Reference Metrics**

*Previous Rule Metrics for Reference:*

- **Train Support:** [0.1667, 0.1845]
- **Test Support:** [0.0833, 0.1354]
- **Train Confidence:** [0.6352, 0.5396]
- **Test Confidence:** [0.3333, 0.4639]
- **Train Lift:** [1.2048, 1.0559]
- **Test Lift:** [0.6889, 0.9137]
- **Train Leverage:** [0.0289, -0.0041]
- **Test Leverage:** [-0.0313, -0.0339]

*Current Metrics (Latest Iteration):*

- **Train Support:** 0.0357
- **Train Confidence:** 0.6875
- **Train Lift:** 1.3507
- **Train Leverage:** 0.0137

---

**Performance Evaluation**

1. **Confidence**

   - **Improvement Observed:** The current **train confidence** is **0.6875**, higher than the previous average train confidence values of **0.6352** and **0.5396**.
   - **Interpretation:** This means that when the conditions of the current rules are met, there is a 68.75% chance of correctly predicting the outcome (high yield). The increase in confidence indicates that the rules are more accurate in their predictions compared to previous iterations.

2. **Lift**

   - **Improvement Observed:** The current **train lift** is **1.3507**, which is higher than the previous average train lift values of **1.2048** and **1.0559**.
   - **Interpretation:** A lift value greater than 1 indicates that the rule is better at predicting the outcome than random chance. The increase in lift suggests that the current rules have a stronger association with the high-yield outcome and are more effective at identifying meaningful relationships.

3. **Support**

   - **Reduction Observed:** The current **train support** is **0.0357**, which is lower than the previous supports of **0.1667** and **0.1845**.
   - **Interpretation:** Support reflects the proportion of data that the rule applies to. The lower support indicates that while the current rules are more accurate when they apply, they cover a smaller portion of the dataset. This trade-off between confidence and support suggests that the rules are more specific but less general.

4. **Leverage**

   - **Positive Value:** The current **train leverage** is **0.0137**, a positive value.
   - **Interpretation:** Positive leverage indicates a stronger association than expected by chance. Although slightly lower than previous positive leverage values, it still signifies that the rules add value beyond random association.

---

**Assessment of Iterative Progress and Local Minimum**

The improvements in confidence and lift suggest that the current rules are more precise and have a better predictive power for high-yield outcomes within the subset of data they cover. However, the decrease in support indicates that these rules apply to fewer instances, potentially limiting their practical utility.

Reaching a local minimum in this context would imply that further iterations may not yield significant improvements in both confidence and support simultaneously. The current iteration shows enhanced confidence and lift but reduced support, suggesting a possible local minimum where increasing one metric adversely affects another.

---

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

To enhance the performance of the current rules, consider the following strategies:

1. **Increase Support Without Sacrificing Confidence**

   - **Broaden Rule Conditions:** Slightly relax overly strict conditions in the rules to encompass more data points while maintaining acceptable confidence levels.
   - **Identify Common Features:** Look for additional features shared among high-yield modifiers that can be incorporated into the rules without diluting their specificity.

2. **Balance Specificity and Generality**

   - **Merge Similar Rules:** Combine rules that have overlapping conditions to increase support. For example, if multiple rules pertain to modifiers with electron-donating groups, they could be unified.
   - **Avoid Over-Specificity:** Ensure that rules are not too narrowly defined by avoiding overly specific functional groups or structural motifs that apply to very few modifiers.

3. **Validate with Test Data**

   - **Split Data for Validation:** Use a portion of the dataset as test data to evaluate the rules' performance outside the training set.
   - **Monitor Overfitting:** Ensure that the high confidence and lift are not a result of overfitting to the training data by checking performance on unseen data.

4. **Incorporate Additional Data Analysis**

   - **Statistical Analysis:** Use statistical methods to identify significant features associated with high yield.
   - **Machine Learning Techniques:** Employ algorithms (e.g., decision trees, random forests) to discover patterns that may not be immediately apparent.

5. **Refine Existing Rules**

   - **Rule Simplification:** Simplify complex rules to make them more general while monitoring their impact on confidence and lift.
   - **Eliminate Redundancies:** Remove rules that do not significantly contribute to predictive power or that overlap substantially with more effective rules.

6. **Consider External Factors**

   - **Additional Variables:** Evaluate whether other factors (e.g., reaction conditions, catalyst properties) influence yield and can be integrated into the rules.
   - **Chemical Intuition:** Consult domain experts to incorporate chemical reasoning that may not be captured fully by the data.

---

**Suggestions for Specific Rules**

- **Rules with Low Support:**

  - **Rule 6** and **Rule 8** have conditions that may be too specific, resulting in low support. Consider generalizing these rules to include a broader range of electron-withdrawing groups or functional groups that reduce coordination ability.

- **Rules with Potential for Expansion:**

  - **Rule 3** (aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-donating groups) can be expanded by exploring additional electron-donating substituents or positions on the ring that might still contribute to high yield.
  - **Rule 5** (modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups) might include modifiers with similar polyfunctional groups, such as polyamines, to increase support.

- **Combine Similar High-Yield Rules:**

  - Merge **Rules 1**, **3**, and **5** under a broader rule that encompasses modifiers with multiple coordination sites due to electron-donating groups or multiple functional groups.

- **Address Overlapping Low-Yield Rules:**

  - **Rules 6**, **7**, and **8** all pertain to modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups or reduced coordination ability. Combining these could increase support while maintaining high confidence.

---

**Conclusion**

The current rules demonstrate improved confidence and lift, indicating stronger predictive capabilities for high-yield reactions when the rules apply. However, the reduced support highlights the need to make the rules more general to cover a larger portion of the dataset.

By adjusting the specificity of the rules, combining similar rules, and validating with additional data, it is possible to improve both support and confidence. This balanced approach will enhance the practical applicability of the rules, ensuring they are both accurate and broadly relevant.

Continuous iteration, guided by both statistical metrics and chemical expertise, will facilitate the development of optimal rules that effectively predict reaction yields and provide valuable insights into the underlying chemistry.

---

**Next Steps**

- **Iterate Rule Refinement:** Apply the recommendations to adjust the current rules and generate new metrics.
- **Evaluate Performance:** Compare new metrics against both current and reference metrics.
- **Monitor Trends:** Look for improvements in both confidence and support to avoid local minima.
- **Engage Experts:** Collaborate with chemists to validate the rules from a domain knowledge perspective.

By following these steps, the rules can be further optimized, leading to a more robust predictive model for catalytic reactions.

Traditional Commenter Message:
**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

1. **Effectiveness of the Current Rules**

The current set of rules has resulted in a **5-fold validation accuracy of 0.5429** (approximately **54.29%**). This is a significant decline compared to the previous validation accuracies, which consistently hovered around **76%**. The trend over the iterations shows a noticeable decrease in accuracy:

- **Initial Iterations**:
  - Validation Accuracies: **[0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]**
  - Test Accuracies: **0.75** and **0.625**

- **Subsequent Iterations**:
  - Validation Accuracies:
    - **0.77**
    - **0.71**
    - **0.68**
    - **0.66**
    - **0.57**
    - **0.54**

This downward trend indicates that the **effectiveness of the rules has diminished** over the iterations. The current rules are not performing as well in predicting the catalyst loading accurately.

2. **Assessment of Overfitting and Underfitting**

- **Overfitting**: If the model were overfitting, we would expect high training accuracy but low validation accuracy. However, the validation accuracy has decreased significantly, suggesting that overfitting may not be the primary issue.

- **Underfitting**: The consistent decline in validation accuracy suggests that the model may be **underfitting**. The current rules might be too generalized or not sufficiently capturing the underlying patterns in the data, leading to poor performance on both the training and validation sets.

3. **Analysis of Discrepancies Based on SHAP Values**

The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis provides insights into how each rule contributes to the model's predictions. We focus on two key discrepancies:

- **Underestimation Cases** (Predicted Low, Experimental High):

  - **Example Molecules**:
    - **C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O**
    - **C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)N**
    - **C([C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](C(=O)O)O)O)O)O)O**

  - **SHAP Values**:
    - **Rule1**: Negative SHAP values (e.g., **-0.0206**)
    - **Rule2**: Negative SHAP values (e.g., **-0.0446**)

  - **Interpretation**: The negative SHAP values for **Rule1** and **Rule2** indicate that these rules are contributing to the prediction of low loading when the experimental value is actually high. This suggests that **Rule1** and **Rule2** may be **penalizing molecules that should result in high loading**, leading to underestimation.

- **Overestimation Cases** (Predicted High, Experimental Low):

  - **No explicit overestimation cases are provided in the latest SHAP analysis.** However, given that the overall accuracy is low, it's likely that some overestimations are occurring.

- **Problematic Rules**:

  - **Rule1**: Appears to be contributing significantly to underestimations when it provides negative SHAP values in cases where the experimental loading is high.
  - **Rule2**: Also contributes to underestimations but may have less impact than Rule1 based on the magnitude of SHAP values.

4. **Interpretation of Accuracy Trends**

The decreasing accuracy metrics suggest that the current rules are not improving the model's performance. Instead, the model's ability to predict the correct catalyst loading has **deteriorated over successive iterations**. This points to potential issues with the rules becoming less representative of the underlying data patterns or possibly introducing conflicting or overlapping criteria that confuse the model.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis**

- **Significant Contributors**: **Rule1** consistently shows significant SHAP values (both positive and negative) across various molecules, indicating that it has a substantial impact on the model's predictions.

- **Rule Overlap and Conflicts**: The SHAP analysis may be highlighting overlaps or conflicts between rules. For instance, if both **Rule1** and **Rule2** are firing simultaneously but contributing opposing SHAP values, this could lead to confusion in the model and incorrect predictions.

- **Underrepresented Features**: The SHAP values suggest that certain molecular features important for accurate prediction might not be sufficiently captured by the current rules.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

1. **Refine Problematic Rules**

   - **Rule1**: Given its significant negative SHAP contributions in underestimation cases, **Rule1** should be closely examined and potentially revised. It's possible that **Rule1 is too broad or incorrectly formulated**, causing it to incorrectly assign low loading to molecules that should have high loading.

     - **Action**: Re-evaluate the criteria of **Rule1** to ensure it accurately reflects the chemical properties that lead to high catalyst loading. Consider narrowing down the scope or adding additional conditions to prevent misclassification.

   - **Rule2**: Similarly, **Rule2** may need adjustment to reduce its negative impact in underestimation cases.

     - **Action**: Assess whether **Rule2** overlaps with **Rule1** or other rules, and modify it to reduce potential conflicts. Ensure that **Rule2** captures distinct molecular features not covered by other rules.

2. **Address Overfitting and Underfitting**

   - **Improve Generalization**: Review all the rules to determine if they are either too specific (overfitting) or too general (underfitting).

     - **Action**: Balance the specificity and generality of the rules by ensuring they are neither too narrow (applying to very few molecules) nor too broad (applying indiscriminately). This may involve combining similar rules or splitting complex rules into simpler, more focused ones.

3. **Eliminate Redundant or Conflicting Rules**

   - **Simplify the Rule Set**: Reduce the total number of rules to minimize redundancy and potential conflicts.

     - **Action**: Identify and remove rules that overlap significantly or contradict each other. Ensure that each rule contributes unique and valuable information to the model.

4. **Incorporate Additional Molecular Features**

   - **Enhance Feature Representation**: If certain molecular characteristics influencing catalyst loading are not adequately captured, consider introducing new rules or modifying existing ones to include these features.

     - **Action**: Analyze molecules with high prediction errors to identify common features not accounted for by current rules. Develop new rules that address these features without overcomplicating the model.

5. **Iterative Testing and Validation**

   - **Incremental Adjustments**: Rather than overhauling multiple rules simultaneously, make targeted adjustments to one or two rules and observe the impact on model performance.

     - **Action**: After refining **Rule1** and **Rule2**, retrain the model and evaluate the change in accuracy. Use SHAP analysis to verify that the adjustments have reduced mispredictions.

6. **Leverage SHAP Insights Without Direct Modification**

   - **Indirect Utilization of SHAP Analysis**: While we cannot directly use SHAP results to modify the rules, we can use them to identify which rules are contributing to errors.

     - **Action**: Use the SHAP values to prioritize which rules to examine and refine, focusing on those with high positive SHAP values in overestimations and high negative values in underestimations.

**Conclusion**

The current rules are not effectively predicting the catalyst loading, as evidenced by the decreased validation accuracy and insights from the SHAP analysis. Focusing on refining **Rule1** and **Rule2**, addressing potential overfitting or underfitting, and simplifying the rule set are critical steps toward improving the model's performance. By making targeted adjustments and iteratively validating their impact, we can enhance the accuracy and reliability of the predictions.

---

**Next Steps**

1. **Review and Refine Rule1 and Rule2**: Analyze the conditions and definitions of these rules to ensure they accurately represent the molecular features leading to high catalyst loading.

2. **Re-evaluate Other Rules**: Assess the remaining rules for redundancy, conflicts, and effectiveness, making adjustments as necessary to improve overall model performance.

3. **Retrain and Validate the Model**: After making adjustments, retrain the classification model and perform cross-validation to evaluate improvements in accuracy.

4. **Monitor Accuracy Trends**: Keep track of validation accuracies over iterations to ensure that changes lead to improvements rather than further declines.

5. **Continue Iterative Refinement**: Utilize SHAP analysis in an indirect manner to guide further refinements, ensuring that each iteration brings us closer to an optimal set of rules.

By following these recommendations, we aim to enhance the model's ability to predict catalyst loading accurately, ultimately contributing to more efficient catalyst design and optimization in the research program.

Project Manager Message:
**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing the Current Rules**

**1. Overview of Current Situation**

In the task of predicting the yield of a radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction of aliphatic alcohols using various molecular modifiers, a set of rules has been established to relate the structural features of the modifiers to the reaction yield. The current rules aim to distinguish between modifiers that lead to high yields and those that result in low yields based on their chemical structures.

**2. Performance Evaluation**

Recent iterations of the model using these rules have shown a decline in predictive performance:

- **Declining Accuracy**: The 5-fold cross-validation accuracy has decreased from approximately 76% in earlier iterations to about 54% in the most recent one.

- **Metric Analysis**:
  - **Train Confidence**: While there's a slight improvement in confidence (from 63.52% to 68.75%), the overall predictive power is limited due to low support.
  - **Train Support**: The support has decreased significantly (from around 18% to 3.57%), indicating that the rules apply to fewer data points.
  - **Lift**: There's an increase in lift, suggesting that when the rules do apply, they are more effective than random chance in predicting high yields.

- **SHAP Analysis**:
  - **Underestimations**: Rules 1 and 2 are contributing to underestimations of yield. Negative SHAP values for these rules in molecules with experimentally high yields indicate that they may be incorrectly penalizing certain compounds.
  - **Overfitting and Underfitting**: The decrease in validation accuracy suggests that the model might be underfitting, failing to capture the underlying patterns in the dataset.

**3. Identified Issues with Current Rules**

- **Over-Specificity**: Some rules are too narrowly defined, leading to low support and limiting their applicability across the dataset.

- **Conflicting or Redundant Rules**: Overlaps and contradictions between rules, especially between Rules 1 and 2, may cause confusion in the model and misclassification.

- **Incorrect SMARTS Patterns**: Some SMARTS patterns used for rule implementation may not accurately capture the intended structural features, leading to incorrect matching and faulty predictions.

- **Balance Between Specificity and Generality**: The current rules may not strike the right balance, being either too specific (missing many relevant compounds) or too general (not providing meaningful predictions).

**Suggestions to Improve the Current Rules**

1. **Refine Problematic Rules**

   - **Rule 1 (α-Amino Dicarboxylic Acids)**:
     - **Issue**: The SMARTS patterns may not accurately capture all α-amino dicarboxylic acids.
     - **Improvement**: Update the SMARTS patterns to ensure the amino group is attached to the α-carbon and that there are exactly two carboxylic acid groups. Use patterns like:
       - `[NX3H2][CH]([CX3](=O)[OX1H])[CX3](=O)[OX1H]`
     - **Action**: Verify and test the new patterns against known examples to ensure accurate matching.

   - **Rule 2 (Heteroaromatic Carboxylic Acids with Nitrogen)**:
     - **Issue**: The patterns may be too general or miss certain ring structures.
     - **Improvement**: Use more specific SMARTS patterns to capture heteroaromatic rings containing nitrogen atoms directly connected to carboxylic acid groups:
       - `[$([nH]),n][c][c][c][c][c][CX3](=O)[OX1H]`
     - **Action**: Ensure the pattern accounts for different heteroaromatic systems and test it extensively.

2. **Optimize SMARTS Patterns for Other Rules**

   - **Rule 3 (Para-Substituted Electron-Donating Groups)**:
     - **Improvement**: Use ring-indexed SMARTS patterns to specifically detect para-substitution on aromatic rings:
       - `[$(c1ccc([CX3](=O)[OX1H])cc1),$([c]1ccc([OX2H])cc1),$([c]1ccc([NX3H2])cc1)]`
     - **Action**: Ensure the patterns correctly identify molecules with electron-donating groups in the para position.

   - **Rule 4 (Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids with Chain Lengths of 5 to 8 Carbons)**:
     - **Improvement**: Generalize the pattern to match any straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acid without additional functional groups:
       - `C(CCCCCC)[CX3](=O)[OX1H]`
       - Use a variable repetition in SMARTS: `C(CC){3,6}[CX3](=O)[OX1H]`
     - **Action**: Ensure the pattern does not exclude molecules that meet the rule's criteria.

3. **Reduce Overlaps and Conflicts Between Rules**

   - **Action**: Review all rules for potential overlaps and contradictions. For instance, determine if Rules 1 and 2 are conflicting in certain cases and adjust them to minimize misclassification.

4. **Simplify and Generalize Rules Where Appropriate**

   - **Balance Specificity and Generality**: Adjust overly specific rules to be more inclusive without sacrificing significant predictive power.
   - **Consolidate Similar Rules**: If multiple rules address similar structural features, consider combining them to reduce complexity.

5. **Validate and Test Rules with Known Examples**

   - **Action**: Use a set of molecules with known outcomes to test each rule individually, ensuring that they correctly predict high or low yields.

6. **Improve Code Implementation**

   - **Correct Use of SMARTS vs. SMILES**: Ensure that SMARTS patterns are used for substructure searches, not SMILES strings.
   - **Avoid Overlapping Matches**: Use methods like `mol.GetSubstructMatches(pattern, uniquify=True)` to prevent counting the same substructure multiple times.

7. **Leverage SHAP Analysis Indirectly**

   - **Action**: Use insights from SHAP values to identify which rules contribute most to mispredictions and prioritize them for refinement.

8. **Engage Chemical Expertise**

   - **Action**: Consult with chemists to validate the chemical logic of the rules and to gain insights into factors that may not be immediately apparent from data alone.

9. **Iterative Refinement and Testing**

    Current_Rules:
    After carefully analyzing the provided dataset and considering the current rules, I've identified several areas where the rules can be improved. Some of the existing rules overlap, are too specific, or do not accurately capture the trends observed in the data. Therefore, I've crafted a new set of rules that better describe the relationship between the molecular modifiers' structures and the relative high or low yield of the reaction.

**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are **α-amino dicarboxylic acids** (α-amino acids with two carboxyl groups) lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (Aspartic acid)
  - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (Glutamic acid)

  **Explanation**: The presence of an α-amino group and two carboxyl groups provides multiple coordination sites with the metal center, enhancing catalyst stability and activity, resulting in high yield.

---

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms** in the ring lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)
  - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid

  **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings act as additional coordination sites, enhancing interactions with the metal catalyst and improving catalytic efficiency.

---

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with a para-substituted electron-donating group** (such as amino, hydroxy, or methoxy groups) lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 4-aminobenzoic acid
  - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
  - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups increase electron density on the aromatic ring, enhancing coordination with the metal center and promoting catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 5 to 8 carbons** without additional polar functional groups lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:
  - Octanoic acid

  **Low Yield Counterexamples**:
  - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid (contains hydroxyl group)
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid (contains amino group)
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid (contains amino group)

  **Explanation**: Long-chain aliphatic acids can interact favorably with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst, enhancing reaction efficiency. Additional polar groups may disrupt these interactions or interfere with coordination.

---

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers containing **multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic backbone** (polyhydroxy carboxylic acids) lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:
  - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

  **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous coordination sites, strengthening interactions with the metal center and enhancing catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups** (such as formyl or methyl groups) lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 4-formylbenzoic acid
  - 4-methylbenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density on the aromatic ring, reducing its ability to coordinate with the metal center, thereby decreasing catalytic performance.

---

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers that contain **strong electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups** result in **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
  - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Fluorinated groups are highly electronegative and withdraw electron density, weakening metal-ligand interactions and leading to reduced catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers that have **amide bonds or peptide linkages** result in **low yield** due to reduced availability of lone pairs for coordination.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
  - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Amide formation involves lone pairs on nitrogen and oxygen, reducing their availability for coordination with the metal, thereby weakening catalyst-modifier interactions.

---

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with nonpolar aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms** lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:
  - (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (Phenylalanine)

  **High Yield Counterexample**:
  - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (Tryptophan; contains an indole ring with nitrogen)

  **Explanation**: Nonpolar aromatic side chains without heteroatoms provide few coordination sites. In contrast, heteroatom-containing side chains enhance metal-ligand interactions, leading to higher yield.

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids longer than 6 carbons containing polar functional groups** (such as amino or hydroxyl groups) lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid

  **Explanation**: Polar groups on long aliphatic chains may disrupt hydrophobic interactions or interfere with proper coordination with the metal center, reducing catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with substituents causing steric hindrance** lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (contains bulky fused rings)

  **Explanation**: Steric hindrance from bulky substituents can reduce the accessibility of coordination sites, diminishing catalyst-modifier binding and catalytic efficiency.

---

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers that contain **intramolecular hydrogen bonding** that limits the availability of coordinating groups lead to **low yield**.*

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:
  - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

  **Explanation**: Intramolecular hydrogen bonding can sequester potential coordinating groups, reducing their availability to interact with the metal center, leading to decreased catalytic activity.

---

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers with **mercapto (-SH) groups on short aliphatic chains** lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifiers**:
  - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid (Note: Exception to the trend; see explanation)

  **Explanation**: Thiol groups have strong affinity for metal centers due to the soft nature of sulfur, enhancing coordination and catalytic activity. However, in aromatic systems like 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid, steric or electronic factors might reduce effectiveness, as seen with its low yield.

---

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted large heterocyclic groups** lead to **variable yield** dependent on steric factors.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid (less steric hindrance)

  **Low Yield Example Modifier**:
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (more steric hindrance)

  **Explanation**: The size and position of heterocyclic groups affect sterics and coordination ability. Modifiers with less steric hindrance can coordinate effectively, leading to high yield, while bulky groups reduce yield.

---

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 3 to 5 carbons containing amino groups** lead to **high yield**.*

  **High Yield Example Modifier**:
  - 5-aminopentanoic acid

  **Low Yield Counterexamples**:
  - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid (contains ether linkages)
  - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (longer chain and acetamido group)

  **Explanation**: Short aliphatic chains with amino groups can effectively coordinate with the metal center without significant steric hindrance, enhancing catalytic activity.

---

**End of Rules**

These rules aim to cover a broad range of the dataset while providing clear guidance on predicting the yield based on structural features of the modifiers. They balance simplicity and complexity, ensuring both higher coverage and specificity where necessary. The explanations tie the observed trends to underlying physicochemical properties, such as electron density, coordination ability, steric effects, and intramolecular interactions.

I believe these updated rules more accurately reflect the relationship between the molecular modifiers and the reaction yield, providing valuable insights for optimizing and controlling the reaction conditions.---------------------------------------------------------------
