**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and specific, focusing on modifiers containing an **alpha-amino acid backbone with two carboxylic acid groups**. This provides good property insight, as such structures may chelate metal ions, enhancing the catalyst's performance. The rule combines multiple functional groups, adding complexity. It is supported by at least two data points—L-glutamic acid and L-aspartic acid—thus satisfying the coverage criterion and achieving a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clearly defined, targeting **aromatic carboxylic acids with a strong electron-withdrawing group at the para position**. The property insight is solid, as electron-withdrawing groups can influence electron density and coordination behavior with metal centers. The rule considers both the aromatic system and the nature of substituents, enhancing complexity. It is supported by two data points—4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid and 4-nitrobenzoic acid—meeting the coverage requirement and maintaining a good balance.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear, focusing on **aromatic carboxylic acids with an amino group at the para position**. However, it is supported by only one data point—4-aminobenzoic acid—which does not fulfill the coverage criterion of at least two data points. Additionally, amino groups are electron-donating, which may conflict with Rule 13 that suggests electron-donating groups at the para position predict low yield. This discrepancy indicates that the property insight may need further refinement, and the rule's reliability is limited due to insufficient data support.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clearly articulated, describing **aliphatic carboxylic acids with an omega-amino group and a chain length of 5 carbons or fewer**. It provides property insight into how shorter-chain omega-amino acids may interact favorably with the catalyst. The rule combines chain length and functional groups, adding complexity. However, it is supported by only one data point—5-aminopentanoic acid—failing to meet the coverage criterion and therefore lacking robust support.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear, focusing on modifiers containing **perfluoroalkyl chains**. The property insight is logical, as perfluoroalkyl groups are highly electron-withdrawing and can affect solubility and binding interactions negatively. The rule is specific but only supported by a single data point—2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid—which does not satisfy the coverage criterion, limiting its reliability.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear and offers property insight by highlighting how **aromatic carboxylic acids with a formyl group at the para position** may lead to low yields, possibly due to the aldehyde group's reactivity. The rule is complex, considering both the aromatic ring and the specific substituent. It is supported by two data points—4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid—meeting the coverage requirement and providing a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear, addressing **aliphatic carboxylic acids with an omega-amino group and a chain length greater than 5 carbons**. The property insight suggests that longer chains may hinder effective interaction with the catalyst. The rule combines chain length considerations with functional group placement, increasing complexity. It is supported by two data points—7-aminoheptanoic acid and 8-aminooctanoic acid—fulfilling the coverage criterion and maintaining a good balance.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is well-defined, focusing on modifiers containing an **aromatic ring fused with a heterocycle**. The property insight is strong, as such structures may facilitate improved π-π interactions or coordination with the catalyst. The rule has significant complexity due to the fused ring system and is supported by at least three data points—L-tryptophan, 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, and 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid—exceeding the coverage criterion and exemplifying a balanced approach.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear, identifying **aromatic carboxylic acids with a sulfanyl (thiol) group at the para position** as predictors of low yield. The property insight is reasonable, considering that thiol groups can have strong binding affinities that might inhibit catalyst activity. However, it is supported by only one data point—4-sulfanylbenzoic acid—which does not meet the coverage criterion, thus limiting its conclusiveness.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clearly stated, focusing on **ether-linked carboxylic acids with flexible ether chains** predicting low yield. The property insight suggests that flexibility and ether linkages may interfere with proper catalyst interaction. The rule is complex, considering both the ether chain and carboxylic acid functionality. It is supported by two data points—2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid and 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid—satisfying the coverage criterion and maintaining balance.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear and offers property insight into how **carboxylic acids with acylated amino groups (amides)** may lead to low yields, potentially due to reduced availability of coordination sites. The rule is complex, involving amide formation in addition to the carboxylic acid group. It is supported by two data points—2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid and (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid—meeting the coverage criterion and achieving a good balance.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is specific and clear, indicating that **modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbons)** predict low yield. The property insight may relate to steric hindrance or solubility issues. However, the rule is only supported by one data point—7-hydroxyheptanoic acid—falling short of the coverage requirement and thus limiting its reliability.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear and provides property insight into how **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-donating groups at the para position** can lead to low yields, possibly due to unfavorable electronic interactions with the catalyst. The rule combines functional group effects with positional specificity, enhancing complexity. It is supported by two data points—4-methylbenzoic acid and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid—fulfilling the coverage criterion and maintaining balance.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 is well-defined, targeting **modifiers with a pyrazole or pyridine ring directly attached to the carboxylic acid**. The property insight is strong, as these heteroaromatic groups may enhance coordination with metal centers. The rule is complex because it involves specific heteroaromatic systems. It is supported by two data points—1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid and pyridine-3-carboxylic acid—meeting the coverage requirement and achieving a good balance.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 is clear, focusing on **sugar acids (polyhydroxylated carboxylic acids)** predicting high yield. The property insight suggests that multiple hydroxyl groups may enhance solubility or interaction with the catalyst. However, it is only supported by one data point—D-gluconic acid—insufficient to meet the coverage criterion, thereby limiting the rule's conclusiveness.

**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**:
Rule 1 is clear and allows for unambiguous predictions when a modifier matches the description of alpha-amino acids with free (unprotected) amino groups. The physical-chemical insight is strong, as free amino groups in alpha-amino acids may facilitate interactions in the reaction mechanism leading to high yield. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures (amino acid backbone and free amino group), adding complexity. Coverage is good, with multiple data points supporting the rule, such as L-glutamic acid, L-aspartic acid, L-tryptophan, and 5-aminopentanoic acid. Therefore, this rule scores highly on all criteria.

- **Comment 2**:
Rule 2 is clear in specifying aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position predicting high yield. The property insight is reasonable, as electron-withdrawing groups can activate the aromatic ring towards certain reactions. Complexity is moderate, involving both the aromatic ring and substituent effects. Coverage meets the criterion with examples like 4-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, though additional data points could strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 3**:
Rule 3 clearly identifies aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position predicting low yield. The property insight is sound, as electron-donating groups can deactivate the aromatic ring. Complexity is moderate, and coverage is adequate with examples such as 4-methylbenzoic acid and 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid. This rule scores well on all criteria.

- **Comment 4**:
Rule 4 specifies aromatic carboxylic acids with a free amino group at the para position predicting high yield. The rule is clear and provides adequate physical-chemical insight. Complexity is moderate due to positional specificity. Coverage is limited to one main example (4-aminobenzoic acid), so additional supporting data would enhance the rule's robustness.

- **Comment 5**:
Rule 5 states that modifiers containing heteroaromatic rings directly attached to the carboxylic acid predict high yield. The rule is clear, and the property insight is strong, considering the reactivity of heteroaromatic systems. Complexity is higher due to the inclusion of heterocycles. Coverage is adequate with examples like pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid, and 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid.

- **Comment 6**:
Rule 6 deals with aliphatic carboxylic acids with an omega-amino group, where yield depends on chain length. The rule is clear and offers good property insight by linking chain length to reactivity. Complexity is high, considering both functional group position and chain length. Coverage is strong, with data points like 5-aminopentanoic acid (high yield) and 7-aminoheptanoic acid (low yield), meeting the criteria well.

- **Comment 7**:
Rule 7 indicates that straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups predict high yield. The rule is clear but lacks complexity. The property insight is acceptable, suggesting that fewer functional groups may lead to fewer side reactions. Coverage is minimal with only one example (octanoic acid). More data points are needed to strengthen this rule.

- **Comment 8**:
Rule 8 states that modifiers with acylated amino groups or amide functionalities predict low yield. The rule is clear, and the property insight is reasonable, as acylation or amide formation can reduce the availability of active sites. Complexity is moderate, involving specific functional groups. Coverage is sufficient with examples like (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid and 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid.

- **Comment 9**:
Rule 9 specifies that modifiers containing flexible ether chains attached to the carboxylic acid predict low yield.

Complexity is moderate, and coverage meets the minimum with examples such as 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid and 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid.

- **Comment 10**:
Rule 10 states that modifiers with perfluoroalkyl chains predict low yield. The rule is clear and offers reasonable property insight due to the strong electron-withdrawing nature of perfluoroalkyl groups. Complexity is low to moderate. However, coverage is limited to a single example (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), so more data points are necessary to fully support this rule.

- **Comment 11**:
Rule 11 indicates that polyhydroxy aliphatic carboxylic acids (sugar acids) predict high yield. The rule is clear, and the property insight is good, as multiple hydroxyl groups may enhance solubility or catalyst interactions. Complexity is moderate due to the presence of multiple functional groups. Coverage is limited to one example (D-gluconic acid), so additional data would strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 12**:
Rule 12 states that aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) groups attached predict low yield. The rule is clear with reasonable property insight, considering the reactivity of aldehyde groups. Complexity is moderate. Coverage includes two examples (4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid), meeting the minimum requirement.

- **Comment 13**:
Rule 13 describes modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with an aromatic ring at the gamma or delta position, especially with electron-donating groups, predicting high yield. The rule is clear but complex. The property insight is acceptable, linking structural positioning to reactivity. Complexity is high, and coverage is good with examples like 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid and 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.

- **Comment 14**:
Rule 14 states that aliphatic carboxylic acids with an aromatic ring at the beta position with electron-donating groups predict low yield. The rule is clear, and the property insight is acceptable. Complexity is moderate. However, coverage is limited to one example (3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid), so additional data points are needed.

- **Comment 15**:
Rule 15 indicates that modifiers with aromatic rings fused to heterocycles or containing multiple heteroatoms predict high yield. The rule is clear, though complex. The property insight is acceptable, considering the influence of fused rings and heteroatoms on reactivity. Complexity is high, and coverage meets the minimum with examples like L-tryptophan and 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid, but more data points would improve the rule.

It is supported by multiple data points (e.g., 5-aminopentanoic acid for high yield; 7-aminoheptanoic acid and 8-aminooctanoic acid for low yield), indicating adequate coverage. The rule effectively balances specificity and applicability.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear, predicting low yield for modifiers containing amide groups or acylated amino groups. The property insight is logical, explaining how resonance stabilization in amide groups reduces their ability to donate electrons and coordinate with metal centers. The rule's complexity is appropriate, focusing on specific functional groups that affect coordination. It is well-supported by multiple data points (e.g., (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid, 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid), providing good coverage. The rule maintains a good balance between specificity and applicability.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear, focusing on heteroaromatic carboxylic acids where the carboxyl group is directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring, predicting high yield. The property insight is plausible, attributing enhanced catalyst activity to additional coordination from heteroatoms in the ring. The rule has appropriate complexity, considering both the aromatic system and functional group attachment. It is supported by multiple data points (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid), demonstrating good coverage. The rule balances specificity with broad applicability.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear, indicating that aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) groups attached to the ring predict low yield. The property insight is sound, suggesting that aldehyde groups can engage in side reactions or inhibit catalyst function. The rule has acceptable complexity, considering specific functional group combinations. Supported by two data points (4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid), the rule meets the coverage criterion. It maintains a good balance between specificity and applicability.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear, predicting low yield for carboxylic acids with perfluoroalkyl or trifluoroacetyl groups. The property insight is reasonable, as highly electron-withdrawing groups can diminish the ability of the carboxylate to coordinate with the metal center. The rule's complexity is appropriate, focusing on impactful electron-withdrawing substituents. It is supported by two data points (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid and 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid), satisfying the coverage requirement. The rule achieves a balance between specificity and coverage.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear, predicting low yield for aliphatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl, ether, or additional polar functional groups on the carbon chain. The property insight is logical, as these polar groups may interfere with metal coordination or alter catalyst solubility. The rule is appropriately complex, considering both the presence and position of additional functional groups. It is supported by multiple data points (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid), indicating good coverage. The rule balances specificity and applicability effectively.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is detailed and clear, predicting high yield for aliphatic carboxylic acids substituted with an aromatic ring at the gamma (γ) or delta (δ) position, especially if the aromatic ring contains electron-donating groups. The property insight is plausible, citing enhanced interactions through π-π stacking or additional coordination. The rule has appropriate complexity, combining chain substitution patterns with functional groups. Supported by multiple data points (e.g., 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid, 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), the rule demonstrates good coverage. It balances specificity and general applicability effectively.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear, predicting low yield for aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol (sulfhydryl) groups attached to the ring. The property insight is acceptable, as aryl thiols can form strong bonds with metal centers, leading to catalyst deactivation. However, the rule is based on a single data point (4-sulfanylbenzoic acid), which limits its coverage and generalizability. Additional data points are needed to confirm this rule's validity.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 is clear, predicting low yield for aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with a keto group adjacent to one of the carboxyl groups. The property insight is logical, as keto groups may form intramolecular interactions that reduce coordination sites for the metal center. However, the rule is supported by only one data point (4-oxoheptanedioic acid), limiting its coverage and reducing confidence in its general applicability. More data points are required to bolster the rule.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 predicts low yield for modifiers with bulky substituents or steric hindrance near the coordinating groups. While the rationale is plausible, the examples provided (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid and 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid) actually show high yield in the dataset, contradicting the rule's prediction. This inconsistency suggests that Rule 15 may be invalid or requires reevaluation with additional data to determine its accuracy.

  - *Rationale*: The free amino group can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity through chelation. Proximity of the amino group to the carboxyl group facilitates strong bidentate binding to the metal.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (L-Glutamic acid)
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (L-Aspartic acid)
    - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (L-Tryptophan)
    - 5-aminopentanoic acid
    - 4-aminobenzoic acid

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halogens) at the para position relative to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing its deprotonation and ability to coordinate with metal centers. This strengthens the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
    - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxy) at the para position relative to the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, weakening its ability to coordinate with metal centers. This reduces the effectiveness of the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups or with small polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, thiol) near the carboxyl group (within three carbons)** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: These simple structures allow effective coordination with metal centers without significant steric hindrance. Small polar groups can enhance solubility and interaction with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - Octanoic acid
    - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
    - 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) located at positions distant from the carboxyl group (beyond three carbons) and with a carbon chain length greater than five** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Functional groups far from the carboxyl group may introduce steric hindrance and reduce the ability of the carboxylate to coordinate effectively with the metal center, diminishing catalyst activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups directly attached to the ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can engage in side reactions or coordinate with the metal center in undesired ways, inhibiting catalyst performance.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids containing amide groups or N-acylated amino groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide groups are less effective at coordinating with metal centers due to resonance stabilization. They may also introduce steric hindrance, reducing catalyst efficiency.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids where the carboxyl group is directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Heteroatoms in the aromatic ring (e.g., nitrogen in pyridine) can participate in additional coordination with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity through synergistic interactions.
  - *Examples*:
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with perfluoroalkyl groups or trifluoroacetyl groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Highly electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups excessively stabilize the carboxylate anion, reducing its ability to coordinate with metal centers and potentially interfering with catalyst function.
  - *Examples*:
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
    - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages or flexible chains containing oxygen atoms** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether linkages increase conformational flexibility and may disrupt the optimal positioning of the carboxyl group for metal coordination. Additionally, oxygen atoms in the chain can interfere with metal interactions.
  - *Examples*:
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids substituted with an aromatic ring at the γ (gamma) or δ (delta) position** predict the yield based on the nature of the aromatic ring:
  - **High Yield** when the aromatic ring is **electron-deficient** (e.g., contains heteroatoms or electron-withdrawing groups).
    - *Rationale*: Electron-deficient aromatic rings can enhance metal coordination through π-π interactions or additional sites for coordination.
    - *Examples*:
      - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
    - *Note*: In the case of 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, despite the hydroxy group being electron-donating, the longer aliphatic chain may reduce its impact, resulting in a high yield.
  - **Low Yield** when the aromatic ring is **electron-rich** (e.g., contains strong electron-donating groups like methoxy or hydroxy) and is directly connected or in close proximity to the carboxyl group.
    - *Rationale*: Electron-rich aromatic rings may compete with the carboxyl group for metal coordination or engage in side reactions.
    - *Example*:
      - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with a ketone functional group between the carboxyl groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The additional carboxyl and ketone groups can create competing coordination sites, leading to complexation that may hinder the catalyst's activity.
  - *Example*:
    - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups can enhance solubility and provide additional coordination sites, strengthening the interaction with the metal center.
  - *Example*:
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with a free (unprotected) primary amino group within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The presence of a free amino group near the carboxyl group allows for chelation with metal centers in the catalyst, enhancing coordination and stability. The proximity facilitates bidentate binding, improving catalytic activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (L-Glutamic acid)
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (L-Aspartic acid)
    - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (L-Tryptophan)
    - 5-aminopentanoic acid
    - 4-aminobenzoic acid
  - *Counterexamples*:
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (**Low Yield**; amino group is N-acetylated, reducing coordination ability)
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid (**Low Yield**; amino group is distant from the carboxyl group, reducing effective coordination)

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) at the para position relative to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing deprotonation and coordination with metal centers. This strengthens the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst, improving activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
    - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - *Counterexamples*:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid (**Low Yield**; despite being electron-withdrawing, the aldehyde group can engage in side reactions or inhibit coordination)
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (**Low Yield**; the pyridyl group may not have the same electron-withdrawing effect and can interfere with coordination)

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, hydroxyl, methoxy) at the para position relative to the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening its ability to deprotonate and coordinate with metal centers. This reduces the interaction with the catalyst, lowering activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
  - *Counterexamples*:
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid (**High Yield**; the increased chain length may offset the electron-donating effect by distancing the hydroxy group from the carboxyl coordination site)

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with no additional functional groups or with small polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, thiol) within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Simple aliphatic acids can coordinate effectively with metal centers without significant steric hindrance. Small polar groups near the carboxyl group can enhance solubility and coordination through additional hydrogen bonding or dipole interactions.
  - *Examples*:
    - Octanoic acid
    - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
    - 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) located beyond three carbons from the carboxyl group and with a carbon chain length greater than five** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Functional groups distant from the carboxyl group do not contribute effectively to coordination and may introduce steric hindrance or conformational flexibility that reduces effective interaction with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids containing amide groups or N-acylated amino groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide groups are less nucleophilic and less effective at coordinating with metal centers due to resonance stabilization. N-acylation of amino groups reduces their ability to participate in coordination, diminishing the modifier's effectiveness.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids where the carboxyl group is directly attached to a nitrogen-containing aromatic ring** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen can coordinate with metal centers through the nitrogen lone pair, providing additional binding interactions that enhance catalyst activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Counterexamples*:
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (**Low Yield**; the carboxyl group is not directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring, reducing the potential for effective coordination)

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups directly attached to the ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups are reactive and can engage in side reactions or inhibit coordination by interacting with metal centers in undesired ways, negatively impacting catalyst performance.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with fluorinated alkyl chains (perfluoroalkyl groups) or trifluoroacetyl substituents** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Highly electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups significantly stabilize the carboxylate anion, decreasing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. They may also introduce steric bulk and hydrophobicity that hinder effective interaction with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
    - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages or flexible chains containing multiple oxygen atoms** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether linkages increase chain flexibility and may disrupt the optimal positioning of the carboxyl group for coordination. The presence of multiple oxygen atoms can lead to unfavorable conformations or compete with the carboxyl group for metal interaction.
  - *Examples*:
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids substituted with an aromatic ring connected via an aliphatic linker of four or more carbons** predict a **high yield** if the aromatic ring is electron-deficient.
  - *Rationale*: A longer aliphatic linker distances the aromatic ring from the carboxyl group, reducing steric hindrance and electronic interference. Electron-deficient aromatic rings can enhance metal coordination through π-acceptor interactions.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid (despite the hydroxy group, the increased distance reduces its electron-donating effect)

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with a ketone or additional carboxyl groups in the chain** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Additional carbonyl groups introduce competing coordination sites and can form internal chelates or complexes that interfere with the modifier's ability to interact effectively with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (**Exception**; despite being a dicarboxylic acid, the presence of a free amino group near the carboxyl groups enhances coordination, resulting in a **high yield**)

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group can participate in hydrogen bonding and additional coordination with metal centers, strengthening the modifier-catalyst interaction and improving solubility.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-rich groups (e.g., hydroxy, methoxy) directly attached to the ring in close proximity to the carboxyl group (ortho or meta positions)** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-rich substituents can interfere with metal coordination by increasing electron density on the ring, making the carboxyl group less acidic and less effective at binding. They may also engage in intramolecular hydrogen bonding, reducing availability for coordination.
  - *Examples*:
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
    - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid (**Exception**; despite the electron-rich ring, this modifier predicts a **high yield**, possibly due to the benzofuran structure facilitating coordination)

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **small heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing additional electronegative atoms (e.g., oxygen) in the ring** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The presence of electronegative atoms in the ring can facilitate additional coordination sites and enhance interaction with the metal center through lone pair donation.
  - *Examples*:
    - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with a free (unprotected) primary amino group located within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The presence of a free amino group near the carboxyl group allows for effective coordination with metal centers in the catalyst, enhancing stability and catalytic activity. The proximity facilitates chelation, improving interaction with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (L-Aspartic acid)
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (L-Glutamic acid)
    - 5-aminopentanoic acid
    - 4-aminobenzoic acid
    - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (L-Tryptophan)
  - *Counterexamples*:
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (**Low Yield**; amino group is N-acetylated, reducing coordination ability)
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid (**Low Yield**; amino group is distant from the carboxyl group)

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) at the para position relative to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing deprotonation and coordination with metal centers. This strengthens the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst, improving activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
    - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - *Counterexample*:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid (**Low Yield**; the aldehyde group is reactive and may interfere with coordination)

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, sulfanyl) at the para position relative to the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening its ability to deprotonate and coordinate with metal centers. This reduces interaction with the catalyst, lowering activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Counterexample*:
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid (**High Yield**; the hydroxyl group is distanced by a longer aliphatic chain, mitigating its electron-donating effect)

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 5 to 8 carbons and no additional functional groups** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Long-chain aliphatic acids can coordinate effectively with metal centers without significant steric hindrance. Their hydrophobic nature may also favor interactions within the reaction medium.
  - *Example*:
    - Octanoic acid

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) located beyond three carbons from the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Functional groups distant from the carboxyl group do not contribute effectively to coordination and may introduce steric hindrance or conformational flexibility that reduces effective interaction with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids where the carboxyl group is directly attached to a nitrogen-containing aromatic ring** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic rings can coordinate with metal centers through the nitrogen lone pair, providing additional binding interactions that enhance catalytic activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with perfluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoroacetyl substituents** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Highly electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups significantly stabilize the carboxylate anion, decreasing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. They may also introduce steric bulk and hydrophobicity that hinder effective interaction with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
    - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with flexible ether linkages in the chain** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether linkages increase chain flexibility and may disrupt the optimal positioning of the carboxyl group for coordination. The presence of multiple oxygen atoms can lead to unfavorable conformations or compete with the carboxyl group for metal interaction.
  - *Examples*:
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups directly attached to the ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups are reactive and can engage in side reactions or inhibit coordination by interacting with metal centers in undesired ways, negatively impacting catalyst performance.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with a chain length of four carbons or more, substituted with an aromatic ring at the terminal position, predict a high yield**, regardless of substituents on the aromatic ring.
  - *Rationale*: A longer aliphatic linker distances the aromatic ring from the carboxyl group, reducing steric hindrance and electronic interference. This allows the carboxyl group to coordinate effectively with the metal center.
  - *Examples*:
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Counterexample*:
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (**Low Yield**; shorter chain length increases electronic effects and steric hindrance)

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with a ketone group in the chain** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Additional carbonyl groups introduce competing coordination sites and can form internal chelates or complexes that interfere with the modifier's ability to interact effectively with the catalyst.
  - *Example*:
    - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group can participate in hydrogen bonding and additional coordination with metal centers, strengthening the modifier-catalyst interaction and improving solubility.
  - *Example*:
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **N-acetylated amino acids or contain amide bonds involving the amino group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: N-acetylation or amide formation reduces the availability of the amino group for coordination with metal centers, diminishing the modifier's effectiveness.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing additional oxygen atoms within the ring structure** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The presence of additional heteroatoms like oxygen can facilitate coordination through lone pair interactions, enhancing the binding to metal centers.
  - *Examples*:
    - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at positions other than the para position (e.g., ortho or meta) may have variable effects on yield and require further analysis**.
  - *Rationale*: The influence of electron-donating groups on coordination ability can depend on their position relative to the carboxyl group, affecting acidity and steric factors in complex ways.
  - *Example*:
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (**Low Yield**; complex electronic effects due to substituent positions)

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows for straightforward prediction of high yield based on the presence of a free primary amino group within three carbons of a carboxyl group. The physical-chemical rationale is sound, as the proximity facilitates effective coordination with metal centers. The rule considers a combination of sub-structures, specifically the spatial relationship between amino and carboxyl groups. It is well-supported by multiple data points, enhancing its reliability.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear and specifies that modifiers are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position. The physical-chemical insight is adequate, as electron-withdrawing groups increase acidity and coordination ability. This rule considers the combination of sub-structures—both the aromatic ring and the para substituent—adding appropriate complexity. It is supported by at least two data points, making it reliable, and maintains a good balance between specificity and coverage.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 clearly states that aromatic carboxylic acids bearing electron-donating groups at the para position result in low yield, with the exception of cases where the donating group is distanced by a longer chain. The rule provides sound physical-chemical insight, linking electron-donating effects to decreased acidity and coordination ability. It appropriately combines structural elements, and is supported by multiple data points including a counterexample that strengthens the rule's validity. The balance between specificity and generality is well-maintained.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear and straightforward, predicting high yield for aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 5–8 carbons and no additional functional groups. While the physical-chemical rationale is plausible, the rule is only supported by a single data point (octanoic acid), which weakens its reliability. According to the coverage criterion, the rule lacks sufficient data to be considered robust. Expanding the dataset or identifying additional supporting examples would strengthen this rule.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 clearly defines modifiers with polar functional groups beyond three carbons from the carboxyl group predicting low yield. The physical-chemical insight is adequate, suggesting that distant functional groups do not enhance coordination and may introduce unfavorable effects. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures and is supported by multiple data points, satisfying the coverage criterion. The rule effectively balances complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clearly defined, specifying heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to nitrogen-containing rings predicting high yield. The rationale is sound, emphasizing the additional coordination via nitrogen lone pairs. This rule combines specific substructures and is well-supported by multiple data points, satisfying both the complexity and coverage criteria.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 clearly identifies that perfluorinated carboxylic acids or those with trifluoroacetyl groups predict low yield. The rationale is appropriate, as the electron-withdrawing effects could reduce coordination ability. The rule accounts for specific substructures, fulfilling the complexity criterion, and is supported by at least two data points, satisfying coverage.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 specifies that aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages predict low yield. The rationale is plausible, citing increased flexibility and potential competition for metal coordination. The rule includes combinations of substructures and is supported by multiple data points, fulfilling the complexity and coverage criteria while maintaining a good balance.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clearly defined, stating that aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups on the ring predict low yield. The rationale is sound, as aldehyde groups can interfere with coordination. The rule considers specific substructures and is well-supported by data points, fulfilling both the complexity and coverage criteria.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clearly articulated, predicting high yield for aliphatic carboxylic acids with long chains bearing terminal aromatic rings, regardless of ring substituents. The rationale is plausible, emphasizing the role of chain length in mitigating steric and electronic effects. The rule combines substructures and is supported by data, including a counterexample that reinforces its specificity. It achieves a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clearly defined, predicting low yield for aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with ketone groups. The rationale is acceptable, highlighting competing coordination sites. However, the rule is only supported by a single data point, which limits its robustness according to the coverage criterion. Additional data points would enhance its validity.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is clearly stated and provides a rationale for polyhydroxy carboxylic acids predicting high yield. However, it is only supported by a single data point, which falls short of the coverage criterion. To enhance the rule's reliability, additional examples are necessary.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 clearly predicts low yield for N-acetylated amino acids or those with amide bonds involving the amino group. The rationale is sound, explaining diminished coordination ability. The rule is supported by multiple data points, satisfying both the complexity and coverage criteria.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 is clear, indicating that heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with additional oxygen atoms in the ring predict high yield. The rationale is plausible, focusing on enhanced coordination via oxygen lone pairs. The rule considers specific substructures and is supported by at least two data points, fulfilling both complexity and coverage criteria.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 lacks clarity in prediction, stating that modifiers may have variable effects requiring further analysis. While the rationale acknowledges complex electronic effects based on substituent positions, the rule does not provide a clear guideline for prediction. It is only supported by a single data point, failing to meet the coverage criterion. The rule's complexity is high relative to its practical utility, suggesting it needs refinement or additional data to be effective.

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with a free (unprotected) primary amino group within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The proximity of the amino group to the carboxyl group facilitates strong coordination with metal centers in the catalyst, enhancing stability and catalytic activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (L-Aspartic acid)
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (L-Glutamic acid)
    - 5-aminopentanoic acid
    - 4-aminobenzoic acid
  - *Counterexamples*:
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid (**Low Yield**; amino group is distant from the carboxyl group)
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (**Low Yield**; amino group is N-acetylated, reducing coordination ability)

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) at the para position relative to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**, while those with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy, sulfhydryl) at the same position predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxyl group, enhancing interaction with the catalyst. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and coordination ability, reducing effectiveness.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
    - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to a nitrogen-containing aromatic ring** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in the aromatic ring can coordinate with metal centers, providing additional binding interactions that enhance catalytic activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Counterexample*:
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (**Low Yield**; carboxyl group is not directly attached to the nitrogen-containing ring)

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 5 to 8 carbons and no additional functional groups** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Such modifiers can coordinate effectively with metal centers without steric hindrance from additional functional groups. Their hydrophobic nature may also favor interactions within the reaction medium.
  - *Example*:
    - Octanoic acid
  - *Counterexamples*:
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid (**Low Yield**; presence of hydroxyl group introduces polarity and potential hydrogen bonding)
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid (**Low Yield**; amino group distant from the carboxyl group)

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino, sulfhydryl) located within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**, while those with such groups located further away predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Polar functional groups near the carboxyl group enhance coordination ability through additional interaction sites. Distant groups have reduced impact and may introduce steric hindrance.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with flexible ether linkages in the carbon chain** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether linkages increase chain flexibility and introduce polar oxygen atoms that can disrupt the positioning of the carboxyl group for optimal coordination with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with perfluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoroacetyl substituents** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Strongly electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups reduce the nucleophilicity of the carboxylate anion, decreasing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. They may also increase steric bulk and hydrophobicity, hindering effective interaction with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
    - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups directly attached to the ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups are reactive and can engage in side reactions or interfere with metal coordination, negatively impacting catalyst performance.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **N-acetylated amino acids or contain amide bonds involving the amino group near the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: N-acetylation or amide formation reduces the availability of the amino group for coordination with metal centers, diminishing the modifier's effectiveness.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with an aromatic ring attached via a chain of four carbons or more** predict a **high yield**, regardless of substituents on the aromatic ring.
  - *Rationale*: A longer aliphatic linker distances the aromatic ring from the carboxyl group, reducing steric hindrance and electronic interference, allowing effective coordination with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Counterexample*:
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (**Low Yield**; shorter chain increases electronic effects and steric hindrance)

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with additional carbonyl groups in the chain** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Additional carbonyl groups introduce competing coordination sites and can form internal chelates, interfering with the modifier's ability to interact effectively with the catalyst.
  - *Example*:
    - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups can enhance coordination through hydrogen bonding and additional interactions with metal centers, strengthening the modifier–catalyst interaction.
  - *Example*:
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

Overall, Rule 1 is well-formulated with a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear in specifying that aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position predict high yield, while those with electron-donating groups predict low yield. The property insight logically connects the electronic effects of substituents to the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxyl group. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures (aromatic ring, carboxylic acid, para substituents), meeting the complexity criterion. Coverage includes multiple examples for both high and low yield, supporting the rule's validity. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 provides clear guidance by specifying that heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to a nitrogen-containing aromatic ring predict high yield. The property insight is sound, highlighting the role of nitrogen atoms in coordinating with metal centers. The rule combines multiple structural features, satisfying the complexity criterion. Coverage includes two high yield examples and one low yield counterexample, which strengthens the rule's reliability. The balance between complexity and coverage is acceptable.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear in its description of aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 5 to 8 carbons and no additional functional groups predicting high yield. The property insight is plausible, explaining minimal steric hindrance and favorable hydrophobic interactions within the reaction medium. However, the rule lacks sufficient coverage, as it is supported by only one high yield example. This weakens confidence in the rule's general applicability. While the rule meets the complexity criterion by considering the absence of additional functional groups, the limited coverage suggests that more supporting data are needed to validate this rule.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 specifies that aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar functional groups within three carbons of the carboxyl group predict high yield, while those with such groups further away predict low yield. The property insight is logical, as proximal polar groups can enhance coordination ability. Despite meeting the complexity criterion by considering combinations of functional groups and their positions, the rule has limited coverage with only one high yield example. This lack of sufficient supporting data reduces the reliability of the rule, indicating that additional examples are necessary for validation.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 clearly states that aliphatic carboxylic acids with flexible ether linkages in the carbon chain predict low yield. The property insight is reasonable, as ether linkages may disrupt the optimal positioning of the carboxyl group for effective coordination. The rule focuses on specific structural features, satisfying the complexity criterion. It is supported by two low yield examples, meeting the minimum coverage requirement. The balance between specificity and coverage is appropriate, making the rule reliable within its defined scope.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear in identifying that modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoroacetyl substituents predict low yield.

The rule considers specific functional groups, satisfying the complexity criterion. Supported by two low yield examples, the rule meets the coverage requirement. The balance between specificity and coverage is acceptable, lending confidence to the rule's applicability.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 clearly indicates that aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups directly attached to the ring predict low yield. The property insight is logical, as reactive aldehyde groups can engage in side reactions or interfere with metal coordination. The rule involves combinations of sub-structures, meeting the complexity criterion. With two low yield examples supporting the rule, it satisfies the coverage requirement. The balance between complexity and coverage is well maintained, making the rule reliable.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 clearly states that N-acetylated amino acids or modifiers containing amide bonds involving the amino group near the carboxyl group predict low yield. The property insight is sound, as N-acetylation or amide formation reduces the availability of the amino group for coordination with metal centers. The rule considers specific structural modifications, satisfying the complexity criterion. It is supported by three low yield examples, providing adequate coverage. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate, enhancing the rule's validity.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 provides clear guidance that aliphatic carboxylic acids with an aromatic ring attached via a chain of four carbons or more predict high yield, regardless of substituents on the aromatic ring. The property insight is plausible, suggesting that a longer aliphatic linker reduces steric hindrance and electronic interference, allowing effective coordination. The rule involves combinations of structural features, satisfying the complexity criterion. Supported by two high yield examples and one low yield counterexample, the rule meets the coverage requirement. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate, reinforcing the rule's reliability.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 states that aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with additional carbonyl groups in the chain predict low yield. The property insight is reasonable, as additional carbonyl groups may introduce competing coordination sites or form internal chelates, interfering with the modifier's effectiveness. However, the rule is supported by only one low yield example, which does not meet the minimum coverage criterion. While the rule satisfies the complexity criterion by considering combinations of functional groups, the limited coverage reduces confidence in the rule, indicating a need for additional supporting data.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 specifies that polyhydroxy carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group predict high yield. The property insight is sound, as multiple hydroxyl groups can enhance coordination through hydrogen bonding and additional interactions with metal centers. Despite meeting the complexity criterion, the rule is supported by only one high yield example, failing to meet the minimum coverage requirement. This limitation suggests that more data are needed to validate the rule and increase its reliability.

- **Comment 1**:

  Rule 1 is clear and precisely defines the structural criteria for predicting high yield: modifiers that are carboxylic acids containing a free amino group within three carbons of the carboxyl group. This allows for unambiguous classification of modifiers. The rationale provides strong physico-chemical insight by explaining that the proximity of the amino group enhances metal coordination through chelation, improving catalyst performance. The rule considers combinations of functional groups and their spatial arrangement, meeting the complexity criterion. Multiple data points, including high-yield examples and low-yield counterexamples, support the rule, satisfying the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 2**:

  Rule 2 clearly specifies that aromatic carboxylic acids with functional groups capable of metal coordination at the ortho or para positions predict high yield. The structural description allows for straightforward application. The rationale offers adequate physico-chemical insight by highlighting how the positioning of functional groups enhances catalyst interaction and performance. The rule involves a combination of sub-structures (aromatic ring, carboxyl group, coordinating functional groups at specific positions), demonstrating appropriate complexity. There are sufficient data points supporting the rule, fulfilling the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 3**:

  Rule 3 is clear in stating that aliphatic carboxylic acids with long, unbranched carbon chains (six or more carbons) and no additional functional groups predict high yield. The structural criteria are easy to identify in modifiers. The rationale provides insight into how long hydrocarbon chains can enhance hydrophobic interactions, facilitating better catalyst engagement. While the rule is simpler, it appropriately considers the absence of interfering functional groups along with chain length, meeting the complexity criterion at an acceptable level. The rule is supported by examples such as octanoic acid, satisfying the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 4**:

  Rule 4 clearly defines that aliphatic carboxylic acids containing functional groups distant from the carboxyl group (more than three carbons away) predict low yield. This allows for easy classification based on the position of functional groups. The rationale gives physico-chemical insight by explaining that distant functional groups are less effective in metal coordination and may introduce unwanted interactions. The rule combines considerations of functional group presence and spatial arrangement, meeting the complexity criterion. There are multiple data points supporting this rule, including low-yield examples like 7-aminoheptanoic acid, fulfilling the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 5**:

  Rule 5 is clear in specifying that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups incapable of metal coordination at the ortho or para positions predict low yield. The structural description is precise, aiding in unambiguous classification. The rationale provides insight into how electron-donating groups decrease carboxyl group acidity, reducing metal coordination ability. The rule considers both the electronic nature and positioning of substituents, demonstrating appropriate complexity. Sufficient data points, including low-yield examples like 4-methylbenzoic acid, support the rule, satisfying the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 6**:

  Rule 6 clearly states that aromatic carboxylic acids with multiple electron-withdrawing groups capable of metal coordination predict high yield. This precise structural description facilitates easy application. The rationale offers strong physico-chemical insight by explaining that electron-withdrawing groups increase acidity and coordination ability of the carboxylate. The rule involves complex structural considerations, including multiple functional groups and their coordination capabilities, meeting the complexity criterion. There are high-yield examples like 4-nitrobenzoic acid supporting the rule, fulfilling the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 7**:

  Rule 7 specifies that polyhydroxy carboxylic acids or modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group predict high yield. The structural criteria are clear. The rationale provides adequate physico-chemical insight by noting that multiple hydroxyl groups offer additional coordination sites, promoting strong chelation with the metal center. While the rule considers combinations of functional groups and their proximity, which meets the complexity criterion, the coverage is limited due to fewer supporting data points. Only one high-yield example, gluconic acid, is provided, suggesting the need for more data to strengthen the rule's validity.

- **Comment 8**:

  Rule 8 clearly states that modifiers containing bulky substituents or long ether chains that can introduce steric hindrance predict low yield. The structural description allows for straightforward identification of such modifiers. The rationale gives physico-chemical insight into how steric hindrance can impede effective coordination between the modifier and the metal center. The rule considers combinations of structural features that contribute to steric effects, meeting the complexity criterion. There are supporting low-yield examples like 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, satisfying the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 9**:

  Rule 9 is clear in stating that fluorinated carboxylic acids or those containing strongly electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups predict low yield. The presence of fluorinated groups is easily identifiable. The rationale provides insight by explaining that these groups reduce electron density, diminishing coordination ability with metal centers. The rule considers the strong electron-withdrawing effects of fluorinated groups, meeting the complexity criterion.

- **Comment 10**:

  Rule 10 clearly defines that modifiers containing amide bonds involving the amino group or near the carboxyl group predict low yield. The structural criteria are precise, enabling easy identification. The rationale offers physico-chemical insight by explaining that amide formation decreases the availability of free amino and carboxyl groups necessary for effective metal coordination. The rule considers specific functional group transformations, meeting the complexity criterion. Supporting low-yield examples like (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid are provided, satisfying the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 11**:

  Rule 11 states clearly that aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups attached to the ring predict low yield. The structural description is specific, facilitating straightforward application. The rationale provides insight into how aldehyde groups may engage in side reactions or interfere with metal coordination. The rule combines considerations of specific functional groups and their potential reactivity, meeting the complexity criterion. Low-yield examples like 4-formylbenzoic acid support the rule, fulfilling the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 12**:

  Rule 12 is clear in specifying that heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms in the ring directly attached to the carboxyl group predict high yield. The structural criteria are precise and easily identifiable. The rationale provides strong physico-chemical insight by highlighting the role of the nitrogen heteroatom in metal coordination. The rule considers specific heteroaromatic structures, demonstrating appropriate complexity. High-yield examples like pyridine-3-carboxylic acid support the rule, satisfying the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 13**:

  Rule 13 states that modifiers with long aliphatic chains connecting functional groups to the carboxyl group (four or more carbons) predict high yield. While the rule attempts to address the effect of chain length, the structural description lacks clarity due to the broad definition of "functional groups" and potential overlap with other rules. Additionally, the rule seems contradictory to Rule 4, which suggests that distant functional groups lead to low yield. The rationale provides some insight into flexibility and reduced steric hindrance but may oversimplify the structural considerations. The complexity is present but may introduce confusion. Although supported by some data points like 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, the conflicting aspects reduce the rule's effectiveness.

- **Comment 14**:

  Rule 14 clearly specifies that aliphatic carboxylic acids containing ether linkages within the carbon chain predict low yield. The structural criteria are precise, allowing for unambiguous identification of such modifiers. The rationale offers insight into how ether linkages can disrupt optimal conformation required for effective metal coordination. The rule considers the combination of aliphatic chains and ether functionalities, meeting the complexity criterion. Low-yield examples like 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid support the rule, fulfilling the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 15**:

  Rule 15 clearly states that modifiers that are peptides or contain peptide bonds predict low yield. The structural description is specific, facilitating easy classification. The rationale provides physico-chemical insight by explaining that peptide bonds reduce the availability of free amino and carboxyl groups necessary for metal coordination. The rule considers specific functional group linkages, meeting the complexity criterion. While there is at least one supporting low-yield example, such as 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid, the coverage is limited, suggesting a need for more data points to strengthen the rule.

The property insight is acceptable, focusing on sulfur as a strong ligand. However, coverage is limited to one high-yield example (*3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*) and one low-yield counterexample (*4-sulfanylbenzoic acid*), which may not be sufficient to fully support the rule.

- **Comment 14**: *Rule 14* is clear and provides valid property insight regarding peptides reducing the availability of coordination sites. The coverage is minimal, with only one low-yield example (*2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*), not meeting the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 15**: *Rule 15* is clear and offers good property insight into how extended conjugation enhances coordination ability. It effectively combines substructures, increasing complexity.

The rationale about strong ligand formation with thiol groups is valid. However, the coverage is limited, with *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid* as the only high-yield data point. Additional examples would improve the rule's robustness.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 clearly explains that modifiers with fused ring systems or extended conjugation capable of metal coordination predict a high yield. The rationale involving increased electron delocalization enhancing coordination is sound.

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear, specifying that aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino or thiol group within three carbons of the carboxyl group predict a high yield. The physical-chemical insight is sound, as close proximity of these groups enhances chelation with metal centers, improving catalyst performance. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures, and the dataset provides strong coverage with multiple supporting examples (e.g., L-Aspartic acid, L-Glutamic acid) and counterexamples (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid). The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

The rule effectively balances complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear in its description of heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms that coordinate with metal centers predicting high yield. The physical-chemical insight is appropriate, highlighting the role of nitrogen atoms in coordination. The rule considers complex sub-structures, and the dataset provides adequate coverage with examples like pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid. The balance between complexity and coverage is maintained.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 specifies that carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups proximal to the carboxyl group predict high yield. The rationale is strong, as additional hydroxyl groups enhance chelation. The rule involves combinations of functional groups and is supported by the dataset with examples like gluconic acid and its analogs. Coverage and balance are adequate.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 clearly indicates that aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxyl group predict low yield. The rationale is valid due to potential side reactions and interference with metal coordination. The rule considers specific combinations of functional groups. The dataset supports this rule with examples such as 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid. The rule achieves a good balance of complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 states that aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrocarbon chains (six or more carbons) and no other polar functional groups predict high yield. The rationale involves enhanced hydrophobic interactions. While the rule is clear and provides property insight, the coverage is limited, with only one supporting example (octanoic acid) and one counterexample (7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) in the dataset. This minimal coverage weakens the rule according to the scoring criteria.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 posits that perfluorinated carboxylic acids or those containing perfluoroalkyl groups predict low yield due to reduced coordination ability from strong electron-withdrawing effects. The rule is clear, and the rationale makes sense. However, the coverage is inadequate, with only one supporting example in the dataset (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid). According to the criteria, at least two data points are needed for adequate coverage, so the rule lacks sufficient support.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 asserts that aliphatic carboxylic acids containing ether linkages and terminal amino groups predict low yield. The rationale is reasonable, as ether linkages increase flexibility, reducing coordination efficiency. The rule is clear and considers combinations of sub-structures. The dataset provides adequate coverage with examples like 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid and 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, both yielding low results. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 indicates that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups incapable of metal coordination at the ortho or para positions predict low yield. The rationale is that electron-donating groups reduce the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxyl group. The rule is clear and considers specific functional group positioning. The dataset supports this rule with examples like 4-methylbenzoic acid and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid showing low yield. The rule has good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 states that modifiers containing amide bonds involving the carboxyl group or N-acetyl modifications near the carboxyl group predict low yield. The rationale is sound since these modifications reduce the availability of free coordinating groups. The rule is clear and considers combinations of sub-structures. The dataset supports it with examples like (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid and 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid, both showing low yield. The coverage and balance are adequate.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 suggests that aromatic carboxylic acids with fused ring systems or extended conjugation capable of metal coordination predict high yield if there is minimal steric hindrance. The rationale is based on enhanced electron delocalization aiding coordination. The rule is clear and considers complex sub-structures. The dataset supports this with examples like L-Tryptophan and 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid showing high yield. However, the counterexample 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, which shows low yield due to steric hindrance, highlights the importance of steric factors. The rule balances complexity and coverage well.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 states that aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups positioned to enable chelation without steric hindrance predict high yield. The rationale is that appropriately positioned hydroxyl groups enhance coordination. The rule is clear and considers functional group positioning. The dataset provides supporting examples, such as 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid showing high yield, and counterexamples like 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid showing low yield due to steric hindrance. Coverage and balance are satisfactory.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 asserts that aliphatic carboxylic acids with functional groups located more than four carbons away from the carboxyl group predict low yield. The rationale is that distant functional groups are less effective in coordination. The rule is clear and considers functional group positioning. The dataset supports this rule with examples like 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid, and 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, all showing low yield. The coverage is strong, and the rule balances complexity and coverage effectively.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 indicates that modifiers with sterically hindered structures or bulky substituents that impede effective coordination predict low yield. While the rationale is logical, the dataset reveals inconsistencies. For instance, 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid shows low yield, supporting the rule. However, 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid is listed as high yield in the dataset, which contradicts the rule's prediction. This inconsistency suggests that the rule does not accurately predict yield in all cases and lacks the necessary coverage and reliability.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 posits that carboxylic acids with both electron-withdrawing substituents and coordinating heteroatoms in positions facilitating chelation predict high yield. The rationale combines increased acidity and additional coordination sites enhancing performance. The rule is clear and considers complex sub-structures.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) located more than four carbons away from the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Distant functional groups are less effective in coordinating simultaneously with the metal center, reducing catalyst efficiency.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that have **bulky substituents or sterically hindered structures near the coordination sites** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Steric hindrance can impede effective alignment and interaction with the metal center, diminishing catalytic performance.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Biaryl system introduces steric bulk)
    - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid* (Bulky methoxy groups)

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with multiple coordinating groups positioned to enable chelation without steric hindrance** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple coordinating groups enhance metal-ligand interactions, stabilizing the catalyst complex and improving activity.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*
    - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (L-Tryptophan)

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **thiol-containing aliphatic carboxylic acids with the thiol group within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**, whereas **thiol-containing aromatic carboxylic acids** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: In aliphatic acids, proximal thiol and carboxyl groups can coordinate simultaneously with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity. In aromatic acids, resonance in the ring reduces thiol coordination effectiveness.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid* (3-Mercaptopropionic acid)
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* (Thiol group less effective due to aromatic resonance)

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **short-chain aliphatic amino acids** with the **amino group within two carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The close proximity of the amino and carboxyl groups enables effective bidentate coordination with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (L-Aspartic acid)
    - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (L-Glutamic acid)

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with an **amino group at the para position** predict a **high yield**, whereas those with **alkyl or hydroxy groups** at the same position predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The amino group provides an additional coordination site, enhancing metal-ligand interactions. Alkyl and hydroxy groups are less effective in metal coordination and may not enhance catalytic activity.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid* (p-Aminobenzoic acid)
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (Lacks coordinating amino group)
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (Hydroxy group less effective for coordination)

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids** containing **nitrogen atoms capable of coordinating** with metal centers predict a **high yield**, unless significant **steric hindrance** is present.
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles act as effective coordination sites, strengthening interactions with metal centers and enhancing catalytic performance.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
    - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*

  - *Rationale*: Proximal hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites through chelation, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and improving catalytic activity.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
    - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*

  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid* (3-Mercaptopropionic acid)
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* (Thiol group on aromatic ring less effective due to resonance stabilization)

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** (six or more carbons) with **no other polar functional groups** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Long hydrophobic chains may enhance substrate-catalyst interactions within hydrophobic regions of the catalytic system, improving yield.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *Octanoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexamples*:
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Polar hydroxyl group disrupts hydrophobic interactions)
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid* (Amino group introduces polarity, reducing hydrophobic interaction)

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that contain **carbonyl groups (aldehyde or ketone) adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.

    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*
    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that have **perfluoroalkyl groups** attached to the **carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Perfluoroalkyl groups are strong electron-withdrawing substituents, significantly reducing electron density on coordinating atoms and weakening metal-ligand interactions.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **ether linkages** and **terminal amino or hydroxyl groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether linkages increase molecular flexibility and distance between functional groups, reducing the ability to coordinate effectively with metal centers.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that have **amide bonds involving the carboxyl group** or **N-acetyl modifications** near the carboxyl group predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide formation decreases the availability of free carboxyl and amino groups necessary for effective metal coordination, hindering catalytic activity.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyl-L-lysine)
    - *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **bulky substituents** or **sterically hindered structures** near potential coordination sites predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Steric hindrance can impede the effective alignment and interaction of coordinating groups with the metal center, reducing catalytic performance.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Biaryl system introduces steric bulk)
    - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid* (Bulky methoxy groups and ketone)

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **polar functional groups** (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) located more than **four carbons away** from the **carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Distant polar functional groups are less effective in simultaneous coordination with the metal center and may interfere with hydrophobic interactions.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-rich aromatic systems** and **electron-donating groups** (other than amino) at positions that do not assist in coordination predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-rich aromatics may not favor coordination due to decreased acidity of the carboxyl group, and electron-donating groups can hinder effective metal-ligand interactions.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (Hydroxy group does not aid coordination)

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids** where the **heteroatom is unable to coordinate effectively** due to **steric hindrance** or **electron delocalization** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ineffective coordination with the metal center diminishes catalyst activity and overall yield.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Rigid structure limits coordination flexibility)

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-withdrawing groups** (e.g., **nitro**, **bromomethyl**, **amino**) at the **para position** predict a **high yield**; those with **electron-donating groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. Electron-donating groups reduce acidity and coordination efficiency.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *4-nitrobenzoic acid*
    - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid*
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid* (Amino group acts as additional coordination site)
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (Methyl group is electron-donating)
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (Hydroxy group too distant for coordination)

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids** containing **nitrogen atoms capable of coordinating with metal centers** and exhibit **minimal steric hindrance** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles serve as additional coordination sites, strengthening interactions with metal centers.
  - *High Yield Examples*:

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **long hydrophobic chains (six or more carbons)** and **no additional polar functional groups** predict a **high yield**; those with **distant polar groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Hydrophobic chains enhance substrate access to active sites through favorable interactions. Polar groups distant from the carboxyl group do not aid coordination and may disrupt these interactions.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *Octanoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid* (Amino group too distant)
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **adjacent hydroxyl groups** near the **carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Hydroxyl groups close to the carboxyl group provide additional coordination sites, enhancing metal-ligand interactions through chelation.
  - *High Yield Examples*:

    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Hydroxyl group too distant)

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with a **thiol group within three carbons** of the **carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**; those where the thiol group is part of an aromatic system predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The thiol group can coordinate with metal centers when in close proximity. Aromatic thiols may have reduced availability due to resonance stabilization.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid* (3-Mercaptopropionic acid)
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* (Thiol group less available for coordination)

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aromatic or aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **hydroxyl or methoxy groups** positioned to assist in coordination predict a **high yield**; if these groups are **too distant or sterically hindered**, they predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Hydroxyl and methoxy groups can serve as additional coordination sites. Distance and steric hindrance reduce effectiveness.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid* (Hydroxy group aids coordination)
    - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (Hydroxy group too distant)

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **perfluoroalkyl groups** attached to the **carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.

    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that have **amide bonds involving the carboxyl group** or are **N-acetylated** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide formation reduces the availability of free carboxyl and amino groups necessary for effective metal coordination.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyl-L-Lysine)
    - *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **ether linkages** and **terminal polar groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether linkages increase molecular flexibility and distance between functional groups, reducing effective coordination with metal centers.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **bulky substituents** directly attached to the aromatic ring predict a **low yield** due to **steric hindrance** affecting coordination.
  - *Rationale*: Bulky groups near coordinating sites impede effective alignment and interaction with the metal center.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Bulky bipyridine structure)
  - *High Yield Counterexample*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid* (Additional methylene units reduce steric hindrance)

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that have **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **polar functional groups** (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) located more than **four carbons away** from the **carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Distant polar groups are less effective in metal coordination and may introduce unfavorable interactions within the catalytic system.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with **multiple functional groups** capable of **intramolecular interactions** (e.g., hydrogen bonding) that lead to **conformational constraints**, hindering coordination with metal centers, predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Intramolecular interactions reduce the availability of functional groups for metal coordination, diminishing catalyst activity.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid* (Complex amino acid derivative)
    - *4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid*

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids** with **ketone groups adjacent to the aromatic ring** predict a **high yield** if the ketone participates in chelation.
  - *Rationale*: Ketone groups can enhance coordination ability when properly oriented, contributing to stronger metal-ligand interactions.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid* (Chelidamic acid)

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**:
  
  **Rule 1** is clear in identifying modifiers that are **α-amino acids** as predictors of high yield. The rule provides strong physical-chemical insight by explaining how the α-amino and carboxyl groups act as bidentate ligands, enhancing catalyst performance through chelation. It considers a combination of functional groups (amino and carboxyl groups attached to the same carbon), demonstrating appropriate complexity. The rule is well-supported by multiple data points in the dataset, such as *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid*, *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid*, and *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid*, all showing high yield. Therefore, **Rule 1 effectively meets all the criteria**.

- **Comment 2**:
  
  **Rule 2** aims to predict yield based on the presence of electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups on aromatic carboxylic acids. While the rule is generally clear, there is a discrepancy with the example of *4-aminobenzoic acid*, which has an electron-donating amino group yet results in a high yield. The rationale mentions that amino groups can act as additional coordination sites, which may override their electron-donating nature. This indicates that the rule could be refined to include substituents that provide additional coordination, regardless of their electronic effects. The physical-chemical insight is sound, but the **rule lacks clarity due to conflicting examples**, and it may benefit from revision for better accuracy.

- **Comment 3**:
  
  **Rule 3** is clear in stating that **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids** containing **pyridine nitrogen atoms** predict a high yield when steric hindrance is minimal. The rule provides solid physical-chemical insight, explaining how nitrogen atoms serve as additional coordination sites. It appropriately considers combinations of sub-structures, reflecting suitable complexity. The rule is well-supported by data points such as *pyridine-3-carboxylic acid*, *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*, and *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*, all yielding high results. Therefore, **Rule 3 effectively meets all the criteria**.

- **Comment 4**:
  
  **Rule 4** clearly identifies that **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **long hydrocarbon chains (six or more carbons)** and **no polar substituents** predict a high yield. The rationale provides adequate physical-chemical insight by explaining how hydrophobic chains enhance substrate access through favorable van der Waals interactions. The rule considers multiple structural features, demonstrating appropriate complexity. It is supported by data points like *octanoic acid* showing high yield and contrasts with *7-aminoheptanoic acid* and *8-aminooctanoic acid* showing low yield due to polar substituents. Thus, **Rule 4 meets all the criteria effectively**.

- **Comment 5**:
  
  **Rule 5** is clear in stating that modifiers with **hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a high yield, while those with distant hydroxyl groups predict a low yield. The rationale offers sound physical-chemical insight into how adjacent hydroxyl groups participate in chelation. The rule considers combinations of functional groups, demonstrating appropriate complexity. It is supported by high yield examples like *gluconic acid* and *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*, and low yield examples like *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*. Therefore, **Rule 5 effectively meets all the criteria**.

- **Comment 6**:
  
  **Rule 6** is clear and specifies that modifiers with **thiol groups within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a high yield, while those with thiol groups in an aromatic ring predict a low yield. The physical-chemical insight is strong, explaining how proximal thiol groups enhance metal coordination and how aromatic thiols are less effective due to resonance stabilization. The rule demonstrates appropriate complexity and is supported by data points like *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid* (high yield) and *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* (low yield). Thus, **Rule 6 effectively meets all the criteria**.

- **Comment 7**:
  
  **Rule 7** is clear in predicting that modifiers containing **perfluoroalkyl groups** attached to the carboxyl group result in a low yield. The rationale provides solid physical-chemical insight by explaining how strong electron-withdrawing groups reduce electron density on coordinating atoms. However, the rule is only supported by a single data point (*2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*), which limits its coverage. While the rule is valid, **the limited data support reduces its overall effectiveness**.

- **Comment 8**:
  
  **Rule 8** clearly states that **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the aromatic ring** predict a low yield. The rationale provides adequate physical-chemical insight by highlighting how these groups can interfere with metal coordination. The rule is appropriately complex and is supported by data points like *4-formylbenzoic acid* and *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid* (both showing low yield). Therefore, **Rule 8 effectively meets all the criteria**.

- **Comment 9**:
  
  **Rule 9** is clear in indicating that modifiers with **amide bonds involving the carboxyl group** or are **N-acetylated amino acids** predict a low yield. The physical-chemical insight is solid, explaining how amide formation reduces the availability of coordinating groups. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures and is supported by data points such as *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* and *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*. Thus, **Rule 9 effectively meets all the criteria**.

- **Comment 10**:
  
  **Rule 10** clearly predicts that **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **ether linkages** and **terminal polar groups** result in a low yield. The rationale offers sound physical-chemical insight into how ether linkages reduce effective coordination due to increased flexibility. The rule demonstrates appropriate complexity and is supported by data points like *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid* and *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*. Therefore, **Rule 10 meets all the criteria effectively**.

- **Comment 11**:
  
  **Rule 11** is clear in stating that modifiers with **bulky substituents near coordinating sites** predict a low yield due to steric hindrance. The physical-chemical insight is strong, explaining how steric effects impede metal coordination. The rule is appropriately complex and is supported by data points like *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (low yield) and *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid* (high yield due to reduced steric hindrance). Thus, **Rule 11 effectively meets all the criteria**.

- **Comment 12**:
  
  **Rule 12** clearly indicates that modifiers with **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** where **polar functional groups** are located more than **four carbons away** from the carboxyl group predict a low yield. The rationale provides adequate physical-chemical insight by explaining the diminished effectiveness of distant polar groups in coordination. The rule is appropriately complex and supported by data points like *7-aminoheptanoic acid*, *8-aminooctanoic acid*, and *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (all showing low yield). Therefore, **Rule 12 meets all the criteria effectively**.

- **Comment 13**:
  
  **Rule 13** suggests that **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **ortho-hydroxyl groups** predict a high yield due to chelation potential. However, the example provided, *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*, shows a low yield in the dataset, which contradicts the rule. This inconsistency indicates a lack of clarity and suggests that other factors (such as the presence of an adjacent aldehyde group, as noted in Rule 8) may override the effect of the ortho-hydroxyl group. Therefore, **Rule 13 lacks clarity and is not sufficiently supported by data**, reducing its effectiveness.

- **Comment 14**:
  
  **Rule 14** clearly states that modifiers with **functional groups capable of intramolecular interactions** that reduce availability of coordinating sites predict a low yield. The rationale provides solid physical-chemical insight into how intramolecular interactions can sequester coordinating groups. The rule is appropriately complex and is supported by data points like *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid* and *4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid*. Thus, **Rule 14 effectively meets all the criteria**.

- **Comment 15**:
  
  **Rule 15** is clear in indicating that modifiers containing **chelating groups** (e.g., adjacent carbonyl and hydroxyl groups) predict a high yield due to enhanced coordination. The physical-chemical insight is strong, explaining how chelating groups form multidentate interactions with metal centers. The rule is appropriately complex and is supported by data points like *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid* and *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid* (both showing high yield). Therefore, **Rule 15 effectively meets all the criteria**.
