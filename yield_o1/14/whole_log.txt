**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and specific, focusing on modifiers containing an **alpha-amino acid backbone with two carboxylic acid groups**. This provides good property insight, as such structures may chelate metal ions, enhancing the catalyst's performance. The rule combines multiple functional groups, adding complexity. It is supported by at least two data points—L-glutamic acid and L-aspartic acid—thus satisfying the coverage criterion and achieving a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clearly defined, targeting **aromatic carboxylic acids with a strong electron-withdrawing group at the para position**. The property insight is solid, as electron-withdrawing groups can influence electron density and coordination behavior with metal centers. The rule considers both the aromatic system and the nature of substituents, enhancing complexity. It is supported by two data points—4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid and 4-nitrobenzoic acid—meeting the coverage requirement and maintaining a good balance.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear, focusing on **aromatic carboxylic acids with an amino group at the para position**. However, it is supported by only one data point—4-aminobenzoic acid—which does not fulfill the coverage criterion of at least two data points. Additionally, amino groups are electron-donating, which may conflict with Rule 13 that suggests electron-donating groups at the para position predict low yield. This discrepancy indicates that the property insight may need further refinement, and the rule's reliability is limited due to insufficient data support.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clearly articulated, describing **aliphatic carboxylic acids with an omega-amino group and a chain length of 5 carbons or fewer**. It provides property insight into how shorter-chain omega-amino acids may interact favorably with the catalyst. The rule combines chain length and functional groups, adding complexity. However, it is supported by only one data point—5-aminopentanoic acid—failing to meet the coverage criterion and therefore lacking robust support.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear, focusing on modifiers containing **perfluoroalkyl chains**. The property insight is logical, as perfluoroalkyl groups are highly electron-withdrawing and can affect solubility and binding interactions negatively. The rule is specific but only supported by a single data point—2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid—which does not satisfy the coverage criterion, limiting its reliability.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear and offers property insight by highlighting how **aromatic carboxylic acids with a formyl group at the para position** may lead to low yields, possibly due to the aldehyde group's reactivity. The rule is complex, considering both the aromatic ring and the specific substituent. It is supported by two data points—4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid—meeting the coverage requirement and providing a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear, addressing **aliphatic carboxylic acids with an omega-amino group and a chain length greater than 5 carbons**. The property insight suggests that longer chains may hinder effective interaction with the catalyst. The rule combines chain length considerations with functional group placement, increasing complexity. It is supported by two data points—7-aminoheptanoic acid and 8-aminooctanoic acid—fulfilling the coverage criterion and maintaining a good balance.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is well-defined, focusing on modifiers containing an **aromatic ring fused with a heterocycle**. The property insight is strong, as such structures may facilitate improved π-π interactions or coordination with the catalyst. The rule has significant complexity due to the fused ring system and is supported by at least three data points—L-tryptophan, 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, and 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid—exceeding the coverage criterion and exemplifying a balanced approach.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear, identifying **aromatic carboxylic acids with a sulfanyl (thiol) group at the para position** as predictors of low yield. The property insight is reasonable, considering that thiol groups can have strong binding affinities that might inhibit catalyst activity. However, it is supported by only one data point—4-sulfanylbenzoic acid—which does not meet the coverage criterion, thus limiting its conclusiveness.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clearly stated, focusing on **ether-linked carboxylic acids with flexible ether chains** predicting low yield. The property insight suggests that flexibility and ether linkages may interfere with proper catalyst interaction. The rule is complex, considering both the ether chain and carboxylic acid functionality. It is supported by two data points—2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid and 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid—satisfying the coverage criterion and maintaining balance.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear and offers property insight into how **carboxylic acids with acylated amino groups (amides)** may lead to low yields, potentially due to reduced availability of coordination sites. The rule is complex, involving amide formation in addition to the carboxylic acid group. It is supported by two data points—2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid and (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid—meeting the coverage criterion and achieving a good balance.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is specific and clear, indicating that **modifiers with a hydroxyl group on a long aliphatic chain (more than 6 carbons)** predict low yield. The property insight may relate to steric hindrance or solubility issues. However, the rule is only supported by one data point—7-hydroxyheptanoic acid—falling short of the coverage requirement and thus limiting its reliability.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear and provides property insight into how **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-donating groups at the para position** can lead to low yields, possibly due to unfavorable electronic interactions with the catalyst. The rule combines functional group effects with positional specificity, enhancing complexity. It is supported by two data points—4-methylbenzoic acid and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid—fulfilling the coverage criterion and maintaining balance.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 is well-defined, targeting **modifiers with a pyrazole or pyridine ring directly attached to the carboxylic acid**. The property insight is strong, as these heteroaromatic groups may enhance coordination with metal centers. The rule is complex because it involves specific heteroaromatic systems. It is supported by two data points—1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid and pyridine-3-carboxylic acid—meeting the coverage requirement and achieving a good balance.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 is clear, focusing on **sugar acids (polyhydroxylated carboxylic acids)** predicting high yield. The property insight suggests that multiple hydroxyl groups may enhance solubility or interaction with the catalyst. However, it is only supported by one data point—D-gluconic acid—insufficient to meet the coverage criterion, thereby limiting the rule's conclusiveness.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Reevaluate Rule 3 and its conflict with Rule 13**. Since Rule 3 (aromatic carboxylic acids with an amino group at the para position predict high yield) is only supported by one data point and amino groups are strong electron-donating groups, this contradicts Rule 13 (aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-donating groups at the para position predict low yield). Consider merging these rules or revising them to reflect that para-amino groups may not consistently predict high yield. Additional data collection on modifiers with para-amino groups is recommended to clarify this discrepancy.

- **Advice 2**: **Expand or Modify Rule 4 to Meet Coverage Criteria**. Rule 4 is supported by only one data point (5-aminopentanoic acid). To improve its reliability, either gather more data on aliphatic omega-amino acids with chain lengths of 5 carbons or fewer or consider combining this rule with a broader category of aliphatic amino acids. Alternatively, adjust the rule to include modifiers with similar structures that are supported by more data points.

- **Advice 3**: **Strengthen Rule 5 by Incorporating Similar Electron-Withdrawing Groups**. Rule 5 is supported by a single data point involving perfluoroalkyl chains. To enhance its applicability, generalize the rule to include modifiers with other strong electron-withdrawing groups on aliphatic chains that also predict low yield. This will expand the rule's coverage and provide better guidance for modifiers with different electron-withdrawing substituents.

- **Advice 4**: **Reassess Rule 9 Due to Limited Data Support**. With only one supporting data point (4-sulfanylbenzoic acid), Rule 9 lacks sufficient coverage. Investigate additional modifiers with para-thiol groups to determine if the trend holds. If thiol-containing aromatic carboxylic acids do not consistently predict low yield, consider removing this rule or combining it with a broader rule addressing sulfur-containing functional groups that affect yield.

- **Advice 5**: **Modify Rule 12 to Include More Data or Broaden Its Scope**. Rule 12 is based on a single example (7-hydroxyheptanoic acid). To meet the coverage criterion, collect more data on modifiers with hydroxyl groups on long aliphatic chains. If similar modifiers also predict low yield, the rule can be retained and strengthened. Otherwise, consider broadening the rule to include other aliphatic hydroxyl-containing acids that affect yield similarly.

- **Advice 6**: **Evaluate Rule 15 for Inclusion or Removal**. Rule 15, concerning sugar acids predicting high yield, is only supported by D-gluconic acid. Determine if other polyhydroxylated carboxylic acids also result in high yields. If not, it may be prudent to remove this rule due to insufficient data support. Alternatively, incorporate sugar acids into a more general rule about polyhydroxylated compounds if applicable.

- **Advice 7**: **Resolve Conflicts Between Rules Involving Electron-Donating Groups**. Address the contradiction between Rule 3 and Rule 13 regarding para-substituted electron-donating groups. Conduct a thorough analysis of modifiers with para-amino, hydroxy, and methoxy groups to determine their true effect on yield. Adjust the rules to accurately reflect the influence of electron-donating groups, possibly by specifying exceptions or conditions under which these groups predict high or low yield.

- **Advice 8**: **Ensure All Rules Meet the Coverage Criterion**. Review all rules to confirm they are supported by at least two data points. For rules that do not meet this criterion (e.g., Rules 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 15), consider either collecting additional supporting data or merging these rules with others to improve their validity and robustness.

- **Advice 9**: **Incorporate Additional Data to Strengthen Weak Rules**. Actively seek out or experiment with modifiers that can provide additional data points for under-supported rules. This will enhance the reliability of these rules and may reveal new trends or necessitate rule adjustments based on more comprehensive data.

- **Advice 10**: **Develop New Rules to Capture Unaddressed Patterns**. Analyze the dataset for patterns not currently explained by existing rules. For example, consider creating rules for modifiers like octanoic acid (high yield) and 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid (high yield), which may reveal insights into the effects of chain length or additional aromatic rings on yield.

- **Advice 11**: **Simplify Overly Complex Rules for Clarity**. Review rules that may be overly complex due to the combination of multiple structural features. Simplify these rules where possible without losing essential property insights. Clear and concise rules are easier to apply and validate, improving their practical utility in predicting reaction yields.

- **Advice 12**: **Standardize Functional Group Nomenclature in Rules**. Ensure consistent use of chemical terminology across all rules. For instance, use standardized names for functional groups and specify positions (e.g., "para" position) clearly. This will enhance understanding and reduce ambiguity when applying the rules to new modifiers.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Reconsider Rule 3 due to conflicting evidence and limited data support.** Rule 3 suggests that aromatic carboxylic acids with an amino group at the para position predict high yield, but this contradicts Rule 10, which states that strong electron-donating groups (like amino groups) at the para position predict low yield. To resolve this, you should:
  - **Modify Rule 10** to specify that only certain electron-donating groups (e.g., hydroxy, methoxy) at the para position predict low yield, excluding amino groups.
  - **Refine Rule 3** by providing a stronger property insight into why amino groups at the para position lead to high yield, potentially due to their ability to coordinate with metal centers.
  - **Collect additional data points** for compounds like 4-aminobenzoic acid to strengthen the rule's support and evaluate if this behavior is consistent across similar compounds.

- **Advice 2**: **Strengthen rules that are supported by only one data point or insufficient coverage.** For Rules 3, 4, 6, 9, 13, and 15, which currently lack sufficient data support, you should:
  - **Gather more experimental data** to find additional examples that either support or refute these rules.
  - **Consider merging these rules** with other rules that share similar structural features or property insights to enhance coverage.
  - **Rephrase the rules** to encompass broader categories that are better supported by the existing data.

- **Advice 3**: **Clarify and specify the exceptions in rules involving electron-donating groups.** Since amino groups seem to be an exception to the general trend that electron-donating groups reduce yield, you should:
  - **Adjust Rule 10** to focus on specific electron-donating groups (hydroxy, methoxy) that have been shown to predict low yield.
  - **Introduce a new rule or a sub-rule** that explains the unique behavior of amino groups at the para position, highlighting their potential to act as ligands and improve catalyst interaction.
  - **Provide mechanistic rationale** to support the distinction between different electron-donating groups and their effects on yield.

- **Advice 4**: **Improve the clarity of Rule 8 by specifying the types of fused aromatic heterocycles.** To make Rule 8 more precise and user-friendly, you should:
  - **List specific classes of fused heterocycles** (e.g., indoles, benzofurans, benzothiazoles) that are known to predict high yield.
  - **Provide additional examples** beyond L-tryptophan and 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid to strengthen the rule.
  - **Include structural diagrams or SMILES representations** to aid in the identification of relevant modifiers.

- **Advice 5**: **Reevaluate Rule 13 due to limited data support.** As Rule 13 is based on a single data point (7-hydroxyheptanoic acid), you should:
  - **Expand the rule to include similar compounds** with long aliphatic chains and hydroxyl groups to see if the low-yield trend holds.
  - **Consider combining Rule 13** with Rule 5, which addresses chain length and omega-amino groups, to create a more general rule about long-chain aliphatic acids predicting low yield.
  - **Conduct further experiments or data mining** to find additional modifiers that fit this category.

- **Advice 6**: **Integrate Rule 6 into a broader rule or gather more data.** Given that Rule 6 (modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl chains predict low yield) is supported by only one data point, you should:
  - **Combine Rule 6 with other rules** that involve strong electron-withdrawing groups, creating a more comprehensive rule about electron-withdrawing substituents predicting low yield.
  - **Seek additional examples** of perfluoroalkyl-containing modifiers to confirm if this is a consistent trend.
  - **Assess the impact of perfluoroalkyl chains** on solubility and catalyst interaction to provide deeper property insight.

- **Advice 7**: **Address rules with limited coverage by expanding datasets or reframing the rules.** For rules with insufficient data points (e.g., Rules 9 and 15), you should:
  - **Collect more data** on modifiers that fit the structural criteria to see if the predicted yield trends hold true.
  - **Reframe the rules as observations** rather than definitive predictions until more supporting evidence is available.
  - **Consider these rules as exceptions or special cases** within broader categories, highlighting the need for caution when applying them.

- **Advice 8**: **Enhance the dataset to support low-coverage rules.** To strengthen rules with limited examples, you should:
  - **Expand your search for additional modifiers** in chemical databases that match the criteria of the low-coverage rules.
  - **Experiment with new modifiers** that are structurally similar to the single data point examples to test the validity of the rules.
  - **Update the rules** based on the new data, either reinforcing them or recognizing patterns that lead to rule modification.

- **Advice 9**: **Develop comprehensive rules that account for electronic effects and substituent positions.** To reconcile conflicting rules and provide clearer guidelines, you should:
  - **Integrate Rules 2, 3, 7, and 10** into a unified rule that considers both electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups at specific positions on the aromatic ring.
  - **Create sub-rules or exceptions** within this comprehensive rule to account for anomalies like the amino group at the para position.
  - **Use quantitative descriptors** (e.g., Hammett constants) to quantify the electronic effects of substituents and correlate them with yield outcomes.

- **Advice 10**: **Deepen the property insights and mechanistic understanding of the rules.** To improve the predictive power and reliability of the rules, you should:
  - **Investigate the reaction mechanisms** to understand how different functional groups influence the catalyst and overall reaction.
  - **Incorporate computational modeling or literature research** to support the proposed effects of various substituents.
  - **Adjust the rules based on mechanistic evidence**, ensuring they reflect the true underlying chemistry rather than just empirical observations.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- **Suggestion 1**: **Improve the pattern matching for omega-amino groups in Rules 7 and 8.** The current implementation of `has_omega_amino_chain` potentially matches any amino group along the carbon chain, not specifically at the omega position (the end opposite the carboxylic acid). To fix this, the SMARTS pattern should ensure that the amino group is at the terminal carbon furthest from the carboxylic acid. The corrected pattern should anchor the amino group to the terminal carbon, for example:
  ```python
  pattern = 'O=C' + '[C]'*(length-2) + '[CH2][NH2]'
  ```
  This ensures that the amino group is on the omega carbon.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Refine the electron-donating group (EDG) matching in Rule 3.** The function `has_electron_donating_group_aromatic` currently checks for EDGs anywhere in the molecule, not specifically attached directly to the aromatic ring. Modify the SMARTS patterns to specify that the EDG is directly attached to the aromatic ring. For example, use:
  ```python
  edg_on_ring = 'c[$(O[H]),$(OC),$(C)]'
  ```
  This pattern ensures that the electron-donating group is directly connected to the aromatic carbon.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Correct the para-substitution pattern in Rule 2.** In `has_electron_withdrawing_group_para`, the SMARTS patterns may not accurately capture para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups on aromatic carboxylic acids. Update the pattern to ensure the EWG is at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid group. For example:
  ```python
  para_electron_withdrawing = 'c1ccc([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])cc1[EWG]'
  ```
  where `[EWG]` represents electron-withdrawing groups like nitro or bromomethyl, and ensure that the positions are correctly annotated.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Enhance the pattern for detecting fused aromatic heterocycles in Rule 10.** The function `has_fused_aromatic_heterocycles` may not capture all relevant structures. Update the SMARTS pattern to more broadly detect fused aromatic rings with heteroatoms. For example:
  ```python
  fused_heterocycle = '[a]12[a][a][a][a][a]1[a][a][a][a][a]2'
  ```
  or use RDKit's ring fusion detection capabilities to identify fused systems.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Adjust the pattern for alpha-amino-dicarboxylic acids in Rule 1.** The current function may not detect all alpha-amino-dicarboxylic acids. Ensure that both carboxylic acid groups are present and that one is on the alpha carbon. A possible SMARTS pattern:
  ```python
  amino_dicarboxylic_acid = '[NX3][CH]([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'
  ```
  This pattern ensures an amino group attached to the alpha carbon, which also has a carboxylic acid, and another carboxylic acid elsewhere in the molecule.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Specify the aldehyde group attachment in Rule 4.** In `has_aldehyde_group_aromatic`, the pattern should ensure the aldehyde group is directly attached to the aromatic ring. Use a SMARTS pattern like:
  ```python
  aldehyde_on_ring = '[c][C](=O)[H]'
  ```
  This ensures the aldehyde carbon is directly connected to an aromatic carbon.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Include stereochemistry where necessary.** The code may not account for stereochemistry, which can be important for certain rules (e.g., sugars in Rule 13). Ensure that stereochemical information is considered if relevant to the rule.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Improve detection of perfluoroalkyl chains in Rule 11.** The current pattern may miss longer perfluoroalkyl chains. Update the pattern to detect any length of perfluoroalkyl chain:
  ```python
  perfluoroalkyl = 'C(F)(F)(F)C(F)(F)F'
  ```
  or a recursive pattern that matches perfluoroalkyl groups of variable length.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Enhance the flexibility of ether chain detection in Rule 12.** The current pattern may not detect all flexible ether chains. Use a pattern that allows for varying chain lengths:
  ```python
  ether_chain = '[OX2H0][CX4][OX2H0][CX4][OX2H0][CX4][OX2H0]'
  ```
  This pattern can be made recursive to match chains of different lengths.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Consider using RDKit's built-in functions.** For some patterns, RDKit has built-in functionalities (like ring counts, aromaticity, etc.) that can simplify pattern definitions and improve accuracy.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Rephrase rules using numerical molecular descriptors** that can be directly calculated from SMILES strings. Instead of qualitative descriptions (e.g., "alpha-amino-dicarboxylic acids"), define rules based on the **counts of specific functional groups** (e.g., number of amino groups, number of carboxylic acid groups).

- **Advice 2**: **Incorporate electronic properties quantitatively** by calculating parameters like **Hammett sigma constants** or **Taft constants** for substituents. This allows electron-donating or withdrawing effects to be represented numerically, facilitating inclusion in a feature matrix.

- **Advice 3**: **Utilize molecular descriptors** such as **molecular weight, logP (octanol-water partition coefficient), topological polar surface area (TPSA),** and **hydrogen bond donors/acceptors counts**. These descriptors can be calculated from SMILES and provide numerical features that correlate with reactivity and yield.

- **Advice 4**: **Consolidate similar rules** to reduce complexity and improve generality. For example, merge rules about aromatic carboxylic acids with various substituents into a single rule that considers the **overall electronic effect and steric hindrance**, quantified by calculated descriptors.

- **Advice 5**: **Include structural features using molecular fingerprints** (e.g., ECFP, MACCS keys) derived from SMILES. Fingerprints convert structural information into binary or count-based numeric vectors, capturing the presence or frequency of substructures.

- **Advice 6**: **Define rules based on chain length and flexibility** numerically. For aliphatic chains, use the **number of carbon atoms** and **number of rotatable bonds** to quantify chain length and flexibility, which can influence reactivity and yield.

- **Advice 7**: **Quantify aromaticity and heteroatom content** by calculating the **number of aromatic rings**, **aromatic heterocycles**, and **heteroatoms (e.g., N, O, S)** within the molecule. These can be important predictors of catalyst interaction and reaction outcomes.

- **Advice 8**: **Implement machine learning models** that utilize the numerical feature matrix derived from the above descriptors to predict yields. This approach allows for more nuanced relationships between molecular features and reaction outcomes to be captured.

- **Advice 9**: **Prioritize the use of cheminformatics tools** (such as **RDKit**) to automate the extraction of these features from SMILES data. This ensures consistency and efficiency in generating the required numerical data for modeling.

- **Advice 10**: **Remove or revise rules that are based on specific examples** and focus on **generalizable patterns** that can be numerically described. This makes the rules applicable to a broader range of modifiers and facilitates computational analysis.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: **For Rule 2**, the SMARTS patterns for detecting electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position are too limited. Currently, the code only accounts for nitro groups and halomethyl groups. Expand the SMARTS patterns to include other strong EWGs such as halogens directly attached to the aromatic ring (e.g., `[c]1[c][c][c][c][c]1[F,Cl,Br,I]` at the para position), cyano groups (`[c]1[c][c][c][c][c]1C#N`), trifluoromethyl groups (`[c]1[c][c][c][c][c]1C(F)(F)F`), and carbonyl-containing groups like aldehydes and ketones. Adjusting the patterns will ensure that all relevant EWGs are detected according to the rule.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: **For Rule 3**, the SMARTS patterns for electron-donating groups (EDGs) are not correctly matching the intended substituents. The current patterns may be too narrow or incorrectly specified. Revise the `edg_aromatic` patterns to accurately detect EDGs such as methyl (`[c][CH3]`), methoxy (`[c][OCH3]`), hydroxy (`[c][OH]`), and sulfhydryl (`[c][SH]`) groups directly attached to the aromatic ring. Make sure to exclude amino groups as specified in the rule. Broadening and correcting these patterns will improve the identification of modifiers that predict low yield.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: **For Rule 5**, the SMARTS pattern for heteroaromatic rings attached to the carboxylic acid is overly restrictive and may miss valid matches. The pattern `[n,c][c,n][c,n][c,n][c,n][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` assumes a specific ring size and structure. To encompass a wider range of heteroaromatic rings, use a more general pattern like `[*]1~[*]~[*]~[*]~[*]1[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]`, which matches any five-membered heteroaromatic ring attached to a carboxylic acid. Additionally, consider including six-membered rings and other heteroaromatic systems to fully capture the rule's intent.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: **For Rules involving positional isomers (e.g., para substitution)**, ensure that the SMARTS patterns accurately reflect the positions of substituents on the aromatic ring. Utilize recursive SMARTS or numbering to specify positions relative to the carboxylic acid group. For example, in Rule 2 and Rule 4, define the aromatic ring with numbered atoms and specify the substituent at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: **In general**, thoroughly review and test all SMARTS patterns against known examples and counter-examples. Some patterns may be too specific, leading to false negatives, or too general, leading to false positives. Implement unit tests with the provided examples in the rules to validate that each pattern correctly matches the intended structures and does not match unintended ones.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: **For Rule 13**, which involves chain length considerations, ensure that the code accurately measures the aliphatic chain length beyond the alpha position and checks for the presence of an aromatic ring with electron-donating groups. Modify the SMARTS patterns and the logic to correctly assess chain lengths and substitutions as specified in the rule.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: **Enhance error handling** in the code to provide informative messages when a SMILES string cannot be parsed or when a pattern matching fails due to an error. This will aid in debugging and improving the reliability of the code.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: **Consider using cheminformatics toolkits** like RDKit's substructure searching capabilities more extensively, such as using molecular queries or descriptors that can simplify complex pattern matching and make the code more maintainable.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Compared to Reference Metrics**

Upon examining the current rule metrics in comparison to the reference metrics provided, several key observations can be made:

---

### **Support**

- **Current Train Support**: **0.0381**
- **Reference Train Support**: **[0.1667, 0.1845]**

**Interpretation**:

- The **current support** has **significantly decreased** compared to the reference metrics.
- **Low support** indicates that the rules are applicable to a **smaller portion of the dataset**.
- This suggests that the current rules are **too specific** and may not generalize well to cover more instances.

---

### **Confidence**

- **Current Train Confidence**: **0.6889**
- **Reference Train Confidence**: **[0.6352, 0.5396]**

**Interpretation**:

- The **current confidence** has **increased** compared to the reference metrics.
- Higher confidence means that when the rule conditions are met, the prediction is correct about **68.89%** of the time.
- This improvement indicates that the rules are **more reliable** for the instances they cover.

---

### **Lift**

- **Current Train Lift**: **1.3772**
- **Reference Train Lift**: **[1.2048, 1.0559]**

**Interpretation**:

- The **current lift** has **increased**, suggesting a **stronger association** between the rule conditions and the prediction compared to the average.
- A lift greater than **1** implies that the rule is **more effective** than random chance in predicting the outcome.
- The higher lift value indicates that the rules are **valuable** for uncovering meaningful patterns.

---

### **Leverage**

- **Current Train Leverage**: **0.0130**
- **Reference Train Leverage**: **[0.0289, -0.0041]**

**Interpretation**:

- The **current leverage** is **positive** but **lower** than the higher reference value.
- Positive leverage indicates that the rules have a **stronger association** than expected by chance.
- However, the lower leverage suggests that the **additional predictive power** contributed by the rules is **limited**.

---

**Overall Assessment**:

- The **increase in confidence and lift** is a positive outcome, indicating that the rules are more **accurate** for the cases they apply to.
- The **significant decrease in support** is concerning, as it implies the rules are relevant to a **smaller subset** of data.
- The combination of high confidence and low support suggests that the rules are **overfitting** to specific instances.

---

### **Evaluation of Local Minimum and Iterations**

Given the observed metrics, it appears that the current rules have reached a **local minimum** in terms of performance:

- **High confidence and lift** indicate that **further improvements** in these metrics may be limited without sacrificing other aspects.
- The **low support** suggests that **additional iterations** are necessary to create rules that cover more data points.
- There may be a **trade-off** between **support** and **confidence/lift** that needs to be balanced.

---

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

To enhance the performance of the current rules, consider the following strategies:

1. **Increase Rule Support**

   - **Generalize Rule Conditions**:
     - Modify overly specific rules to be more **inclusive**.
     - For example, broaden functional groups or structural features to encompass more compounds.
   - **Combine Similar Rules**:
     - Merge rules with overlapping conditions to create a more **comprehensive** rule.
     - This can increase support while maintaining reasonable confidence.

2. **Balance Specificity and Generality**

   - **Avoid Overfitting**:
     - Ensure that rules are not tailored to **individual instances**.
     - Introduce variability in the conditions to prevent rules from being too narrow.
   - **Iterative Testing**:
     - Test rule modifications on **validation data** to assess generalizability.

3. **Enhance Leverage**

   - **Identify High-Frequency Patterns**:
     - Focus on rule conditions that occur **frequently** in the dataset but are still predictive.
   - **Positive Leverage Optimization**:
     - Aim to maximize leverage by enhancing the rule's ability to capture the **additional support** over chance.

4. **Integrate New Features**

   - **Include Additional Descriptors**:
     - Consider incorporating more molecular descriptors or features that may influence yield.
   - **Explore Non-linear Relationships**:
     - Some associations may not be linear; consider models that can capture **complex interactions**.

5. **Re-evaluate Rule Structure**

   - **Refine Rule Definitions**:
     - Reassess the **current rules** for possible redundancies or conflicts.
     - Ensure that rules are **mutually exclusive** where appropriate to avoid overlapping conditions.

6. **Cross-Validate with Test Data**

   - **Assess Generalizability**:
     - Apply the rules to a **test dataset** to evaluate performance outside of the training data.
   - **Monitor for Overfitting**:
     - Compare metrics between training and test data to identify signs of overfitting.

7. **Increase Iterations with Focused Goals**

   - **Set Specific Objectives**:
     - Target increasing support without a significant drop in confidence and lift.
   - **Incremental Adjustments**:
     - Make small, systematic changes to rules to monitor their impact on metrics.

8. **Consider Alternative Models**

   - **Machine Learning Techniques**:
     - Explore using decision trees, random forests, or other algorithms that can handle feature interactions more effectively.
   - **Statistical Analysis**:
     - Perform regression analysis to identify significant predictors of high yield.

---

**Conclusion**

The current rules show **improvement in confidence and lift** but suffer from **low support**, indicating that they are accurate for a small portion of the data. To achieve a better balance and enhance overall performance:

- **Increase the applicability** of rules to cover more data points.
- **Ensure that the rules are general enough** to be useful but specific enough to maintain predictive power.
- **Continue iterating** with a focus on **expanding support** while monitoring the impact on confidence and lift.

By implementing these improvements, the rules can become more robust, providing valuable insights into the catalytic problem and contributing more effectively to the research program.

ML Commenter Message:
**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

Based on the latest training results, the current set of rules appears to be less effective than in previous iterations. The 5-fold validation accuracy obtained using the classification model is **68.57%**, which is lower than the previous validation accuracies, which were consistently around **76%**. This decrease suggests that the current rules may not be capturing the underlying patterns in the data as effectively as before.

The test accuracies in the previous iterations varied between **62.5%** and **75%**, indicating some inconsistency in model generalization. The current iteration's validation accuracy drop may point towards potential underfitting, where the model is too simple to capture complex relationships, or it could be due to overfitting specific rules that do not generalize well to unseen data.

**SHAP Analysis and Rule Effectiveness**

An examination of the SHAP values for the misclassified molecules provides insights into which rules may be contributing to incorrect predictions:

1. **Overestimated Loadings (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**
   - Molecules where the model predicts a high loading but the experimental value is low show consistently high positive SHAP values for **Rule 9**, **Rule 10**, and **Rule 12**.
   - For example:
     - *Molecule:* C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O
       - **Rule 10 SHAP value:** 0.05895
       - **Rule 12 SHAP value:** 0.04366
     - *Molecule:* CC1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=O)O
       - **Rule 9 SHAP value:** 0.02232
       - **Rule 10 SHAP value:** 0.04170
       - **Rule 12 SHAP value:** 0.04171
   - The positive SHAP values for these rules indicate they are strong contributors to the overestimation of the loading.

2. **Underestimated Loadings (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**
   - There are fewer instances of underestimated loadings, but in cases where the model predicts a low loading while the experimental value is high, rules with high negative SHAP values contribute to the misprediction.
   - For example:
     - *Molecule:* C(CC(=O)O)CNC(=O)C(F)(F)F
       - **Rule 10 SHAP value:** -0.24322
       - **Rule 9 SHAP value:** -0.11761

**Assessment of Specific Rules**

- **Rule 9 (Perfluoroalkyl Chains Predict Low Yield):**
  - This rule contributes positively to high loading predictions in several misclassified molecules, which is contrary to its intended purpose.
  - The rule may be too broadly defined or not accurately capturing the influence of perfluoroalkyl groups on the modifier's behavior.

- **Rule 10 (Carboxylic Acids with Acylated Amino Groups Predict Low Yield):**
  - Despite predicting low yield, Rule 10 has high positive SHAP values in cases where the model overestimates the loading.
  - This discrepancy suggests that the rule may be misclassifying modifiers or that the structural features it targets are present in high-yield modifiers as well.

- **Rule 12 (Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Aldehyde Groups Predict Low Yield):**
  - Similar to Rule 10, Rule 12 shows high positive SHAP values in overestimations, indicating it may not be accurately predicting low yield as intended.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

1. **Refine Rule 9:**
   - **Issue Identified:** Rule 9 is contributing to overestimated loadings instead of predicting low yield as intended.
   - **Suggested Action:**
     - Re-evaluate the scope of perfluoroalkyl chains considered in this rule.
     - Consider specifying the length of the perfluoroalkyl chain or the position of the fluorine atoms to improve specificity.
     - Analyze whether certain perfluoroalkyl modifiers actually lead to high yield, and adjust the rule accordingly.

2. **Adjust Rule 10:**
   - **Issue Identified:** Rule 10 is associated with high positive SHAP values in cases where low yield is expected.
   - **Suggested Action:**
     - Investigate the structural features of modifiers misclassified due to this rule.
     - Narrow down the definition to exclude modifiers that are exceptions (i.e., acylated amino groups that do not lead to low yield).
     - Incorporate additional criteria, such as the presence of specific side chains or functional groups that may influence the yield differently.

3. **Update Rule 12:**
   - **Issue Identified:** Rule 12 is contributing to the overprediction of high yield despite being intended to predict low yield.
   - **Suggested Action:**
     - Examine modifiers with aldehyde groups that are resulting in high loading predictions.
     - Refine the rule to account for the position of the aldehyde group and its interplay with other substituents on the aromatic ring.
     - Consider adding exceptions or additional conditions to the rule to improve its predictive accuracy.

4. **Enhance Generalization:**
   - **Issue Identified:** The decrease in validation accuracy suggests potential underfitting.
   - **Suggested Action:**
     - Introduce new rules that capture structural features not currently accounted for, based on an analysis of misclassified molecules.
     - Increase the complexity of the model by considering interactions between rules or adding weighting factors.
     - Evaluate the existing rules for redundancy or overlap, consolidating them where appropriate to simplify the feature matrix without losing critical information.

5. **Iterative Rule Refinement:**
   - **Approach:**
     - Use the insights from the SHAP analysis to prioritize which rules need adjustment.
     - After refining the rules, retrain the model and assess the impact on validation accuracy.
     - Continue this iterative process of refinement and evaluation to progressively improve model performance.

6. **Additional Considerations:**
   - **Data Balance:**
     - Check for class imbalance between high and low yield modifiers, which could affect model training.
     - Apply techniques like resampling or weighting to address any imbalance.

   - **Feature Engineering:**
     - Explore additional molecular descriptors or features that could enhance the model's predictive power.
     - Utilize domain knowledge to identify relevant chemical properties influencing modifier loading.

   - **Model Complexity:**
     - Consider testing more sophisticated models or algorithms if rule-based predictions continue to underperform.
     - Implement cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

**Conclusion**

By focusing on the refinement of Rules 9, 10, and 12, and enhancing the generalization capabilities of the model, we can address the overestimation issues identified in the SHAP analysis. Iterative refinement, informed by systematic analysis of mispredictions, will help improve the accuracy of the predictions and the effectiveness of the rules. Moreover, considering additional molecular features and ensuring a balanced dataset will contribute to a more robust and reliable model.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

The current set of rules aims to predict the yield of a radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction of aliphatic alcohols, influenced by various molecular modifiers. Recent analyses have revealed that while the rules exhibit high confidence and lift, they suffer from low support, indicating that they are too specific and apply to a limited subset of the dataset. This specificity may lead to overfitting, where the rules perform well on training data but fail to generalize to new, unseen data.

**Key Findings:**

- **Low Support:** The current training support is approximately **3.81%**, significantly lower than previous metrics. This suggests that the rules are too narrowly defined and do not cover enough data points to be broadly applicable.

- **High Confidence and Lift:** Despite low support, the confidence is around **68.89%**, and the lift is **1.377**, indicating that when the rules do apply, they are reasonably accurate.

- **Overfitting Indicators:** The decrease in validation accuracy to **68.57%** from previous accuracies of **76%** suggests potential overfitting or underfitting, indicating that the rules may not be capturing the underlying patterns effectively.

- **SHAP Analysis Insights:** Certain rules (notably **Rule 9**, **Rule 10**, and **Rule 12**) are contributing to incorrect predictions, as evidenced by their SHAP values in misclassified molecules. These rules are not performing as intended and may need to be revised or refined.

**Suggestions to Improve Current Rules:**

1. **Refine SMARTS Patterns for Electron-Withdrawing Groups (EWGs) in Rule 2:**

   - **Issue:** Currently, Rule 2 only accounts for nitro and bromomethyl groups at the para position.
   - **Action:** Expand the SMARTS patterns to include other strong EWGs such as halogens (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine), cyano groups, trifluoromethyl groups, and carbonyl-containing groups like aldehydes and ketones.
   - **Enhanced Pattern:** Incorporate patterns like `[cH]1ccc([F,Cl,Br,I])cc1`, `[cH]1ccc(C#N)cc1`, and `[cH]1ccc(C(=O)[CH3])cc1` to capture a broader range of EWGs.

2. **Correct SMARTS Patterns for Electron-Donating Groups (EDGs) in Rule 3:**

   - **Issue:** The current patterns may be too narrow or incorrectly specified, potentially missing key EDGs.
   - **Action:** Revise the `edg_aromatic` patterns to accurately detect EDGs such as methyl (`[cH]1ccc([CH3])cc1`), methoxy (`[cH]1ccc(OC)cc1`), hydroxy (`[cH]1ccc(O)cc1`), and sulfhydryl (`[cH]1ccc(S)cc1`) groups directly attached to the aromatic ring. Exclude amino groups as specified.
   - **Enhanced Pattern:** Use more general patterns that match any of these substituents directly attached to the aromatic ring.

3. **Generalize Patterns for Heteroaromatic Rings in Rule 5:**

   - **Issue:** The current SMARTS pattern is overly restrictive and may miss valid heteroaromatic rings.
   - **Action:** Use more general patterns to match a wider range of heteroaromatic rings attached to the carboxylic acid. For example, use `[*]1~[*]~[*]~[*]~[*]1C(=O)O` to match five-membered heteroaromatic rings and extend patterns to include six-membered rings.
   - **Benefit:** This will ensure modifiers with various heteroaromatic systems are accurately identified.

4. **Ensure Accurate Positional Isomer Recognition:**

   - **Issue:** Rules involving positional isomers (e.g., para substitution) may not accurately reflect substituent positions.
   - **Action:** Utilize recursive SMARTS or atom numbering to specify positions relative to the carboxylic acid group in the aromatic ring. This will improve the accuracy of detecting para-substituted compounds.

5. **Review and Test All SMARTS Patterns:**

   - **Action:** Conduct thorough testing of all SMARTS patterns against known examples and counter-examples from the dataset.
   - **Benefit:** This will help identify and correct any patterns that are too specific or too general, reducing false positives and negatives.

6. **Refine Rule 9 (Perfluoroalkyl Chains Predict Low Yield):**

   - **Issue:** Rule 9 is contributing to overestimation of yield in some cases.
   - **Action:** Re-evaluate the definition of perfluoroalkyl chains in this rule. Specify the length of the chain or the position of fluorine atoms to improve specificity. Exclude compounds where perfluoroalkyl groups do not negatively impact yield.

7. **Adjust Rule 10 (Carboxylic Acids with Acylated Amino Groups Predict Low Yield):**

   - **Issue:** Rule 10 sometimes predicts high yield when low yield is expected.
   - **Action:** Refine the rule to exclude modifiers that are exceptions. Incorporate additional criteria such as the nature of the acyl groups or the presence of other functional groups that may influence the yield differently.

8. **Update Rule 12 (Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Aldehyde Groups Predict Low Yield):**

   - **Issue:** Rule 12 is incorrectly contributing to high yield predictions.
   - **Action:** Modify the rule to account for the position of the aldehyde group and its interaction with other substituents. Consider excluding compounds where aldehyde groups are not detrimental to yield.

9. **Enhance Error Handling and Utilize Cheminformatics Tools:**

   - **Action:** Implement robust error handling to provide informative messages when parsing fails or pattern matching errors occur. Use cheminformatics libraries like RDKit to simplify complex pattern matching and improve maintainability.

10. **Increase Rule Support by Generalizing Conditions:**

    - **Action:** Broaden the applicability of rules by making conditions less restrictive while maintaining predictive accuracy.
    - **Benefit:** This will increase the support, ensuring that rules cover a larger portion of the dataset without sacrificing confidence.

11. **Iterative Rule Testing and Refinement:**

    - **Action:** Continuously test and refine rules using cross-validation and SHAP analysis to assess their impact on model performance.
    - **Benefit:** This iterative approach allows for gradual improvement and prevents overfitting by validating changes against unseen data.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

Yes, there is significant potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting:

- **Balancing Specificity and Generality:** By adjusting the SMARTS patterns and rule conditions, the rules can be made more general to cover more data points while avoiding overfitting to specific instances.

- **Improving Rule Accuracy:** Refining rules that currently contribute to misclassifications (e.g., Rules 9, 10, and 12) will enhance the model's predictive power and reduce errors.

- **Enhancing Model Validation:** Using cross-validation and monitoring metrics like support, confidence, lift, and leverage ensures that the model remains robust and generalizes well to new data.

- **Incorporating Additional Features:** Introducing new molecular descriptors or considering interactions between features may capture underlying patterns more effectively.

**Conclusion**

Given the above considerations, further optimization of the current rules is both possible and necessary to improve their predictive performance and general applicability.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Refine Rule 2 to include additional electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) in aromatic carboxylic acids.** Expand the SMARTS patterns in Rule 2 to detect modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong EWGs at the para position beyond nitro and bromomethyl groups. Include halogens (F, Cl, Br, I), cyano groups, trifluoromethyl groups, and carbonyl-containing groups like aldehydes and ketones. Update the rule's SMARTS patterns accordingly to match these groups.

- **Advice 2**: **Correct and generalize the SMARTS patterns for electron-donating groups (EDGs) in Rule 3.** Revise the `edg_aromatic` patterns to accurately detect EDGs such as methyl, methoxy, hydroxy, and sulfhydryl groups directly attached to the aromatic ring, excluding amino groups. Simplify or generalize the patterns to ensure they match all relevant EDGs without being overly restrictive.

- **Advice 3**: **Generalize the SMARTS patterns for heteroaromatic rings in Rule 5 to include a wider variety of heteroaromatic systems.** Modify Rule 5's patterns to match modifiers containing heteroaromatic rings directly attached to the carboxylic acid. Use more general SMARTS patterns to capture five-membered and six-membered heteroaromatic rings with various heteroatoms, ensuring that modifiers with different heteroaromatic systems are accurately identified.

- **Advice 4**: **Ensure accurate positional isomer recognition in rules involving substitution positions.** For rules that specify certain substituents at specific positions (e.g., para position in aromatic rings), use atom numbering or recursive SMARTS patterns to precisely define the position of substituents relative to the carboxylic acid group. This will improve the accuracy of rules such as Rule 2 and Rule 3.

- **Advice 5**: **Review and test all SMARTS patterns against known examples and counter-examples.** Conduct thorough testing of each rule's SMARTS patterns using the dataset, checking for both correct matches and incorrect matches (false positives and false negatives). Adjust the patterns as necessary to ensure they accurately capture the intended chemical structures without being too general or too specific.

- **Advice 6**: **Refine Rule 9 to improve specificity regarding perfluoroalkyl chains.** Reassess Rule 9 to better define perfluoroalkyl chains contributing to low yield. Specify the chain length or position of fluorine atoms to improve the rule's specificity. Exclude compounds where perfluoroalkyl groups do not negatively impact yield.

- **Advice 7**: **Adjust Rule 10 to account for modifiers with acylated amino groups that do not predict low yield.** Refine Rule 10 by incorporating additional criteria such as the nature of the acyl groups, the size of the aliphatic chain, or the presence of other functional groups that could influence yield differently. This will help prevent misclassification of modifiers where acylated amino groups do not lead to low yield.

- **Advice 8**: **Update Rule 12 to consider the position and influence of aldehyde groups in aromatic carboxylic acids.** Modify Rule 12 to include considerations for the position of the aldehyde group and its interaction with other substituents on the ring. Exclude compounds where the aldehyde group does not negatively impact yield or adjust the rule to specify that certain positions (e.g., ortho, meta) may not predict low yield.

- **Advice 9**: **Implement robust error handling and utilize cheminformatics tools for SMARTS pattern matching.** Use cheminformatics libraries such as RDKit to manage complex SMARTS patterns and improve the reliability of pattern matching. Implement error handling to provide informative messages when parsing fails or when there are pattern matching errors, aiding in debugging and pattern refinement.

- **Advice 10**: **Increase rule support by generalizing conditions while maintaining predictive accuracy.** Broaden the applicability of the rules by making conditions less restrictive where possible, without sacrificing the accuracy of predictions. For example, consider combining similar rules or expanding definitions to cover more modifiers, thereby increasing the support of the rules.

- **Advice 11**: **Conduct iterative testing and refinement of the rules using cross-validation and SHAP analysis.** Continuously test and refine the rules by applying cross-validation techniques and analyzing SHAP values to understand the impact of each rule. This will help identify rules that contribute to incorrect predictions or overfitting and allow for their adjustment or removal.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**:
Rule 1 is clear and allows for unambiguous predictions when a modifier matches the description of alpha-amino acids with free (unprotected) amino groups. The physical-chemical insight is strong, as free amino groups in alpha-amino acids may facilitate interactions in the reaction mechanism leading to high yield. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures (amino acid backbone and free amino group), adding complexity. Coverage is good, with multiple data points supporting the rule, such as L-glutamic acid, L-aspartic acid, L-tryptophan, and 5-aminopentanoic acid. Therefore, this rule scores highly on all criteria.

- **Comment 2**:
Rule 2 is clear in specifying aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position predicting high yield. The property insight is reasonable, as electron-withdrawing groups can activate the aromatic ring towards certain reactions. Complexity is moderate, involving both the aromatic ring and substituent effects. Coverage meets the criterion with examples like 4-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, though additional data points could strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 3**:
Rule 3 clearly identifies aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position predicting low yield. The property insight is sound, as electron-donating groups can deactivate the aromatic ring. Complexity is moderate, and coverage is adequate with examples such as 4-methylbenzoic acid and 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid. This rule scores well on all criteria.

- **Comment 4**:
Rule 4 specifies aromatic carboxylic acids with a free amino group at the para position predicting high yield. The rule is clear and provides adequate physical-chemical insight. Complexity is moderate due to positional specificity. Coverage is limited to one main example (4-aminobenzoic acid), so additional supporting data would enhance the rule's robustness.

- **Comment 5**:
Rule 5 states that modifiers containing heteroaromatic rings directly attached to the carboxylic acid predict high yield. The rule is clear, and the property insight is strong, considering the reactivity of heteroaromatic systems. Complexity is higher due to the inclusion of heterocycles. Coverage is adequate with examples like pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid, and 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid.

- **Comment 6**:
Rule 6 deals with aliphatic carboxylic acids with an omega-amino group, where yield depends on chain length. The rule is clear and offers good property insight by linking chain length to reactivity. Complexity is high, considering both functional group position and chain length. Coverage is strong, with data points like 5-aminopentanoic acid (high yield) and 7-aminoheptanoic acid (low yield), meeting the criteria well.

- **Comment 7**:
Rule 7 indicates that straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups predict high yield. The rule is clear but lacks complexity. The property insight is acceptable, suggesting that fewer functional groups may lead to fewer side reactions. Coverage is minimal with only one example (octanoic acid). More data points are needed to strengthen this rule.

- **Comment 8**:
Rule 8 states that modifiers with acylated amino groups or amide functionalities predict low yield. The rule is clear, and the property insight is reasonable, as acylation or amide formation can reduce the availability of active sites. Complexity is moderate, involving specific functional groups. Coverage is sufficient with examples like (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid and 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid.

- **Comment 9**:
Rule 9 specifies that modifiers containing flexible ether chains attached to the carboxylic acid predict low yield. The rule is clear, with acceptable property insight, considering that flexible chains might hinder proper interaction with the catalyst. Complexity is moderate, and coverage meets the minimum with examples such as 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid and 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid.

- **Comment 10**:
Rule 10 states that modifiers with perfluoroalkyl chains predict low yield. The rule is clear and offers reasonable property insight due to the strong electron-withdrawing nature of perfluoroalkyl groups. Complexity is low to moderate. However, coverage is limited to a single example (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), so more data points are necessary to fully support this rule.

- **Comment 11**:
Rule 11 indicates that polyhydroxy aliphatic carboxylic acids (sugar acids) predict high yield. The rule is clear, and the property insight is good, as multiple hydroxyl groups may enhance solubility or catalyst interactions. Complexity is moderate due to the presence of multiple functional groups. Coverage is limited to one example (D-gluconic acid), so additional data would strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 12**:
Rule 12 states that aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) groups attached predict low yield. The rule is clear with reasonable property insight, considering the reactivity of aldehyde groups. Complexity is moderate. Coverage includes two examples (4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid), meeting the minimum requirement.

- **Comment 13**:
Rule 13 describes modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with an aromatic ring at the gamma or delta position, especially with electron-donating groups, predicting high yield. The rule is clear but complex. The property insight is acceptable, linking structural positioning to reactivity. Complexity is high, and coverage is good with examples like 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid and 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.

- **Comment 14**:
Rule 14 states that aliphatic carboxylic acids with an aromatic ring at the beta position with electron-donating groups predict low yield. The rule is clear, and the property insight is acceptable. Complexity is moderate. However, coverage is limited to one example (3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid), so additional data points are needed.

- **Comment 15**:
Rule 15 indicates that modifiers with aromatic rings fused to heterocycles or containing multiple heteroatoms predict high yield. The rule is clear, though complex. The property insight is acceptable, considering the influence of fused rings and heteroatoms on reactivity. Complexity is high, and coverage meets the minimum with examples like L-tryptophan and 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid, but more data points would improve the rule.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: **Simplify SMARTS Patterns to Be Less Restrictive**  
  In the current SMARTS patterns for Rule 1, specific hydrogen counts (e.g., `[NX3H2]`) and atom types are used, which can be too restrictive and may not match valid molecules due to implicit hydrogen representations in SMILES. Remove explicit hydrogen counts and use more general atom definitions. For example, replace `[NX3H2]` with `[N;!$(N=*)]` to match any amino group attached to a carbon without double bonds, regardless of hydrogen count.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: **Include Tautomeric and Ionic Forms**  
  Many amino acids exist in zwitterionic forms or may be represented in different tautomeric states in SMILES. Update the SMARTS patterns to account for both protonated and deprotonated forms of functional groups. For carboxylic acids, use `[C](=O)[O,H]` to match both `[C](=O)O` and `[C](=O)[O-]`.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: **Avoid Over-Specification of Atom Connectivity**  
  For Rule 1, instead of specifying the exact number of carbons between the amino group and carboxylic acid, allow for any chain length that fits the definition of alpha-amino acids. Use recursive SMARTS or more flexible patterns like `[N;!$(N=*)][C;!$(C=*)][C](=O)[O,H]` to match amino acids with various side chains.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: **Use Aromaticity and Ring Definitions Correctly**  
  For aromatic compounds in Rules 2 and 3, ensure that aromatic atoms are correctly specified using lowercase symbols, and rings are denoted properly. For example, use `c1ccccc1` for a benzene ring and include substitutions at the correct positions.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: **Test SMARTS Patterns Against Known Examples**  
  Before finalizing the SMARTS patterns, test them against the example compounds provided in each rule to ensure they match as intended. For instance, verify that the pattern for Rule 1 matches L-phenylalanine and L-aspartic acid.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: **Include Additional Relevant Functional Groups**  
  Extend the SMARTS patterns to include other functional groups or structural features mentioned in the rules. For example, for Rule 1, consider amino acids with heterocyclic side chains or sulfur-containing groups.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: **Account for Stereochemistry When Necessary**  
  If stereochemistry is important for the rule, ensure that the SMARTS patterns include chiral specifications. However, if not critical, you may omit stereochemistry to broaden the match.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: **Enhance Pattern Matching Logic in the Code**  
  Modify the code to handle multiple patterns more effectively. Ensure that if any of the SMARTS patterns in a rule match, the molecule is considered a match. Additionally, check that exclude patterns (if any) are correctly processed.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: **Update the Code to Handle Implicit Hydrogens**  
  The current code may not account for implicit hydrogens in the molecule objects. Update the code to consider implicit hydrogens during substructure matching or adjust the SMARTS patterns accordingly.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: **Provide Clear Documentation for Each Pattern**  
  In the code, include comments or documentation explaining what each SMARTS pattern represents and why it is used, aiding future users or collaborators in understanding and maintaining the code.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: **For Rule 2**, the SMARTS pattern may not correctly capture substituents like **-CH₂Br (bromomethyl)** at the para position. The current pattern `'c1cc([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])ccc1[$([F,Cl,Br,I]),$([NX3](=O)=O)]'` only matches halogens or nitro groups directly attached to the aromatic ring. To include substituents like **bromomethyl groups**, modify the pattern to account for halomethyl substitutions. Consider changing the pattern to `'c1cc([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])ccc1[C,$(CBr)]'` to include bromomethyl groups at the para position.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: **For Rule 3**, the SMARTS pattern may not capture all types of electron-donating groups at the para position, especially when the substituent is connected via a carbon atom (e.g., methyl or methoxy groups attached through a methyl linker). The current pattern `'c1cc([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])ccc1[$([CH3]),$([OX2H]),$([OX2][CH3]),$([SX2H])]'` may miss some relevant structures. To improve coverage, consider using a more general pattern like `'c1cc([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])ccc1[*:1]'`, where `*:1` is later defined to match common electron-donating groups such as alkyl, alkoxy, or hydroxy groups, possibly with recursive SMARTS.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: **For Rule 7**, the exclude pattern `['[!#6]']` is too broad and may unintentionally exclude molecules that should match the rule. This pattern excludes any molecule containing atoms other than carbon anywhere in the structure, including in functional groups like the carboxylic acid. To precisely exclude non-carbon atoms **in the aliphatic chain only**, modify the exclude pattern to target the chain atoms specifically. For example, use `'[C;!H0][C;!H0][!#6]'`, which focuses on heteroatoms in the chain rather than in the entire molecule.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: **For Rule 5**, the SMARTS pattern `'[c;n;o;s]1cccc1[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` may not capture all heteroaromatic rings directly attached to the carboxylic acid, especially if the heteroatom is not in a five-membered ring or if the ring has different patterns of heteroatoms. Expand the pattern to include six-membered heteroaromatic rings and other common heterocycles. For example, include patterns like `'[nH]1cccc1[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` for pyrrole derivatives or use a more general pattern `'a[n,o,s]a[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` to cover various heteroaromatic systems.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: **Ensure stereochemistry does not hinder substructure matching**. The SMILES strings contain chiral centers indicated by `@` or `@@`, which may affect matching with the SMARTS patterns. When compiling the SMARTS patterns, set the `useChirality=False` option to ignore chirality during matching if stereochemistry is not relevant to the rule.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: **For Rule 6**, the pattern for chain lengths longer than five carbons in Rule 6.1 is `'[NX3;H2][CH2]{5,}[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'`. However, this may inadvertently include chains exactly five carbons long, which should predict high yield according to Rule 6. Ensure that the quantifier accurately reflects "longer than five carbons" by using `{6,}` instead of `{5,}`. So, update the pattern to `'[NX3;H2][CH2]{6,}[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'`.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: **For Rule 15**, the patterns provided (`'c1cc2ccccc2n1'`, `'c1cc2c(cc1)o[nH]c2'`) match specific compounds like indole and benzofuran derivatives but may miss other relevant structures. To generalize, consider using a broader pattern that captures aromatic rings fused to any heterocycles or containing multiple heteroatoms. For example, use `'c1ccc2nccc2c1'` to match quinoline derivatives or `'c1cc2c(cc1)[n,o,s]c2'` to match various fused heterocycles. Alternatively, include a list of patterns representing common fused systems.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: **Modify the code to allow any matching pattern to trigger a rule**, rather than requiring all patterns in a group to match simultaneously. In the current code, the logic may unintentionally require all patterns in a group to match (`group_match` may only be `True` if all patterns match). Adjust the code so that if any pattern in a group matches, the rule is considered a match. This can be achieved by initializing `group_match = False` and setting it to `True` when any pattern matches.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: **Account for ionizable groups and tautomers**. The presence of ionizable groups like carboxylic acids, which may be deprotonated in some SMILES representations, can affect substructure matching. Use SMARTS patterns that match both protonated and deprotonated forms by including tautomers or specifying both possibilities. For example, `[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]` accounts for both carboxylic acid and carboxylate forms.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: **Canonicalize SMILES and perform kekulization**. Before substructure matching, standardize the molecules by using RDKit's `MolToSmiles` with `canonical=True` and perform kekulization to ensure consistent representations. This helps in matching aromatic systems and reduces discrepancies due to different SMILES notations for the same structure.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: Adjust the SMARTS patterns for Rule 6 to account for both directions of connectivity between the amino group and the carboxylic acid. The current pattern `[NX3;H2][CH2]{1,5}[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]` only matches molecules where the amino group is at one end and the carboxylic acid at the other, missing molecules like 5-aminopentanoic acid where the carboxylic acid is at the end. Include a reversed pattern like `[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CH2]{1,5}[NX3;H2]` to capture such cases.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Correct the use of repetition operators in the SMARTS patterns. In SMARTS, `{n,}` is not valid. Use `*` for zero or more repetitions and `+` for one or more repetitions. For Rule 7, change the pattern from `[CH3][CH2]{0,}[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]` to `[CH3][CH2]*[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]` to match straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids of any length.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: Review and refine the exclude patterns for Rule 7. The current exclude pattern `[CH3][CH2]{0,}[!#6;!#1]` may inadvertently exclude all matches because it looks for any heteroatom along the chain. Ensure that the exclude pattern only excludes molecules with heteroatoms within the carbon chain, not those with functional groups at the ends. For example, use `[$([CH3][CH2]*[!#6;!#1][CH2]*[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])]` to exclude only those with heteroatoms in the chain.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: For Rule 6 and Rule 6.1, consider combining both patterns into a single pattern with a variable chain length and then use conditions within the code to assign high or low yield based on the chain length. For example, use `[NX3;H2][CH2]{1,}[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]` to match all omega-amino aliphatic carboxylic acids and programmatically check the chain length.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: Incorporate `useChirality=False` in the `HasSubstructMatch` function calls to ignore chirality unless it is specifically relevant to the rule. Stereochemistry can cause mismatches if not accounted for in SMARTS patterns.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: For Rule 5, expand the SMARTS patterns to include a wider variety of heteroaromatic rings directly attached to carboxylic acids. The current patterns may miss certain heteroaromatic systems. Consider using a more general pattern like `[c,n,o,s]1[c,n,o,s][c,n,o,s][c,n,o,s][c,n,o,s][c,n,o,s]1[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]`.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: Add comprehensive SMARTS patterns for Rule 15 to capture molecules with aromatic rings fused to heterocycles or containing multiple heteroatoms. Use patterns like `c1ccc2[n,o,s][cH][cH][cH]2c1` to match such fused systems.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Implement unit tests for each rule using known example molecules to verify that the patterns correctly match the intended structures. This will help identify any mismatches between the rules and the SMARTS patterns.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: Re-evaluate the patterns for Rules 2 and 3 to ensure they accurately represent electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups at the para position. For instance, explicitly include nitro groups in Rule 2 and methoxy groups in Rule 3.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Consider using RDKit's built-in functions or descriptors to identify functional groups instead of relying solely on SMARTS patterns. This can provide more reliable matching for complex patterns.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

After reviewing the current metrics in comparison to the reference metrics, several observations can be made regarding the performance of the current set of rules, particularly focusing on **confidence** and **lift**.

1. **Increase in Confidence:**
   - **Previous Average Train Confidence:** Approximately 0.5874 (from 0.6352 and 0.5396).
   - **Current Train Confidence:** **0.7031**.
   - **Interpretation:** The current rules have a higher confidence level, indicating that when the rule conditions are met, there is a greater probability that the prediction will also be true. This suggests improved reliability and precision of the rules.

2. **Increase in Lift:**
   - **Previous Average Train Lift:** Approximately 1.1304 (from 1.2048 and 1.0559).
   - **Current Train Lift:** **1.4043**.
   - **Interpretation:** A lift greater than 1 indicates a positive association between the rule conditions and the prediction. The increased lift signifies that the current rules are more effective at identifying instances where the prediction is true compared to random chance, highlighting a stronger association.

3. **Decrease in Support:**
   - **Previous Average Train Support:** Approximately 0.1756 (from 0.1667 and 0.1845).
   - **Current Train Support:** **0.0232**.
   - **Interpretation:** The support has significantly decreased, meaning the rules now apply to a much smaller subset of the data. While the rules are more precise, they cover fewer instances, which may limit their practical applicability.

4. **Slight Decrease in Leverage:**
   - **Previous Average Train Leverage:** Approximately 0.0124 (from 0.0289 and -0.0041).
   - **Current Train Leverage:** **0.0107**.
   - **Interpretation:** Leverage measures the improvement over random chance. While still positive, the slight decrease suggests that the added value provided by the rules has marginally diminished.

**Assessment of Progress and Iterations**

Considering the increase in confidence and lift, the current set of rules demonstrates improved predictive strength and accuracy for the instances they cover. However, the substantial decrease in support indicates that these rules are applicable to a smaller portion of the dataset. This suggests that the rules have become too specialized, potentially leading to overfitting.

A local minimum may have been reached in terms of optimizing for confidence and lift at the expense of support. The current iteration has improved certain metrics but may not provide a comprehensive solution due to limited coverage. Therefore, it's advisable to continue with further iterations to refine the rules for better balance.

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

To enhance the performance of the current rules while addressing the decreased support, consider the following strategies:

1. **Broaden Rule Conditions:**
   - **Action:** Slightly relax some of the overly specific conditions in the rules to encompass a larger portion of the data.
   - **Rationale:** This can increase support while maintaining acceptable levels of confidence and lift.

2. **Combine Similar Rules:**
   - **Action:** Identify rules that are similar or overlap in their conditions and merge them where possible.
   - **Rationale:** Combining rules can increase support and simplify the rule set without significantly compromising precision.

3. **Incorporate Additional Relevant Features:**
   - **Action:** Analyze the data for other features or patterns that could be included in the rules.
   - **Rationale:** Including more relevant variables may help capture more instances that lead to high yield, improving both support and confidence.

4. **Balance Specificity and Generality:**
   - **Action:** Re-evaluate the trade-off between rule specificity (leading to high confidence and lift) and generality (leading to higher support).
   - **Rationale:** Achieving an optimal balance ensures that the rules are both accurate and widely applicable.

5. **Validate with Test Data:**
   - **Action:** Assess the updated rules against a test dataset to ensure that the improvements generalize beyond the training data.
   - **Rationale:** This helps prevent overfitting and confirms the real-world applicability of the rules.

6. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - **Action:** Continue iterative cycles of rule adjustment, testing, and evaluation.
   - **Rationale:** Iterative refinement allows for incremental improvements and helps in finding a global optimum rather than settling for a local minimum.

**Conclusion**

While the current rules have shown improvements in confidence and lift, indicating stronger and more accurate predictions, the decrease in support is a concern that needs to be addressed. By implementing the above recommendations, we can aim to develop a rule set that not only makes accurate predictions but is also applicable to a larger portion of the data, thereby enhancing the overall performance of the catalytic analysis.

ML Commenter Message:
**Comments on Accuracies of the Validation and Training Sets:**

The current 5-fold validation performance yielded an accuracy of **68.57%**, a decrease compared to the previous validation accuracies of **76%** with test accuracies ranging from **62.5%** to **75%**. This reduction in accuracy suggests that the current set of rules used to generate the feature matrix may not be as effective as those in previous iterations. The decline indicates potential issues with model generalization or possible overfitting/underfitting problems with the new rules.

---

**Analysis Based on SHAP Values Calculated on the Validation Set:**

The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis provides insights into how each rule contributes to the prediction of high or low catalyst loading for each molecule. By examining the SHAP values, we can identify which rules are influencing the predictions, especially in cases where there is a discrepancy between predicted and experimental values.

**Overestimated Loadings (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**

Several molecules exhibit overestimated loadings, where the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low. These discrepancies highlight potential issues with certain rules contributing to incorrect high loading predictions.

     - **Rule 9:** +0.0918
     - **Rule 3:** +0.0245
     - **Rule 13:** +0.0246

In these cases, **Rule 9** consistently exhibits the highest positive SHAP values, suggesting it significantly contributes to the incorrect prediction of high loading for molecules that experimentally show low loading.

**Underestimated Loadings (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**

The data provided does not present clear instances where the model underestimates loading (predicted low, experimental high). Therefore, the focus should be on addressing the overestimations identified.

---

**Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting:**

The decrease in validation accuracy from previous iterations indicates that the model may be **underfitting**, failing to capture the underlying patterns in the data effectively with the current rules. The observed overestimations suggest that certain rules are too broadly defined or improperly applied, leading to incorrect predictions across multiple molecules.

---

**Interpretation of Accuracy Improvements:**

Given the decrease in accuracy, the current set of rules does not improve the model's predictive capabilities. Instead, they may have introduced more errors by incorrectly influencing the predictions, as observed with Rule 9's contribution to overestimations.

---

**Deriving Insights from SHAP Analysis:**

The SHAP analysis highlights that **Rule 9**, and to a lesser extent **Rule 3**, are contributing positively to high loading predictions in molecules where the experimental results indicate low loading. This misalignment suggests that these rules may be incorrectly formulated or overly inclusive, leading to misclassification.

---

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

1. **Refine Rule 9:**

   - **Issue Identified:** Rule 9 is intended to predict **low yield** for modifiers containing flexible ether chains attached to the carboxylic acid. However, it's contributing positively to high loading predictions in molecules with low experimental loadings.
   - **Suggested Actions:**
     - **Review the Structural Definition:** Ensure that Rule 9 accurately captures only those molecules with flexible ether chains directly influencing the carboxylic acid's behavior.
     - **Narrow the Scope:** Consider adding more specific criteria to the rule, such as the length of the ether chain or the position of the ether linkage relative to the carboxylic acid group.
     - **Exclude Confounding Structures:** Identify and exclude molecules that are being wrongly classified under Rule 9 due to partial matches in their structure but do not possess the properties leading to low yield.

2. **Adjust Rule 3:**

   - **Issue Identified:** Rule 3 predicts **low yield** for aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position but is contributing to high loading predictions in some cases.
   - **Suggested Actions:**
     - **Re-express the Rule's Conditions:** Double-check the implementation to ensure that electron-donating groups are correctly identified and that their positions are accurately determined.
     - **Differentiate Substituents:** Consider the varying effects of different electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl vs. methoxy vs. hydroxy) on yield and adjust the rule to reflect these nuances.
     - **Add Exceptions or Subrules:** Create subrules to account for molecules where electron-donating groups at certain positions do not lead to low yield, refining the rule's predictive capability.

3. **Examine Rule 13:**

   - **Observation:** Rule 13 contributes positively to high loading predictions in overestimated cases.
   - **Suggested Actions:**
     - **Clarify Structural Requirements:** Ensure that Rule 13 accurately identifies aliphatic carboxylic acids with aromatic rings substituted at the gamma or delta positions, with electron-donating groups.
     - **Consider Electron-Withdrawing Effects:** Evaluate whether electron-withdrawing groups on the aromatic ring affect the yield differently and adjust the rule accordingly.

4. **Enhance Rule Specificity:**

   - **Avoid Overlapping Rules:** Ensure that molecule classifications are mutually exclusive where appropriate to prevent conflicting contributions from multiple rules.
   - **Incorporate Additional Chemical Knowledge:** Use domain expertise to refine rules based on known chemical behaviors and interactions that affect catalyst loading.

5. **Improve Model Generalization:**

   - **Reduce Overfitting:** Simplify overly complex rules that may be fitting to specific cases but do not generalize well to new data.
   - **Increase Training Data Diversity:** If possible, expand the dataset to include more examples that challenge the current rules, aiding in the development of more robust rules.

6. **Iterative Testing and Validation:**

   - **Retrain and Validate:** After adjusting the rules, retrain the model and assess performance using cross-validation to ensure that modifications lead to genuine improvements.
   - **Monitor SHAP Contributions:** Continue using SHAP analysis to verify that rules contribute appropriately and adjust further if necessary.

7. **Address Potential Misclassifications:**

   - **Investigate Outliers:** Analyze molecules with high discrepancies individually to determine if there are unique features not captured by existing rules.
   - **Update or Add New Rules:** Develop new rules to account for patterns observed in misclassified molecules that are not covered by current rules.

---

**Conclusion:**

The reduction in model accuracy and the insights from the SHAP analysis indicate that the current rules, particularly **Rule 9** and **Rule 3**, may be inaccurately influencing predictions. By refining these rules to more precisely capture the chemical features that correlate with catalyst loading, we can improve model performance. Iterative refinement—guided by both statistical analysis and chemical expertise—is essential to enhance the predictive accuracy and generalizability of the model.

---

**Action Plan:**

- **Step 1:** Review and modify Rule 9 and Rule 3 based on the recommendations.
- **Step 2:** Retrain the model with the updated rules.
- **Step 3:** Perform cross-validation and assess the new model's accuracy.
- **Step 4:** Conduct SHAP analysis on the updated model to verify that rule contributions align with expected chemical behavior.
- **Step 5:** Repeat the iterative process as needed, incorporating additional refinements and validations.

By systematically addressing the identified issues and refining the rules, we aim to improve the model's ability to accurately predict catalyst loading, thereby advancing the research program's objectives.

1. **Increased Confidence and Lift, but Decreased Support**:
   - The current rules exhibit higher **confidence** (0.7031) and **lift** (1.4043) compared to previous iterations. This indicates that when the rules apply, they are more predictive of high yield.
   - However, there is a significant decrease in **support** (0.0232), meaning the rules now cover a smaller portion of the dataset. This suggests that the rules have become too specialized, potentially leading to overfitting.

2. **Decrease in Validation Accuracy**:
   - The 5-fold cross-validation accuracy has dropped to **68.57%** from previous values of **76%**. This decline suggests that the current rules may not generalize well to new data and may be overfitting to the training set.

3. **SHAP Analysis Highlights Misclassifications**:
   - The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis indicates that certain rules, particularly **Rule 9** and **Rule 3**, are contributing significantly to incorrect predictions.
   - These rules are causing overestimations of yield, predicting high yield for modifiers that experimentally result in low yield.

4. **Potential Overfitting and Underfitting**:
   - The decrease in support and validation accuracy, along with misclassifications, suggests that the model may be overfitting to specific patterns in the data.
   - Simultaneously, the model may be underfitting by failing to capture broader patterns that generalize across the dataset.

**Suggestions to Improve Current Rules**

To address these issues and optimize the current rules, the following suggestions are proposed:

1. **Refine Rule 9** (Modifiers containing flexible ether chains predict low yield):

   - **Issue Identified**: Rule 9 is contributing to incorrect high yield predictions for molecules that experimentally show low yield.
   - **Actions**:
     - **Review Structural Definitions**: Ensure that the SMARTS pattern for Rule 9 accurately captures only those molecules with flexible ether chains directly influencing the carboxylic acid's reactivity.
     - **Specify Chain Length and Position**: Modify the rule to include criteria for the length of the ether chain and its precise position relative to the carboxylic acid group.
     - **Exclude Confounding Structures**: Adjust the rule to prevent it from matching molecules where ether chains do not negatively impact the yield.

2. **Revise Rule 3** (Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position predict low yield):

   - **Issue Identified**: Rule 3 is incorrectly contributing to high yield predictions in some cases.
   - **Actions**:
     - **Ensure Accurate Identification of Substituents**: Verify that the SMARTS pattern correctly identifies electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxy) and their positions.
     - **Differentiate Between Substituents**: Recognize that different electron-donating groups may have varying effects on yield and adjust the rule to reflect these nuances.
     - **Refine or Split the Rule**: Consider dividing Rule 3 into subrules to handle different substituents more precisely.

3. **Adjust Rule Definitions for Consistency**:

   - **Address Rule Overlaps**: Ensure that rules are mutually exclusive where appropriate to prevent conflicting contributions to predictions.
   - **Combine Similar Rules**: Identify and merge rules that cover similar chemical features to increase support while maintaining high confidence.

4. **Broaden Rule Conditions Carefully**:

   - **Increase Support Without Losing Precision**: Slightly relax overly specific rule conditions to encompass a larger portion of the dataset while being cautious not to introduce inaccuracies.
   - **Balance Specificity and Generality**: Find an optimal balance where rules are neither too specific (leading to overfitting) nor too general (leading to underfitting).

5. **Improve SMARTS Pattern Accuracy**:

   - **Correct Repetition Operators**: Ensure the correct use of repetition operators in SMARTS patterns (use `*` for zero or more repetitions and `+` for one or more).
   - **Include Reverse Connectivity**: For rules like Rule 6, include patterns that account for both directions of connectivity between functional groups.

6. **Utilize RDKit's Functionalities**:

   - **Use Built-in Functions**: Leverage RDKit's built-in functions or descriptors to identify functional groups, which can provide more reliable matching than SMARTS patterns alone.
   - **Set `useChirality=False`**: Unless chirality is specifically relevant, setting `useChirality=False` can prevent mismatches due to stereochemistry.

7. **Implement Unit Testing for Rules**:

   - **Validate Rule Performance**: Create unit tests with known example molecules to verify that each rule correctly matches intended structures.
   - **Identify and Correct Errors**: Use these tests to detect mismatches between rules and their SMARTS patterns and correct them accordingly.

8. **Re-evaluate and Expand Rules**:

   - **Expand Rule Coverage**: For rules like Rule 5 and Rule 15, expand SMARTS patterns to include a wider variety of relevant structures (e.g., various heteroaromatic systems).
   - **Incorporate Additional Features**: Consider including other relevant chemical features or descriptors that may impact yield.

9. **Iterative Refinement and Validation**:

   - **Retrain the Model**: After making adjustments, retrain the model and assess its performance using cross-validation to ensure improvements generalize.
   - **Monitor SHAP Contributions**: Use SHAP analysis to verify that rules are contributing appropriately to predictions and make further adjustments if necessary.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

There is a strong possibility for further optimization of the current rules without leading to overfitting. By addressing the specific issues identified with certain rules (notably Rule 9 and Rule 3), refining SMARTS patterns, and carefully broadening rule conditions, we can improve both the accuracy and applicability of the model. Implementing the suggestions above should help increase support while maintaining or enhancing confidence and lift, ultimately leading to a more robust and generalizable model.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **
- ** Advice 1 **: **Review and Correct the Implementation of Rule 3 and Rule 9**

  - **Action**: Examine the SMARTS patterns and code implementation for **Rule 3** and **Rule 9** to ensure they correctly predict **low yield** as intended.
    - For **Rule 3** (Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position predicting low yield):
      - Verify that the SMARTS pattern accurately identifies electron-donating groups (e.g., `-OH`, `-OCH3`, `-CH3`, `-SH`) at the **para position** relative to the carboxylic acid.
      - Ensure that the rule is not erroneously predicting **high yield** due to incorrect pattern matching or logical errors in the code.
    - For **Rule 9** (Modifiers containing flexible ether chains predict low yield):
      - Confirm that the SMARTS pattern correctly matches molecules with **flexible ether chains attached to the carboxylic acid**, and not other unrelated structures.
      - Correct any implementation errors that may cause the rule to predict **high yield** incorrectly.

- ** Advice 2 **: **Refine Rule 3 by Differentiating Electron-Donating Groups**

  - **Action**: Split **Rule 3** into subrules to handle different electron-donating substituents more precisely.
    - Create separate rules for different substituents:
      - **Rule 3a**: Aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-donating groups (e.g., `-OH`, `-OCH3`) at the para position predict **low yield**.
      - **Rule 3b**: Aromatic carboxylic acids with weak electron-donating groups (e.g., `-CH3`) at the para position may have a less significant effect on yield; consider **moderate or context-dependent yield**.
    - Adjust SMARTS patterns accordingly to differentiate between these groups.

- ** Advice 3 **: **Refine Rule 9 by Specifying Ether Chain Length and Position**

  - **Action**: Modify **Rule 9** to include criteria for the length and position of the ether chain relative to the carboxylic acid.
    - Specify that only modifiers with **long flexible ether chains (e.g., three or more ether units)** directly attached to the carboxylic acid predict **low yield**.
    - Adjust the SMARTS pattern to match ether chains of specific lengths:
      - Example SMARTS pattern: `OCCOCCOC(=O)` for long ether chains attached to the carboxylic acid.
    - Exclude molecules where short ether chains or ether groups distant from the carboxylic acid do not negatively impact yield.

- ** Advice 4 **: **Improve SMARTS Patterns for Accuracy**

  - **Action**: Review and correct SMARTS patterns across all rules to ensure accuracy and proper matching.
    - Use correct repetition operators:
      - Use `*` for zero or more repetitions (e.g., `C*` matches zero or more carbons).
      - Use `+` for one or more repetitions (e.g., `C+` matches one or more carbons).
    - Include reverse connectivity where applicable to capture all relevant structures.
    - Ensure that atom mapping numbers and ring closures are used correctly.

- ** Advice 5 **: **Utilize RDKit's Built-in Functional Group Identification**

  - **Action**: Leverage RDKit's `Chem.Fragments` and `rdMolDescriptors` modules to identify functional groups.
    - Use functions like `rdMolDescriptors.CalcNumAromaticRings()`, `Chem.Fragments.fr_ether()`, etc., to detect features.
    - Replace overly complex SMARTS patterns with these functions to reduce errors and improve reliability.

- ** Advice 6 **: **Set `useChirality=False` in Substructure Searches**

  - **Action**: Modify substructure search functions to set `useChirality=False` unless chirality is specifically relevant.
    - This prevents mismatches due to stereochemistry when chirality does not influence the reaction outcome.

- ** Advice 7 **: **Implement Unit Testing for Each Rule**

  - **Action**: Create unit tests with known example molecules for each rule.
    - Include molecules that should match the rule (positive cases) and those that should not (negative cases).
    - Use these tests to validate that the SMARTS patterns and code logic correctly apply the rules.
    - Example:
      - For **Rule 3**, test that `4-methylbenzoic acid` matches and predicts **low yield**, while `benzoic acid` does not match the rule.

- ** Advice 8 **: **Adjust Rule Definitions for Consistency and Overlaps**

  - **Action**: Review all rules to identify and resolve overlaps or contradictions.
    - Ensure that rules are mutually exclusive where appropriate to prevent conflicting predictions.
    - Combine similar rules to increase dataset coverage:
      - Merge **Rule 5** and **Rule 15** if they cover similar heteroaromatic systems predicting **high yield**.
    - Clarify rule hierarchies, so that more specific rules take precedence over general ones.

- ** Advice 9 **: **Broaden Rule Conditions Carefully to Increase Support**

  - **Action**: Relax overly specific rule conditions slightly to cover more data without sacrificing accuracy.
    - For example, in **Rule 7** (Straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups predict high yield):
      - Consider including short-chain aliphatic acids, not just octanoic acid, to increase support.
    - Ensure that the relaxation does not introduce misclassifications.

- ** Advice 10 **: **Re-evaluate and Expand Rules to Include Additional Features**

  - **Action**: Identify chemical features not currently captured by existing rules and create new rules as needed.
    - Analyze misclassified molecules to find common features that could be the basis for new rules.
    - Example:
      - If certain modifiers with specific heterocycles predict high yield, add a new rule to capture this.
    - Expand existing SMARTS patterns to include close analogs of known high-yield modifiers.

- ** Advice 11 **: **Retrain the Model and Validate Performance**

  - **Action**: After implementing the above changes, retrain the model and assess its performance.
    - Use 5-fold cross-validation to evaluate accuracy, support, confidence, and lift.
    - Monitor SHAP values to ensure that rules contribute appropriately to predictions.
    - Continue iterative refinement based on validation results.

- ** Advice 12 **: **Document and Standardize Rule Implementation**

  - **Action**: Maintain clear documentation of each rule, its purpose, SMARTS pattern, and examples.
    - Use a standardized format for rules to facilitate maintenance and updates.
    - Include comments in the code to explain complex SMARTS patterns or logic.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**:

  **Rule 1** is clear, specifying that modifiers which are α-amino acids with free (unprotected) amino groups predict high yield. It demonstrates strong property insight by linking the presence of amino and carboxylic acid groups to the reaction's outcome. The rule considers a combination of functional groups, adding to its complexity. Supported by multiple data points (entries 0, 2, 3, 14), it has good coverage and balances complexity with predictability.

- **Comment 2**:

  **Rule 2** clearly states that aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position predict high yield. This rule provides property insight into how electron-withdrawing groups influence reactivity. It has appropriate complexity by combining aromatic structure with specific substituents. Supported by at least two data points (entries 1 and 20), it meets the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 3**:

  **Rule 3** effectively identifies that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position predict low yield. The rule is clear and grounded in chemical understanding of electron-donating effects. It considers combinations of structures and substituents, adding complexity. With support from at least three data points (entries 10, 22, 30), it has adequate coverage.

- **Comment 4**:

  **Rule 4** predicts high yield for modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with a free amino group at the para position. While clear and insightful regarding the role of amino groups, it is supported by only one data point (entry 4). This lack of coverage limits the confidence in the rule's general applicability.

- **Comment 5**:

  **Rule 5** states that modifiers containing heteroaromatic rings directly attached to the carboxylic acid predict high yield. It is clear and offers property insight into the effects of heteroatoms in aromatic systems. The rule has suitable complexity and is supported by multiple data points (entries 8, 15, 21), demonstrating good coverage.

- **Comment 6**:

  **Rule 6** provides a clear relationship between chain length and yield for aliphatic carboxylic acids with an omega-amino group. It offers property insight into how chain length affects reactivity and considers functional group positioning, adding complexity. Supported by data points for both high (entry 3) and low yields (entries 31, 34), it has strong coverage.

- **Comment 7**:

  **Rule 7** predicts high yield for straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups. While the rule is clear, it is supported by only one data point (entry 5: octanoic acid), which does not satisfy the coverage criterion. This limits the rule's reliability.

- **Comment 8**:

  **Rule 8** identifies that modifiers with acylated amino groups or amide functionalities predict low yield. It is clear and provides property insight into how these groups may hinder reactivity. The rule combines structural features, enhancing complexity. Supported by multiple data points (entries 23, 26, 33), it meets the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 9**:

  **Rule 9** states that modifiers containing flexible ether chains attached to the carboxylic acid predict low yield. The rule is clear and offers insight into the steric and electronic effects of ether chains. With support from at least two data points (entries 11 and 32), it satisfies the coverage criterion and has appropriate complexity.

- **Comment 10**:

  **Rule 10** predicts low yield for modifiers with perfluoroalkyl chains. Despite being clear and offering property insight into the electron-withdrawing effects of perfluoroalkyl groups, it is supported by only one data point (entry 13). Therefore, it lacks sufficient coverage.

- **Comment 11**:

  **Rule 11** states that polyhydroxy aliphatic carboxylic acids (sugar acids) predict high yield. While the rule provides property insight into the role of multiple hydroxyl groups, it is supported by only one data point (entry 9). This insufficient coverage weakens the rule's applicability.

- **Comment 12**:

  **Rule 12** predicts low yield for aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) groups attached to the aromatic ring. The rule is clear and considers the electron-withdrawing nature of formyl groups. Supported by two data points (entries 18 and 19), it meets the coverage criterion and has appropriate complexity.

- **Comment 13**:

  **Rule 13** indicates that aliphatic carboxylic acids with an aromatic ring substituted at the gamma (γ) or delta (δ) position, especially with electron-donating groups, predict high yield. The rule is clear and offers property insight into the influence of aromatic substitution on reactivity. With support from multiple data points (entries 7, 24, 25), it has strong coverage and balances complexity with effectiveness.

- **Comment 14**:

  **Rule 14** states that modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with an aromatic ring substituted at the beta (β) position, containing electron-donating groups, predict low yield. While the rule is clear and provides property insight, it is supported by only one data point (entry 30). This lack of coverage limits its reliability.

- **Comment 15**:

  **Rule 15** predicts high yield for modifiers with aromatic rings fused to heterocycles or containing multiple heteroatoms. The rule is clear, considers complex molecular structures, and offers substantial property insight. Supported by at least two data points (entries 14 and 16), it satisfies the coverage criterion.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Implement Positional Matching for Substituents**  
  The current code does not handle the positions of substituents on aromatic rings, especially for rules that specify substituents at the **para** position (Rules 2, 3, 4, and 12). To fix this:
  - Modify the SMARTS patterns to specify the **para** position relative to the carboxylic acid group. For example, for para-substituted benzoic acid, use a pattern like `'c1cc([CX3](=O)[OX1H1])cc([Substituent])c1'`.
  - Implement logic in the code to map and verify that the substituent is at the para position with respect to the carboxylic acid group. This can be done by identifying the atom indices of the carboxylic acid and substituent and ensuring they are positioned correctly on the ring.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Revise SMARTS Pattern for Rule 1 to Match All α-Amino Acids**  
  The SMARTS pattern for Rule 1 is too restrictive and doesn't account for side chains, especially those containing aromatic or heterocyclic rings (e.g., phenylalanine, tryptophan). Update the pattern to:
  - Allow for any side chain connected to the α-carbon. Use a pattern like `'[NX3H2][CX4H]([#6])[CX3](=O)[OX1H1]'` to include various side chains.
  - Ensure the pattern matches α-amino acids with different substituents at the α-carbon.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Handle Chain Lengths Accurately in Rules 6 and 6.1**  
  The patterns for Rules 6 and 6.1 do not accurately capture the intended chain lengths of aliphatic carboxylic acids with omega-amino groups. To correct this:
  - For Rule 6 (chain ≤ 5 carbons), use `'[NX3H2][CH2]{m}[CX3](=O)[OX1H1]'` where `m=3` for a total of 5 carbons (including the carboxylic acid carbon).
  - For Rule 6.1 (chain > 5 carbons), use `'[NX3H2][CH2]{4,}[CX3](=O)[OX1H1]'` ensuring that the pattern matches chains with more than 5 carbons.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Incorporate Position-Specific Substructure Searches in Code**  
  Since some rules require substituents at specific positions, the code should be enhanced to:
  - Use `Chem.GetSubstructMatches()` to find all matches of the main pattern.
  - Iterate over these matches and check the positions of substituents relative to the main functional group.
  - For example, in Rule 2, after finding the aromatic carboxylic acid, check if an EWG is attached to the carbon atom that is **para** to the carboxylic acid group.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Adjust Patterns for Electron-Withdrawing and Electron-Donating Groups**  
  The code currently checks for EWGs and EDGs anywhere in the molecule, not specifically at the required positions. To fix this:
  - Modify the sub-pattern matching to only consider substituents attached directly to the aromatic ring at the specified positions.
  - Use atom mapping or specify SMARTS patterns that include both the ring and the substituent at the correct position.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Enhance SMARTS Patterns to Consider Functional Group Variations**  
  Some SMARTS patterns may be too simplistic and miss important functional group variations. Suggestions include:
  - For Rule 5 (heteroaromatic rings), broaden the patterns to include different heteroatoms and ring sizes.
  - For Rule 15 (fused aromatic rings), include patterns that capture various fused ring systems with heteroatoms.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Test and Validate Each SMARTS Pattern Individually**  
  Before using the patterns in the code, individually test them against known compounds to ensure they match the intended structures. Use tools like RDKit's `MolViewer` or external chemical databases.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Implement Error Handling and Logging**  
  Ensure that the code gracefully handles molecules that cannot be parsed or matched. Add logging to capture parsing errors or mismatches for debugging purposes.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Consider Stereochemistry Where Relevant**  
  Some rules may depend on stereochemistry (e.g., Rule 1 with L-amino acids). Update the SMARTS patterns to include stereochemical specifications if necessary, or use RDKit's stereochemistry features.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Review and Correct the Exclude Patterns in Rule 7**  
  In Rule 7, the exclude pattern `'[!#6;!H]'` may not be working as intended. Review and adjust it to properly exclude heteroatoms and ensure the pattern matches straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: Reframe the rules using **computationally identifiable structural features** directly extractable from SMILES strings. Replace qualitative descriptions with specific substructures or functional groups that can be detected using cheminformatics tools. For example, define electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups using standard chemical terms that correspond to identifiable substructures.

- **Advice 2**: Implement **SMARTS patterns** in the rules to represent the chemical features of modifiers. SMARTS allows for the specification of substructural patterns in molecules, making it easier to programmatically search for specific functional groups or motifs within SMILES strings.

- **Advice 3**: **Quantify functional groups** and molecular properties to create a **numerical feature matrix**. Develop descriptors such as counts of amino groups, carboxylic acids, aromatic rings, chain lengths, and presence of specific substituents. These descriptors can be computed directly from SMILES strings and used for quantitative analysis.

- **Advice 4**: Group modifiers based on **easily computable physicochemical properties** like LogP (octanol-water partition coefficient), topological polar surface area (TPSA), and molecular weight. These properties can be derived from SMILES and may correlate with the reaction yield, aiding in rule refinement.

- **Advice 5**: Simplify rules by focusing on **key functional groups** that significantly impact yield. For instance, specify rules based on the presence of free amino groups, carboxylic acids, aldehydes, or electron-withdrawing/donating substituents at specific positions, which can be directly identified from SMILES.

- **Advice 6**: Use **hierarchical clustering** or **principal component analysis (PCA)** on the computed numerical features to identify patterns and relationships between modifiers and yields. This can help in refining the rules and making them more data-driven.

- **Advice 7**: Incorporate **machine learning models** to correlate the numerical features extracted from SMILES with the reaction yields. Techniques like decision trees or random forests can help in identifying the most significant features, leading to more precise and predictive rules.

- **Advice 8**: Update the rules to specify **chain lengths** numerically, such as "Modifiers with aliphatic chains of five carbons or fewer with terminal amino groups predict high yield," which can be directly measured from SMILES by counting carbon atoms in the chain.

- **Advice 9**: For rules involving positional substituents (e.g., para, meta positions), define the rules in terms of **ring substitution patterns** that can be identified via SMILES parsing. Specify the exact positions using numbering that aligns with SMILES notation.

- **Advice 10**: Eliminate ambiguous terms like "flexible ether chains" and replace them with precise structural descriptors, such as "Modifiers containing aliphatic ether linkages of the form R-O-CH2-CH2-OH predict low yield," which can be searched for in SMILES strings.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: **Rule 1** is clear and well-defined, specifying that modifiers which are **α-amino acids with free (unprotected) amino groups**, including both mono- and di-carboxylic acids, predict **high yield**. The rule is supported by multiple data points—entries 0, 2, and 14—all of which have high yields, satisfying the **coverage** criterion. The **property insight** is strong, as the presence of free amino groups in α-amino acids could facilitate coordination with the Fe catalyst, enhancing the reaction. The **complexity** is appropriate, considering specific functional groups in combination. Overall, Rule 1 effectively meets all criteria.

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 2** clearly states that modifiers which are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (excluding aldehyde groups) at the para position** predict **high yield**. It is supported by entries 1 and 20, both showing high yields, thus satisfying the **coverage** requirement. The **property insight** is adequate, as electron-withdrawing groups can influence the electron density of the aromatic ring, potentially enhancing catalytic interactions. The rule's **complexity** is balanced, considering both the aromatic system and substituent effects.

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 3** indicates that modifiers which are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position** predict **low yield**, except when the group is a **free amino group**. The rule is clear but includes an exception, adding **complexity**. It is supported by entries 10 and 22 (low yield) and entry 4 (high yield due to the exception), meeting the **coverage** criterion. The **property insight** is solid, relating the electronic effects of substituents to the reaction outcome.

- **Comment 4**: **Rule 4** specifies that modifiers which are **aromatic carboxylic acids with a free amino group at the para position** predict **high yield**. While clear, this rule is somewhat redundant, as it serves as the exception noted in Rule 3. This redundancy could affect **clarity** and may be streamlined by integrating it into Rule 3 to avoid confusion.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** describes that **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids where the carboxyl group is directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring** predict **high yield**. Supported by entries 8, 15, and 21—all with high yields—the rule satisfies the **coverage** criterion. The **property insight** is meaningful, as heteroatoms in the ring could play a role in catalytic activity. The **complexity** is appropriate, considering specific molecular structures.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** states that modifiers which are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids where the heteroaromatic ring is attached to a benzene ring** predict **low yield**. The rule is clear but is only supported by a single data point (entry 12), which limits its **coverage**. Additional data would strengthen this rule's validity.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** outlines that **aliphatic carboxylic acids with an omega-amino group** predict yield based on chain length: **high yield** for chains of five carbons or fewer, and **low yield** for longer chains. Supported by entries 3 (high yield), 31, and 34 (both low yield), the rule meets the **coverage** criterion. The **property insight** is solid, linking chain length to reactivity, and the **complexity** is appropriate.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** posits that **straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups** predict **high yield**. While clear, it is supported by only one data point (entry 5), which limits its **coverage**. More supporting data would enhance the rule's robustness.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** indicates that modifiers containing **flexible ether chains attached to the carboxylic acid** predict **low yield**. It is clear and supported by entries 11 and 32, satisfying the **coverage** criterion. The **property insight** is acceptable, as flexible chains might hinder effective catalyst interaction. The **complexity** is balanced.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** states that modifiers with **acylated amino groups or amide functionalities connected to an aromatic ring** predict **low yield**. Supported by entries 23, 26, and 33, all with low yields, the rule meets the **coverage** criterion. The **property insight** is adequate, considering how these functionalities might affect reactivity. The **complexity** is appropriate.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** mentions that modifiers with **perfluoroalkyl chains** predict **low yield**. While clear, it is only supported by a single data point (entry 13), limiting its **coverage**. Additional examples are needed to strengthen this rule.

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** indicates that modifiers which are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) groups attached to the aromatic ring** predict **low yield**. Supported by entries 18 and 19, both with low yields, it meets the **coverage** criterion. The rule is clear, and the **property insight** is sound, as aldehyde groups can be reactive and may interfere with the catalyst.

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13** states that modifiers which are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with an aromatic ring substituted at the gamma (γ) or delta (δ) position**, especially with **electron-donating groups** on the ring, predict **high yield**. With entries 7, 24, and 25 supporting it, the rule satisfies the **coverage** criterion. It is clear and provides good **property insight** into how the position and substituents affect reactivity. The **complexity** is appropriate, considering the combination of structural features.

- **Comment 14**: **Rule 14** suggests that modifiers which are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with an aromatic ring substituted at the beta (β) position**, where the ring has **electron-donating groups**, predict **low yield**. The rule is clear but is only supported by one data point (entry 30), limiting **coverage**. Combining this rule with Rule 13 and refining the structural criteria could improve both **clarity** and **coverage**.

- **Comment 15**: **Rule 15** states that modifiers with **fused aromatic and heterocyclic rings directly attached to the carboxylic acid** predict **high yield**. Supported by only one data point (entry 16), the rule lacks sufficient **coverage**. More examples are needed to confirm its validity.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: For **Rule 1**, the SMARTS pattern used is too restrictive and does not account for the variable side chain (R group) present in α-amino acids. The current pattern `'[NX3;H2][C;H1]([#1])[C](=O)[O;H1,-1]'` misses most α-amino acids because it doesn't allow for any side chain. To fix this, modify the SMARTS pattern to include any side chain attached to the alpha carbon. A suggested pattern is `'[NX3;H2][CH]([*])[C](=O)[O;H1,-1]'`, which represents a primary amine connected to a carbon (alpha carbon) with any substituent (the side chain), connected to a carboxylic acid.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: For **Rules 2, 3, and 4**, the functions `apply_rule2`, `apply_rule3`, and `apply_rule4` currently return hardcoded values and do not perform actual substructure searches. Implement proper SMARTS patterns and logic within these functions to accurately identify electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) and electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position of an aromatic ring. Use SMARTS patterns to define common EWGs (e.g., nitro `[N+](=O)[O-]`, cyano `[C]#[N]`) and EDGs (e.g., methoxy `[OCH3]`, hydroxy `[OH]`), and use atom mapping to ensure they are at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid group.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: In **Rule 7**, the `apply_rule7` function always returns `1`, regardless of the chain length between the omega-amino group and the carboxylic acid. Update this function to calculate the carbon chain length between the amino group and the carboxylic acid. If the chain length is five carbons or fewer (≤5), return `1` (high yield); if it is longer than five carbons (>5), return `-1` (low yield).

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Review and refine the SMARTS patterns for **all rules** to ensure they accurately reflect the natural language descriptions. For example, in **Rule 5**, the pattern `'[a][C](=O)[O;H1,-1]'` may match both heteroaromatic and simple aromatic rings. Modify it to exclude simple aromatics by specifying heteroatoms in the ring, such as `'[$(n),$(o),$(s)]1cccc1[C](=O)[O;H1,-1]'`.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: Implement unit tests for each rule using the provided example molecules. For each rule, create test cases with molecules that should match (positive examples) and molecules that should not match (negative examples). This will help validate that the SMARTS patterns and functions are working as intended.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Utilize RDKit's advanced features to handle positional isomerism and functional group detection. For positional specificity (e.g., para substitution in **Rules 2, 3, and 4**), use atom mapping and specify relative positions in the SMARTS patterns. For example, use `'c1cc([C](=O)[O;H1,-1])ccc1[$(N),$(O)]'` to find para-substituted carboxylic acids with specific functional groups.

Metric Commenter Message:
After analyzing the current rule metrics in comparison to the previous metrics, several observations can be made regarding the performance of the current rules, focusing specifically on **confidence** and **lift**.

---

**1. Confidence Analysis:**

- **Previous Metrics (Train Confidence):**
  - **Rule 1:** 63.52%
  - **Rule 2:** 53.96%
- **Current Metrics (Train Confidence):**
  - **Iteration 1:** 68.89%
  - **Iteration 2:** 70.31%
  - **Iteration 3:** 59.63%

**Observation:**

- The current rules show an improvement in train confidence during the first two iterations, reaching up to **70.31%**, which is higher than the previous metrics.
- The third iteration shows a slight decrease to **59.63%**, but it remains within a comparable range to the previous rules.

**Interpretation:**

- Higher confidence indicates that when the rule conditions are met, there is a greater likelihood that the predicted outcome (high yield or low yield) is correct.
- The initial increase suggests that the current rules are more reliable in predicting the outcomes compared to the previous rules.

---

**2. Lift Analysis:**

- **Previous Metrics (Train Lift):**
  - **Rule 1:** 1.2048
  - **Rule 2:** 1.0559
- **Current Metrics (Train Lift):**
  - **Iteration 1:** 1.3772
  - **Iteration 2:** 1.4043
  - **Iteration 3:** 1.2027

**Observation:**

- The lift values in the current iterations are consistently higher than those in the previous metrics.
- The lift reaches up to **1.4043** in the second iteration, indicating a strong association between the rule conditions and the predicted outcomes.

**Interpretation:**

- A lift greater than 1 indicates that the rule is better at predicting the outcome than random chance.
- The increased lift suggests that the current rules are more informative and have stronger predictive power.

---

**3. Support Analysis (Contextual):**

- **Previous Metrics (Train Support):**
  - **Rule 1:** 16.67%
  - **Rule 2:** 18.45%
- **Current Metrics (Train Support):**
  - **Iteration 1:** 3.81%
  - **Iteration 2:** 2.32%
  - **Iteration 3:** 5.71%

**Observation:**

- The support for the current rules is lower compared to the previous rules.
- This indicates that the current rules apply to a smaller portion of the data.

**Interpretation:**

- While higher confidence and lift are positive, the lower support suggests that the rules might be too specific.
- There is a trade-off between the generality of a rule (applying to more data) and its predictive accuracy.

---

**4. Leverage Analysis (Contextual):**

- **Previous Metrics (Train Leverage):**
  - **Rule 1:** 0.0289
  - **Rule 2:** -0.0041
- **Current Metrics (Train Leverage):**
  - **Iteration 1:** 0.0130
  - **Iteration 2:** 0.0107
  - **Iteration 3:** 0.0037

**Observation:**

- The positive leverage values indicate a stronger association than expected by chance.
- The leverage in current rules is lower than that of Rule 1 in previous metrics but higher than Rule 2.

**Interpretation:**

- The leverage values corroborate the findings from the confidence and lift analyses.
- Although the leverage is lower, it remains positive, supporting the validity of the rules.

---

**5. Recommendations for Improvement:**

- **Expand Rule Applicability:**
  - **Review Rule Specificity:** Consider generalizing some overly specific rules to increase support without significantly reducing confidence and lift.
  - **Combine Similar Rules:** Identify rules that predict the same outcome and have similar conditions; combining them may increase support.
- **Balance Between Support and Confidence:**
  - **Optimize Rule Conditions:** Adjust the rule conditions to include more data points while maintaining a high confidence level.
  - **Analyze Low-Support Rules:** Re-evaluate rules with very low support to determine if they are contributing meaningfully to the model.
- **Incorporate Additional Data Features:**
  - **Feature Engineering:** Introduce new features or descriptors that might capture more general patterns in the data.
  - **Address Exceptions:** Investigate instances where the rules fail to predict accurately to refine the conditions.
- **Continuous Validation:**
  - **Cross-Validation:** Use cross-validation techniques to ensure the rules perform well on unseen data.
  - **Monitor Overfitting:** Be cautious of rules that perform exceptionally well on training data but poorly on test data.

---

**6. Conclusion:**

- The current rules demonstrate **improved confidence and lift**, indicating better predictive accuracy compared to previous rules.
- The reduced support suggests that the rules may be too narrow and not broadly applicable.
- By refining the rules to balance specificity with generality, we can enhance their overall performance.
- Continued iteration and validation are essential to optimize the rules and achieve better outcomes in the catalytic program.

---

**Next Steps:**

- **Collaborative Review:** Engage with other agents to review the current rules and identify areas for generalization.
- **Data Augmentation:** Consider collecting additional data to increase the support for specific rules.
- **Rule Testing:** Implement the suggested improvements and re-evaluate the metrics to measure progress.

**Performance Analysis of Current Rules**

**1. Evaluation of Effectiveness**

The performance of the current rules has decreased compared to previous iterations. The validation accuracy has dropped from an average of **0.76** in the reference data to **0.6286** in the latest iteration. This suggests that the current set of rules is less effective in accurately predicting the loading of modifiers on the catalyst.

**Previous Accuracies for Reference:**

- Validation Accuracies: [0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]; Test Accuracy: 0.75
- Validation Accuracies: [0.76, 0.68, 0.72, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]; Test Accuracy: 0.75
- Validation Accuracies: [0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]; Test Accuracies: 0.625

**Current Accuracies:**

- Validation Accuracy: **0.6286**

The decrease in validation accuracy indicates that the model's ability to generalize to unseen data has diminished, suggesting that the current rules are not capturing the underlying patterns effectively.

**2. Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting**

The consistent decrease in validation accuracy without significant differences between training and validation accuracies suggests that the model may be **underfitting**. The rules may not be complex enough or may be missing critical features necessary to capture the relationships in the data.

**3. Analysis of Discrepancies Using SHAP Values**

By examining the SHAP values for instances where the predicted loading does not match the experimental value, we can identify problematic rules.

**Overestimated Loadings (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**

- **Molecule:** C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O
  - **Rules Contributing to Overestimation:**
    - **Rule 9** SHAP value: 0.0901
    - **Rule 3** SHAP value: 0.0473
    - **Rule 13** SHAP value: 0.0248

- **Molecule:** C(CCCC(=O)O)CCCN
  - **Rules Contributing to Overestimation:**
    - **Rule 9** SHAP value: 0.0901
    - **Rule 3** SHAP value: 0.0473
    - **Rule 13** SHAP value: 0.0248

- **Molecule:** CC1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=O)O
  - **Rules Contributing to Overestimation:**
    - **Rule 3** SHAP value: -0.4762 (Exceptionally negative, but the molecule is predicted high when it is experimentally low)
    - **Rule 9** SHAP value: 0.0331
    - **Rule 1** SHAP value: -0.0673

**Observations:**

- **Rule 9**, which predicts **low yield** for modifiers containing flexible ether chains, is contributing positively to the prediction of **high loading** in cases where the experimental loading is low.
- **Rule 3**, which predicts **low yield** for aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position (except free amino groups), shows conflicting SHAP values.
  - In some cases, it contributes negatively but with a high magnitude, possibly indicating overfitting.
- **Rule 13**, which predicts **high yield** for aliphatic carboxylic acids with an aromatic ring substituted at the gamma (γ) or delta (δ) position with electron-donating groups, is contributing to overestimation.

**Underestimated Loadings (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**

- There are fewer instances of underestimation, but we observe that for molecules where this occurs, rules with negative SHAP values may be overly penalizing certain features.

**4. Interpretation of Accuracy Improvements**

The decline in validation accuracy suggests that the probability of improvement using the current rules is low. The adjustments made in the rules may have introduced noise or removed essential features, leading to decreased performance.

**5. Insights from SHAP Analysis**

The SHAP analysis highlights specific rules that consistently contribute to mispredictions:

- **Rule 9**: Its positive SHAP values in overestimated loadings suggest it may be misclassifying modifiers as high yield when they are low.
- **Rule 3**: The highly negative SHAP value in some cases indicates it may be over-penalizing certain molecules, leading to incorrect predictions.
- **Rule 13**: While intended to predict high yield, it may be too broadly defined, capturing molecules that do not align with experimental results.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

**1. Refine Rule 9**

- **Issue Identified:**
  - **Rule 9** predicts **low yield** for modifiers containing flexible ether chains, but SHAP analysis shows it contributing to overestimations.
- **Suggested Refinement:**
  - **Clarify and Narrow the Scope:**
    - Specify the length and position of ether chains that lead to low yield.
    - Exclude cases where ether chains are part of ring structures or are adjacent to functional groups that alter their effect.
  - **Re-express the Rule:**
    - "Modifiers containing flexible ether chains longer than three atoms attached to the carboxylic acid predict low yield."

**2. Adjust Rule 3**

- **Issue Identified:**
  - **Rule 3** shows inconsistent SHAP values, sometimes highly negative, which may lead to over-penalization.
- **Suggested Refinement:**
  - **Reevaluate Electron-Donating Groups:**
    - Assess whether all electron-donating groups should predict low yield or if certain groups (e.g., hydroxyl) have different effects.
  - **Introduce Sub-Rules:**
    - Separate the influence of different electron-donating groups.
    - For example, "Aromatic carboxylic acids with a para-hydroxy group predict moderate yield."

**3. Reassess Rule 13**

- **Issue Identified:**
  - **Rule 13** may be too general, causing overestimation in molecules that do not exhibit high experimental yield.
- **Suggested Refinement:**
  - **Add Specificity:**
    - Include conditions on the type of electron-donating groups and their positions.
    - Consider steric factors that may impact the yield.
  - **Modify the Rule:**
    - "Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with an aromatic ring substituted at the gamma (γ) or delta (δ) position, where the aromatic ring contains specific electron-donating groups (e.g., methoxy), predict high yield."

**4. Eliminate or Modify Rules Leading to Conflicting Predictions**

- **Rules to Evaluate:**
  - **Rule 1**: While generally contributing positively, its negative SHAP values in some mispredictions suggest a review.
  - **Rule 12**: If it consistently contributes to discrepancies, consider refining or removing it.

**5. Address Overfitting/Underfitting**

- **Reduce Overfitting:**
  - Simplify rules that are overly complex or too narrowly defined.
  - Remove redundant rules that do not contribute new information.
- **Reduce Underfitting:**
  - Introduce new rules based on chemical intuition and data analysis to capture missing patterns.
  - Ensure rules cover the diversity of the dataset.

**6. Validate Rule Implementations**

- **Check for Errors:**
  - Ensure that the rules are correctly implemented in the feature matrix.
  - Verify that the descriptors accurately represent the intended chemical features.

**7. Incorporate Additional Data**

- **Enhance Dataset:**
  - If possible, include more experimental data to provide a better basis for rule refinement.
- **Use Statistical Methods:**
  - Employ statistical analyses or machine learning techniques to identify patterns not captured by the current rules.

**8. Iterative Refinement**

- **Continuous Improvement:**
  - After implementing changes, re-evaluate the model's performance.
  - Use SHAP analysis in each iteration to identify remaining issues.
- **Collaborative Review:**
  - Discuss proposed changes with the team to incorporate diverse expertise.

**Conclusion**

The current set of rules is not sufficiently effective, as indicated by the decreased validation accuracy and insights from the SHAP analysis. By refining problematic rules, particularly those contributing to overestimations, and enhancing the specificity and coverage of rules, we can improve the model's predictive performance. Continuous evaluation and iterative refinement, guided by both data-driven insights and chemical understanding, are essential for developing a robust predictive model.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

The current set of rules for predicting the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction has shown decreased performance compared to previous iterations. The validation accuracy has dropped from an average of approximately 76% to around 62.86%, indicating that the rules are not effectively capturing the underlying patterns necessary for accurate predictions. Several key issues have been identified through the analysis of rule metrics, SHAP values, and model performance:

1. **Specificity and Coverage**: Some rules are too specific, resulting in low support (applying to a small portion of the data), while others are too general, leading to decreased predictive accuracy.

2. **Implementation Errors**: Certain rules are not properly implemented, either due to overly restrictive or incorrect SMARTS patterns, or placeholder functions that do not perform the intended chemical substructure searches.

3. **Conflicting Contributions**: SHAP analysis reveals that some rules contribute conflictingly to the predictions, leading to misclassifications. Rules such as Rule 3, Rule 9, and Rule 13 have been identified as contributing to overestimations or underestimations of yield.

**Suggestions to Improve Current Rules**

To address these issues and optimize the current rules, the following suggestions are proposed:

1. **Refine SMARTS Patterns and Implementation**

   - **Rule 1**: Modify the SMARTS pattern to account for variable side chains in α-amino acids. Use a pattern like `'[NX3;H2][CH]([*])[C](=O)[O;H1,-1]'` to include any side chain attached to the alpha carbon.
   
   - **Rules 2, 3, and 4**: Implement proper SMARTS patterns to accurately identify electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) and electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position of aromatic rings. Utilize specific SMARTS patterns for common EWGs (e.g., nitro, cyano) and EDGs (e.g., methoxy, hydroxy) and ensure correct positional matching relative to the carboxylic acid group.

   - **Rule 5**: Adjust the SMARTS pattern to specifically target heteroaromatic carboxylic acids by excluding simple aromatic rings. For example, use a pattern like `'[$(n),$(o),$(s)]1cccc1[C](=O)[O;H1,-1]'` to match heterocycles.

   - **Overall**: Review and refine the SMARTS patterns for all rules to ensure they match the intended chemical structures accurately.

2. **Improve Rule Functions**

   - Replace placeholder functions with code that performs actual substructure searches using RDKit or similar cheminformatics tools.
   
   - Ensure that the functions return correct values based on the presence or absence of the targeted substructures.

3. **Adjust Rule Specificity**

   - **Rule 3**: Reevaluate the scope of electron-donating groups and consider separating the influence of different groups. For example, hydroxyl groups may have a different effect on yield compared to methyl groups.

   - **Rule 7**: Implement logic to calculate the carbon chain length between the amino group and the carboxylic acid. Modify the rule to return high yield for chains ≤5 carbons and low yield for chains >5 carbons.

   - **Rule 9**: Clarify the scope by specifying the length and position of ether chains that lead to low yield. Exclude cases where ether chains are part of ring structures or adjacent to functional groups that alter their effect.

   - **Rule 13**: Add specificity regarding the type of electron-donating groups and their positions on the aromatic ring. Consider steric factors and limit the rule to certain substituents known to positively influence yield.

4. **Eliminate or Modify Problematic Rules**

   - Review rules that consistently contribute to mispredictions, such as Rules 9, 3, and 13, and adjust or remove them based on their impact on model performance.

5. **Implement Unit Tests and Validation**

   - Develop unit tests for each rule using provided example molecules to verify that they match intended structures and return correct predictions.

   - Use cross-validation techniques to assess the performance of rules and prevent overfitting.

6. **Balance Rule Generality and Specificity**

   - Aim for a balance between rules that are too narrow (low support) and too broad (low confidence). Adjust rules to increase support while maintaining or improving confidence and lift.

7. **Utilize Advanced Cheminformatics Features**

   - Leverage RDKit’s advanced functionalities to handle positional isomerism and functional group detection.
   
   - Use atom mapping and relative position specification in SMARTS patterns to accurately identify substitution patterns on aromatic rings.

8. **Continuous Iteration and Collaboration**

   - Engage in collaborative review of the rules to incorporate diverse chemical expertise.
   
   - Iteratively refine rules based on model performance metrics and SHAP analysis after each adjustment.

**Possibility for Further Optimization**

Given the identified issues and the proposed suggestions for improvement, there is significant potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. Refining the rules as outlined will likely enhance the model's ability to accurately predict yields and generalize to new data.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Refine and Correct SMARTS Patterns in Rules**

  - **Rule 1**: Modify the SMARTS pattern to account for variable side chains in α-amino acids with free (unprotected) amino groups. Replace the current pattern with one that matches any α-amino acid.

    - **Current Issue**: The SMARTS pattern is too specific, matching only certain α-amino acids.

    - **Improvement**: Use a more general pattern to include any side chain attached to the alpha carbon.

      ```python
      # Original pattern (too specific):
      smarts = '[NX3;H2][CH](C)[C](=O)[O;H1,-1]'

      # Revised pattern (generalized side chain):
      smarts = '[NX3;H2][CH]([*!H])[C](=O)[O;H1,-1]'
      ```

    - **Explanation**: The `[*!H]` allows for any side chain (except hydrogen) attached to the α-carbon, capturing all α-amino acids with free amino groups.

  - **Rules 2, 3, and 4**: Implement accurate SMARTS patterns to detect electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) and electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids.

    - **Rule 2**: For aromatic carboxylic acids with strong EWGs (excluding aldehyde groups) at the para position predicting high yield.

      - **Improvement**: Create specific SMARTS patterns for common EWGs at the para position.

        ```python
        # Example pattern for nitro group at para position:
        smarts = 'c1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc1C(=O)[O;H1,-1]'

        # General pattern for strong EWGs (excluding aldehydes) at para position:
        smarts = 'c1ccc([!#1;a;$(N(=O)=O),$(C#N),$(S(=O)(=O)O[H])]cc1)C(=O)[O;H1,-1]'
        ```

      - **Explanation**: The pattern includes nitro (`N(=O)=O`), cyano (`C#N`), and sulfonic acid (`S(=O)(=O)O[H]`) groups at the para position.

    - **Rule 3 and 4**: For EDGs at the para position predicting low yield, except when the group is a free amino group predicting high yield.

      - **Improvement**:

        ```python
        # Rule 3 (EDGs at para position excluding amino group):
        smarts = 'c1ccc([!N;!$(O[H]);!$(S[H]);R0])cc1C(=O)[O;H1,-1]'

        # Rule 4 (Free amino group at para position predicting high yield):
        smarts = 'c1ccc(N)cc1C(=O)[O;H1,-1]'
        ```

      - **Explanation**: The first pattern excludes amino groups, matching other EDGs like methyl or methoxy. The second pattern specifically matches a free amino group at the para position.

  - **Rule 5**: Adjust the SMARTS pattern to specifically target heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring.

    - **Improvement**:

      ```python
      smarts = '[n,o,s]1cccc1C(=O)[O;H1,-1]'
      ```

    - **Explanation**: This pattern matches heteroaromatic rings (containing nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur) directly attached to a carboxylic acid group.

- **Advice 2**: **Implement Accurate Rule Functions Using RDKit**

  - **Issue**: Placeholder functions or incorrect implementation can lead to erroneous predictions.

  - **Improvement**:

    - Replace placeholder functions with RDKit-based substructure search functions.

    - **Example Implementation**:

      ```python
      from rdkit import Chem

      def Rule_X(mol):
          pattern = Chem.MolFromSmarts('SMARTS_PATTERN')
          return mol.HasSubstructMatch(pattern)
      ```

    - **Ensure**:

      - The molecule (`mol`) is an RDKit Mol object.

      - The function correctly returns `True` if the pattern matches (predicting high yield) or `False` otherwise.

  - **Action Items**:

    - Go through each rule and verify the function implementation.

    - Test each function with known molecules to confirm correct behavior.

- **Advice 3**: **Adjust Rule Specificity and Coverage**

  - **Rule 3**: Reevaluate the scope of electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position.

    - **Issue**: Different EDGs may have varying effects on yield.

    - **Improvement**:

      - Separate the rule into sub-rules for different EDGs.

      - **Example**:

        - **Rule 3a**: Para-substituted with methyl or methoxy groups predicting low yield.

          ```python
          smarts = 'c1ccc([CH3, OCH3])cc1C(=O)[O;H1,-1]'
          ```

        - **Rule 3b**: Para-substituted with hydroxy or sulfhydryl groups may have different effects; consider creating a separate rule after analyzing their impact.

  - **Rule 7**: Implement logic to calculate the carbon chain length between the amino group and the carboxylic acid.

    - **Improvement**:

      - Use bond traversal to count the number of carbons in the chain.

      - **Example Implementation**:

        ```python
        def Rule_7(mol):
            patterns = [
                '[NH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2]C(=O)O',  # 5-carbon chain
                '[NH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2]C(=O)O'  # 6-carbon chain
            ]
            pattern_5 = Chem.MolFromSmarts(patterns[0])
            pattern_6 = Chem.MolFromSmarts(patterns[1])
            if mol.HasSubstructMatch(pattern_5):
                return True  # High yield
            elif mol.HasSubstructMatch(pattern_6):
                return False  # Low yield
            else:
                # Add additional logic for other chain lengths
                pass
        ```

    - **Note**: Generalize the pattern to account for varying chain lengths.

  - **Rule 9**: Clarify and specify the definition of "flexible ether chains attached to the carboxylic acid."

    - **Improvement**:

      - Define the position and length of the ether chains that lead to low yield.

      - **SMARTS Pattern Example**:

        ```python
        smarts = 'C(=O)OCCOCCO'  # Represents an ether chain connected to the carboxylic acid
        ```

    - **Action Items**:

      - Analyze the dataset to determine the impact of different ether chain lengths and positions.

      - Adjust the rule accordingly.

- **Advice 4**: **Review and Modify Problematic Rules**

  - **Rule 9**: If this rule leads to consistent mispredictions, consider refining it.

    - **Improvement**:

      - Reassess the chemical rationale behind the rule.

      - Modify the SMARTS pattern to more accurately reflect the structures that lead to low yield.

  - **Rule 13**: Add specificity regarding the position of the aromatic ring and nature of substituents.

    - **Issue**: The rule may be too broad or too narrow.

    - **Improvement**:

      - Specify the positions (γ or δ) using SMARTS patterns that reflect the correct distance from the carboxylic acid.

      - Include conditions for electron-donating groups on the aromatic ring.

- **Advice 5**: **Implement Unit Tests for Rule Validation**

  - **Action Items**:

    - Create unit tests for each rule using molecules from the dataset as test cases.

    - **Example**:

      ```python
      def test_Rule_X():
          mol_positive = Chem.MolFromSmiles('SMILES_STRING_FOR_POSITIVE_TEST')
          mol_negative = Chem.MolFromSmiles('SMILES_STRING_FOR_NEGATIVE_TEST')
          assert Rule_X(mol_positive) == True
          assert Rule_X(mol_negative) == False
      ```

    - **Benefits**:

      - Ensures each rule functions as intended.

      - Quickly identifies issues in rule implementation.

- **Advice 6**: **Balance Rule Generality and Specificity**

  - **Issue**: Overly specific rules have low support; overly general rules may reduce accuracy.

  - **Improvement**:

    - Analyze each rule's support (number of molecules it applies to) and confidence (accuracy when it applies).

    - Adjust rules to increase support without sacrificing confidence.

  - **Action Items**:

    - Merge similar rules where appropriate.

    - Split rules that cover too broad a range of structures.

- **Advice 7**: **Leverage Advanced Cheminformatics Features**

  - **Utilize RDKit's capabilities**:

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with free (unprotected) amino groups**, including both mono- and di-carboxylic acids, predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Free amino groups can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (L-Glutamic acid)
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (L-Aspartic acid)
    - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (L-Tryptophan)

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halomethyl) at the para position** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups can enhance binding to the metal center and stabilize reaction intermediates.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
    - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxy, sulfhydryl) at the para position** predict a **low yield**, except when the substituent is a **free amino group**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups may reduce the ability of the modifier to coordinate with the metal center.
  - *Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 4-methylbenzoic acid
      - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
    - **Exception (High Yield)**:
      - 4-aminobenzoic acid (due to the free amino group enhancing coordination)

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids where the carboxyl group is directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Heteroatoms in the ring can participate in coordination with metal centers.
  - *Examples*:
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids where the heteroaromatic ring is attached to a benzene ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Steric hindrance from the additional benzene ring may impede effective coordination.
  - *Example*:
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with an omega-amino group**, predict yield based on carbon chain length:
  - **High Yield** when the carbon chain is **five carbons or fewer** (≤5 carbons).
    - *Rationale*: Short chains reduce steric hindrance, allowing effective coordination via the amino group.
    - *Example*:
      - 5-aminopentanoic acid
  - **Low Yield** when the carbon chain is **longer than five carbons** (>5 carbons).
    - *Rationale*: Longer chains introduce steric bulk, hindering coordination.
    - *Examples*:
      - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
      - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Lack of interfering groups allows unhindered coordination with the catalyst.
  - *Example*:
    - Octanoic acid

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxy, ether) on the carbon chain** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Polar groups may interfere with catalyst interaction or solubility.
  - *Examples*:
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **amide or acylated amino groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide groups may reduce coordination ability due to resonance stabilization.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) groups attached to the ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups may participate in side reactions or deactivate the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers containing **perfluoroalkyl chains** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Perfluoroalkyl groups are highly electron-withdrawing and may disrupt catalyst interactions.
  - *Example*:
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with an aromatic ring substituted at the gamma (γ) or delta (δ) position**, especially if the aromatic ring contains **electron-donating groups**, predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The aromatic ring may enhance π-π interactions or provide additional coordination sites.
  - *Examples*:
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
    - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with an aromatic ring substituted at the beta (β) position**, predict a **low yield**, even if the aromatic ring has electron-donating groups.
  - *Rationale*: Closer proximity of the aromatic ring may cause steric hindrance or electronic effects that interfere with coordination.
  - *Example*:
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with **fused aromatic and heterocyclic rings directly attached to the carboxylic acid** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Fused rings may enhance coordination through extended conjugation.
  - *Example*:
    - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with sulfhydryl (thiol) groups attached to the ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Thiol groups can bind irreversibly to metal centers, potentially deactivating the catalyst.
  - *Example*:
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: **Rule 1** exhibits excellent **clarity** by precisely defining modifiers as α-amino acids with free (unprotected) amino groups, including both mono- and di-carboxylic acids. The **property insight** is strong, as the rationale explains how free amino groups can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity. The rule demonstrates adequate **complexity** by considering the combination of an α-amino acid structure with free amino groups. With at least three data points supporting the rule—(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid, (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid, and (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid—it achieves good **coverage** and maintains a proper **balance** between complexity and applicability.

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 2** is clear in specifying aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position predicting high yield. The **property insight** is solid, highlighting how electron-withdrawing groups enhance binding to the metal center. The rule is straightforward yet effective, capturing necessary **complexity** by focusing on specific substituents. With two data points (4-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid) validating the rule, it has acceptable **coverage**.

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 3** maintains **clarity** by detailing that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position predict a low yield, with an exception for free amino groups. This exception adds **complexity** and reflects a nuanced understanding of the modifiers. The **property insight** is thoughtful, explaining how electron-donating groups may reduce coordination ability, whereas free amino groups enhance it. Multiple data points support the rule, including low yields for 4-methylbenzoic acid and 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid, and a high yield for the exception, 4-aminobenzoic acid, demonstrating good **coverage**.

- **Comment 4**: **Rule 4** provides clear guidance by focusing on heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the ring, predicting high yield. The **property insight** is logical, as heteroatoms can coordinate with metal centers. The rule encompasses sufficient **complexity** by targeting specific structural features, and it is supported by three data points—pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, and 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid—indicating strong **coverage**.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** is clear in its description but lacks sufficient **coverage**, relying on a single data point: 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid predicting a low yield. While the **property insight** regarding steric hindrance is plausible, the rule would benefit from additional data points to enhance its validity and **balance**.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** is well-defined and offers good **clarity** by correlating yield with the carbon chain length of aliphatic carboxylic acids with omega-amino groups. The **property insight** is sound, explaining how chain length affects steric hindrance and coordination. The rule appropriately handles **complexity** by distinguishing between short and long chains. It has strong **coverage** with multiple data points: high yield for 5-aminopentanoic acid (≤5 carbons) and low yields for 7-aminoheptanoic acid and 8-aminooctanoic acid (>5 carbons).

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** demonstrates **clarity** by identifying straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups as predictors of high yield. The **property insight** is acceptable, emphasizing unhindered coordination. However, the **coverage** is limited, with only one supporting data point (octanoic acid). To improve the **balance**, more examples should be included to validate the rule.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** provides clear structural criteria and a logical **property insight** into how polar functional groups may interfere with catalyst interaction. The rule exhibits appropriate **complexity** by considering the presence of specific polar groups. It has good **coverage**, supported by data points such as 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, and 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid, all predicting low yield.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** is clear and offers strong **property insight**, explaining how amide or acylated amino groups may reduce coordination ability. The rule effectively addresses **complexity** by focusing on specific functional groups that alter reactivity. It has good **coverage**, with examples including (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid, and 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid predicting low yield.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** maintains **clarity** in defining modifiers with aldehyde groups attached to aromatic rings predicting low yield. The **property insight** is credible, considering the potential for side reactions. The rule has sufficient **coverage** with two data points: 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid. The **complexity** is appropriate for its purpose.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** is clear but has limited **coverage**, relying on a single data point (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid). While the **property insight** about perfluoroalkyl chains disrupting catalyst interactions is valid, additional examples are needed to strengthen the rule's **balance** and applicability.

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** exhibits good **clarity** and provides insightful **property** reasoning by linking aromatic ring substitution at the γ or δ position to enhanced interactions. The rule handles **complexity** effectively by considering both the position and nature of substituents. It has excellent **coverage**, supported by data points such as 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid, and 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid, all predicting high yield.

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13** is clear but suffers from limited **coverage**, with only one data point (3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid) predicting low yield. The **property insight** regarding steric hindrance at the β position is reasonable, but more data are necessary to confirm the rule's validity and improve the **balance**.

- **Comment 14**: **Rule 14** has a clear structural description and plausible **property insight** about fused rings enhancing coordination. However, the **coverage** is minimal, with only one example (1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid) predicting high yield. To strengthen the rule, additional supporting data points are needed.

- **Comment 15**: **Rule 15** is clear in its focus on aromatic carboxylic acids with sulfhydryl groups predicting low yield. The **property insight** is solid, as thiol groups can deactivate catalysts. However, the rule overlaps with **Rule 3** regarding 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid and has limited **coverage** with only one data point. Clarifying the distinction between the rules and incorporating more data would improve its **balance** and utility.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with free (unprotected) amino groups**, including both mono- and di-carboxylic acids, predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Free amino groups can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (L-Glutamic acid)
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (L-Aspartic acid)
    - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (L-Tryptophan)

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halomethyl) at the para position** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups can enhance binding to the metal center and stabilize reaction intermediates.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
    - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxy, sulfhydryl) at the para position** predict a **low yield**, except when the substituent is a **free amino group**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups may reduce the ability of the modifier to coordinate with the metal center.
  - *Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 4-methylbenzoic acid
      - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
    - **Exception (High Yield)**:
      - 4-aminobenzoic acid (due to the free amino group enhancing coordination)

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids where the carboxyl group is directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Heteroatoms in the ring can participate in coordination with metal centers.
  - *Examples*:
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids where the heteroaromatic ring is attached to a benzene ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Steric hindrance from the additional benzene ring may impede effective coordination.
  - *Example*:
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with an omega-amino group**, predict yield based on carbon chain length:
  - **High Yield** when the carbon chain is **five carbons or fewer** (≤5 carbons).
    - *Rationale*: Short chains reduce steric hindrance, allowing effective coordination via the amino group.
    - *Example*:
      - 5-aminopentanoic acid
  - **Low Yield** when the carbon chain is **longer than five carbons** (>5 carbons).
    - *Rationale*: Longer chains introduce steric bulk, hindering coordination.
    - *Examples*:
      - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
      - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Lack of interfering groups allows unhindered coordination with the catalyst.
  - *Example*:
    - Octanoic acid

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxy, ether) on the carbon chain** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Polar groups may interfere with catalyst interaction or solubility.
  - *Examples*:
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **amide or acylated amino groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide groups may reduce coordination ability due to resonance stabilization.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) groups attached to the ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups may participate in side reactions or deactivate the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers containing **perfluoroalkyl chains** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Perfluoroalkyl groups are highly electron-withdrawing and may disrupt catalyst interactions.
  - *Example*:
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with an aromatic ring substituted at the gamma (γ) or delta (δ) position**, especially if the aromatic ring contains **electron-donating groups**, predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The aromatic ring may enhance π-π interactions or provide additional coordination sites.
  - *Examples*:
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
    - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with an aromatic ring substituted at the beta (β) position**, predict a **low yield**, even if the aromatic ring has electron-donating groups.
  - *Rationale*: Closer proximity of the aromatic ring may cause steric hindrance or electronic effects that interfere with coordination.
  - *Example*:
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with **fused aromatic and heterocyclic rings directly attached to the carboxylic acid** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Fused rings may enhance coordination through extended conjugation.
  - *Example*:
    - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with sulfhydryl (thiol) groups attached to the ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Thiol groups can bind irreversibly to metal centers, potentially deactivating the catalyst.
  - *Example*:
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: In the code for **Rule 2**, the SMARTS pattern for detecting electron-withdrawing groups (EWG) at the para position is incomplete. The current pattern `"[c][c]([F,Cl,Br,I,N+](=O)[O-])[c][c][c][c]"` only captures nitro groups and halogens directly attached to the ring but misses halomethyl groups like bromomethyl. Modify the pattern to include halomethyl substituents by detecting a halomethyl group at the para position. For example, use `"[c][c]([CX4][F,Cl,Br,I])[c][c][c][c]"` to capture halomethyl groups attached to the ring.
- ** Suggestion 2 **: Enhance the EWG detection in **Rule 2** by including other strong electron-withdrawing groups such as cyano (`-C#N`), trifluoromethyl (`-CF3`), and sulfonyl (`-SO2R`). Adjust the SMARTS pattern to account for these groups at the para position. For example: `"[c][c]([CX3](=[OX1])[OX1H0])[c][c][c][c]"` for esters or `[c][c]([#6]#[NX1])[c][c][c][c]"` for cyano groups.
- ** Suggestion 3 **: For **Rule 2**, consider separating the detection of the aromatic carboxylic acid and the EWG at the para position to allow for flexibility in matching. Use a two-step check: first, confirm the presence of an aromatic carboxylic acid (`"[c][c]([CX3](=O)[OX2H1])[c][c][c][c]"`), and then check for the EWG at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid group.
- ** Suggestion 4 **: In **Rule 5**, the SMARTS pattern may not accurately detect heteroaromatic rings attached to a benzene ring. The current pattern `"[c][c]1[c][c][c][c][c]1[n,o,s]"` may not match molecules where the heteroaromatic ring is fused with the benzene ring differently. Refine the pattern to accurately capture heteroaromatic rings attached to benzene rings, considering various fusion patterns.
- ** Suggestion 5 **: For **Rule 6**, ensure that the differentiation between modifiers with carbon chain lengths ≤5 and >5 is correctly implemented. The current patterns may not accurately count the carbon atoms in the chain. Use SMARTS patterns that specify the exact chain lengths, such as `"[NX3;H2][CH2]{0,4}[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]"` for chains with 5 carbons or fewer, and `"[NX3;H2][CH2]{5,}[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]"` for chains longer than 5 carbons.
- ** Suggestion 6 **: In **Rule 7**, the exclude pattern `"[!#6]"` may not function as intended because it matches any non-carbon atom anywhere in the molecule, which could inadvertently exclude valid modifiers. Restrict the exclude pattern to the side chain only, for example, by specifying `"[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CH2]{4,}[!#6]"` to check for heteroatoms in the aliphatic chain beyond the carboxylic acid group.
- ** Suggestion 7 **: For **Rule 15**, ensure that the pattern `"[c][SX2H]"` correctly identifies thiol groups attached to aromatic rings. Consider adding aromaticity constraints and check for possible tautomeric forms. Additionally, confirm that the carboxylic acid group is present by combining patterns appropriately.
- ** Suggestion 8 **: Implement thorough testing of the SMARTS patterns against the provided examples in each rule to validate that the patterns match all intended cases. Adjust patterns based on any mismatches discovered during testing.
- ** Suggestion 9 **: Consider using more advanced cheminformatics tools or methods, such as recursive SMARTS or SMARTS with atom mapping, to capture more complex structural features described in the rules.
- ** Suggestion 10 **: Provide detailed comments and documentation within the code for each SMARTS pattern to explain the logic and ensure future maintainability and ease of understanding for collaborators.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify and Quantify Electronic Effects**: Replace qualitative terms like "strong electron-withdrawing groups" or "electron-donating groups" with quantifiable electronic descriptors such as Hammett sigma constants, computed partial charges, or electronegativity values. This quantification allows for the creation of numerical features that can be directly used in modeling.

- **Advice 2**: **Standardize Steric Descriptors**: Instead of specifying chain length qualitatively (e.g., "carbon chain is five carbons or fewer"), use exact counts or steric parameters like molar volume or topological steric index. This makes it easier to encode steric effects numerically.

- **Advice 3**: **Utilize Molecular Descriptors**: Incorporate calculated molecular descriptors (e.g., LogP, molecular weight, TPSA, number of hydrogen bond donors/acceptors) into the rules. These descriptors can be computed from SMILES strings and included in a numerical feature matrix.

- **Advice 4**: **Employ Substructure Fingerprints**: Use cheminformatics tools to generate substructure or molecular fingerprints (e.g., MACCS keys, Morgan fingerprints) from SMILES. Modify the rules to identify the presence or absence of specific substructures associated with high or low yields, which can be readily encoded numerically.

- **Advice 5**: **Rephrase Exception-Based Rules**: For rules with exceptions (e.g., Rule 3), rephrase them to reduce complexity. Instead of noting exceptions, define the rule based on the presence of functional groups and their positions, which can be detected and quantified computationally.

- **Advice 6**: **Combine Similar Rules**: Merge rules that are similar in nature to reduce redundancy and simplify the rule set. For example, combine rules dealing with aromatic carboxylic acids by distinguishing modifiers based on their substituents' electronic nature and position on the ring.

- **Advice 7**: **Incorporate QSAR Modeling**: Transition from a rule-based approach to a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model. Use statistical methods to correlate numerical molecular descriptors with reaction yields, providing a more nuanced and predictive model.

- **Advice 8**: **Automate Descriptor Calculation**: Utilize software tools (e.g., RDKit, Open Babel) to automate the calculation of molecular descriptors from SMILES strings for all modifiers. This ensures consistency and speeds up the generation of the numerical feature matrix.

- **Advice 9**: **Validate and Refine Rules with Data**: Use the provided dataset to statistically validate each rule. Assess the predictive power of each rule and refine or eliminate those that do not correlate well with the experimental data.

- **Advice 10**: **Develop a Decision Tree Model**: Create a decision tree or random forest model using the dataset to identify key features influencing yield. This model can help reveal complex interactions and guide the refinement of the rules into a more accurate predictive framework.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **ω-amino aliphatic carboxylic acids**, predict yield based on carbon chain length:
  - **High Yield** when the carbon chain is **five carbons or fewer** (≤5 carbons).
    - *Rationale*: Short-chain ω-amino acids allow the amino group to coordinate effectively without significant steric hindrance.
    - *Example*:
      - 5-aminopentanoic acid
  - **Low Yield** when the carbon chain is **longer than five carbons** (>5 carbons).
    - *Rationale*: Longer chains introduce steric bulk, hindering effective coordination with the metal center.

  - *Examples*:
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
    - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids connected via an amide linkage to another aromatic or aliphatic group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide linkages can hinder coordination due to their planar structure and resonance stabilization.
  - *Example*:
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with methyl groups at the para position** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Methyl groups are electron-donating and can reduce the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening metal coordination.
  - *Example*:
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with a keto group adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The keto group may form internal hydrogen bonds or chelate with the metal center in a manner that disrupts effective catalysis.
  - *Example*:
    - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: *Rule 1* is clear in its description of modifiers (**α-amino acids with free amino groups, including mono- and di-carboxylic acids**) predicting a high yield. The rationale provides good physical-chemical insight, explaining how free amino groups enhance coordination with metal centers. The rule considers combinations of substructures (amino and carboxyl groups), which adds appropriate complexity. Coverage is strong, supported by at least three data points (entries 0, 2, and 14), ensuring the rule is robust. Overall, Rule 1 effectively balances complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 2**: *Rule 2* clearly identifies modifiers (**aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**) predicting a high yield. The rationale adequately explains the influence of electron-withdrawing groups on acidity and metal coordination. The rule's complexity is appropriate, focusing on specific substituents and positions. It is supported by at least two data points (entries 1 and 20), indicating sufficient coverage. The rule balances complexity and coverage well.

- **Comment 3**: *Rule 3* provides a clear criterion for predicting low yield based on modifiers (**aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position, excluding free amino groups**), with an exception noted for 4-aminobenzoic acid. The rationale offers good insight into the effect of electron-donating groups on acidity and coordination. The rule demonstrates complexity by combining functional group type and position, and it is supported by multiple data points (entries 10 and 22 for low yield, entry 4 for the exception), providing adequate coverage.

- **Comment 4**: *Rule 4* is clear, stating that straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups predict a high yield. The rationale is straightforward, relating to steric hindrance and coordination. However, the rule may lack sufficient coverage, as only one data point (entry 5) supports it. This limits its robustness. Consider identifying additional data points or refining the rule to enhance coverage.

- **Comment 5**: *Rule 5* clearly differentiates high and low yields based on chain length in ω-amino aliphatic carboxylic acids. The rationale provides good insight into steric effects and coordination efficiency. The rule is complex, considering both functional group position and chain length. It is well-supported by data (entries 3, 31, and 34), providing strong coverage and balance.

- **Comment 6**: *Rule 6* clearly describes modifiers with aldehyde groups attached to aromatic rings predicting a low yield. The rationale explains potential side reactions affecting catalyst effectiveness. The rule has appropriate complexity and is supported by at least two data points (entries 18 and 19), ensuring adequate coverage.

- **Comment 7**: *Rule 7* identifies modifiers with perfluoroalkyl or trifluoroacetyl groups predicting a low yield. The rationale is sound, discussing the impact of highly electron-withdrawing groups. The rule is clear and complex enough, with coverage provided by at least two data points (entries 13 and 28). 

- **Comment 8**: *Rule 8* clearly states that heteroaromatic carboxylic acids where the carboxyl group is directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring predict a high yield. The rationale is reasonable, considering coordination enhancement. The rule is supported by multiple data points (entries 8, 15, and 21), ensuring strong coverage.

- **Comment 9**: *Rule 9* clearly indicates that modifiers containing amide groups or acylated amino groups predict a low yield. The rationale provides good insight into resonance stabilization affecting coordination. The rule has acceptable complexity and is supported by several data points (entries 23, 26, and 33), providing sufficient coverage.

- **Comment 10**: *Rule 10* identifies modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups predicting a low yield. While the rationale is logical, the rule lacks coverage, being supported by only one data point (entry 10). This limits the rule's robustness. Additional data points or broader criteria may enhance coverage.

- **Comment 11**: *Rule 11* clearly describes modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl or ether groups predicting a low yield. The rationale is adequate, and the rule is supported by multiple data points (entries 11, 29, and 32), providing good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 12**: *Rule 12* specifies that aliphatic carboxylic acids substituted with an aromatic ring at the γ or δ position predict a high yield. The rationale offers insight into π-π interactions and coordination. The rule is complex, considering substituent type and position, and is supported by sufficient data points (entries 7, 24, and 25), ensuring robust coverage.

- **Comment 13**: *Rule 13* identifies modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids connected via an amide linkage predicting a low yield. Although the rationale is sound, the rule lacks coverage with only one supporting data point (entry 26). This weakens its reliability. Enhancing coverage through additional data or refining the rule may improve its robustness.

- **Comment 14**: *Rule 14* indicates that aromatic carboxylic acids with methyl groups at the para position predict a low yield. While the rationale is acceptable, the rule's coverage is limited, with only one data point (entry 22). This reduces confidence in the rule. Including more data points or broadening the rule could improve its coverage.

- **Comment 15**: *Rule 15* describes modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a keto group adjacent to the carboxyl group predicting a low yield. The rationale is reasonable, but the rule is supported by only one data point (entry 27), indicating insufficient coverage. Additional data is needed to validate the rule.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Enhance Rule Coverage by Including More Data Points**

  - **Action**: Reassess rules that are currently supported by only one data point (e.g., Rules 4, 5, 7, 11, 13, 14, and 15). To improve their robustness, consider:

    - Searching the dataset for additional examples that fit these rules.
    - Broadening the criteria of the rules to encompass more compounds without losing specificity.
    - Combining similar rules to create a more comprehensive rule with better coverage.

  - **Example**: Merge Rules 4 and 7, which both deal with aliphatic carboxylic acids, to form a unified rule that predicts high yield for straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with or without additional simple functional groups, provided they do not interfere with metal coordination.

- **Advice 2**: **Consolidate Overlapping or Redundant Rules for Clarity**

  - **Action**: Identify and merge rules that have overlapping criteria or outcomes to reduce redundancy and improve clarity.

  - **Example**:

    - Combine Rule 3 (aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups predicting low yield, except free amino groups) and Rule 14 (aromatic carboxylic acids with methyl groups at the para position predicting low yield), as methyl groups are a type of electron-donating group.

    - Integrate Rule 4 (aromatic carboxylic acids with a free amino group at the para position predicting high yield) into Rule 3 as an exception, to avoid having separate rules for similar concepts.

- **Advice 3**: **Refine Rules with Limited Support to Increase Applicability**

  - **Action**: For rules supported by limited data, consider:

    - Generalizing the rule to include a wider range of substituents or structural features.
    - Investigating whether the rationale applies to other compounds in the dataset.

  - **Example**: Modify Rule 11 (modifiers with perfluoroalkyl chains predicting low yield) to include other highly electron-withdrawing groups that may disrupt catalyst interactions, thereby increasing the rule’s coverage.

- **Advice 4**: **Improve Clarity by Eliminating Redundant Rationales**

  - **Action**: Ensure that each rule's rationale is unique and directly relates to the rule's criteria. Remove or revise rationales that repeat ideas already covered in other rules.

  - **Example**:

    - The rationale in Rule 7 about electron-withdrawing groups disrupting coordination is similar to that in Rule 2. Consider combining the rationales or distinguishing them more clearly.

- **Advice 5**: **Strengthen Property Insights with Detailed Chemical Explanations**

  - **Action**: Provide more in-depth explanations in the rationales to enhance understanding of why certain functional groups or structures affect yield.

  - **Example**:

    - In Rule 9, elaborate on how resonance stabilization in amide groups reduces the availability of lone pairs for metal coordination, thus decreasing catalyst effectiveness.

- **Advice 6**: **Ensure Consistent Terminology and Definitions Across Rules**

  - **Action**: Use consistent chemical terminology and definitions to improve readability and reduce confusion.

  - **Example**:

    - Standardize terms like "electron-withdrawing groups" and "electron-donating groups," and specify positions using nomenclature like ortho, meta, and para consistently throughout the rules.

- **Advice 7**: **Prioritize Rules Based on Impact and Confidence**

  - **Action**: Arrange the rules so that those with the strongest support and most significant impact on yield are prioritized. Clearly indicate the confidence level or robustness of each rule.

  - **Example**:

    - Place rules with broad coverage and strong data support (e.g., Rule 1 and Rule 3) at the beginning of the rule set, and indicate that they have high confidence due to multiple supporting data points.

- **Advice 8**: **Consider Structural Visualization for Complex Rules**

  - **Action**: For rules involving complex structures or stereochemistry, incorporate visual aids like structural diagrams to aid comprehension.

  - **Example**:

    - Provide structures for compounds mentioned in Rules 12 and 15 to clarify how substitutions at different positions affect yield.

- **Advice 9**: **Expand Dataset or Gather More Data if Necessary**

  - **Action**: If certain rules cannot be adequately supported due to limited data, consider expanding the dataset through experimentation or literature review to collect more examples.

  - **Example**:

    - For modifiers like those in Rule 13 (aromatic carboxylic acids connected via an amide linkage), seek out or test additional compounds to validate the rule.

- **Advice 10**: **Review and Update Rules Based on the Latest Data**

  - **Action**: Regularly revisit the rules to ensure they remain accurate and relevant as new data becomes available.

  - **Example**:

    - If new modifiers are tested and added to the dataset, assess whether they fit existing rules or necessitate the creation of new rules.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify and Quantify Molecular Features**  
  Focus on simplifying the rules by identifying key molecular features that can be easily quantified and translated into numerical descriptors from SMILES strings. For instance, instead of complex functional group patterns, use counts of specific atoms (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen), the presence of certain functional groups (e.g., amines, carboxylic acids), or molecular properties (e.g., molecular weight, LogP, polarity).

- **Advice 2**: **Consolidate Overlapping Rules**  
  Review the current rules to identify and consolidate overlapping or redundant ones. Many rules address similar functional groups or structural motifs. By grouping these together under broader categories (e.g., "Modifiers with electron-donating groups" or "Modifiers with coordinating heteroatoms"), you can reduce complexity and make it easier to assign numerical values.

- **Advice 3**: **Employ Standard Molecular Descriptors**  
  Utilize standard molecular descriptors and fingerprints that are widely used in cheminformatics, such as MACCS keys, ECFP (Extended-Connectivity Fingerprints), or molecular properties like TPSA (Topological Polar Surface Area). These descriptors can be directly calculated from SMILES and used to create a numerical feature matrix.

- **Advice 4**: **Develop Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) Models**  
  Consider building QSAR models that correlate numerical molecular descriptors with the yield outcome. This approach moves beyond categorical rules and allows for the prediction of yields based on quantifiable molecular features extracted from SMILES.

- **Advice 5**: **Include Steric and Electronic Parameters**  
  Introduce numerical parameters that capture steric hindrance and electronic effects, such as Taft steric parameters, Hammett sigma constants, or partial charges. These can provide insight into how molecular size and electronic distribution affect the reaction yield.

- **Advice 6**: **Create a Scoring System for Functional Groups**  
  Assign numerical scores to different functional groups based on their influence on yield (e.g., +1 for groups that enhance yield, -1 for groups that reduce yield). Sum these scores for each modifier to obtain an overall reactivity score that correlates with the yield.

- **Advice 7**: **Simplify Chain Length Rules into Numerical Features**  
  Instead of categorical rules based on chain length (e.g., "five carbons or fewer"), use the actual carbon chain length as a numerical feature. This allows for more nuanced modeling of how chain length impacts yield.

- **Advice 8**: **Utilize Machine Learning Techniques**  
  Feed the numerical feature matrix into machine learning algorithms that can handle nonlinear relationships and interactions between descriptors. Techniques like decision trees, random forests, or neural networks can uncover patterns not apparent from manual rule generation.

- **Advice 9**: **Standardize Functional Group Definitions**  
  Define functional groups in a standardized manner to avoid ambiguity. Use SMARTS patterns or other cheminformatics tools to consistently identify functional groups in the modifiers.

- **Advice 10**: **Incorporate Solubility and Coordination Ability**  
  Include numerical descriptors that reflect the solubility of modifiers in the reaction solvent and their coordination ability with the metal center. This can be quantified through parameters like solubility scores or coordination numbers.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with free (unprotected) amino groups**, including both mono- and di-carboxylic acids, predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Free amino groups can coordinate effectively with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity through chelation.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (L-Glutamic acid)
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (L-Aspartic acid)
    - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (L-Tryptophan)

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halomethyl) at the para position** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing coordination with metal centers and stabilizing the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
    - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxy, sulfhydryl) at the para position**, excluding free amino groups, predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, weakening metal coordination and catalyst interaction.
  - *Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 4-methylbenzoic acid
      - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
      - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
    - **Exception (High Yield)**:
      - 4-aminobenzoic acid (due to the free amino group enhancing coordination)

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: These simple acids coordinate effectively with metal centers without steric hindrance or interfering functionalities.
  - *Example*:
    - Octanoic acid

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **ω-amino aliphatic carboxylic acids** predict yield based on carbon chain length:
  - **High Yield** when the carbon chain is **five carbons or fewer** (≤5 carbons).
    - *Rationale*: Short-chain ω-amino acids allow both amino and carboxyl groups to coordinate with the metal center without significant steric hindrance.
    - *Example*:
      - 5-aminopentanoic acid
  - **Low Yield** when the carbon chain is **longer than five carbons** (>5 carbons).
    - *Rationale*: Longer chains introduce steric bulk, hindering effective coordination with the catalyst.
    - *Examples*:
      - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
      - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing **amide groups or acylated amino groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide groups have resonance stabilization that reduces their ability to donate electrons and coordinate with metal centers, decreasing catalyst interaction.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids where the carboxyl group is directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen) in the ring can participate in additional coordination with the metal center, enhancing catalyst activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) groups attached to the ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can engage in side reactions or inhibit catalyst function by interacting unfavorably with metal centers.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with perfluoroalkyl or trifluoroacetyl groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Highly electron-withdrawing groups can overly stabilize the carboxylate anion, diminishing its ability to coordinate with the metal center.
  - *Examples*:
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
    - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl, ether, or additional polar functional groups on the carbon chain** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: These polar groups may interfere with metal coordination or alter the solubility of the catalyst, reducing its effectiveness.
  - *Examples*:
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids substituted with an aromatic ring at the gamma (γ) or delta (δ) position**, especially if the aromatic ring contains electron-donating groups, predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The aromatic ring can enhance interactions through π-π stacking or additional coordination, improving catalyst performance.
  - *Examples*:
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
    - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol (sulfhydryl) groups attached to the ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aryl thiols can form strong and potentially irreversible bonds with metal centers, leading to catalyst deactivation.
  - *Example*:
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with a keto group adjacent to one of the carboxyl groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Keto groups may form intramolecular interactions that reduce the availability of coordination sites for the metal center.
  - *Example*:
    - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids connected via an amide linkage to another aromatic or aliphatic group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide linkages reduce the electron-donating ability of the amino group due to resonance, weakening coordination with the metal center.
  - *Example*:
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with **bulky substituents or steric hindrance near the coordinating groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Steric hindrance can impede effective coordination between the modifier and the metal center, reducing catalyst activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid
    - 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: **Rule 1** is clear in specifying that α-amino acids with free (unprotected) amino groups predict a high yield. The rationale provides strong property insight by explaining the role of free amino groups in coordinating with metal centers to enhance catalyst activity. The rule achieves an appropriate level of complexity by considering both the α-amino acid structure and the functional group status (free amino group). It is well-supported by multiple data points in the dataset, such as (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid and (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid, both showing high yields.

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 2** clearly states that aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position predict a high yield. The rationale offers solid chemical insight into how electron-withdrawing groups increase acidity and enhance metal coordination. The complexity is adequate, focusing on specific substituents and their positions on the aromatic ring. The rule is supported by data points like 4-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid, which yield high results.

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 3** effectively distinguishes between electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups on aromatic carboxylic acids, predicting low yield when electron-donating groups are present at the para position (excluding free amino groups). The rationale is clear and aligns with the chemical properties affecting acidity and coordination. The rule's complexity is appropriate, considering exceptions like 4-aminobenzoic acid. Data points such as 4-methylbenzoic acid and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid support the rule with low yields.

- **Comment 4**: **Rule 4** is straightforward in stating that straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups predict a high yield. The rationale about minimal steric hindrance is clear but somewhat lacks depth in property insight. The complexity is low due to the simplicity of the structural requirement. However, the rule is supported by the example of octanoic acid in the dataset, which shows a high yield.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** provides clarity by linking the carbon chain length of ω-amino aliphatic carboxylic acids to yield outcomes. The rationale is insightful, connecting chain length and steric effects on coordination. The complexity is good, incorporating both functional group positioning and chain length considerations. The rule is well-supported by data points like 5-aminopentanoic acid (high yield) and 7-aminoheptanoic acid (low yield).

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** is clear in identifying modifiers with amide groups or acylated amino groups as predictors of low yield.

This rule is supported by examples such as (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, which has a low yield.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** outlines that heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached predict a high yield. The rationale provides good insight into the role of heteroatoms in metal coordination. The rule has suitable complexity by specifying ring types and attachment positions. Data points like pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid support the rule with high yields.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** is clear that aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups attached to the ring predict a low yield. The rationale addresses potential side reactions and unfavorable interactions with metal centers. The complexity is appropriate, focusing on specific functional groups. This rule is supported by 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid, both showing low yields.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** clearly identifies modifiers with perfluoroalkyl or trifluoroacetyl groups as predictors of low yield. The rationale explains the impact of highly electron-withdrawing groups on coordination ability. The complexity is sufficient, considering specific electron-withdrawing substituents. The rule is supported by data such as 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid, which has a low yield.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** states that aliphatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl, ether, or additional polar groups predict a low yield. The rationale provides insight into how these groups may interfere with metal coordination. The complexity is good, accounting for various polar functional groups.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** effectively specifies that aliphatic carboxylic acids substituted with aromatic rings at the γ or δ position, especially with electron-donating groups, predict a high yield. The rationale connects enhanced interactions through π-π stacking or coordination. The complexity is high, considering chain substitution and functional groups on the aromatic ring. Data like 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid support the rule with high yields.

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** is clear in predicting low yield for aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups attached to the ring. The rationale is solid, explaining the strong binding of thiol groups to metal centers leading to catalyst deactivation. The complexity is appropriate, focusing on specific functional groups. The rule is supported by 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid, which shows a low yield.

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13** identifies aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with a keto group adjacent to a carboxyl group as predictors of low yield. The rationale provides insight into intramolecular interactions reducing coordination availability. The complexity is adequate, considering multiple functional groups. The rule is supported by 4-oxoheptanedioic acid, which has a low yield.

- **Comment 14**: **Rule 14** specifies that aromatic carboxylic acids connected via an amide linkage to another group predict a low yield. The rationale about resonance effects on electron donation is clear. The complexity is good, focusing on structural connectivity and functional groups. The rule is supported by 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid showing a low yield.

- **Comment 15**: **Rule 15** states that modifiers with bulky substituents or steric hindrance near coordinating groups predict a low yield. The rationale is sound, based on steric hindrance impeding effective coordination. The complexity is broad but valid, encompassing various bulky groups. The rule is supported by examples like (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid, which has a low yield.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with free (unprotected) amino groups**, including both mono- and di-carboxylic acids, predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Free amino groups can coordinate effectively with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity through chelation.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (L-Glutamic acid)
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (L-Aspartic acid)
    - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (L-Tryptophan)

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halomethyl) at the para position** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing coordination with metal centers and stabilizing the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
    - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxy, sulfhydryl) at the para position**, excluding free amino groups, predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, weakening metal coordination and catalyst interaction.
  - *Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 4-methylbenzoic acid
      - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
      - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
    - **Exception (High Yield)**:
      - 4-aminobenzoic acid (due to the free amino group enhancing coordination)

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: These simple acids coordinate effectively with metal centers without steric hindrance or interfering functionalities.
  - *Example*:
    - Octanoic acid

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **ω-amino aliphatic carboxylic acids** predict yield based on carbon chain length:
  - **High Yield** when the carbon chain is **five carbons or fewer** (≤5 carbons).
    - *Rationale*: Short-chain ω-amino acids allow both amino and carboxyl groups to coordinate with the metal center without significant steric hindrance.
    - *Example*:
      - 5-aminopentanoic acid
  - **Low Yield** when the carbon chain is **longer than five carbons** (>5 carbons).
    - *Rationale*: Longer chains introduce steric bulk, hindering effective coordination with the catalyst.
    - *Examples*:
      - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
      - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing **amide groups or acylated amino groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide groups have resonance stabilization that reduces their ability to donate electrons and coordinate with metal centers, decreasing catalyst interaction.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids where the carboxyl group is directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen) in the ring can participate in additional coordination with the metal center, enhancing catalyst activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) groups attached to the ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can engage in side reactions or inhibit catalyst function by interacting unfavorably with metal centers.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with perfluoroalkyl or trifluoroacetyl groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Highly electron-withdrawing groups can overly stabilize the carboxylate anion, diminishing its ability to coordinate with the metal center.
  - *Examples*:
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
    - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl, ether, or additional polar functional groups on the carbon chain** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: These polar groups may interfere with metal coordination or alter the solubility of the catalyst, reducing its effectiveness.
  - *Examples*:
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids substituted with an aromatic ring at the gamma (γ) or delta (δ) position**, especially if the aromatic ring contains electron-donating groups, predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The aromatic ring can enhance interactions through π-π stacking or additional coordination, improving catalyst performance.
  - *Examples*:
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
    - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol (sulfhydryl) groups attached to the ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aryl thiols can form strong and potentially irreversible bonds with metal centers, leading to catalyst deactivation.
  - *Example*:
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with a keto group adjacent to one of the carboxyl groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Keto groups may form intramolecular interactions that reduce the availability of coordination sites for the metal center.
  - *Example*:
    - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids connected via an amide linkage to another aromatic or aliphatic group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide linkages reduce the electron-donating ability of the amino group due to resonance, weakening coordination with the metal center.
  - *Example*:
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with **bulky substituents or steric hindrance near the coordinating groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Steric hindrance can impede effective coordination between the modifier and the metal center, reducing catalyst activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid
    - 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: **Update Rule 2 SMARTS Patterns for Nitro Groups**

  - **Issue**: The current SMARTS pattern for nitro groups in `ewg_para` is `c1cc([NX3](=O)=O)ccc1[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]`, which does not match nitro groups as they are represented in SMILES/SMARTS (`[N+](=O)[O-]`).
  - **Improvement**: Modify the pattern to correctly match nitro groups:
    ```python
    ewg_para = 'c1ccc(cc1[N+](=O)[O-])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
    ```
    This pattern accounts for the nitro group's correct representation and ensures matching with compounds like 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Correct Halogen Patterns in Rule 2**

  - **Issue**: The `halogen_para` pattern in Rule 2 only accounts for halogens directly attached to the aromatic ring, not halomethyl groups as specified in the rule (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid).
  - **Improvement**: Update the pattern to include halomethyl groups at the para position:
    ```python
    halogen_methyl_para = 'c1cc(ccc1[CX4][F,Cl,Br,I])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
    ```
    Add `halogen_methyl_para` to Rule 2's patterns to match compounds with halomethyl substituents.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Expand Electron-Donating Groups in Rule 3**

  - **Issue**: The `edg_para` pattern in Rule 3 does not include sulfhydryl (thiol) groups, which are mentioned in the natural language rule.
  - **Improvement**: Modify the pattern to include thiol groups and correct the representation of methyl groups:
    ```python
    edg_para = 'c1ccc([OX2H,OX2H0,CH3,SX2H])cc1[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
    ```
    Use `[CX4H3]` for methyl groups:
    ```python
    edg_para = 'c1ccc([OX2H,OX2H0,[CX4H3],SX2H])cc1[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
    ```
    This ensures that methyl, methoxy, hydroxy, and sulfhydryl groups at the para position are correctly identified.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Correct Exclude Pattern in Rule 3**

  - **Issue**: The current exclude pattern `['[NX3][c]']` may not effectively exclude free amino groups attached to the aromatic ring.
  - **Improvement**: Refine the exclude pattern to target para-amino groups specifically:
    ```python
    exclude_patterns = ['c1ccc([NX3H2])cc1']
    ```
    This pattern excludes compounds like 4-aminobenzoic acid where the amino group is directly attached to the ring at the para position.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Generalize Pattern for Straight-Chain Acids in Rule 4**

  - **Issue**: The `straight_chain_carboxylic_acid` pattern only matches acids with exactly five carbons in the chain, missing longer chains like octanoic acid.
  - **Improvement**: Modify the pattern to allow variable chain lengths:
    ```python
    straight_chain_carboxylic_acid = '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H3]'
    ```
    Or use a recursive SMARTS pattern:
    ```python
    straight_chain_carboxylic_acid = '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H2]([CX4H2])@[CX4H2]'
    ```
    Alternatively, consider using SMILES parser capabilities to match any length:
    ```python
    straight_chain_carboxylic_acid = '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CX4H2][CX4H2]([CX4H2])*[CX4H3]'
    ```
    This will match straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with various chain lengths.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Improve Perfluoroalkyl Group Matching in Rule 9**

  - **Issue**: The `perfluoroalkyl_group` pattern ` [CX4]([F,Cl,Br,I])([F,Cl,Br,I])[F,Cl,Br,I]` may not effectively match perfluoroalkyl or trifluoroacetyl groups.
  - **Improvement**: Update the pattern to specifically match perfluoroalkyl chains and trifluoromethyl groups:
    ```python
    perfluoroalkyl_group = '[CX4]([F])([F])[F]'
    ```
    For perfluoroalkyl chains:
    ```python
    perfluoroalkyl_chain = '[CX4]([F])([F])[CX4]([F])([F])[CX4]([F])([F])[F]'
    ```
    Ensure that compounds with such groups are accurately identified.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Make Omega-Amino Acid Patterns Flexible in Rule 5**

  - **Issue**: The patterns for `omega_amino_acid_short` and `omega_amino_acid_long` have fixed chain lengths, missing compounds with chains of varying lengths up to or beyond five carbons.
  - **Improvement**: Use SMARTS patterns with variable repetitions:
    ```python
    omega_amino_acid_short = '[NX3H2][CX4H2]{1,5}[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
    omega_amino_acid_long = '[NX3H2][CX4H2]{6,}[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
    ```
    This allows matching of omega-amino acids based on chain length criteria specified in Rule 5.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Verify Heteroaromatic Acids in Rule 7**

  - **Issue**: The `heteroaromatic_carboxylic_acid` pattern might not match all heteroaromatic systems specified in the rule.
  - **Improvement**: Ensure that the pattern includes various heteroatoms and ring systems:
    ```python
    heteroaromatic_carboxylic_acid = '[n,o,s]1cccc1[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
    ```
    Expand the pattern as necessary to include different heteroaromatic structures.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Refine Keto Dicarboxylic Acid Pattern in Rule 13**

  - **Issue**: The `keto_dicarboxylic_acid` pattern may not accurately capture all aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with a keto group adjacent to a carboxyl group.
  - **Improvement**: Adjust the pattern to reflect the structural features:
    ```python
    keto_dicarboxylic_acid = '[CX3](=O)[CX2](=O)[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
    ```
    Ensure the pattern accurately represents the keto and carboxylic acid functionalities in the molecule.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Enhance Bulky Substituent Detection in Rule 15**

  - **Issue**: The `bulky_substituent` pattern `[CX4]([OX2H])([OX2H])[OX2H]` may not effectively represent steric hindrance near coordinating groups.
  - **Improvement**: Develop patterns that capture sterically bulky groups, such as tert-butyl or multiple substitutions near key functional groups. Consider using:
    ```python
    bulky_substituent = '[CX4H]([CX4H3])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
    ```
    Or include patterns for sterically hindered alcohols, amines, or other functionalities:
    ```python
    bulky_substituent = '[#6][CX3](=[OX1])[OX2H1][C;X4](C)(C)C'
    ```
    This helps identify compounds where steric hindrance might affect metal coordination.

- **Suggestion 11**: **Revalidate All Patterns Against Examples**

  - **Issue**: Some patterns may still not capture all the examples provided in the rules.
  - **Improvement**: For each rule, cross-reference the SMARTS patterns with all given examples to ensure accurate matching. Adjust patterns where discrepancies are found.

- **Suggestion 12**: **Standardize SMARTS Syntax and Use RDKit's Capabilities**

  - **Issue**: Inconsistencies or errors in SMARTS syntax may lead to unmatched patterns.
  - **Improvement**: Review and standardize all SMARTS patterns for correct syntax. Utilize RDKit's advanced features like recursive SMARTS, atom maps, and smarts matching functions to enhance pattern accuracy.

**Analysis of Current Rule Performance**

Based on the provided metrics and focusing on confidence and lift, the current rules show noticeable improvements compared to the previous reference metrics. Here's a detailed analysis:

---

**Comparison with Previous Metrics**

1. **Confidence**:
   - **Previous Train Confidence**: Average of 0.5874 (calculated from 0.6352 and 0.5396).
   - **Current Train Confidence**:
     - Iteration 1: 0.6889
     - Iteration 2: 0.7031
     - Iteration 3: 0.5963
     - Final: 0.6719
   - **Observation**: The current rules exhibit higher confidence values than the previous average. This indicates that when the rule conditions are met, the predicted outcome is correct more frequently. The confidence has consistently remained above 0.59 across iterations, peaking at 0.7031.

2. **Lift**:
   - **Previous Train Lift**: Average of 1.1304 (calculated from 1.2048 and 1.0559).
   - **Current Train Lift**:
     - Iteration 1: 1.3772
     - Iteration 2: 1.4043
     - Iteration 3: 1.2027
     - Final: 1.3524
   - **Observation**: The current rules have higher lift values compared to the previous average. A lift greater than 1 indicates that the rule is better at predicting the outcome than random chance. The increase in lift demonstrates that the current rules are more effective at identifying true positive cases.

---

**Support and Leverage Considerations**

- **Support**:
  - **Previous Average Train Support**: 0.1756
  - **Current Train Support**:
    - Iteration 1: 0.0381
    - Iteration 2: 0.0232
    - Iteration 3: 0.0571
    - Final: 0.0232
  - **Observation**: There is a significant decrease in support in the current rules compared to the previous average. While confidence and lift have improved, the rules now apply to a smaller portion of the dataset. Low support means that the rules, although accurate when applicable, are relevant to fewer instances.

- **Leverage**:
  - **Previous Average Train Leverage**: 0.0124
  - **Current Train Leverage**:
    - Iteration 1: 0.0130
    - Iteration 2: 0.0107
    - Iteration 3: 0.0037
    - Final: 0.0108
  - **Observation**: The leverage values are comparable to the previous average, indicating that the rules retain a similar level of improvement over chance.

---

**Assessment of Iterations and Local Minimum**

- The improvements in confidence and lift across iterations suggest that the rules have been refined effectively.
- The metrics have stabilized, particularly in confidence and lift, indicating that further iterations may yield diminishing returns.
- However, the declining support highlights a trade-off where rules have become more specific, possibly overfitting to the training data.
- Given the current state, it's plausible that a local minimum has been reached concerning confidence and lift, but support has decreased, suggesting room for further optimization.

---

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

1. **Balance Between Specificity and Generality**:
   - **Issue**: High confidence and lift but low support suggest the rules are too specific.
   - **Solution**:
     - Review the conditions of the rules to identify overly restrictive criteria.
     - Consider relaxing some conditions to encompass a broader subset of data without significantly compromising confidence and lift.
     - For example, combining similar rules or removing redundant constraints.

2. **Increase Rule Support**:
   - **Strategy**:
     - Identify modifiers or conditions that are common among high-yield instances but are not currently captured by the existing rules.
     - Incorporate these broader patterns to create rules with higher support.
     - Analyze the dataset for underrepresented instances where the rules could be expanded.

3. **Merge Overlapping Rules**:
   - **Observation**: Some rules may overlap in terms of their predictive power or conditions.
   - **Action**:
     - Consolidate rules with similar conditions and outcomes to increase support.
     - This may involve generalizing functional groups or structural features in the modifiers.

4. **Avoid Overfitting**:
   - **Concern**: High metrics with very low support might indicate overfitting to training data.
   - **Recommendation**:
     - Validate the rules using a separate test set to ensure they generalize well.
     - Implement cross-validation techniques to assess the robustness of the rules.

5. **Incorporate Additional Data Features**:
   - **Suggestion**:
     - Explore other molecular descriptors or properties that correlate with high yield.
     - Features such as steric hindrance indices, electronic properties, or solvent interactions might provide additional insights.

6. **Iterative Refinement**:
   - **Approach**:
     - Re-evaluate the modifiers associated with low and high yields to identify new patterns.
     - Engage domain experts to validate the chemical plausibility of the rules.
     - Use statistical methods to test the significance of new rules before inclusion.

---

**Conclusion**

The current set of rules demonstrates improved performance in confidence and lift, indicating stronger predictive power when the rules apply. However, the decrease in support suggests that these rules are applicable to a smaller portion of the dataset, potentially limiting their practical utility.

To enhance the overall effectiveness:

- **Aim to increase support** while maintaining high confidence and lift.
- **Adjust rule specificity** to capture a broader range of relevant instances without sacrificing accuracy.
- **Validate the rules** to ensure they are not overfitting and generalize well to new data.

By implementing these recommendations, the rules can be improved to provide more comprehensive and reliable predictions, ultimately contributing to the success of the catalytic research program.

**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

1. **Accuracy Metrics Comparison**

   - **Previous Reference Metrics:**
     - Validation Accuracies ranged from **0.625** to **0.76**.
     - Test Accuracies ranged from **0.625** to **0.75**.

   - **Current Iteration Metrics:**
     - The latest 5-fold validation accuracy is **0.7143**.

   - **Analysis:**
     - The current validation accuracy of **0.7143** reflects a moderate performance of the classification model.
     - Compared to the highest previous validation accuracy of **0.76**, there is still a gap, indicating room for improvement.
     - The slight improvement from earlier iterations (which had accuracies around **0.6286** to **0.6857**) suggests that adjustments to the rules have had some positive effect but may not be sufficient.

2. **Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment**

   - The validation accuracy is moderate, and there is no significant discrepancy between training and validation accuracies (training accuracies are not provided, but we can infer from validation performance).
   - This suggests that the model is **not overfitting**; however, the model may be **underfitting**, as it is not capturing all the underlying patterns that distinguish high loading from low loading.
   - The consistent validation performance across iterations implies that the current rules may lack the complexity to fully model the data.

3. **Discrepancy Analysis Using SHAP Values**

   **Overestimated Loadings (False Positives):**

   - **Molecule:** C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O
     - **Predicted Loading:** High
     - **Experimental Loading:** Low
     - **SHAP Values:**
       - **Rule7:** **0.0822** (highest positive contribution)
       - Rule9: 0.0464
       - Rule13: 0.0242
       - Other rules have lower or negative contributions.

   - **Molecule:** C(CCCC(=O)O)CCCN
     - **Predicted Loading:** High
     - **Experimental Loading:** Low
     - **SHAP Values:**
       - **Rule7:** **0.0822** (highest positive contribution)
       - Rule9: 0.0464
       - Rule13: 0.0242

   - **Observation:**
     - **Rule7** consistently has the highest positive SHAP value in molecules where the model overestimates the loading.
     - This indicates that **Rule7 is a key contributor to false positives**.

   **Underestimated Loadings (False Negatives):**

   - In the provided data, there are no clear examples where the model predicts low loading while the experimental loading is high. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to identify rules with high negative SHAP values causing underestimations.

4. **Interpretation of Accuracy Improvements**

   - The current validation accuracy is lower than the highest previous accuracy, indicating that the latest changes to the rules have not led to significant improvement.
   - The model seems to be caught in a local minimum, with marginal gains from previous iterations.
   - Without addressing the key contributors to misclassifications, further improvements in accuracy are unlikely.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis**

   - **Rule7** has the most substantial positive SHAP values in overestimated loadings, suggesting that it may be overgeneralized.
   - **Rule9** also contributes positively to overestimations but to a lesser extent.
   - **Rule1** shows variability in its SHAP values, contributing negatively in some misclassifications, indicating possible inconsistencies in its application.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

1. **Refine Rule7**

   - **Current Rule7 Definition:**
     - *Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids where the carboxyl group is directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring predict a high yield.*

   - **Issues Identified:**
     - Rule7 is overgeneralized and includes modifiers that do not actually result in high experimental loading.
     - The rule contributes to false positives due to its broad applicability.

   - **Suggested Refinements:**
     - **Add Specificity to Heteroaromatic Rings:**
       - Limit Rule7 to specific heteroaromatic rings known to enhance catalyst activity (e.g., pyridine rings with certain substituents).
     - **Include Substituent Effects:**
       - Exclude heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups or bulky substituents that may hinder coordination.
     - **Incorporate Electronic Factors:**
       - Consider the electron density of the heteroaromatic ring and its impact on metal coordination.
     - **Example Revised Rule7:**
       - *Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen-containing rings (e.g., pyridine, pyrazine) and no electron-donating substituents predict a high yield.*

2. **Re-examine Rule9**

   - **Current Rule9 Definition:**
     - *Modifiers that are carboxylic acids with perfluoroalkyl or trifluoroacetyl groups predict a low yield.*

   - **Issues Identified:**
     - Rule9 occasionally contributes positively to high loading predictions in misclassified molecules.
     - This suggests potential misclassification of certain modifiers or exceptions to the rule.

   - **Suggested Refinements:**
     - **Clarify the Scope of Electron-Withdrawing Groups:**
       - Ensure Rule9 accurately identifies only those modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups that reduce coordination ability.
     - **Check for Misapplied Cases:**
       - Review modifiers incorrectly influenced by Rule9 and adjust the rule to exclude them.
     - **Include Contextual Conditions:**
       - Add conditions where the presence of other functional groups counteracts the effect of perfluoroalkyl groups.

3. **Adjust Rule1**

   - **Current Rule1 Definition:**
     - *Modifiers that are α-amino acids with free (unprotected) amino groups, including both mono- and di-carboxylic acids, predict a high yield.*

   - **Issues Identified:**
     - Rule1 has significant positive SHAP values in some cases and negative in others, indicating inconsistent performance.
     - Negative contributions in misclassifications suggest the rule may not account for specific structural features affecting the outcome.

   - **Suggested Refinements:**
     - **Consider Side Chain Properties:**
       - Include analysis of side chains that may impede coordination due to steric hindrance or unfavorable electronic effects.
     - **Specify Amino Acid Types:**
       - Differentiate between amino acids based on side chain characteristics (e.g., bulky, charged, hydrophobic).
     - **Example Revised Rule1:**
       - *Modifiers that are α-amino acids with free amino groups and small, non-bulky side chains predict a high yield.*

4. **Introduce New Rules or Modify Existing Ones**

   - **Identify Patterns in Misclassifications:**
     - Analyze molecules with incorrect predictions to find common features not covered by existing rules.
     - Consider factors like chain length, steric hindrance, or additional functional groups.

   - **Incorporate Steric and Electronic Factors:**
     - **Steric Hindrance:**
       - Create a rule addressing modifiers with bulky groups near the coordinating sites that may hinder metal coordination.
       - *Example New Rule:* Modifiers with bulky substituents adjacent to the carboxyl group predict a low yield.
     - **Electronic Effects:**
       - Add rules considering the impact of electron-donating or withdrawing groups in positions that significantly affect coordination.

5. **Enhance the Generalization of the Rules**

   - **Avoid Overgeneralization:**
     - Ensure rules are neither too broad nor too narrow, striking a balance to prevent overfitting and underfitting.
   - **Combine Features:**
     - Develop composite rules that consider multiple features simultaneously for more accurate predictions.
     - *Example Composite Rule:* Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids without electron-donating groups and with side chains less than three carbons predict high yield.

6. **Iterative Testing and Validation**

   - **Re-evaluate the Model:**
     - After adjusting the rules, retrain the model and assess its performance on the validation set.
   - **Monitor SHAP Values:**
     - Use SHAP analysis in subsequent iterations to identify remaining issues and refine the rules further.

7. **Incorporate Domain Knowledge and Experimental Data**

   - **Consult Literature:**
     - Review relevant chemical literature to understand the underlying mechanisms influencing modifier effectiveness.
   - **Use Experimental Insights:**
     - If available, incorporate experimental data on coordination behavior, steric factors, and electronic effects into the rule development.

**Conclusion**

- **Addressing Key Contributors to Misclassifications:**
  - Refining **Rule7** is critical, as it is the primary contributor to overestimations.
  - Adjustments to **Rule9** and **Rule1** will help reduce misclassifications and improve the model's predictive accuracy.

- **Improving Rule Specificity and Applicability:**
  - Adding detailed conditions and incorporating multiple molecular features will enhance rule effectiveness.
  - Ensuring that rules are based on sound chemical principles will improve generalization.

- **Achieving Better Model Performance:**
  - Through iterative refinement and careful analysis of SHAP values, the model's accuracy can be improved.
  - A more accurate set of rules will enable better predictions of modifier effectiveness in catalytic reactions.

**Next Steps**

- Implement the suggested refinements to the rules.
- Retrain the model and evaluate its performance using the updated rules.
- Continue using SHAP analysis to guide further refinements.
- Consider incorporating machine learning techniques to identify complex patterns that are difficult to capture with manual rules alone.

**Summary of Discussions and Suggestions for Optimizing Current Rules**

The current task involves optimizing the rules used to predict the yield of a radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction of aliphatic alcohols catalyzed by a modified Hf-TPY-MOL(Fe) catalyst. The focus is on improving the accuracy and applicability of the rules derived from SMILES representations of molecular modifiers.

**Performance Analysis of Current Rules**

1. **Rule Metrics:**
   - **Confidence and Lift:** The current rules have shown improvements in confidence and lift compared to previous iterations. Confidence values have consistently been above 0.59, peaking at 0.7031, indicating that the rules are accurate when they apply. The lift values have also increased, suggesting that the rules are effective at identifying true positives.
   - **Support:** There's a noticeable decrease in support, meaning the rules apply to a smaller portion of the dataset. Low support can limit the practical utility of the rules, as they may not generalize well.

2. **Accuracy and SHAP Analysis:**
   - **Validation Accuracy:** The latest 5-fold validation accuracy is **0.7143**, which is moderate but below the highest previous accuracy of **0.76**. This indicates room for improvement.
   - **SHAP Values:** SHAP analysis revealed that certain rules, particularly **Rule 7**, are major contributors to misclassifications (false positives). This suggests that some rules may be overgeneralized or not accurately capturing the intended patterns.

**Directions to Optimize Current Rules**

To enhance the effectiveness of the current rules while avoiding overfitting, the following suggestions are proposed:

1. **Refine Rule 2: Update SMARTS Patterns for Nitro Groups**
   - **Issue:** The existing SMARTS pattern for nitro groups does not match the correct representation in SMILES/SMARTS (`[N+](=O)[O-]`).
   - **Solution:** Modify the SMARTS pattern to correctly match nitro groups:
     ```python
     ewg_para = 'c1ccc(cc1[N+](=O)[O-])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
     ```
     This adjustment ensures accurate identification of compounds like 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

2. **Correct Halogen Patterns in Rule 2**
   - **Issue:** The pattern misses halomethyl groups (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid).
   - **Solution:** Include halomethyl groups in the pattern:
     ```python
     halogen_methyl_para = 'c1cc(ccc1[CX4][F,Cl,Br,I])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
     ```
     This change enhances the rule's ability to detect relevant modifiers.

3. **Expand Electron-Donating Groups in Rule 3**
   - **Issue:** Sulfhydryl (thiol) groups are not included in the pattern, despite being mentioned in the rule.
   - **Solution:** Modify the pattern to encompass thiol groups and correct methyl group representation:
     ```python
     edg_para = 'c1ccc([OX2H,OX2H0,[CX4H3],SX2H])cc1[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
     ```
     This ensures accurate matching of modifiers with electron-donating groups at the para position.

4. **Refine Exclude Pattern in Rule 3**
   - **Issue:** The exclude pattern may not effectively exclude free amino groups.
   - **Solution:** Adjust the pattern to specifically target para-amino groups:
     ```python
     exclude_patterns = ['c1ccc([NX3H2])cc1']
     ```
     This change prevents misclassification of compounds like 4-aminobenzoic acid.

5. **Generalize Straight-Chain Acids in Rule 4**
   - **Issue:** The pattern only matches acids with exactly five carbons, missing longer chains.
   - **Solution:** Modify the pattern to accept variable chain lengths:
     ```python
     straight_chain_carboxylic_acid = '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CX4H2]+[CX4H3]'
     ```
     Using the `+` operator allows for one or more repetitions, matching acids with varying chain lengths.

6. **Improve Perfluoroalkyl Group Matching in Rule 9**
   - **Issue:** The pattern may not effectively match perfluoroalkyl or trifluoroacetyl groups.
   - **Solution:** Update the pattern:
     ```python
     perfluoroalkyl_group = '[CX4]([F])([F])[F]'
     ```
     This adjusts the rule to accurately identify modifiers with perfluoroalkyl groups.

7. **Flexibilize Omega-Amino Acid Patterns in Rule 5**
   - **Issue:** Fixed chain lengths exclude certain compounds.
   - **Solution:** Use variable repetitions in patterns:
     ```python
     omega_amino_acid_short = '[NX3H2][CX4H2]{1,5}[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
     omega_amino_acid_long = '[NX3H2][CX4H2]{6,}[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
     ```

8. **Verify Heteroaromatic Acids in Rule 7**
   - **Issue:** The current pattern might not match all intended compounds.
   - **Solution:** Extend the pattern to incorporate various heteroatoms:
     ```python
     heteroaromatic_carboxylic_acid = '[n,o,s]1cccc1[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
     ```

9. **Refine Keto Dicarboxylic Acid Pattern in Rule 13**
   - **Issue:** The pattern may not capture all relevant structures.
   - **Solution:** Adjust the pattern to represent keto and carboxylic functionalities:
     ```python
     keto_dicarboxylic_acid = '[CX3](=O)[CX2](=O)[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
     ```

10. **Enhance Bulky Substituent Detection in Rule 15**
    - **Issue:** The pattern may not effectively detect steric hindrance.
    - **Solution:** Develop patterns for bulky groups:
      ```python
      bulky_substituent = '[#6][CX3](=[OX1])[OX2H1][C;X4](C)(C)C'
      ```
      This helps identify modifiers where steric hindrance affects coordination.

11. **Revalidate All Patterns Against Examples**
    - **Action:** Cross-reference all SMARTS patterns with the provided examples to ensure accuracy and make adjustments as necessary.

12. **Standardize SMARTS Syntax and Leverage RDKit Capabilities**
    - **Action:** Review and standardize patterns, utilizing RDKit features like recursive SMARTS and smarts matching functions for enhanced accuracy.

**Further Optimization Possibility**

Based on the analysis, there's a clear indication that the current rules can be optimized further without overfitting. Specifically:

- **Rule Refinement:** Adjusting rules that contribute to misclassifications, such as refining Rule 7 to reduce false positives.
- **Balancing Specificity and Generality:** Modifying rules to increase support while maintaining high confidence and lift.
- **Incorporating Additional Molecular Features:** Considering steric and electronic factors not currently captured by existing rules.
- **Iterative Testing and Validation:** Continuously refining the rules based on model performance and SHAP analysis.

**Conclusion**

Further optimization of the current rules is both possible and necessary to improve predictive accuracy and generalization without overfitting.

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with free (unprotected) amino groups**, including both mono- and di-carboxylic acids, predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Free amino groups can coordinate effectively with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity through chelation.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (L-Glutamic acid)
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (L-Aspartic acid)
    - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (L-Tryptophan)

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halomethyl) at the para position** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing coordination with metal centers and stabilizing the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
    - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxy, sulfhydryl) at the para position**, excluding free amino groups, predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, weakening metal coordination and catalyst interaction.
  - *Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 4-methylbenzoic acid
      - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
      - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
    - **Exception (High Yield)**:
      - 4-aminobenzoic acid (due to the free amino group enhancing coordination)

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: These simple acids coordinate effectively with metal centers without steric hindrance or interfering functionalities.
  - *Example*:
    - Octanoic acid

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **ω-amino aliphatic carboxylic acids** predict yield based on carbon chain length:
  - **High Yield** when the carbon chain is **five carbons or fewer** (≤5 carbons).
    - *Rationale*: Short-chain ω-amino acids allow both amino and carboxyl groups to coordinate with the metal center without significant steric hindrance.
    - *Example*:
      - 5-aminopentanoic acid
  - **Low Yield** when the carbon chain is **longer than five carbons** (>5 carbons).
    - *Rationale*: Longer chains introduce steric bulk, hindering effective coordination with the catalyst.
    - *Examples*:
      - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
      - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing **amide groups or acylated amino groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide groups have resonance stabilization that reduces their ability to donate electrons and coordinate with metal centers, decreasing catalyst interaction.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids where the carboxyl group is directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen) in the ring can participate in additional coordination with the metal center, enhancing catalyst activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) groups attached to the ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can engage in side reactions or inhibit catalyst function by interacting unfavorably with metal centers.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with perfluoroalkyl or trifluoroacetyl groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Highly electron-withdrawing groups can overly stabilize the carboxylate anion, diminishing its ability to coordinate with the metal center.
  - *Examples*:
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
    - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl, ether, or additional polar functional groups on the carbon chain** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: These polar groups may interfere with metal coordination or alter the solubility of the catalyst, reducing its effectiveness.
  - *Examples*:
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids substituted with an aromatic ring at the gamma (γ) or delta (δ) position**, especially if the aromatic ring contains electron-donating groups, predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The aromatic ring can enhance interactions through π-π stacking or additional coordination, improving catalyst performance.
  - *Examples*:
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
    - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol (sulfhydryl) groups attached to the ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aryl thiols can form strong and potentially irreversible bonds with metal centers, leading to catalyst deactivation.
  - *Example*:
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with a keto group adjacent to one of the carboxyl groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Keto groups may form intramolecular interactions that reduce the availability of coordination sites for the metal center.
  - *Example*:
    - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids connected via an amide linkage to another aromatic or aliphatic group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide linkages reduce the electron-donating ability of the amino group due to resonance, weakening coordination with the metal center.
  - *Example*:
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with **bulky substituents or steric hindrance near the coordinating groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Steric hindrance can impede effective coordination between the modifier and the metal center, reducing catalyst activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid
    - 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid

**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: *Update SMARTS Pattern for Nitro Groups in Rule 2*

  **Issue**: The current SMARTS pattern for nitro groups does not match the correct representation in SMILES/SMARTS (`[N+](=O)[O-]`).

  **Solution**: Modify the SMARTS pattern to accurately match nitro groups. The updated pattern is:

  ```python
  ewg_para = 'c1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc1C(=O)O'
  ```

  **Action**: Replace the existing pattern in Rule 2 with this updated pattern to correctly identify modifiers like 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Advice 2**: *Include Halomethyl Groups in Rule 2*

  **Issue**: The current pattern misses halomethyl groups, such as in 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid.

  **Solution**: Expand the SMARTS pattern to include halomethyl groups at the para position:

  ```python
  halogen_methyl_para = 'c1ccc(CX2H2[F,Cl,Br,I])cc1C(=O)O'
  ```

  **Action**: Update Rule 2 to incorporate this pattern, enabling the correct identification of modifiers with halomethyl substituents.

- **Advice 3**: *Expand Electron-Donating Groups in Rule 3*

  **Issue**: Sulfhydryl (thiol) groups are not included in the current pattern for electron-donating groups.

  **Solution**: Modify the SMARTS pattern to encompass thiol groups and correct the methyl group's representation:

  ```python
  edg_para = 'c1ccc([OX2H,OX2H0,CX4H3,SX2H])cc1C(=O)O'
  ```

  **Action**: Update the pattern in Rule 3 to include `SX2H` for thiol groups and ensure accurate matching of modifiers with electron-donating groups.

- **Advice 4**: *Refine Exclude Pattern in Rule 3 to Exclude Free Amino Groups*

  **Issue**: The exclude pattern may not effectively exclude modifiers with free amino groups, such as 4-aminobenzoic acid.

  **Solution**: Adjust the exclude pattern to specifically target para-amino groups:

  ```python
  exclude_patterns = ['c1ccc(NH2)cc1']
  ```

  **Action**: Incorporate this exclude pattern into Rule 3 to prevent misclassification of modifiers with free amino groups that actually lead to high yield.

- **Advice 5**: *Generalize Straight-Chain Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids in Rule 4*

  **Issue**: The current pattern only matches acids with specific chain lengths, missing others like octanoic acid.

  **Solution**: Modify the pattern to accept variable chain lengths:

  ```python
  straight_chain_carboxylic_acid = 'C{2,}[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
  ```

  **Action**: Update Rule 4 with this pattern to match straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids of varying lengths.

- **Advice 6**: *Improve Perfluoroalkyl Group Matching in Rule 9*

  **Issue**: The pattern may not effectively match perfluoroalkyl or trifluoroacetyl groups.

  **Solution**: Update the pattern to accurately represent these groups:

  ```python
  perfluoroalkyl_group = '[CX4](F)(F)F'
  ```

  **Action**: Use this pattern in Rule 9 to correctly identify modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl groups.

- **Advice 7**: *Adjust ω-Amino Acid Patterns in Rule 5 with Variable Chain Lengths*

  **Issue**: Fixed chain lengths exclude certain compounds and do not distinguish between short and long chains.

  **Solution**: Use variable repetitions in the patterns:

  **High Yield (≤5 carbons)**:

  ```python
  omega_amino_acid_short = 'N[C;H2]{1,4}CC(=O)O'
  ```

  **Low Yield (>5 carbons)**:

  ```python
  omega_amino_acid_long = 'N[C;H2]{5,}[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
  ```

  **Action**: Modify Rule 5 to include these patterns for more accurate classification based on chain length.

- **Advice 8**: *Refine Heteroaromatic Carboxylic Acids Pattern in Rule 7*

  **Issue**: The current pattern might not match all intended heteroaromatic compounds.

  **Solution**: Extend the pattern to incorporate various heteroatoms and ensure the carboxyl group is directly attached:

  ```python
  heteroaromatic_carboxylic_acid = '[n,o,s]1ccccc1C(=O)O'
  ```

  **Action**: Update Rule 7 with this pattern to accurately identify heteroaromatic carboxylic acids.

- **Advice 9**: *Refine Keto Dicarboxylic Acid Pattern in Rule 13*

  **Issue**: The pattern may not capture all relevant structures with a keto group adjacent to a carboxyl group.

  **Solution**: Adjust the pattern to represent the keto and carboxylic functionalities:

  ```python
  keto_dicarboxylic_acid = 'O=C[CH2]C(=O)CC(=O)O'
  ```

  **Action**: Modify Rule 13 to include this pattern for accurate detection of such modifiers.

- **Advice 10**: *Enhance Bulky Substituent Detection in Rule 15*

  **Issue**: The pattern may not effectively detect steric hindrance near coordinating groups.

  **Solution**: Develop patterns for bulky groups near carboxyl functions:

  ```python
  bulky_substituent = '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][C](C)(C)C'
  ```

  **Action**: Incorporate this pattern into Rule 15 to identify modifiers where steric hindrance affects coordination.

- **Advice 11**: *Revalidate All SMARTS Patterns Against Provided Examples*

  **Action**: Cross-reference each updated SMARTS pattern with the provided dataset to ensure accurate matching. Adjust patterns based on any discrepancies found during validation.

- **Advice 12**: *Standardize SMARTS Syntax and Leverage RDKit Capabilities*

  **Action**: Review all SMARTS patterns to ensure they follow standard syntax. Utilize RDKit features such as recursive SMARTS, atom class matching, and smarts matching functions for enhanced pattern recognition and accuracy.

  - *Rationale*: Simple aliphatic acids coordinate effectively with metal centers without steric hindrance or interfering functionalities.
  - *Example*:
    - Octanoic acid

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **ω-amino aliphatic carboxylic acids** predict yield based on carbon chain length:
  - **High Yield** when the carbon chain is **five carbons or fewer** (≤5 carbons).
    - *Rationale*: Short-chain ω-amino acids allow both amino and carboxyl groups to coordinate with the metal center without significant steric hindrance.
    - *Example*:
      - 5-aminopentanoic acid
  - **Low Yield** when the carbon chain is **longer than five carbons** (>5 carbons).
    - *Rationale*: Longer chains introduce steric bulk, hindering effective coordination with the catalyst.
    - *Examples*:
      - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
      - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing **amide groups or acylated amino groups** predict a **low yield**.

  - *Examples*:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with perfluoroalkyl or trifluoroacetyl groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Highly electron-withdrawing groups can overly stabilize the carboxylate anion, diminishing its ability to coordinate with the metal center.
  - *Examples*:
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
    - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl, ether, or additional polar functional groups on the carbon chain** predict a **low yield**.

  - *Examples*:
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
    - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol (sulfhydryl) groups attached to the ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aryl thiols can form strong and potentially irreversible bonds with metal centers, leading to catalyst deactivation.
  - *Example*:
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with a keto group adjacent to one of the carboxyl groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Keto groups may form intramolecular interactions that reduce the availability of coordination sites for the metal center.
  - *Example*:
    - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with **bulky substituents or steric hindrance near the coordinating groups** predict a **low yield**.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is well-defined, identifying aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position (excluding free amino groups), predicting low yield. The property insight connects decreased acidity to weaker metal coordination and reduced catalyst interaction. The rule's complexity is appropriate, considering specific substituents and excluding exceptions. It is supported by multiple data points (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid, 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid), indicating good coverage. The rule maintains a good balance between specificity and general applicability.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear, predicting high yield for aromatic carboxylic acids with free amino groups at the para position. The property insight is reasonable, as free amino groups enhance coordination with the metal center due to their electron-donating ability. However, the rule is based on a single data point (4-aminobenzoic acid), which limits its coverage and reduces confidence in its general applicability. Additional supporting data points are needed to strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear, indicating that straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups predict high yield. The property insight is plausible, suggesting effective coordination without steric hindrance or interfering functionalities. However, the rule is supported by only one data point (octanoic acid), limiting its coverage. More data points are necessary to confirm the rule's validity and enhance its reliability.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is detailed and clear, predicting yield based on chain length in ω-amino aliphatic carboxylic acids. The property insight provides a logical rationale linking chain length to coordination efficiency and steric hindrance. The rule has good complexity, considering both functional groups and chain length. It is supported by multiple data points (e.g., 5-aminopentanoic acid for high yield; 7-aminoheptanoic acid and 8-aminooctanoic acid for low yield), indicating adequate coverage. The rule effectively balances specificity and applicability.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear, predicting low yield for modifiers containing amide groups or acylated amino groups. The property insight is logical, explaining how resonance stabilization in amide groups reduces their ability to donate electrons and coordinate with metal centers. The rule's complexity is appropriate, focusing on specific functional groups that affect coordination. It is well-supported by multiple data points (e.g., (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid, 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid, 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid), providing good coverage. The rule maintains a good balance between specificity and applicability.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear, focusing on heteroaromatic carboxylic acids where the carboxyl group is directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring, predicting high yield. The property insight is plausible, attributing enhanced catalyst activity to additional coordination from heteroatoms in the ring. The rule has appropriate complexity, considering both the aromatic system and functional group attachment. It is supported by multiple data points (e.g., pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid), demonstrating good coverage. The rule balances specificity with broad applicability.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear, indicating that aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (formyl) groups attached to the ring predict low yield. The property insight is sound, suggesting that aldehyde groups can engage in side reactions or inhibit catalyst function. The rule has acceptable complexity, considering specific functional group combinations. Supported by two data points (4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid), the rule meets the coverage criterion. It maintains a good balance between specificity and applicability.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear, predicting low yield for carboxylic acids with perfluoroalkyl or trifluoroacetyl groups. The property insight is reasonable, as highly electron-withdrawing groups can diminish the ability of the carboxylate to coordinate with the metal center. The rule's complexity is appropriate, focusing on impactful electron-withdrawing substituents. It is supported by two data points (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid and 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid), satisfying the coverage requirement. The rule achieves a balance between specificity and coverage.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear, predicting low yield for aliphatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl, ether, or additional polar functional groups on the carbon chain. The property insight is logical, as these polar groups may interfere with metal coordination or alter catalyst solubility. The rule is appropriately complex, considering both the presence and position of additional functional groups. It is supported by multiple data points (e.g., 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid), indicating good coverage. The rule balances specificity and applicability effectively.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is detailed and clear, predicting high yield for aliphatic carboxylic acids substituted with an aromatic ring at the gamma (γ) or delta (δ) position, especially if the aromatic ring contains electron-donating groups. The property insight is plausible, citing enhanced interactions through π-π stacking or additional coordination. The rule has appropriate complexity, combining chain substitution patterns with functional groups. Supported by multiple data points (e.g., 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid, 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), the rule demonstrates good coverage. It balances specificity and general applicability effectively.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear, predicting low yield for aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol (sulfhydryl) groups attached to the ring. The property insight is acceptable, as aryl thiols can form strong bonds with metal centers, leading to catalyst deactivation. However, the rule is based on a single data point (4-sulfanylbenzoic acid), which limits its coverage and generalizability. Additional data points are needed to confirm this rule's validity.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 is clear, predicting low yield for aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with a keto group adjacent to one of the carboxyl groups. The property insight is logical, as keto groups may form intramolecular interactions that reduce coordination sites for the metal center. However, the rule is supported by only one data point (4-oxoheptanedioic acid), limiting its coverage and reducing confidence in its general applicability. More data points are required to bolster the rule.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 predicts low yield for modifiers with bulky substituents or steric hindrance near the coordinating groups. While the rationale is plausible, the examples provided (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid and 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid) actually show high yield in the dataset, contradicting the rule's prediction. This inconsistency suggests that Rule 15 may be invalid or requires reevaluation with additional data to determine its accuracy.
**End of Comments**
---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Re-evaluate Rule 15**. The examples provided for Rule 15, namely (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid and 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid, actually show **high yield** in the dataset, contradicting the rule's prediction of low yield. This inconsistency suggests that bulky substituents or steric hindrance near coordinating groups may not necessarily lead to reduced catalyst activity in this reaction. Consider **removing Rule 15** or **modifying it** based on additional data to accurately reflect the impact of steric factors.

- **Advice 2**: **Strengthen Rule 4** by increasing its data support. Rule 4 predicts high yield for aromatic carboxylic acids with free amino groups at the para position but is currently supported by only one data point (4-aminobenzoic acid). To enhance the rule's reliability, **seek additional examples** of such modifiers to confirm their effect on yield. Alternatively, consider **combining Rule 4 with Rule 1**, as both involve free amino groups enhancing coordination with metal centers.

- **Advice 3**: **Expand the dataset for Rule 5**. Rule 5, which states that straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups predict high yield, is supported by only one example (octanoic acid). To improve the rule's **coverage and robustness**, include more data points by testing additional straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids of varying chain lengths to verify if this trend holds consistently.

- **Advice 4**: **Consolidate overlapping rules** to simplify the ruleset and improve clarity. For instance, Rule 3 and Rule 14 both address aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups predicting low yield. Combining these rules could reduce redundancy and provide a clearer guideline. Ensure that exceptions (such as free amino groups enhancing yield) are clearly noted within the consolidated rule.

- **Advice 5**: **Review the scope of Rule 11**. While Rule 11 predicts low yield for aliphatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl, ether, or additional polar functional groups, some modifiers with such groups may not significantly interfere with metal coordination. Reassess the rule by **analyzing the influence of different polar groups and their positions** on the carbon chain. This may involve categorizing polar groups based on their electronic properties or steric effects and adjusting the rule to reflect these nuances.

- **Advice 6**: **Gather more data for rules with limited support**, such as Rule 13 and Rule 14. Rules based on single data points lack statistical significance and may not be reliable predictors. **Investigate additional modifiers** that fit the criteria of these rules to determine whether they consistently predict low yield. If consistent patterns emerge, the rules can be retained and strengthened; otherwise, consider revising or eliminating them.

- **Advice 7**: **Clarify the exceptions in rules involving electron-donating groups**. Since free amino groups are electron-donating yet enhance yield due to their coordination ability, explicitly state this exception within the relevant rules (e.g., Rule 3). This clarification will prevent confusion and ensure that users correctly apply the rules when predicting yields based on modifier structures.

- **Advice 8**: **Incorporate stereochemistry considerations** where relevant. Some modifiers may exhibit different coordination behavior based on their stereochemistry, which could impact yield. Assess whether the stereochemistry of modifiers contributes to variations in catalyst activity and, if so, update the rules to reflect these factors.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids substituted with an aromatic ring at the gamma (γ) or delta (δ) position** predict yield based on the substituents on the aromatic ring:
  - **High Yield** when the aromatic ring is **unsubstituted or contains electron-withdrawing groups**.
    - *Rationale*: Electron-deficient aromatic rings may enhance interactions through π-π stacking or additional coordination, improving catalyst performance.
    - *Example*:
      - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - **Low Yield** when the aromatic ring contains **electron-donating groups** (e.g., methoxy, hydroxy).
    - *Rationale*: Electron-rich aromatic rings may interfere with metal coordination or participate in side reactions.
    - *Examples*:
      - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
      - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol (sulfhydryl) groups attached to the ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aryl thiols can form strong and potentially irreversible bonds with metal centers, leading to catalyst deactivation.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Re-evaluate Rule 5 due to contradictions with the data.** The current Rule 5 predicts that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups (polyhydroxylated acids) or sterically hindering groups near the carboxyl group result in a low yield. However, **Entries 6 and 9** in the dataset (which fit this rule) actually show **high yields**. To improve the rule:
  - **Action**: Investigate the specific structures of these exceptions to identify why they yield high results despite the initial expectation.
  - **Suggestion**: Refine the rule to account for the potential positive effects of multiple hydroxyl groups in certain contexts or specify additional structural factors that influence the yield.

- **Advice 2**: **Reassess Rule 13 due to conflicting data.** Rule 13 states that aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol (sulfhydryl) groups attached to the ring predict a low yield. However, **Entry 17 (3-sulfanylpropanoic acid)** shows a **high yield**, contradicting this rule.
  - **Action**: Differentiate between aliphatic and aromatic thiol-containing carboxylic acids.
  - **Suggestion**: Modify the rule to specify that only **aromatic** thiol groups lead to low yield, while **aliphatic** thiol groups may not have the same deactivating effect on the catalyst.

- **Advice 3**: **Expand data to support Rule 4 or reconsider its generality.** Rule 4 predicts that aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups lead to a high yield but is supported by only **one data point (Entry 5: octanoic acid)**.
  - **Action**: Include more examples of simple aliphatic carboxylic acids in the dataset.
  - **Suggestion**: Gather additional data to validate the rule's applicability or adjust the rule if further data show variability in yield outcomes.

- **Advice 4**: **Refine Rule 12 to address inconsistencies.** Rule 12 predicts yield based on substituents on aromatic rings at the γ or δ position, stating that electron-donating groups lead to low yield. However, **Entry 25** (with electron-donating methoxy groups) shows a **high yield**, conflicting with the rule.
  - **Action**: Analyze the impact of electron-donating groups in the context of the entire molecule.
  - **Suggestion**: Adjust the rule to reflect that electron-donating groups on aromatic rings at certain positions may not always decrease yield, or identify additional structural features that influence the outcome.

- **Advice 5**: **Review Rule 9 due to exceptions in the data.** Rule 9 claims that aromatic carboxylic acids with carbonyl groups attached to the ring predict a low yield. However, **Entry 16 (1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid)** has a **high yield**.
  - **Action**: Investigate why certain carbonyl-containing aromatic acids yield high results.
  - **Suggestion**: Refine the rule to specify which types of carbonyl groups or positions on the ring negatively affect the yield, or consider excluding certain structural motifs like benzofuran derivatives.

- **Advice 6**: **Increase supporting data for Rule 3.** Rule 3 is currently based on limited data (primarily **Entry 22**) predicting low yields for aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position.
  - **Action**: Incorporate additional compounds with similar structures into the dataset.
  - **Suggestion**: Strengthen the rule by validating it against more examples to ensure its reliability and general applicability.

- **Advice 7**: **Differentiate between aliphatic and aromatic systems in Rules involving thiol groups.** The contradiction in Rule 13 suggests that the effect of thiol groups may differ between aliphatic and aromatic compounds.
  - **Action**: Separate rules for aliphatic and aromatic thiol-containing carboxylic acids.
  - **Suggestion**: Specify that **aromatic** thiol groups may lead to catalyst deactivation and low yield, while **aliphatic** thiol groups do not have the same effect.

- **Advice 8**: **Consider merging or clarifying Rules 1 and 4.** Both rules deal with modifiers that predict high yield based on the absence of steric hindrance and the presence of coordinating groups.
  - **Action**: Examine the distinctions and overlaps between these rules.
  - **Suggestion**: Combine the rules or clarify their scopes to reduce redundancy and improve coherence in the rule set.

- **Advice 9**: **Investigate additional factors influencing yield in modifiers with complex structures.** Some entries with bulky substituents or potential steric hindrance still show high yields (e.g., Entries 6 and 9).
  - **Action**: Study the molecular structures to identify other factors (such as intramolecular hydrogen bonding or overall molecular flexibility) that may contribute to high yield.
  - **Suggestion**: Develop new rules or adjust existing ones to account for these additional factors.

- **Advice 10**: **Validate rules with contradictory examples.** Where rules predict an outcome that contradicts the data (as in Rules 5, 9, and 12), it's crucial to understand the underlying reasons.
  - **Action**: Perform a detailed analysis of these exceptions.
  - **Suggestion**: Use computational modeling or further experimentation to ascertain why these modifiers do not comply with the expected trends, and update the rules accordingly.

  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, weakening its ability to coordinate with metal centers. This reduces the effectiveness of the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups or with small polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, thiol) near the carboxyl group (within three carbons)** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: These simple structures allow effective coordination with metal centers without significant steric hindrance. Small polar groups can enhance solubility and interaction with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - Octanoic acid
    - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
    - 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) located at positions distant from the carboxyl group (beyond three carbons) and with a carbon chain length greater than five** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Functional groups far from the carboxyl group may introduce steric hindrance and reduce the ability of the carboxylate to coordinate effectively with the metal center, diminishing catalyst activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups directly attached to the ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can engage in side reactions or coordinate with the metal center in undesired ways, inhibiting catalyst performance.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids containing amide groups or N-acylated amino groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide groups are less effective at coordinating with metal centers due to resonance stabilization. They may also introduce steric hindrance, reducing catalyst efficiency.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids where the carboxyl group is directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Heteroatoms in the aromatic ring (e.g., nitrogen in pyridine) can participate in additional coordination with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity through synergistic interactions.
  - *Examples*:
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with perfluoroalkyl groups or trifluoroacetyl groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Highly electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups excessively stabilize the carboxylate anion, reducing its ability to coordinate with metal centers and potentially interfering with catalyst function.
  - *Examples*:
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
    - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages or flexible chains containing oxygen atoms** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether linkages increase conformational flexibility and may disrupt the optimal positioning of the carboxyl group for metal coordination. Additionally, oxygen atoms in the chain can interfere with metal interactions.
  - *Examples*:
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids substituted with an aromatic ring at the γ (gamma) or δ (delta) position** predict the yield based on the nature of the aromatic ring:
  - **High Yield** when the aromatic ring is **electron-deficient** (e.g., contains heteroatoms or electron-withdrawing groups).
    - *Rationale*: Electron-deficient aromatic rings can enhance metal coordination through π-π interactions or additional sites for coordination.
    - *Examples*:
      - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
    - *Note*: In the case of 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, despite the hydroxy group being electron-donating, the longer aliphatic chain may reduce its impact, resulting in a high yield.
  - **Low Yield** when the aromatic ring is **electron-rich** (e.g., contains strong electron-donating groups like methoxy or hydroxy) and is directly connected or in close proximity to the carboxyl group.
    - *Rationale*: Electron-rich aromatic rings may compete with the carboxyl group for metal coordination or engage in side reactions.
    - *Example*:
      - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with a ketone functional group between the carboxyl groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The additional carboxyl and ketone groups can create competing coordination sites, leading to complexation that may hinder the catalyst's activity.
  - *Example*:
    - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups can enhance solubility and provide additional coordination sites, strengthening the interaction with the metal center.
  - *Example*:
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with free (unprotected) amino groups directly attached to the α-carbon** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The free amino group can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity through chelation. Proximity of the amino group to the carboxyl group facilitates strong bidentate binding to the metal.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (L-Glutamic acid)
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (L-Aspartic acid)
    - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (L-Tryptophan)
    - 5-aminopentanoic acid
    - 4-aminobenzoic acid

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halogens) at the para position relative to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing its deprotonation and ability to coordinate with metal centers. This strengthens the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
    - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxy) at the para position relative to the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, weakening its ability to coordinate with metal centers. This reduces the effectiveness of the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups or with small polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, thiol) near the carboxyl group (within three carbons)** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: These simple structures allow effective coordination with metal centers without significant steric hindrance. Small polar groups can enhance solubility and interaction with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - Octanoic acid
    - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
    - 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) located at positions distant from the carboxyl group (beyond three carbons) and with a carbon chain length greater than five** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Functional groups far from the carboxyl group may introduce steric hindrance and reduce the ability of the carboxylate to coordinate effectively with the metal center, diminishing catalyst activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups directly attached to the ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can engage in side reactions or coordinate with the metal center in undesired ways, inhibiting catalyst performance.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids containing amide groups or N-acylated amino groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide groups are less effective at coordinating with metal centers due to resonance stabilization. They may also introduce steric hindrance, reducing catalyst efficiency.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids where the carboxyl group is directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Heteroatoms in the aromatic ring (e.g., nitrogen in pyridine) can participate in additional coordination with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity through synergistic interactions.
  - *Examples*:
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with perfluoroalkyl groups or trifluoroacetyl groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Highly electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups excessively stabilize the carboxylate anion, reducing its ability to coordinate with metal centers and potentially interfering with catalyst function.
  - *Examples*:
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
    - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages or flexible chains containing oxygen atoms** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether linkages increase conformational flexibility and may disrupt the optimal positioning of the carboxyl group for metal coordination. Additionally, oxygen atoms in the chain can interfere with metal interactions.
  - *Examples*:
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids substituted with an aromatic ring at the γ (gamma) or δ (delta) position** predict the yield based on the nature of the aromatic ring:
  - **High Yield** when the aromatic ring is **electron-deficient** (e.g., contains heteroatoms or electron-withdrawing groups).
    - *Rationale*: Electron-deficient aromatic rings can enhance metal coordination through π-π interactions or additional sites for coordination.
    - *Examples*:
      - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
    - *Note*: In the case of 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, despite the hydroxy group being electron-donating, the longer aliphatic chain may reduce its impact, resulting in a high yield.
  - **Low Yield** when the aromatic ring is **electron-rich** (e.g., contains strong electron-donating groups like methoxy or hydroxy) and is directly connected or in close proximity to the carboxyl group.
    - *Rationale*: Electron-rich aromatic rings may compete with the carboxyl group for metal coordination or engage in side reactions.
    - *Example*:
      - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with a ketone functional group between the carboxyl groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The additional carboxyl and ketone groups can create competing coordination sites, leading to complexation that may hinder the catalyst's activity.
  - *Example*:
    - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups can enhance solubility and provide additional coordination sites, strengthening the interaction with the metal center.
  - *Example*:
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Correct the SMARTS pattern for Rule 1.**
  
  The current `rule1_pattern` does not accurately capture modifiers that are carboxylic acids with free amino groups directly attached to the α-carbon. The pattern:

  ```python
  rule1_pattern = '[NX3;H2][CX4H]([*])[CX3](=O)[OX1H1,OX1-]'
  ```

  has syntax issues and doesn't properly represent the structural connectivity of amino acids.

  **Improvement**:

  - Modify the `rule1_pattern` to accurately reflect an α-amino carboxylic acid:

    ```python
    rule1_pattern = '[NX3;H2][CX4H]([#6])[CX3](=O)[OX1H1,OX1-]'
    ```

    This pattern specifies a primary amine (`[NX3;H2]`) connected to a carbon (`[CX4H]`) which is connected to any carbon (`[#6]`), and then to a carboxylic acid group (`[CX3](=O)[OX1H1,OX1-]`).

  - Test the pattern against known amino acids (e.g., L-Glutamic acid and L-Aspartic acid) to ensure it matches.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Refine the SMARTS patterns for electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) in Rule 2.**

  The current `ewg` pattern:

  ```python
  ewg = '[F,Cl,Br,I,N+;!$([N+][O-])]'  # Halogens and positively charged nitrogen
  ```

  excludes nitro groups due to the `;!$([N+][O-])` exclusion, which actually filters out nitro groups (`[N+](=O)[O-]`).

  **Improvement**:

  - Include nitro groups explicitly:

    ```python
    ewg = '[F,Cl,Br,I,$([N+](=O)[O-])]'  # Halogens and nitro group
    ```

  - Modify the aromatic carboxylic acid pattern to ensure the EWG is at the para position relative to the carboxyl group. This requires specifying the relative positions on the aromatic ring:

    ```python
    rule2_pattern = 'c1ccc([CX3](=O)[OX1H1,OX1-])cc1[$(c[F,Cl,Br,I,N+](=O)[O-])]'
    ```

    This pattern matches an aromatic ring with a carboxylic acid and an EWG in para positions.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Refine the SMARTS patterns for electron-donating groups (EDGs) in Rule 3.**

  The current `edg` pattern:

  ```python
  edg = '[OX2H,OX2][#6]'  # Hydroxyl and methoxy groups
  ```

  doesn't capture all common EDGs like methyl groups.

  **Improvement**:

  - Include methyl and other EDGs:

    ```python
    edg = '[$([OX2H][#6]),$([OX2][#6]),$([CX4H3])]'  # Hydroxyl, methoxy, methyl groups
    ```

  - Modify the pattern to ensure the EDG is at the para position relative to the carboxyl group on the aromatic ring:

    ```python
    rule3_pattern = 'c1ccc([CX3](=O)[OX1H1,OX1-])cc1[$(c[$([OX2H,OX2][#6]),$([CX4H3])])]'
    ```

- **Suggestion 4**: **Correct the pattern for heteroaromatic carboxylic acids in Rule 8.**

  The current `heteroaromatic_carboxylic_acid` pattern:

  ```python
  heteroaromatic_carboxylic_acid = '[n,o,s][c][CX3](=O)[OX1H1,OX1-]'
  ```

  may miss some heteroaromatic rings where the heteroatom is not directly bonded to the carbon bearing the carboxyl group.

  **Improvement**:

  - Use a more general pattern for heteroaromatic rings:

    ```python
    heteroaromatic_carboxylic_acid = '[n,o,s]1cccc1[CX3](=O)[OX1H1,OX1-]'
    ```

    This ensures the carboxyl group is directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Adjust the patterns to account for positional specificity in aromatic substitutions.**

  Patterns for Rules 2, 3, 6, and 11 need to specify the position (ortho, meta, para) of substituents relative to the carboxyl group.

  **Improvement**:

  - Use atom indexes or recursive SMARTS to define positions on the aromatic ring.

  - Example for para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids:

    ```python
    rule2_pattern = '[c:1]1[cH][cH][c:2][cH][cH]1[CX3](=O)[OX1H1,OX1-].[c:2][F,Cl,Br,I,$([N+](=O)[O-])]'
    ```

    This pattern matches an aromatic ring where the substituent is para to the carboxyl group.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Ensure that patterns for aliphatic chains specify chain length and functional group positions for Rules 4, 5, and 11.**

  **Improvement**:

  - For Rule 4, define aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups:

    ```python
    rule4_pattern = '[CX3](=O)[OX1H1,OX1-][CH2][CH2][CH3]'
    ```

  - For Rule 5, detect polar groups beyond three carbons from the carboxyl group:

    ```python
    rule5_pattern = '[CX3](=O)[OX1H1,OX1-][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][OX2H,NX3;H2]'
    ```

- **Suggestion 7**: **Correct the pattern for ethers in aliphatic chains in Rule 10.**

  The current `ether_linkage` pattern:

  ```python
  ether_linkage = '[#6][OX2][#6]'
  ```

  may match any ether regardless of its position.

  **Improvement**:

  - Restrict the ether linkage to aliphatic chains:

    ```python
    ether_linkage = '[CX4][OX2][CX4]'
    ```

  - Ensure it's within the aliphatic chain of the carboxylic acid:

    ```python
    rule10_pattern = '[CX3](=O)[OX1H1,OX1-][CX4][OX2][CX4]'
    ```

- **Suggestion 8**: **Validate and test all SMARTS patterns against known examples and counter-examples.**

  **Improvement**:

  - Create a validation set with molecules that should match and molecules that should not match each rule.

  - Use unit tests to verify that the patterns correctly identify the intended structures.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Handle cases where multiple patterns need to be matched with specific relationships.**

  For example, ensuring that certain groups are at specific positions relative to others (e.g., gamma or delta position in Rule 11).

  **Improvement**:

  - Use SMARTS patterns that explicitly define the relative distances between functional groups.

  - Example for Rule 11 (gamma-substituted aromatic ring):

    ```python
    rule11_pattern_high = '[CX3](=O)[OX1H1,OX1-][CH2][CH2][c][$([n,o,s]),$([cN+](=O)[O-])]'
    ```

    For electron-deficient aromatic rings.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Review and correct syntax errors in the SMARTS patterns.**

  Some patterns may contain typos or improper syntax that prevents them from functioning correctly.

  **Improvement**:

  - For instance, in the `diketone` pattern for Rule 12:

    ```python
    diketone = '[CX3](=O)[#6][CX3](=O)'
    ```

    This may not capture dicarboxylic acids with a ketone between the carboxyl groups.

  - Correct it to:

    ```python
    diketone = '[CX3](=O)[CH2][CX3](=O)[OX1H1,OX1-]'
    ```

    To match structures like 4-oxoheptanedioic acid.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

The evaluation of the current rules involves examining the provided metrics, particularly focusing on **confidence** and **lift**, and comparing them to the reference metrics from previous iterations.

---

### **Comparison of Metrics**

1. **Support**:

   - **Reference Metrics**:
     - Train support ranges between **16.67%** and **18.45%**.
   - **Current Metrics**:
     - Train support ranges from **2.32%** to **5.71%** in initial iterations.
     - In the final iteration, train support drops to **0.0%**.

   - **Comment**:
     - The current rules have significantly lower support compared to the reference metrics.
     - A support of **0.0%** indicates that the rules do not apply to any instances in the training dataset, rendering them ineffective.

2. **Confidence**:

   - **Reference Metrics**:
     - Train confidence values are **63.52%** and **53.96%**.
   - **Current Metrics**:
     - Train confidence values are higher, ranging from **59.63%** to **70.31%**.
     - Final iteration confidence is **50%** with zero support.

   - **Comment**:
     - The current rules exhibit higher confidence levels than the reference metrics.
     - High confidence suggests that when the rule conditions are met, the predictions are likely to be correct.
     - However, the high confidence is undermined by the low support, as the rules apply to very few instances.

3. **Lift**:

   - **Reference Metrics**:
     - Train lift values are **1.20** and **1.06**.
   - **Current Metrics**:
     - Train lift values are higher, ranging from **1.20** to **1.40**.
     - Final iteration lift is **1.0**.

   - **Comment**:
     - Higher lift values indicate that the rule is more effective at predicting outcomes compared to random chance.
     - A lift of **1.0** in the final iteration indicates no improvement over random guessing.

4. **Leverage**:

   - **Reference Metrics**:
     - Train leverage values range from **-0.0041** to **0.0289**.
   - **Current Metrics**:
     - Train leverage values range from **0.0037** to **0.0130**.
     - Final iteration leverage is **0.0**.

   - **Comment**:
     - Positive leverage values suggest a meaningful association between rule conditions and predictions.
     - The leverage in current iterations is positive but relatively low, indicating a modest association.
     - A leverage of **0.0** in the final iteration reflects no association.

---

### **Performance Overview**

- The current rules demonstrate **higher confidence** and **lift** compared to the reference metrics, suggesting that when they apply, they are more accurate and provide better predictive power.
- **However**, the **significant drop in support** indicates that these rules apply to a much smaller portion of the dataset.
- The **final iteration** shows a complete breakdown of rule effectiveness, with **0% support** and a **lift of 1.0**, indicating that the rules have become too specific and no longer contribute to prediction accuracy.

---

### **Recommendations for Improvement**

1. **Increase Rule Support**:

   - **Simplify Rule Conditions**:
     - Review and relax overly specific conditions in the rules to make them applicable to a larger portion of the dataset.
     - For example, if a rule requires multiple simultaneous features that rarely occur together, consider if all are necessary.

   - **Merge Similar Rules**:
     - Combine rules that are similar in nature to increase overall support while maintaining confidence.
     - This can help in capturing broader patterns within the data.

2. **Avoid Overfitting**:

   - **Balance Specificity and Generalization**:
     - Ensure that rules are not too tailored to the training data at the expense of general applicability.
     - Introduce more general conditions where appropriate to prevent the rules from capturing noise.

   - **Regularization Techniques**:
     - Apply techniques to penalize overly complex rules, encouraging simpler, more generalizable rules.

3. **Enhance Rule Discovery Process**:

   - **Data Exploration**:
     - Conduct a thorough analysis to identify underlying patterns that may not be immediately apparent.
     - Utilize domain knowledge to inform rule creation, ensuring they are grounded in chemical principles.

   - **Iterative Refinement**:
     - Continuously test and refine rules based on feedback from metrics.
     - Monitor how changes in rules affect support, confidence, and lift to find the optimal balance.

4. **Incorporate Test Data Metrics**:

   - **Evaluate on Test Data**:
     - Assess the rules using test data to check for overfitting.
     - Ensure that improvements in training metrics translate to test data performance.

   - **Adjust Based on Test Performance**:
     - Modify rules that perform poorly on test data, even if they show good training metrics.

5. **Review Rule Relevance**:

   - **Domain Validation**:
     - Re-express the rules in terms of chemical properties and mechanisms to verify their plausibility.
     - Discard or modify rules that lack a strong scientific basis, even if they show good metrics.

   - **Expert Consultation**:
     - Consult with domain experts to validate the rules and gain insights into potential improvements.

6. **Monitor Metric Trends**:

   - **Detect Local Minima**:
     - Watch for patterns suggesting diminishing returns, such as increasing confidence but decreasing support.
     - Recognize when the rules have reached a point where further iterations provide minimal benefits.

   - **Set Stopping Criteria**:
     - Establish clear criteria for when to stop refining rules, such as thresholds for support and lift.

---

### **Conclusion**

- The current rule set shows promise in terms of confidence and lift but fails to cover a sufficient portion of the dataset due to low support.
- To enhance performance, it's essential to **increase the support** of the rules without significantly compromising confidence and lift.
- By **broadening rule applicability**, **avoiding overfitting**, and **grounding rules in domain knowledge**, the rules can be made more effective and generalizable.
- Ongoing **iterative refinement** and **cross-validation with test data** will be crucial in developing a robust set of rules that reliably predict high yields in catalytic processes.

ML Commenter Message:
**Performance Analysis of Current Rules**

1. **Evaluation of Effectiveness**

   The current 5-fold validation accuracy is **0.4286**, which is significantly lower than previous validation accuracies:

   - Previous validation accuracies ranged from **0.625** to **0.76**.
   - The decrease from **0.7143** (previous iteration) to **0.4286** indicates a substantial drop in model performance.

   This suggests that the current set of rules is **less effective** in predicting the loading of modifiers on the catalyst compared to earlier iterations.

2. **Assessing Overfitting/Underfitting**

   - The significant drop in both training and validation accuracy implies that the model might be **underfitting**.
   - Underfitting occurs when the model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data.
   - The current rules may not be comprehensive enough to represent the complexities of the modifier-catalyst interactions.

3. **Analyzing Discrepancies Using SHAP Values**

   - **Discrepancy Observed**: Several molecules with a **high experimental loading** are **predicted to have low loading** by the model.
     - Examples include:
       - C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N
       - C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O
       - C([C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](C(=O)O)O)O)O)O)O
   - **SHAP Analysis**:
     - For all these molecules, **Rule13 SHAP value for high loading is 0.0**.
     - No other SHAP values are provided, indicating that Rule13 is the only contributing rule in this analysis.

   - **Interpretation**:
     - Since the **predicted loading is low** while the **experimental value is high**, and **Rule13 SHAP value is 0.0**, this suggests that **Rule13 is not contributing positively** to the prediction.
     - According to the guidance, the rule with the most **negative SHAP value** is likely problematic.
     - In this case, the absence of positive SHAP values points to Rule13 being ineffective.

4. **Interpretation of Accuracy Changes**

   - The substantial decrease in validation accuracy indicates that the **current rules are not capturing the essential features** needed for accurate predictions.
   - Previous iterations had higher accuracies, suggesting that changes made in the current iteration have negatively impacted the model's performance.
   - This may be due to the removal or alteration of rules that were previously contributing positively.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis**

   - The consistent **SHAP value of 0.0 for Rule13** across all molecules implies that this rule **does not influence the model's output**.
   - **Rule13** states:

     *Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.*

   - The molecules with mispredictions fit the criteria of Rule13 but are not being correctly classified, suggesting that **Rule13 is not effectively encoded in the model**.
   - The lack of other contributing rules in the SHAP analysis indicates that **important features may be missing** from the feature matrix.

---

**Recommendations for Improvement**

1. **Refine Rule13**

   - **Re-evaluate the Definition**:
     - Ensure that Rule13 accurately captures the characteristics of modifiers that lead to high loading.
     - Consider expanding the rule to include similar functional groups or structural motifs that are present in the misclassified molecules.
   - **Enhance Encoding in Feature Matrix**:
     - Verify that the features corresponding to Rule13 are correctly extracted and represented.
     - If Rule13 is not being activated for molecules that fit its criteria, adjust the feature extraction process.

2. **Introduce Additional Rules or Features**

   - **Identify Missing Patterns**:
     - Analyze the misclassified molecules to identify common features not captured by existing rules.
     - Consider functional groups, molecular geometry, steric factors, and electronic properties.
   - **Develop New Rules**:
     - Formulate new rules based on the identified patterns.
     - For example, if certain hydroxyl-rich compounds are misclassified, a rule emphasizing the role of multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups could be beneficial.

3. **Adjust Problematic Rules**

   - **Review All Current Rules**:
     - Reassess the effectiveness of each rule by examining their SHAP values across the dataset.
   - **Modify Rules with Negative Impact**:
     - Rules that consistently contribute negatively in cases where the model mispredicts should be revised or removed.
     - Ensure that the rationales behind the rules are scientifically sound and align with experimental observations.

4. **Improve Generalization**

   - **Address Underfitting**:
     - Simplify overly complex rules that may not generalize well to unseen data.
     - Focus on key features that are most predictive of the outcome.
   - **Balance the Rule Set**:
     - Ensure that the rules cover a diverse range of molecular features without being too specific.

5. **Enhance the Model with Additional Data**

   - **Expand the Dataset**:
     - Incorporate more experimental data if available to provide the model with additional examples.
   - **Use Multimodal Features**:
     - Consider integrating quantitative descriptors (e.g., molecular weight, logP, pKa) alongside the rule-based features.

6. **Iterative Testing and Validation**

   - **Validate Changes with Cross-Validation**:
     - After modifying the rules, perform cross-validation to assess the impact on model performance.
   - **Monitor SHAP Values**:
     - Use SHAP analysis in each iteration to understand how changes affect feature importance.
   - **Avoid Overfitting to Validation Set**:
     - Ensure that adjustments are not overly tailored to the current dataset, which could harm performance on new data.

7. **Collaborate for Expert Insights**

   - **Consult Domain Experts**:
     - Engage with chemists or material scientists to gain deeper insights into the underlying chemistry.
     - Expert knowledge can help refine rules and identify overlooked factors.

---

**Conclusion**

The current decrease in model performance indicates a need to **re-evaluate and refine the existing rules**, particularly **Rule13**, which is not contributing effectively to the predictions. By **analyzing discrepancies** through SHAP values and **iteratively improving the rules** based on these insights, we can enhance the model's ability to accurately predict modifier loading on catalysts.

Future iterations should focus on:

- Ensuring that all rules are **effectively encoded** in the feature matrix.
- **Addressing underfitting** by capturing more relevant features.
- **Validating changes thoroughly** to achieve a balance between model complexity and generalizability.

This approach will help in developing a more robust predictive model that aligns closely with experimental outcomes.

### **Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

The discussions above focused on analyzing the current set of rules designed to predict the yield of a radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction of aliphatic alcohols using modified catalysts. The analysis included a review of the rules' SMARTS (SMILES Arbitrary Target Specification) patterns, performance metrics (support, confidence, lift, leverage), and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to understand their impact on model accuracy.

**Key Issues Identified:**

1. **Low Support and Decreased Accuracy:**
   - The current rules exhibit significantly low support, with some rules applying to 0% of the training dataset.
   - There is a substantial drop in validation accuracy from previous iterations (from ~76% to ~43%), indicating reduced model effectiveness.

2. **Ineffective SMARTS Patterns:**
   - Several SMARTS patterns contain syntax errors or are too restrictive, failing to accurately match the intended molecular structures.
   - Rules are not effectively capturing the molecular features associated with high or low yield predictions.

3. **Underfitting and Overspecificity:**
   - The rules may be too specific, leading to underfitting where the model cannot generalize well to new data.
   - Overly complex rules with multiple simultaneous conditions result in low applicability across the dataset.

4. **Inadequate Handling of Molecular Features:**
   - Some important functional groups and positional relationships are not properly accounted for in the rules.
   - Patterns fail to specify the relative positions of substituents on aromatic rings or the chain lengths in aliphatic compounds.

5. **Ineffective Contribution of Certain Rules:**
   - SHAP analysis indicates that some rules, such as Rule 13, are not contributing positively to predictions, with SHAP values of zero across molecules.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1. **Refine SMARTS Patterns for Accuracy:**
   - **Rule 1:** Correct the pattern to accurately detect α-amino carboxylic acids by ensuring proper connectivity and inclusion of primary amines directly attached to the α-carbon.
     - Updated Pattern: `[NX3;H2][CX4H]([#6])[CX3](=O)[OX1H1,OX1-]`

   - **Rule 2:** Include nitro groups as electron-withdrawing groups and adjust patterns to capture para-substitution on aromatic rings.
     - Updated EWG Pattern: `[F,Cl,Br,I,$([N+](=O)[O-])]`
     - Updated Aromatic Pattern: `c1ccc([CX3](=O)[OX1H1,OX1-])cc1[$(c[F,Cl,Br,I,N+](=O)[O-])]`

   - **Rule 3:** Expand the electron-donating group (EDG) pattern to include methyl groups and ensure para-substitution detection.
     - Updated EDG Pattern: `[$([OX2H][#6]),$([OX2][#6]),$([CX4H3])]`
     - Updated Aromatic Pattern: `c1ccc([CX3](=O)[OX1H1,OX1-])cc1[$(c[$([OX2H,OX2][#6]),$([CX4H3])])]`

   - **Rule 8:** Adjust the pattern for heteroaromatic carboxylic acids to ensure the carboxyl group is directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring.
     - Updated Pattern: `[n,o,s]1cccc1[CX3](=O)[OX1H1,OX1-]`

2. **Specify Positional Relationships:**
   - Incorporate atom indexing or recursive SMARTS to define ortho, meta, and para positions in aromatic rings for accurate substitution pattern detection.

3. **Simplify and Generalize Rules:**
   - Merge similar rules or relax overly restrictive conditions to increase support while maintaining confidence.
   - Ensure that rules capture essential molecular features without being too specific, improving generalizability.

4. **Enhance Patterns for Aliphatic Chains:**
   - For Rules 4, 5, and 11, define chain lengths and functional group positions explicitly to differentiate between high and low yield predictors.
     - Example for Rule 4 (simple aliphatic acids): `[CX3](=O)[OX1H1,OX1-][CH2][CH2][CH3]`

5. **Correct Syntax Errors:**
   - Review all SMARTS patterns for typos or improper syntax that could prevent them from functioning correctly.
   - Validate patterns against known examples to ensure accurate matching.

6. **Improve Detection of Functional Groups:**
   - For Rule 10, restrict ether linkage patterns to aliphatic chains to prevent false positives.
     - Updated Pattern: `[CX4][OX2][CX4]` within the context of a carboxylic acid.

7. **Validate and Test Patterns Thoroughly:**
   - Create a validation set with positive and negative examples for each rule to test pattern accuracy.
   - Use unit tests to ensure patterns match the intended structures and exclude inappropriate ones.

8. **Adjust Rules Based on SHAP Analysis:**
   - Re-evaluate rules that are not contributing positively (e.g., Rule 13) and adjust them to have a meaningful impact on predictions.
   - Ensure that important molecular features observed in misclassified molecules are included in the rules.

9. **Incorporate Additional Molecular Descriptors:**
   - Enhance the model by integrating quantitative descriptors such as molecular weight, logP, and pKa alongside rule-based features.
   - Consider electronic and steric factors that may influence catalytic activity.

10. **Collaborate with Domain Experts:**
    - Engage chemists or material scientists to validate rules and provide insights into molecular interactions affecting yield.
    - Use expert knowledge to identify overlooked features and refine rules accordingly.

### **Judgment on Possibility for Further Optimization**

Based on the significant decrease in model performance, low support of current rules, and the identification of specific areas for improvement, there is substantial potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. By refining SMARTS patterns, simplifying overly complex rules, and ensuring accurate representation of molecular features, the model's predictive ability can be enhanced.

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with free (unprotected) amino groups directly attached to the α-carbon** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The free amino group can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity through chelation. Proximity of the amino group to the carboxyl group facilitates strong bidentate binding to the metal.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (L-Glutamic acid)
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (L-Aspartic acid)
    - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (L-Tryptophan)
    - 5-aminopentanoic acid
    - 4-aminobenzoic acid

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halogens) at the para position relative to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing its deprotonation and ability to coordinate with metal centers. This strengthens the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
    - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxy) at the para position relative to the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, weakening its ability to coordinate with metal centers. This reduces the effectiveness of the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups or with small polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, thiol) near the carboxyl group (within three carbons)** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: These simple structures allow effective coordination with metal centers without significant steric hindrance. Small polar groups can enhance solubility and interaction with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - Octanoic acid
    - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
    - 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) located at positions distant from the carboxyl group (beyond three carbons) and with a carbon chain length greater than five** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Functional groups far from the carboxyl group may introduce steric hindrance and reduce the ability of the carboxylate to coordinate effectively with the metal center, diminishing catalyst activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups directly attached to the ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can engage in side reactions or coordinate with the metal center in undesired ways, inhibiting catalyst performance.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids containing amide groups or N-acylated amino groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide groups are less effective at coordinating with metal centers due to resonance stabilization. They may also introduce steric hindrance, reducing catalyst efficiency.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids where the carboxyl group is directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Heteroatoms in the aromatic ring (e.g., nitrogen in pyridine) can participate in additional coordination with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity through synergistic interactions.
  - *Examples*:
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with perfluoroalkyl groups or trifluoroacetyl groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Highly electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups excessively stabilize the carboxylate anion, reducing its ability to coordinate with metal centers and potentially interfering with catalyst function.
  - *Examples*:
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
    - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages or flexible chains containing oxygen atoms** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether linkages increase conformational flexibility and may disrupt the optimal positioning of the carboxyl group for metal coordination. Additionally, oxygen atoms in the chain can interfere with metal interactions.
  - *Examples*:
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids substituted with an aromatic ring at the γ (gamma) or δ (delta) position** predict the yield based on the nature of the aromatic ring:
  - **High Yield** when the aromatic ring is **electron-deficient** (e.g., contains heteroatoms or electron-withdrawing groups).
    - *Rationale*: Electron-deficient aromatic rings can enhance metal coordination through π-π interactions or additional sites for coordination.
    - *Examples*:
      - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
    - *Note*: In the case of 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, despite the hydroxy group being electron-donating, the longer aliphatic chain may reduce its impact, resulting in a high yield.
  - **Low Yield** when the aromatic ring is **electron-rich** (e.g., contains strong electron-donating groups like methoxy or hydroxy) and is directly connected or in close proximity to the carboxyl group.
    - *Rationale*: Electron-rich aromatic rings may compete with the carboxyl group for metal coordination or engage in side reactions.
    - *Example*:
      - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with a ketone functional group between the carboxyl groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The additional carboxyl and ketone groups can create competing coordination sites, leading to complexation that may hinder the catalyst's activity.
  - *Example*:
    - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups can enhance solubility and provide additional coordination sites, strengthening the interaction with the metal center.
  - *Example*:
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Refine SMARTS Patterns for Accuracy**
  - **Rule 1**: Update the SMARTS pattern to accurately detect α-amino carboxylic acids with free amino groups directly attached to the α-carbon. Correct the connectivity and ensure the amino group is properly represented.
    - **Updated SMARTS Pattern**: `[NX3;H2][CX4H]([#6])[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX1H1]`
    - **Explanation**: This pattern captures a primary amine (`[NX3;H2]`) attached to an sp³-hybridized carbon (`[CX4H]`) connected to any alkyl group (`[#6]`), which is bonded to a carboxyl group (`[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX1H1]`).
  
  - **Rule 2**: Modify the SMARTS pattern to detect aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position relative to the carboxyl group. Include nitro and halogen groups and ensure proper para-substitution detection.
    - **Updated SMARTS Pattern**: `c1cc([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX1H1])ccc1[$([F,Cl,Br,I,$([N+](=O)[O-])])]`
    - **Explanation**: This pattern identifies aromatic rings where the carboxyl group is para to an electron-withdrawing group (`[F,Cl,Br,I,$([N+](=O)[O-])]`).
  
  - **Rule 3**: Adjust the SMARTS pattern to detect aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position relative to the carboxyl group. Include methyl, methoxy, and hydroxy groups.
    - **Updated SMARTS Pattern**: `c1cc([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX1H1])ccc1[$([OX2H,$(OC)][CH3])]`
    - **Explanation**: This pattern matches aromatic rings with a carboxyl group para to an electron-donating group such as hydroxyl (`[OX2H]`), methoxy (`$(OC)`), or methyl (`[CH3]`).
  
  - **Rule 8**: Correct the SMARTS pattern to accurately detect heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring.
    - **Updated SMARTS Pattern**: `[$([nH1]),$([nH0]),o,s]1cccc1[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX1H1]`
    - **Explanation**: This pattern identifies heteroaromatic rings (with nitrogen `[nH1,nH0]`, oxygen `o`, or sulfur `s`) directly bonded to a carboxyl group.

- **Advice 2**: **Specify Positional Relationships Using Atom Indexing**
  - Utilize atom indexing in SMARTS patterns to define the relative positions of substituents on aromatic rings (ortho, meta, para).
    - **Example for Para-Substitution**:
      - SMARTS Pattern: `c1ccc([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX1H1])cc1[X]` where `X` represents the substituent.
      - Include recursive SMARTS to ensure substitution occurs at the desired position relative to the carboxyl group.

- **Advice 3**: **Simplify and Generalize Overly Specific Rules**
  - Merge similar rules to increase their applicability and prevent underfitting.
    - **Combine Rules with Similar Functional Groups**: If multiple rules address modifiers with similar effects due to functional groups, consider unifying them.
    - **Relax Overly Restrictive Conditions**: Remove unnecessary constraints that limit the rules' applicability without significantly impacting confidence.
  
- **Advice 4**: **Correct Syntax Errors and Validate SMARTS Patterns**
  - Review all SMARTS patterns for typos, improper syntax, or incorrect formal charges.
    - **Ensure Validity**: Use cheminformatics tools to test each pattern against known molecules to confirm accurate matching.
    - **Example**: Verify that `[OX1H1,OX1-]` correctly represents both neutral and deprotonated carboxylate forms.

- **Advice 5**: **Enhance Patterns for Aliphatic Chains**
  - Define chain lengths and functional group positions explicitly in the SMARTS patterns for aliphatic carboxylic acids.
    - **Rule 4 (Modifiers Predicting High Yield)**:
      - **Updated SMARTS Pattern**: `[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX1H1][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH3]`
      - **Explanation**: This pattern captures straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths conducive to high yield.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with a free (unprotected) primary amino group within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The presence of a free amino group near the carboxyl group allows for chelation with metal centers in the catalyst, enhancing coordination and stability. The proximity facilitates bidentate binding, improving catalytic activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (L-Glutamic acid)
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (L-Aspartic acid)
    - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (L-Tryptophan)
    - 5-aminopentanoic acid
    - 4-aminobenzoic acid
  - *Counterexamples*:
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (**Low Yield**; amino group is N-acetylated, reducing coordination ability)
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid (**Low Yield**; amino group is distant from the carboxyl group, reducing effective coordination)

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) at the para position relative to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing deprotonation and coordination with metal centers. This strengthens the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst, improving activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
    - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - *Counterexamples*:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid (**Low Yield**; despite being electron-withdrawing, the aldehyde group can engage in side reactions or inhibit coordination)
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (**Low Yield**; the pyridyl group may not have the same electron-withdrawing effect and can interfere with coordination)

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, hydroxyl, methoxy) at the para position relative to the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening its ability to deprotonate and coordinate with metal centers. This reduces the interaction with the catalyst, lowering activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
  - *Counterexamples*:
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid (**High Yield**; the increased chain length may offset the electron-donating effect by distancing the hydroxy group from the carboxyl coordination site)

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with no additional functional groups or with small polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, thiol) within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Simple aliphatic acids can coordinate effectively with metal centers without significant steric hindrance. Small polar groups near the carboxyl group can enhance solubility and coordination through additional hydrogen bonding or dipole interactions.
  - *Examples*:
    - Octanoic acid
    - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
    - 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) located beyond three carbons from the carboxyl group and with a carbon chain length greater than five** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Functional groups distant from the carboxyl group do not contribute effectively to coordination and may introduce steric hindrance or conformational flexibility that reduces effective interaction with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids containing amide groups or N-acylated amino groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide groups are less nucleophilic and less effective at coordinating with metal centers due to resonance stabilization. N-acylation of amino groups reduces their ability to participate in coordination, diminishing the modifier's effectiveness.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids where the carboxyl group is directly attached to a nitrogen-containing aromatic ring** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen can coordinate with metal centers through the nitrogen lone pair, providing additional binding interactions that enhance catalyst activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Counterexamples*:
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (**Low Yield**; the carboxyl group is not directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring, reducing the potential for effective coordination)

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups directly attached to the ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups are reactive and can engage in side reactions or inhibit coordination by interacting with metal centers in undesired ways, negatively impacting catalyst performance.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with fluorinated alkyl chains (perfluoroalkyl groups) or trifluoroacetyl substituents** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Highly electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups significantly stabilize the carboxylate anion, decreasing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. They may also introduce steric bulk and hydrophobicity that hinder effective interaction with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
    - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages or flexible chains containing multiple oxygen atoms** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether linkages increase chain flexibility and may disrupt the optimal positioning of the carboxyl group for coordination. The presence of multiple oxygen atoms can lead to unfavorable conformations or compete with the carboxyl group for metal interaction.
  - *Examples*:
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids substituted with an aromatic ring connected via an aliphatic linker of four or more carbons** predict a **high yield** if the aromatic ring is electron-deficient.
  - *Rationale*: A longer aliphatic linker distances the aromatic ring from the carboxyl group, reducing steric hindrance and electronic interference. Electron-deficient aromatic rings can enhance metal coordination through π-acceptor interactions.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid (despite the hydroxy group, the increased distance reduces its electron-donating effect)

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with a ketone or additional carboxyl groups in the chain** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Additional carbonyl groups introduce competing coordination sites and can form internal chelates or complexes that interfere with the modifier's ability to interact effectively with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (**Exception**; despite being a dicarboxylic acid, the presence of a free amino group near the carboxyl groups enhances coordination, resulting in a **high yield**)

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group can participate in hydrogen bonding and additional coordination with metal centers, strengthening the modifier-catalyst interaction and improving solubility.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-rich groups (e.g., hydroxy, methoxy) directly attached to the ring in close proximity to the carboxyl group (ortho or meta positions)** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-rich substituents can interfere with metal coordination by increasing electron density on the ring, making the carboxyl group less acidic and less effective at binding. They may also engage in intramolecular hydrogen bonding, reducing availability for coordination.
  - *Examples*:
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
    - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid (**Exception**; despite the electron-rich ring, this modifier predicts a **high yield**, possibly due to the benzofuran structure facilitating coordination)

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **small heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing additional electronegative atoms (e.g., oxygen) in the ring** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The presence of electronegative atoms in the ring can facilitate additional coordination sites and enhance interaction with the metal center through lone pair donation.
  - *Examples*:
    - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with a free (unprotected) primary amino group within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The presence of a free amino group near the carboxyl group allows for chelation with metal centers in the catalyst, enhancing coordination and stability. The proximity facilitates bidentate binding, improving catalytic activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (L-Glutamic acid)
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (L-Aspartic acid)
    - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (L-Tryptophan)
    - 5-aminopentanoic acid
    - 4-aminobenzoic acid
  - *Counterexamples*:
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (**Low Yield**; amino group is N-acetylated, reducing coordination ability)
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid (**Low Yield**; amino group is distant from the carboxyl group, reducing effective coordination)

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) at the para position relative to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing deprotonation and coordination with metal centers. This strengthens the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst, improving activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
    - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - *Counterexamples*:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid (**Low Yield**; despite being electron-withdrawing, the aldehyde group can engage in side reactions or inhibit coordination)
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (**Low Yield**; the pyridyl group may not have the same electron-withdrawing effect and can interfere with coordination)

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, hydroxyl, methoxy) at the para position relative to the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening its ability to deprotonate and coordinate with metal centers. This reduces the interaction with the catalyst, lowering activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
  - *Counterexamples*:
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid (**High Yield**; the increased chain length may offset the electron-donating effect by distancing the hydroxy group from the carboxyl coordination site)

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with no additional functional groups or with small polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, thiol) within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Simple aliphatic acids can coordinate effectively with metal centers without significant steric hindrance. Small polar groups near the carboxyl group can enhance solubility and coordination through additional hydrogen bonding or dipole interactions.
  - *Examples*:
    - Octanoic acid
    - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
    - 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) located beyond three carbons from the carboxyl group and with a carbon chain length greater than five** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Functional groups distant from the carboxyl group do not contribute effectively to coordination and may introduce steric hindrance or conformational flexibility that reduces effective interaction with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids containing amide groups or N-acylated amino groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide groups are less nucleophilic and less effective at coordinating with metal centers due to resonance stabilization. N-acylation of amino groups reduces their ability to participate in coordination, diminishing the modifier's effectiveness.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids where the carboxyl group is directly attached to a nitrogen-containing aromatic ring** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen can coordinate with metal centers through the nitrogen lone pair, providing additional binding interactions that enhance catalyst activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Counterexamples*:
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (**Low Yield**; the carboxyl group is not directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring, reducing the potential for effective coordination)

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups directly attached to the ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups are reactive and can engage in side reactions or inhibit coordination by interacting with metal centers in undesired ways, negatively impacting catalyst performance.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with fluorinated alkyl chains (perfluoroalkyl groups) or trifluoroacetyl substituents** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Highly electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups significantly stabilize the carboxylate anion, decreasing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. They may also introduce steric bulk and hydrophobicity that hinder effective interaction with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
    - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages or flexible chains containing multiple oxygen atoms** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether linkages increase chain flexibility and may disrupt the optimal positioning of the carboxyl group for coordination. The presence of multiple oxygen atoms can lead to unfavorable conformations or compete with the carboxyl group for metal interaction.
  - *Examples*:
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids substituted with an aromatic ring connected via an aliphatic linker of four or more carbons** predict a **high yield** if the aromatic ring is electron-deficient.
  - *Rationale*: A longer aliphatic linker distances the aromatic ring from the carboxyl group, reducing steric hindrance and electronic interference. Electron-deficient aromatic rings can enhance metal coordination through π-acceptor interactions.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid (despite the hydroxy group, the increased distance reduces its electron-donating effect)

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with a ketone or additional carboxyl groups in the chain** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Additional carbonyl groups introduce competing coordination sites and can form internal chelates or complexes that interfere with the modifier's ability to interact effectively with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (**Exception**; despite being a dicarboxylic acid, the presence of a free amino group near the carboxyl groups enhances coordination, resulting in a **high yield**)

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group can participate in hydrogen bonding and additional coordination with metal centers, strengthening the modifier-catalyst interaction and improving solubility.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-rich groups (e.g., hydroxy, methoxy) directly attached to the ring in close proximity to the carboxyl group (ortho or meta positions)** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-rich substituents can interfere with metal coordination by increasing electron density on the ring, making the carboxyl group less acidic and less effective at binding. They may also engage in intramolecular hydrogen bonding, reducing availability for coordination.
  - *Examples*:
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
    - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid (**Exception**; despite the electron-rich ring, this modifier predicts a **high yield**, possibly due to the benzofuran structure facilitating coordination)

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **small heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing additional electronegative atoms (e.g., oxygen) in the ring** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The presence of electronegative atoms in the ring can facilitate additional coordination sites and enhance interaction with the metal center through lone pair donation.
  - *Examples*:
    - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: In the code for **Rule 1**, the distance calculation between the carboxylic acid and the primary amine may not accurately reflect the actual atom connectivity. The SMARTS pattern `[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` matches both the carbonyl carbon and the hydroxyl oxygen in the carboxylic acid group, and `[NX3;H2]` matches the nitrogen in the primary amine. When calculating the shortest path (`Chem.GetShortestPath(mol, ca[0], pa[0])`), you're using the carbonyl carbon and the nitrogen. However, the relevant distance for this rule is along the backbone carbon chain. To improve accuracy, consider identifying the alpha carbon (the carbon directly bonded to the carboxyl carbon) and calculate the distance from the alpha carbon to the nitrogen atom. This adjustment ensures that the proximity of the amino group to the carboxyl group is measured correctly along the chain.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: For **Rule 2**, the SMARTS pattern for electron-withdrawing groups at the para position (`electron_withdrawing_para`) is incomplete. The current pattern `[c][c]([NX3](=O)[O-])[c]c[c](C(=O)[O,H])` only matches nitro groups. To encompass other strong electron-withdrawing groups like cyano, carbonyl, or halogens, expand the SMARTS pattern to include these substituents. For example, use `[c][c]([N+](=O)[O-],C#N,C(=O)[#6,F,Cl,Br,I])[c]c[c](C(=O)[O,H])`.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: In **Rule 3**, the SMARTS pattern for electron-donating groups at the para position (`electron_donating_para`) may miss certain functional groups like methyl or amino groups. Modify the pattern to include all common electron-donating groups. For instance, `[c][c]([OX2H,OX1-,NX3H2,NH1,CX4H3])[c]c[c](C(=O)[O,H])` can capture hydroxyl, methoxy, amino, and methyl groups.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: The implementation of **Rule 4** does not account for aliphatic carboxylic acids without any additional functional groups. The current code checks for small polar groups within three carbons of the carboxyl group but may not assign a positive match when no such groups are present. Adjust the code to assign a positive match if the molecule is an aliphatic carboxylic acid without additional groups or with small polar groups within three carbons.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: In **Rule 5**, the code logic is flawed. The condition `chain_length = len(Chem.rdmolops.GetShortestPath(mol, ca[0], hy[0]))` duplicates the path length calculation. Moreover, the chain length should be measured as the total number of carbons in the longest continuous carbon chain, not the path length between the carboxyl group and the polar group. Implement a method to calculate the main carbon chain length, perhaps using `Chem.rdmolops.GetLongestStraightChain(mol)`, and verify the position of polar groups relative to the carboxyl group.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: For **Rule 6**, the SMARTS patterns for amide groups (`amide_group`) and N-acylated amines (`n_acylated_amine`) are too general and may lead to false positives. Refine the patterns to specifically match amide groups adjacent to the carboxyl group. For the N-acylated amine, use a pattern like `[NX3;H0;$(N-C(=O))]` to ensure it matches only N-acylated amino groups.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: In **Rule 7**, the SMARTS pattern `[n][c](C(=O)[O,H])` may not capture all heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen directly attached to the carboxyl group. Broaden the pattern to include different heteroaromatic systems. For example, use `[$([nX2]),$([nX3+])][c](C(=O)[O,H])` to match both neutral and positively charged nitrogen atoms in various ring systems.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: The code for **Rule 11** ignores the requirement for the aromatic ring to be electron-deficient. To accurately implement this rule, include a condition that checks for electron-deficient substituents on the aromatic ring. Modify the SMARTS pattern to detect electron-deficient aromatic rings, such as those containing nitro, cyano, or halogen groups, or heteroaromatic rings. For example, use a pattern like `[c][c]([$(N=O),$(C#N),$(C(=O)[#6]),F,Cl,Br,I])[c][C;R0][C;R0][C;R0][C;R0][C](=O)[O,H]` to ensure the aromatic ring is electron-deficient and connected via an aliphatic linker of four or more carbons.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: For **Rule 12**, the SMARTS pattern for dicarboxylic acids (`dicarboxylic_acid`) is overly specific and may not match all relevant molecules. The current pattern `OC(=O)C(*)C(=O)O` may not capture variations in chain length or substitutions. Use a more general pattern like `O=C(O)C(-*)-*-C(=O)O` or consider using substructure matching to identify molecules with two carboxyl groups separated by any number of carbons.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: In **Rule 13**, the code checks for two hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group but may not capture all polyhydroxy carboxylic acids. Adjust the code to account for hydroxyl groups at both the alpha and beta positions relative to the carboxyl group. Additionally, ensure that the hydroxyl groups are on adjacent carbons if required by the rule.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: For **Rule 14**, the SMARTS pattern used may not accurately detect electron-rich groups at the ortho or meta positions relative to the carboxyl group. Update the SMARTS pattern to `[c][c]([OX2H,OX2][#6])[c](C(=O)[O,H])[c][c]`, which covers the ortho position, and `[c][c]([OX2H,OX2][#6])[c][c](C(=O)[O,H])[c]` for the meta position. This adjustment ensures precise matching of the specified substitution patterns.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: The code for **Rule 15** may be too restrictive or not general enough to capture all small heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing additional electronegative atoms. Expand the SMARTS pattern to include rings with oxygen or sulfur atoms, such as `[o,n,s][c](C(=O)[O,H])`, to broaden the scope and accurately identify the intended molecules.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: Several rules implicitly rely on the overall structure of the molecule (e.g., aliphatic vs. aromatic), but the code may not differentiate between these. Implement checks for aliphatic versus aromatic carboxylic acids using the `Chem.MolFromSmarts` patterns for aliphatic (`'[C;!R]'`) and aromatic (`'c'`) carbons to ensure rules are applied correctly.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: Include test cases for each rule using the examples and counterexamples provided in the natural language rules. Verify that the code correctly identifies positive and negative matches for these molecules. This practice will help validate the SMARTS patterns and logic implemented in the code.

- ** Suggestion 15 **: Improve code readability and maintainability by organizing the code into functions, each handling a specific rule. This modular approach makes it easier to debug and update individual rules without affecting others.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with a free (unprotected) primary amino group within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The presence of a free amino group near the carboxyl group allows for chelation with metal centers in the catalyst, enhancing coordination and stability. The proximity facilitates bidentate binding, improving catalytic activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (L-Glutamic acid)
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (L-Aspartic acid)
    - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (L-Tryptophan)
    - 5-aminopentanoic acid
    - 4-aminobenzoic acid
  - *Counterexamples*:
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (**Low Yield**; amino group is N-acetylated, reducing coordination ability)
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid (**Low Yield**; amino group is distant from the carboxyl group, reducing effective coordination)

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) at the para position relative to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing deprotonation and coordination with metal centers. This strengthens the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst, improving activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
    - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - *Counterexamples*:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid (**Low Yield**; despite being electron-withdrawing, the aldehyde group can engage in side reactions or inhibit coordination)
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (**Low Yield**; the pyridyl group may not have the same electron-withdrawing effect and can interfere with coordination)

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, hydroxyl, methoxy) at the para position relative to the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening its ability to deprotonate and coordinate with metal centers. This reduces the interaction with the catalyst, lowering activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
  - *Counterexamples*:
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid (**High Yield**; the increased chain length may offset the electron-donating effect by distancing the hydroxy group from the carboxyl coordination site)

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with no additional functional groups or with small polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, thiol) within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Simple aliphatic acids can coordinate effectively with metal centers without significant steric hindrance. Small polar groups near the carboxyl group can enhance solubility and coordination through additional hydrogen bonding or dipole interactions.
  - *Examples*:
    - Octanoic acid
    - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
    - 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) located beyond three carbons from the carboxyl group and with a carbon chain length greater than five** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Functional groups distant from the carboxyl group do not contribute effectively to coordination and may introduce steric hindrance or conformational flexibility that reduces effective interaction with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids containing amide groups or N-acylated amino groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide groups are less nucleophilic and less effective at coordinating with metal centers due to resonance stabilization. N-acylation of amino groups reduces their ability to participate in coordination, diminishing the modifier's effectiveness.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids where the carboxyl group is directly attached to a nitrogen-containing aromatic ring** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen can coordinate with metal centers through the nitrogen lone pair, providing additional binding interactions that enhance catalyst activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Counterexamples*:
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (**Low Yield**; the carboxyl group is not directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring, reducing the potential for effective coordination)

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups directly attached to the ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups are reactive and can engage in side reactions or inhibit coordination by interacting with metal centers in undesired ways, negatively impacting catalyst performance.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with fluorinated alkyl chains (perfluoroalkyl groups) or trifluoroacetyl substituents** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Highly electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups significantly stabilize the carboxylate anion, decreasing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. They may also introduce steric bulk and hydrophobicity that hinder effective interaction with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
    - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages or flexible chains containing multiple oxygen atoms** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether linkages increase chain flexibility and may disrupt the optimal positioning of the carboxyl group for coordination. The presence of multiple oxygen atoms can lead to unfavorable conformations or compete with the carboxyl group for metal interaction.
  - *Examples*:
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids substituted with an aromatic ring connected via an aliphatic linker of four or more carbons** predict a **high yield** if the aromatic ring is electron-deficient.
  - *Rationale*: A longer aliphatic linker distances the aromatic ring from the carboxyl group, reducing steric hindrance and electronic interference. Electron-deficient aromatic rings can enhance metal coordination through π-acceptor interactions.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid (despite the hydroxy group, the increased distance reduces its electron-donating effect)

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with a ketone or additional carboxyl groups in the chain** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Additional carbonyl groups introduce competing coordination sites and can form internal chelates or complexes that interfere with the modifier's ability to interact effectively with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (**Exception**; despite being a dicarboxylic acid, the presence of a free amino group near the carboxyl groups enhances coordination, resulting in a **high yield**)

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group can participate in hydrogen bonding and additional coordination with metal centers, strengthening the modifier-catalyst interaction and improving solubility.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-rich groups (e.g., hydroxy, methoxy) directly attached to the ring in close proximity to the carboxyl group (ortho or meta positions)** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-rich substituents can interfere with metal coordination by increasing electron density on the ring, making the carboxyl group less acidic and less effective at binding. They may also engage in intramolecular hydrogen bonding, reducing availability for coordination.
  - *Examples*:
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
    - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid (**Exception**; despite the electron-rich ring, this modifier predicts a **high yield**, possibly due to the benzofuran structure facilitating coordination)

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **small heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing additional electronegative atoms (e.g., oxygen) in the ring** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The presence of electronegative atoms in the ring can facilitate additional coordination sites and enhance interaction with the metal center through lone pair donation.
  - *Examples*:
    - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Revise Rule 1 Code to Accurately Capture Primary Amino Groups Within Three Carbons**

  The current implementation of **Rule 1** focuses on the alpha carbon adjacent to the carboxyl carbon when searching for the primary amino group. This approach may miss cases where the amino group is within three carbons but not directly connected via the alpha carbon. For example, in the molecule `C(CCN)CC(=O)O`, the primary amino group is within three carbons of the carboxyl group but is not detected by the current code.

  **Recommendation**: Modify the `rule1` function to calculate the shortest path length from the carboxyl carbon (or the carboxylate oxygen) to the primary amine nitrogen atom, without restricting the search to alpha carbons. Ensure that the path length includes all possible routes, and consider paths up to three bonds long. Update the function as follows:

  ```python
  def rule1(mol):
      try:
          ca_matches = mol.GetSubstructMatches(carboxylic_acid)
          pa_matches = mol.GetSubstructMatches(primary_amine)
          if not ca_matches or not pa_matches:
              return 0
          for ca in ca_matches:
              ca_carb_idx = ca[0]  # Carbonyl carbon of carboxylic acid
              for pa in pa_matches:
                  pa_atom_idx = pa[0]
                  path = Chem.GetShortestPath(mol, ca_carb_idx, pa_atom_idx)
                  if 0 < len(path) - 1 <= 3:
                      return 1
          return 0
      except:
          return 0
  ```

- **Suggestion 2**: **Expand SMARTS Patterns in Rule 2 to Include All Specified Electron-Withdrawing Groups**

  The SMARTS pattern for **Rule 2** may be too restrictive by only considering specific substituents. The natural language rule mentions strong electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro and bromomethyl groups at the para position.

  **Recommendation**: Update the SMARTS pattern to include all relevant electron-withdrawing groups specified in the rule. Use a more general pattern that captures these groups. For example:

  ```python
  ewg_para = Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1cc([N+](=O)[O-],BrC)ccc1C(=O)[O-,OH]')
  ```

  Additionally, consider parameterizing the pattern to include other electron-withdrawing groups such as cyano (`C#N`) and halogens.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Correct Chain Length Calculation and Polar Group Identification in Rule 5**

  In **Rule 5**, the code needs to accurately determine if the carbon chain length is greater than five and if polar functional groups are located beyond three carbons from the carboxyl group. The current implementation may not correctly compute the longest carbon chain or identify the positions of polar groups.

  **Recommendation**:

  - Implement a method to find the longest carbon chain in the molecule, perhaps by using a depth-first search or utilizing molecular frameworks.
  - When checking the distance from the carboxyl group to the polar functional group, calculate the shortest path length between these groups, ensuring that only paths longer than three bonds contribute to a `-1` assignment.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Enhance Rule 13 to Accurately Detect Adjacent Hydroxyl Groups**

  The code for **Rule 13** might not effectively identify polyhydroxy carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group, especially if it requires multiple adjacent hydroxyls.

  **Recommendation**: Modify the `rule13` function to:

  - Use a SMARTS pattern that identifies hydroxyl groups attached to carbons adjacent to the carboxyl carbon.
  - Count the number of hydroxyl groups within one bond of the carboxyl group, and if it meets the criterion (e.g., two or more adjacent hydroxyls), return `1`.

  Example modification:

  ```python
  def rule13(mol):
      try:
          ca_matches = mol.GetSubstructMatches(carboxylic_acid)
          if not ca_matches:
              return 0
          for ca in ca_matches:
              ca_idx = ca[0]
              ca_atom = mol.GetAtomWithIdx(ca_idx)
              neighbors = ca_atom.GetNeighbors()
              adjacent_hydroxyls = 0
              for neighbor in neighbors:
                  neighbor_idx = neighbor.GetIdx()
                  if mol.GetAtomWithIdx(neighbor_idx).GetSymbol() == 'C':
                      for nbr in neighbor.GetNeighbors():
                          if nbr.GetSymbol() == 'O' and nbr.GetTotalDegree() == 1:
                              adjacent_hydroxyls += 1
              if adjacent_hydroxyls >= 2:
                  return 1
          return 0
      except:
          return 0
  ```

- **Suggestion 5**: **Review SMARTS Patterns and Structural Definitions for All Rules**

  Some SMARTS patterns may not fully capture the structural features described in the natural language rules due to overly specific or general patterns.

  **Recommendation**:

  - **Rule 3**: Ensure that the SMARTS pattern correctly captures electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, hydroxyl, methoxy) at the para position.
  - **Rule 4**: Confirm that the pattern accurately identifies aliphatic carboxylic acids and correctly handles small polar groups within three carbons.
  - **Rule 7 and Rule 15**: Check that heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen or oxygen are properly recognized, and that the carboxyl group is directly attached.
  - **Rule 11**: Modify the code to check the linker length accurately and verify if the aromatic ring is electron-deficient based on substituents.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Implement Comprehensive Unit Tests for Each Rule Function**

  To ensure reliability, testing each rule function with known examples and counterexamples is crucial.

  **Recommendation**:

  - Develop unit tests for each rule using the `unittest` or `pytest` frameworks.
  - Include both positive and negative test cases based on the examples and counterexamples provided in the natural language rules.
  - Validate that each rule function returns the expected values for these test cases.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Refine Error Handling and Logging**

  The current code uses broad `try-except` blocks, which can suppress important error messages.

  **Recommendation**:

  - Replace broad exception handling with specific exceptions.
  - Add logging statements to capture and report errors, which will aid in debugging.
  - Ensure that the code fails gracefully and provides informative messages when encountering unexpected structures.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with a free (unprotected) primary amino group within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The presence of a free amino group near the carboxyl group allows for chelation with metal centers in the catalyst, enhancing coordination and stability. The proximity facilitates bidentate binding, improving catalytic activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (L-Glutamic acid)
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (L-Aspartic acid)
    - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (L-Tryptophan)
    - 5-aminopentanoic acid
    - 4-aminobenzoic acid
  - *Counterexamples*:
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (**Low Yield**; amino group is N-acetylated, reducing coordination ability)
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid (**Low Yield**; amino group is distant from the carboxyl group, reducing effective coordination)

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) at the para position relative to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing deprotonation and coordination with metal centers. This strengthens the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst, improving activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
    - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - *Counterexamples*:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid (**Low Yield**; despite being electron-withdrawing, the aldehyde group can engage in side reactions or inhibit coordination)
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (**Low Yield**; the pyridyl group may not have the same electron-withdrawing effect and can interfere with coordination)

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, hydroxyl, methoxy) at the para position relative to the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening its ability to deprotonate and coordinate with metal centers. This reduces the interaction with the catalyst, lowering activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
  - *Counterexamples*:
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid (**High Yield**; the increased chain length may offset the electron-donating effect by distancing the hydroxy group from the carboxyl coordination site)

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with no additional functional groups or with small polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, thiol) within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Simple aliphatic acids can coordinate effectively with metal centers without significant steric hindrance. Small polar groups near the carboxyl group can enhance solubility and coordination through additional hydrogen bonding or dipole interactions.
  - *Examples*:
    - Octanoic acid
    - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
    - 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) located beyond three carbons from the carboxyl group and with a carbon chain length greater than five** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Functional groups distant from the carboxyl group do not contribute effectively to coordination and may introduce steric hindrance or conformational flexibility that reduces effective interaction with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids containing amide groups or N-acylated amino groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide groups are less nucleophilic and less effective at coordinating with metal centers due to resonance stabilization. N-acylation of amino groups reduces their ability to participate in coordination, diminishing the modifier's effectiveness.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids where the carboxyl group is directly attached to a nitrogen-containing aromatic ring** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen can coordinate with metal centers through the nitrogen lone pair, providing additional binding interactions that enhance catalyst activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Counterexamples*:
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (**Low Yield**; the carboxyl group is not directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring, reducing the potential for effective coordination)

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups directly attached to the ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups are reactive and can engage in side reactions or inhibit coordination by interacting with metal centers in undesired ways, negatively impacting catalyst performance.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with fluorinated alkyl chains (perfluoroalkyl groups) or trifluoroacetyl substituents** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Highly electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups significantly stabilize the carboxylate anion, decreasing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. They may also introduce steric bulk and hydrophobicity that hinder effective interaction with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
    - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages or flexible chains containing multiple oxygen atoms** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether linkages increase chain flexibility and may disrupt the optimal positioning of the carboxyl group for coordination. The presence of multiple oxygen atoms can lead to unfavorable conformations or compete with the carboxyl group for metal interaction.
  - *Examples*:
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids substituted with an aromatic ring connected via an aliphatic linker of four or more carbons** predict a **high yield** if the aromatic ring is electron-deficient.
  - *Rationale*: A longer aliphatic linker distances the aromatic ring from the carboxyl group, reducing steric hindrance and electronic interference. Electron-deficient aromatic rings can enhance metal coordination through π-acceptor interactions.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid (despite the hydroxy group, the increased distance reduces its electron-donating effect)

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with a ketone or additional carboxyl groups in the chain** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Additional carbonyl groups introduce competing coordination sites and can form internal chelates or complexes that interfere with the modifier's ability to interact effectively with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (**Exception**; despite being a dicarboxylic acid, the presence of a free amino group near the carboxyl groups enhances coordination, resulting in a **high yield**)

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group can participate in hydrogen bonding and additional coordination with metal centers, strengthening the modifier-catalyst interaction and improving solubility.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-rich groups (e.g., hydroxy, methoxy) directly attached to the ring in close proximity to the carboxyl group (ortho or meta positions)** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-rich substituents can interfere with metal coordination by increasing electron density on the ring, making the carboxyl group less acidic and less effective at binding. They may also engage in intramolecular hydrogen bonding, reducing availability for coordination.
  - *Examples*:
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
    - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid (**Exception**; despite the electron-rich ring, this modifier predicts a **high yield**, possibly due to the benzofuran structure facilitating coordination)

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **small heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing additional electronegative atoms (e.g., oxygen) in the ring** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The presence of electronegative atoms in the ring can facilitate additional coordination sites and enhance interaction with the metal center through lone pair donation.
  - *Examples*:
    - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: **Correct exception handling in Rule 12**. The current code for Rule 12 does not correctly handle the exceptions specified in the rule description. Specifically, it should recognize molecules like L-Aspartic acid and L-Glutamic acid as exceptions that predict a **high yield** despite being dicarboxylic acids. Update the `exception_pattern` SMARTS to accurately match these molecules. For example, modify the exception pattern to `'[NH2][CH](CC(=O)O)C(=O)O'` to match both L-Aspartic acid and L-Glutamic acid.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: **Resolve conflicting rule predictions**. When a molecule matches multiple rules with different predictions (e.g., both high and low yield), the code should have a clear strategy to resolve these conflicts. This can be achieved by assigning priority levels to the rules or by creating a decision logic that determines the final prediction based on the combination of rule outputs.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: **Review and update SMARTS patterns for substituents**. The SMARTS patterns for electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) and electron-donating groups (EDGs) used in Rules 2, 3, and 14 may not comprehensively capture all relevant substituents. Ensure that the patterns include all common EWGs (e.g., nitro, cyano, halogens) and EDGs (e.g., alkyl, methoxy, amino) and accurately reflect their positions on the aromatic ring (ortho, meta, para).

- ** Suggestion 4 **: **Incorporate positional specificity on aromatic rings**. For rules that depend on substituent positions (e.g., Rules 2, 3, 14), enhance the SMARTS patterns to specify ortho, meta, or para positions relative to the carboxyl group. This will improve the accuracy of the rule matching by ensuring that only substituents in the correct positions are considered.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: **Enhance handling of heteroaromatic systems**. For Rules 7 and 15, which involve heteroaromatic carboxylic acids, verify that the SMARTS patterns correctly identify heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen) within the ring and that the carboxyl group is directly attached to the ring. Adjust the patterns to include cases where the heteroatom is part of a fused ring system, if applicable.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Performance Analysis of Current Rules Based on Metrics**

After analyzing the current rule metrics in comparison to the previous metrics, we can draw conclusions about the performance of the current set of rules, focusing on **confidence** and **lift**.

---

**1. Train Support**

- **Previous Metrics**: The train support ranged from **16.67%** to **18.45%**.
- **Current Metrics**: The train support is **5.71%**.
- **Analysis**:
  - The **train support has decreased significantly** compared to the previous metrics. This indicates that the current rules cover a smaller portion of the training data.
  - **Implication**: While a lower support means the rules apply to fewer cases, it can also indicate that the rules are more specific.

---

**2. Train Confidence**

- **Previous Metrics**: The train confidence ranged from **53.96%** to **63.52%**.
- **Current Metrics**: The train confidence is **63.49%**.
- **Analysis**:
  - The current confidence is **comparable to the highest previous confidence** value.
  - **Implication**: When the conditions of the current rules are met, the prediction of high yield is correct approximately **63.5%** of the time, which is consistent with earlier performance.

---

**3. Train Lift**

- **Previous Metrics**: The train lift ranged from **1.0559** to **1.2048**.
- **Current Metrics**: The train lift is **1.2799**.
- **Analysis**:
  - The **lift has increased** compared to previous metrics.
  - **Implication**: A lift greater than 1 indicates that the rule is better at predicting high yield than random chance. The increased lift suggests that the current rules are more effective in identifying high-yield outcomes when the rule conditions are met.

---

**4. Train Leverage**

- **Previous Metrics**: The train leverage ranged from **-0.0041** to **0.0289**.
- **Current Metrics**: The train leverage is **0.0141**.
- **Analysis**:
  - The leverage has decreased from the highest previous value but remains **positive**.
  - **Implication**: Positive leverage indicates a stronger association between the rule conditions and the prediction than would be expected by chance. However, the decrease suggests that the incremental benefit over chance is less than before.

---

**Overall Evaluation**

- **Specificity vs. Generalization**:
  - The **increase in lift** and maintenance of confidence with a **decrease in support** suggests that the rules have become more specific.
  - The rules are **more accurate** when they apply but **apply to fewer instances**.

- **Rule Effectiveness**:
  - The current rules are effective in **predicting high yields** when their conditions are met.
  - However, the decrease in support may lead to **missing out on potential high-yield predictions** in the data not covered by the rules.

---

**Local Minimum and Iterations**

- **Local Minimum Consideration**:
  - The metrics indicate that the current rules have improved in specificity but at the cost of generality (support).
  - This suggests that a **local minimum may have been reached** concerning lift and confidence.

- **Need for Further Iterations**:
  - Given the trade-off between support and lift, **further iterations may be necessary** to find a better balance.
  - Adjusting the rules to improve support without significantly sacrificing confidence and lift could lead to better overall performance.

---

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

1. **Balance Between Support and Confidence**:
   - **Expand Rule Coverage**:
     - Review the existing rules to identify opportunities to **generalize conditions** slightly to cover more data points.
     - Example: Merge similar rules or broaden specific functional group requirements.
   - **Maintain Confidence and Lift**:
     - Ensure that any expansion of the rules does not significantly reduce confidence and lift values.

2. **Analyze Low Support Rules**:
   - **Assess the Contribution**:
     - Identify rules with particularly low support (e.g., Rules with support below 2%).
     - Determine if these rules contribute meaningfully to the overall predictive power.
   - **Consolidate or Eliminate**:
     - Consider consolidating low support rules with others or eliminating them if they do not enhance performance.

3. **Refine Rule Conditions**:
   - **Simplify Complex Rules**:
     - Simplify overly complex rules to reduce overfitting and improve generalization.
   - **Focus on Key Functional Groups**:
     - Identify the most influential functional groups contributing to high yield and prioritize them in the rules.

4. **Investigate Exceptions and Outliers**:
   - **Analyze Counterexamples**:
     - Examine counterexamples and exceptions within each rule to understand why they do not conform.
     - Adjust rules to either account for these exceptions or clarify the conditions.

5. **Incorporate Test Metrics**:
   - **Evaluate Generalization**:
     - Include metrics on test data to assess how well the rules perform on unseen data.
     - This will help prevent overfitting to the training data.

6. **Increase Data Diversity**:
   - **Expand Dataset**:
     - If possible, include more diverse modifiers in the dataset to enrich the training process.
     - This can help in creating rules that are more widely applicable.

7. **Iterative Rule Refinement**:
   - **Sequential Adjustments**:
     - Make incremental changes to the rules and monitor the impact on metrics.
     - This allows for fine-tuning without drastic shifts in performance.

8. **Leverage Domain Expertise**:
   - **Consult Chemists**:
     - Collaborate with domain experts to validate the chemical plausibility of the rules.
     - Chemical insights can guide the adjustment of rules beyond purely statistical considerations.

9. **Use Statistical Techniques**:
   - **Feature Importance Analysis**:
     - Perform statistical analysis to identify which features (functional groups, chain lengths, etc.) have the most significant impact on yield.
     - Use this information to prioritize rule refinement.

---

**Conclusion**

The current rules demonstrate **improved specificity** with increased lift and stable confidence but at the expense of **reduced support**. While they are effective for a subset of the data, there's a risk of the rules being too narrow, potentially overlooking other high-yield cases.

To enhance the rules:

- **Aim for a better balance** between support, confidence, and lift by broadening the applicability of the rules without diluting their effectiveness.
- **Continue iterating**, focusing on understanding and integrating exceptions and expanding the dataset where possible.
- **Monitor test metrics** to ensure the rules generalize well and do not overfit the training data.

This suggests that while improvements have been made, **further iterations are warranted** to optimize the rules fully. The goal should be to develop a set of rules that are both **accurate** and **applicable to a larger portion** of the data, thereby maximizing their utility in predicting catalytic performance.

ML Commenter Message:
**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

**1. Accuracy Analysis**

The latest 5-fold cross-validation accuracy achieved by the classification model is **74.29%**. This represents an improvement over several previous iterations, where accuracies varied as follows:

- **Previous Accuracies:**
  - Validation Accuracies: Consistently around **76%**
  - Test Accuracies: **75%** and **62.5%**

- **Current Iteration Accuracies:**
  - Iteration 1: **68.57%**
  - Iteration 2: **68.57%**
  - Iteration 3: **62.86%**
  - Iteration 4: **71.43%**
  - Iteration 5: **42.86%**
  - **Latest Iteration: 74.29%**

The fluctuating accuracies indicate that while there is some variability, the latest model's performance aligns closely with the initial baseline and shows improvement over some prior iterations.

**2. Effectiveness of Current Rules**

The current rules have demonstrated moderate effectiveness:

- The **latest accuracy of 74.29%** suggests that the rules capture significant patterns in the data.
- However, there is still a notable error rate of **25.71%**, indicating room for refinement.
- Consistency with initial baseline accuracies (~76%) suggests that the model's performance has plateaued, potentially reaching a local minimum.

**3. Overfitting and Underfitting Assessment**

- **Overfitting:**
  - Not evident, as the validation accuracies are consistent across folds and similar to test accuracies.
  - The model does not show significantly higher training accuracy compared to validation accuracy.

- **Underfitting:**
  - Possible indications due to the inability to improve accuracy beyond the baseline.
  - The model might not be capturing more complex relationships present in the data.

**4. Discrepancy Analysis Using SHAP Values**

**a. Overestimated Loadings (Predicted High, Experimental Low)**

- **Molecules:**
  - **C(=O)(C(C(C(C(F)(F)F)(F)F)(F)F)(F)F)O**
  - **C1=CC(=CC=C1CCC(=O)O)O**
  - **CC1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=O)O**

- **Contributing Rules with High Positive SHAP Values:**
  - **Rule 5:** High positive SHAP values, significantly contributing to the overestimation.
  - **Rule 6:** Positive SHAP values, reinforcing the overestimation.
  - **Rule 10:** Moderate positive SHAP values.

**b. Underestimated Loadings (Predicted Low, Experimental High)**

- **Molecule:**
  - **C([C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](C(=O)O)O)O)O)O)**

- **Contributing Rules with High Negative SHAP Values:**
  - **Rule 5:** High negative SHAP value, significantly contributing to underestimation.

**5. Interpretation of Accuracy Improvements**

- **Stagnation at a Local Minimum:**
  - The accuracy has remained around 74% despite iterations, indicating that the current set of rules may have reached their optimal performance given their current definitions.
  - Further improvements in accuracy may require refining existing rules or introducing new ones to capture additional nuances.

- **Potential for Improvement:**
  - Since there is a consistent error rate, adjustments to the rules could help the model better generalize and improve prediction accuracy.

**6. Insights from SHAP Analysis for Rule Improvement**

- **Rule 5 Issues:**
  - **Overestimation:** Rule 5 contributes to false positives by assigning high loading predictions to molecules with experimental low loadings.
  - **Underestimation:** Negative SHAP values from Rule 5 lead to false negatives, where molecules with experimental high loadings are predicted as low.

- **Rule 6 Issues:**
  - Positive SHAP values from Rule 6 contribute to overestimating the loading for certain molecules with experimental low values.

- **Rule 10 Contributions:**
  - Moderate positive SHAP values indicate that Rule 10 may also play a role in mispredictions but to a lesser extent.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

**1. Refinement of Rule 5**

- **Current Definition:**
  - Predicts **low yield** for aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar functional groups beyond three carbons from the carboxyl group and with carbon chains longer than five.

- **Issues Identified:**
  - Rule 5 is contributing both high positive and high negative SHAP values, leading to mispredictions.
  - Overly penalizes molecules with beneficial functional groups that are not adequately accounted for.

- **Suggested Adjustments:**
  - **Incorporate Chain Flexibility:**
    - Revise the chain length criterion to consider the impact of chain flexibility and steric effects.
    - **New Criterion:** Modify the chain length threshold or specify the types of polar functional groups that significantly impact yield.

- **Consider Exceptions:**
  - Identify and exclude molecules where distant polar groups do not hinder coordination due to other favorable interactions.
  - **Example Adjustment:**
    - Exclude molecules with **multiple coordinating sites** or **secondary interactions** that enhance binding despite the chain length.

**2. Refinement of Rule 6**

- **Current Definition:**
  - Predicts **low yield** for carboxylic acids containing amide groups or N-acylated amino groups.

- **Issues Identified:**
  - Positive SHAP values contribute to overestimating loading in molecules with experimental low values.
  - May not account for cases where amide groups participate in coordination differently.

- **Suggested Adjustments:**
  - **Differentiate Amide Types:**
    - Distinguish between secondary and tertiary amides, as their coordination abilities differ.
    - **New Criterion:** Specify that only tertiary amides (with no available hydrogen for hydrogen bonding) predict low yield.

- **Consider Amide Positioning:**
  - Assess the position of the amide group relative to the carboxyl group.
  - **Example Adjustment:**
    - Modify the rule to consider amide groups only when they are adjacent to the carboxyl group, as distant amide groups may have less impact.

**3. Evaluation of Rule 10**

- **Current Definition:**
  - Predicts **low yield** for aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages or flexible chains containing multiple oxygen atoms.

- **Observations:**
  - Rule 10 has moderate SHAP values contributing to mispredictions.
  - May need refinement to account for molecules where ether linkages do not adversely affect coordination.

- **Suggested Adjustments:**
  - **Assess Chain Rigidity:**
    - Consider the rigidity introduced by ether linkages in certain molecular contexts.
    - **New Criterion:** Specify that only molecules where ether linkages increase chain flexibility beyond a certain threshold predict low yield.

- **Inclusion of Beneficial Oxygen Atoms:**
  - Recognize cases where additional oxygen atoms enhance solubility or coordination.
  - **Example Adjustment:**
    - Exclude molecules with ether groups that facilitate binding through chelation.

**4. Introduction of New Rules or Modifiers**

- **Incorporate Hydrogen Bonding Effects:**
  - Include considerations for molecules capable of forming strong hydrogen bonds with the catalyst.
  - **New Rule Idea:**
    - Modifiers with hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group predict high yield due to enhanced coordination via hydrogen bonding.

- **Account for Aromaticity and Conjugation:**
  - Assess the impact of conjugated systems on coordination ability.
  - **New Rule Idea:**
    - Modifiers with conjugated aromatic systems directly attached to the carboxyl group and lacking interfering substituents predict high yield.

**5. Generalization to Address Underfitting**

- **Enhance Rule Coverage:**
  - Ensure that the rules cover a broader range of chemical functionalities present in the dataset.
  - Avoid overly specific criteria that exclude relevant modifiers.

- **Iterative Testing and Validation:**
  - Continuously test the impact of rule adjustments on model performance.
  - Use cross-validation to assess generalization to unseen data.

**6. Use of SHAP Analysis in Refinement**

- **Target High-Impact Rules:**
  - Focus on rules that show the highest SHAP values (positive or negative) in mispredicted cases.
  - Adjust these rules to minimize their contribution to errors.

- **Visualize SHAP Contributions:**
  - Create summary plots to visualize the overall impact of each rule on model predictions.
  - Identify patterns where certain rules consistently contribute to mispredictions.

**Conclusion**

By refining Rules 5, 6, and possibly Rule 10, we can potentially improve the model's predictive accuracy. Adjustments should aim to reduce overgeneralization and consider exceptions highlighted by SHAP analysis. Continuous evaluation and iterative refinement, guided by both the data and chemical intuition, will enhance the effectiveness of the rules and the overall model performance.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

The task involves optimizing the yield of a radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction of aliphatic alcohols using di-tert-butyl azodicarboxylate (DBAD) as the substrate. The reaction employs an FeCl₃ catalyst in combination with Hf-TPY-MOL, a metal-organic layer modified by various molecular modifiers. The primary goal is to extract rules from SMILES representations of modifiers to predict the reaction yield and optimize parameters such as modifier loading on the catalyst (modifier/SBU), Fe/Hf ratio, and Fe loading.

**Current Situation:**

- A set of rules has been developed to predict high or low yields based on the structural features of the molecular modifiers.
- The performance metrics indicate:

  - **Train Support:** Decreased, suggesting rules are more specific but cover fewer data points.
  - **Train Confidence:** Consistent with previous iterations, indicating stable accuracy when rules apply.
  - **Train Lift:** Increased, showing improved predictive power over random chance.
  - **Accuracy:** Fluctuates, with the latest validation accuracy at **74.29%**, indicating room for improvement.

- **SHAP Analysis** reveals that certain rules (e.g., Rule 5 and Rule 6) contribute significantly to mispredictions, either overestimating or underestimating the yield.

**Directions to Optimize Current Rules**

1. **Refine Exception Handling and Conflict Resolution**

   - **Correct Exception Handling in Rule 12:**
     - **Issue:** Rule 12 does not properly account for exceptions like L-Aspartic acid and L-Glutamic acid, which are dicarboxylic acids but predict high yield due to their free amino groups near the carboxyl groups.
     - **Solution:** Update the SMARTS patterns for exceptions to accurately recognize these molecules. Modify the exception pattern to match molecules with free amino groups adjacent to carboxyl groups, ensuring these exceptions predict high yield.

   - **Resolve Conflicting Rule Predictions:**
     - **Issue:** Molecules matching multiple rules with opposing predictions lead to conflicts.
     - **Solution:** Implement a clear strategy to resolve conflicts:
       - **Priority System:** Assign priority levels to rules based on their confidence, lift, or domain importance.
       - **Weighted Decision Logic:** Use a weighted approach where rules contribute to the final prediction proportionally to their statistical significance or performance metrics.

2. **Review and Update SMARTS Patterns**

   - **Improve Patterns for Substituents:**
     - **Issue:** SMARTS patterns for electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) and electron-donating groups (EDGs) may not be comprehensive.
     - **Solution:** Expand these patterns to include all relevant substituents, such as cyano groups, halogens, alkoxy groups, and ensure accurate representation of their positions (ortho, meta, para) relative to the carboxyl group.

   - **Specify Positional Isomers on Aromatic Rings:**
     - **Issue:** Current patterns may not distinguish between different positions of substituents, affecting rule accuracy.
     - **Solution:** Enhance SMARTS patterns to specify exact positions. For example, use patterns that specifically detect para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids when required.

3. **Adjust Rules Based on SHAP Analysis**

   - **Refine Rule 5 (Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids with Distant Polar Groups):**
     - **Issue:** Rule 5 contributes to both overestimations and underestimations of the yield.
     - **Solution:** 
       - **Reevaluate Chain Length Criteria:** Adjust the chain length threshold or specify the types of polar functional groups that significantly impact yield.
       - **Consider Chain Flexibility and Steric Effects:** Incorporate parameters that account for the impact of chain flexibility on coordination.

   - **Modify Rule 6 (Carboxylic Acids with Amide Groups):**
     - **Issue:** Rule 6 does not differentiate between types of amides or their positions.
     - **Solution:** 
       - **Differentiate Amide Types:** Specify whether the amide is primary, secondary, or tertiary, as their coordination abilities differ.
       - **Position of Amide Groups:** Adjust the rule to account for the position of the amide group relative to the carboxyl group, as proximity can influence coordination.

   - **Evaluate Rule 10 (Ether Linkages and Flexible Chains):**
     - **Issue:** Rule 10 may incorrectly predict low yield for molecules where ether linkages do not hinder coordination.
     - **Solution:** 
       - **Assess Chain Rigidity:** Incorporate criteria that consider whether ether linkages increase chain flexibility to a degree that affects coordination.
       - **Beneficial Oxygen Atoms:** Recognize cases where additional oxygen atoms enhance solubility or coordination and adjust the rule accordingly.

4. **Enhance Handling of Heteroaromatic Systems**

   - **Update SMARTS Patterns for Heteroaromatics:**
     - **Issue:** Patterns may not correctly identify heteroatoms within fused ring systems or account for the direct attachment of carboxyl groups to the ring.
     - **Solution:** Refine patterns to accurately detect heteroaromatic rings with coordinating heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen) and ensure that the carboxyl group is directly attached when required by the rule.

5. **Incorporate Statistical Metrics in Rule Refinement**

   - **Balance Support and Confidence:**
     - **Issue:** Increased specificity has led to decreased support.
     - **Solution:** 
       - **Expand Rule Coverage:** Generalize certain rule conditions carefully to cover more data points without significantly reducing confidence and lift.
       - **Monitor Impact:** Continuously monitor how changes affect support, confidence, and lift.

   - **Use Feature Importance Analysis:**
     - **Issue:** Need to focus on the most impactful molecular features.
     - **Solution:** Apply statistical methods to identify key features influencing yield and prioritize them in rule adjustments.

6. **Iteratively Test and Validate Rule Changes**

   - **Monitor Performance Metrics:**
     - With each iteration, assess the effects on accuracy, support, confidence, and lift.
   - **Avoid Overfitting:**
     - Ensure that rules generalize well to unseen data by testing on validation and test sets.

7. **Leverage Domain Expertise**

   - **Consult Chemists and Domain Experts:**
     - Validate the chemical plausibility of rules and adjustments.
     - Incorporate insights on coordination chemistry and reaction mechanisms to inform rule refinement.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

Yes, there is a possibility for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. By addressing the issues identified and implementing the suggested improvements, the model can enhance its predictive accuracy while maintaining or even increasing its applicability to a broader range of modifiers. Careful refinement, guided by both statistical analysis and chemical expertise, can lead to more robust and generalizable rules.

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with a free (unprotected) primary amino group within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The presence of a free amino group near the carboxyl group allows for chelation with metal centers in the catalyst, enhancing coordination and stability. The proximity facilitates bidentate binding, improving catalytic activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (L-Glutamic acid)
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (L-Aspartic acid)
    - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (L-Tryptophan)
    - 5-aminopentanoic acid
    - 4-aminobenzoic acid
  - *Counterexamples*:
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (**Low Yield**; amino group is N-acetylated, reducing coordination ability)
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid (**Low Yield**; amino group is distant from the carboxyl group, reducing effective coordination)

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) at the para position relative to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing deprotonation and coordination with metal centers. This strengthens the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst, improving activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
    - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - *Counterexamples*:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid (**Low Yield**; despite being electron-withdrawing, the aldehyde group can engage in side reactions or inhibit coordination)
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (**Low Yield**; the pyridyl group may not have the same electron-withdrawing effect and can interfere with coordination)

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, hydroxyl, methoxy) at the para position relative to the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening its ability to deprotonate and coordinate with metal centers. This reduces the interaction with the catalyst, lowering activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
  - *Counterexamples*:
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid (**High Yield**; the increased chain length may offset the electron-donating effect by distancing the hydroxy group from the carboxyl coordination site)

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with no additional functional groups or with small polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, thiol) within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Simple aliphatic acids can coordinate effectively with metal centers without significant steric hindrance. Small polar groups near the carboxyl group can enhance solubility and coordination through additional hydrogen bonding or dipole interactions.
  - *Examples*:
    - Octanoic acid
    - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
    - 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) located beyond three carbons from the carboxyl group and with a carbon chain length greater than five** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Functional groups distant from the carboxyl group do not contribute effectively to coordination and may introduce steric hindrance or conformational flexibility that reduces effective interaction with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids containing amide groups or N-acylated amino groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide groups are less nucleophilic and less effective at coordinating with metal centers due to resonance stabilization. N-acylation of amino groups reduces their ability to participate in coordination, diminishing the modifier's effectiveness.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids where the carboxyl group is directly attached to a nitrogen-containing aromatic ring** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen can coordinate with metal centers through the nitrogen lone pair, providing additional binding interactions that enhance catalyst activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Counterexamples*:
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (**Low Yield**; the carboxyl group is not directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring, reducing the potential for effective coordination)

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups directly attached to the ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups are reactive and can engage in side reactions or inhibit coordination by interacting with metal centers in undesired ways, negatively impacting catalyst performance.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with fluorinated alkyl chains (perfluoroalkyl groups) or trifluoroacetyl substituents** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Highly electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups significantly stabilize the carboxylate anion, decreasing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. They may also introduce steric bulk and hydrophobicity that hinder effective interaction with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
    - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages or flexible chains containing multiple oxygen atoms** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether linkages increase chain flexibility and may disrupt the optimal positioning of the carboxyl group for coordination. The presence of multiple oxygen atoms can lead to unfavorable conformations or compete with the carboxyl group for metal interaction.
  - *Examples*:
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids substituted with an aromatic ring connected via an aliphatic linker of four or more carbons** predict a **high yield** if the aromatic ring is electron-deficient.
  - *Rationale*: A longer aliphatic linker distances the aromatic ring from the carboxyl group, reducing steric hindrance and electronic interference. Electron-deficient aromatic rings can enhance metal coordination through π-acceptor interactions.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid (despite the hydroxy group, the increased distance reduces its electron-donating effect)

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with a ketone or additional carboxyl groups in the chain** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Additional carbonyl groups introduce competing coordination sites and can form internal chelates or complexes that interfere with the modifier's ability to interact effectively with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (**Exception**; despite being a dicarboxylic acid, the presence of a free amino group near the carboxyl groups enhances coordination, resulting in a **high yield**)

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group can participate in hydrogen bonding and additional coordination with metal centers, strengthening the modifier-catalyst interaction and improving solubility.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-rich groups (e.g., hydroxy, methoxy) directly attached to the ring in close proximity to the carboxyl group (ortho or meta positions)** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-rich substituents can interfere with metal coordination by increasing electron density on the ring, making the carboxyl group less acidic and less effective at binding. They may also engage in intramolecular hydrogen bonding, reducing availability for coordination.
  - *Examples*:
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid
    - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid (**Exception**; despite the electron-rich ring, this modifier predicts a **high yield**, possibly due to the benzofuran structure facilitating coordination)

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **small heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing additional electronegative atoms (e.g., oxygen) in the ring** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The presence of electronegative atoms in the ring can facilitate additional coordination sites and enhance interaction with the metal center through lone pair donation.
  - *Examples*:
    - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- ** Advice 1 **: **Refine Rule 12 by updating SMARTS patterns to correctly identify exceptions like L-Aspartic acid and L-Glutamic acid.** Create exception patterns that match molecules with free amino groups adjacent to carboxyl groups ([NH2][CH2][CH2]C(=O)O), ensuring these dicarboxylic acids are predicted to have high yield due to enhanced coordination despite being dicarboxylic acids.

- ** Advice 2 **: **Implement a conflict resolution strategy for molecules matching multiple rules with opposing predictions.** Assign priority levels to rules based on their statistical confidence, support, or chemical significance. When a molecule matches conflicting rules, the rule with higher priority should determine the prediction. This approach ensures consistent and accurate predictions.

- ** Advice 3 **: **Review and expand SMARTS patterns for electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups to include all relevant substituents.** Update patterns to detect groups like cyano (–C#N), halogens (–F, –Cl, –Br, –I), nitro (–NO₂), and alkoxy (–OR) groups. Ensure that these patterns capture the electronic effects of substituents accurately, enhancing the prediction of yield based on substituent nature.

- ** Advice 4 **: **Enhance SMARTS patterns to specify exact positions of substituents on aromatic rings.** Refine patterns to detect ortho, meta, or para positions relative to the carboxyl group. For example, modify patterns to specifically identify para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids when required by the rule, improving the accuracy of predictions based on substituent positions.

- ** Advice 5 **: **Refine Rule 5 by adjusting chain length criteria and specifying types of polar functional groups that impact yield.** Reevaluate the threshold for the carbon chain length (e.g., from greater than five to greater than six carbons) and specify which polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) negatively affect coordination when located beyond three carbons from the carboxyl group. This refinement will improve the rule's accuracy in predicting low yield modifiers.

- ** Advice 6 **: **Modify Rule 6 to differentiate between types of amide groups and their positions relative to the carboxyl group.** Specify whether the amide is primary, secondary, or tertiary, as coordination abilities differ. Adjust the rule to account for decreased coordination when amide groups are adjacent to the carboxyl group due to resonance stabilization, improving the rule’s predictive accuracy.

- ** Advice 7 **: **Reevaluate Rule 10 by considering chain rigidity and the potential benefits of additional oxygen atoms.** Modify the rule to recognize cases where ether linkages do not hinder coordination significantly or where multiple oxygen atoms enhance solubility and coordination. Incorporate criteria that assess whether chain flexibility adversely affects coordination to improve yield predictions.

- ** Advice 8 **: **Update SMARTS patterns for heteroaromatic carboxylic acids to accurately detect coordinating heteroatoms and ring attachments.** Ensure patterns can identify heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen or oxygen atoms where the carboxyl group is directly attached. Include detection of fused ring systems and variations in ring size to enhance the accuracy of rules involving heteroaromatic modifiers.

- ** Advice 9 **: **Balance support and confidence by generalizing certain rule conditions carefully.** Expand rule coverage by slightly relaxing stringent conditions without significantly reducing confidence and lift. For example, adjust numerical thresholds or include additional but relevant functional groups to increase the number of data points covered by the rules.

- ** Advice 10 **: **Utilize feature importance analysis to identify key molecular features influencing yield.** Use statistical methods like SHAP values to prioritize rule adjustments based on the most impactful molecular features. Focus refinement efforts on these features to enhance the overall predictive performance of the rules.

- ** Advice 11 **: **Iteratively test and validate rule changes while monitoring performance metrics.** After each rule adjustment, evaluate the impact on accuracy, support, confidence, and lift. Use separate validation and test sets to ensure that the rules generalize well to unseen data and to avoid overfitting.

- ** Advice 12 **: **Consult chemists and domain experts to validate chemical plausibility of rules and adjustments.** Incorporate insights on coordination chemistry and reaction mechanisms to inform rule refinements. This collaboration ensures that the rules are chemically sound and that the modifications align with practical chemical knowledge.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with a free (unprotected) primary amino group located within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The presence of a free amino group near the carboxyl group allows for effective coordination with metal centers in the catalyst, enhancing stability and catalytic activity. The proximity facilitates chelation, improving interaction with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (L-Aspartic acid)
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (L-Glutamic acid)
    - 5-aminopentanoic acid
    - 4-aminobenzoic acid
    - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (L-Tryptophan)
  - *Counterexamples*:
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (**Low Yield**; amino group is N-acetylated, reducing coordination ability)
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid (**Low Yield**; amino group is distant from the carboxyl group)

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) at the para position relative to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing deprotonation and coordination with metal centers. This strengthens the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst, improving activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
    - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - *Counterexample*:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid (**Low Yield**; the aldehyde group is reactive and may interfere with coordination)

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, sulfanyl) at the para position relative to the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening its ability to deprotonate and coordinate with metal centers. This reduces interaction with the catalyst, lowering activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Counterexample*:
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid (**High Yield**; the hydroxyl group is distanced by a longer aliphatic chain, mitigating its electron-donating effect)

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 5 to 8 carbons and no additional functional groups** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Long-chain aliphatic acids can coordinate effectively with metal centers without significant steric hindrance. Their hydrophobic nature may also favor interactions within the reaction medium.
  - *Example*:
    - Octanoic acid

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) located beyond three carbons from the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Functional groups distant from the carboxyl group do not contribute effectively to coordination and may introduce steric hindrance or conformational flexibility that reduces effective interaction with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids where the carboxyl group is directly attached to a nitrogen-containing aromatic ring** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic rings can coordinate with metal centers through the nitrogen lone pair, providing additional binding interactions that enhance catalytic activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with perfluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoroacetyl substituents** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Highly electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups significantly stabilize the carboxylate anion, decreasing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. They may also introduce steric bulk and hydrophobicity that hinder effective interaction with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
    - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with flexible ether linkages in the chain** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether linkages increase chain flexibility and may disrupt the optimal positioning of the carboxyl group for coordination. The presence of multiple oxygen atoms can lead to unfavorable conformations or compete with the carboxyl group for metal interaction.
  - *Examples*:
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups directly attached to the ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups are reactive and can engage in side reactions or inhibit coordination by interacting with metal centers in undesired ways, negatively impacting catalyst performance.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with a chain length of four carbons or more, substituted with an aromatic ring at the terminal position, predict a high yield**, regardless of substituents on the aromatic ring.
  - *Rationale*: A longer aliphatic linker distances the aromatic ring from the carboxyl group, reducing steric hindrance and electronic interference. This allows the carboxyl group to coordinate effectively with the metal center.
  - *Examples*:
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Counterexample*:
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (**Low Yield**; shorter chain length increases electronic effects and steric hindrance)

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with a ketone group in the chain** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Additional carbonyl groups introduce competing coordination sites and can form internal chelates or complexes that interfere with the modifier's ability to interact effectively with the catalyst.
  - *Example*:
    - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group can participate in hydrogen bonding and additional coordination with metal centers, strengthening the modifier-catalyst interaction and improving solubility.
  - *Example*:
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **N-acetylated amino acids or contain amide bonds involving the amino group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: N-acetylation or amide formation reduces the availability of the amino group for coordination with metal centers, diminishing the modifier's effectiveness.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing additional oxygen atoms within the ring structure** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The presence of additional heteroatoms like oxygen can facilitate coordination through lone pair interactions, enhancing the binding to metal centers.
  - *Examples*:
    - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at positions other than the para position (e.g., ortho or meta) may have variable effects on yield and require further analysis**.
  - *Rationale*: The influence of electron-donating groups on coordination ability can depend on their position relative to the carboxyl group, affecting acidity and steric factors in complex ways.
  - *Example*:
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (**Low Yield**; complex electronic effects due to substituent positions)

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows for straightforward prediction of high yield based on the presence of a free primary amino group within three carbons of a carboxyl group. The physical-chemical rationale is sound, as the proximity facilitates effective coordination with metal centers. The rule considers a combination of sub-structures, specifically the spatial relationship between amino and carboxyl groups. It is well-supported by multiple data points, enhancing its reliability.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear and specifies that modifiers are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position. The physical-chemical insight is adequate, as electron-withdrawing groups increase acidity and coordination ability. This rule considers the combination of sub-structures—both the aromatic ring and the para substituent—adding appropriate complexity. It is supported by at least two data points, making it reliable, and maintains a good balance between specificity and coverage.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 clearly states that aromatic carboxylic acids bearing electron-donating groups at the para position result in low yield, with the exception of cases where the donating group is distanced by a longer chain. The rule provides sound physical-chemical insight, linking electron-donating effects to decreased acidity and coordination ability. It appropriately combines structural elements, and is supported by multiple data points including a counterexample that strengthens the rule's validity. The balance between specificity and generality is well-maintained.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear and straightforward, predicting high yield for aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 5–8 carbons and no additional functional groups. While the physical-chemical rationale is plausible, the rule is only supported by a single data point (octanoic acid), which weakens its reliability. According to the coverage criterion, the rule lacks sufficient data to be considered robust. Expanding the dataset or identifying additional supporting examples would strengthen this rule.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 clearly defines modifiers with polar functional groups beyond three carbons from the carboxyl group predicting low yield. The physical-chemical insight is adequate, suggesting that distant functional groups do not enhance coordination and may introduce unfavorable effects. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures and is supported by multiple data points, satisfying the coverage criterion. The rule effectively balances complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clearly defined, specifying heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to nitrogen-containing rings predicting high yield. The rationale is sound, emphasizing the additional coordination via nitrogen lone pairs. This rule combines specific substructures and is well-supported by multiple data points, satisfying both the complexity and coverage criteria.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 clearly identifies that perfluorinated carboxylic acids or those with trifluoroacetyl groups predict low yield. The rationale is appropriate, as the electron-withdrawing effects could reduce coordination ability. The rule accounts for specific substructures, fulfilling the complexity criterion, and is supported by at least two data points, satisfying coverage.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 specifies that aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages predict low yield. The rationale is plausible, citing increased flexibility and potential competition for metal coordination. The rule includes combinations of substructures and is supported by multiple data points, fulfilling the complexity and coverage criteria while maintaining a good balance.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clearly defined, stating that aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups on the ring predict low yield. The rationale is sound, as aldehyde groups can interfere with coordination. The rule considers specific substructures and is well-supported by data points, fulfilling both the complexity and coverage criteria.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clearly articulated, predicting high yield for aliphatic carboxylic acids with long chains bearing terminal aromatic rings, regardless of ring substituents. The rationale is plausible, emphasizing the role of chain length in mitigating steric and electronic effects. The rule combines substructures and is supported by data, including a counterexample that reinforces its specificity. It achieves a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clearly defined, predicting low yield for aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with ketone groups. The rationale is acceptable, highlighting competing coordination sites. However, the rule is only supported by a single data point, which limits its robustness according to the coverage criterion. Additional data points would enhance its validity.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is clearly stated and provides a rationale for polyhydroxy carboxylic acids predicting high yield. However, it is only supported by a single data point, which falls short of the coverage criterion. To enhance the rule's reliability, additional examples are necessary.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 clearly predicts low yield for N-acetylated amino acids or those with amide bonds involving the amino group. The rationale is sound, explaining diminished coordination ability. The rule is supported by multiple data points, satisfying both the complexity and coverage criteria.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 is clear, indicating that heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with additional oxygen atoms in the ring predict high yield. The rationale is plausible, focusing on enhanced coordination via oxygen lone pairs. The rule considers specific substructures and is supported by at least two data points, fulfilling both complexity and coverage criteria.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 lacks clarity in prediction, stating that modifiers may have variable effects requiring further analysis. While the rationale acknowledges complex electronic effects based on substituent positions, the rule does not provide a clear guideline for prediction. It is only supported by a single data point, failing to meet the coverage criterion. The rule's complexity is high relative to its practical utility, suggesting it needs refinement or additional data to be effective.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with a free (unprotected) primary amino group located within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The presence of a free amino group near the carboxyl group allows for effective coordination with metal centers in the catalyst, enhancing stability and catalytic activity. The proximity facilitates chelation, improving interaction with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (L-Aspartic acid)
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (L-Glutamic acid)
    - 5-aminopentanoic acid
    - 4-aminobenzoic acid
    - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (L-Tryptophan)
  - *Counterexamples*:
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (**Low Yield**; amino group is N-acetylated, reducing coordination ability)
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid (**Low Yield**; amino group is distant from the carboxyl group)

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) at the para position relative to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing deprotonation and coordination with metal centers. This strengthens the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst, improving activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
    - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - *Counterexample*:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid (**Low Yield**; the aldehyde group is reactive and may interfere with coordination)

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, sulfanyl) at the para position relative to the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening its ability to deprotonate and coordinate with metal centers. This reduces interaction with the catalyst, lowering activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *Counterexample*:
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid (**High Yield**; the hydroxyl group is distanced by a longer aliphatic chain, mitigating its electron-donating effect)

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 5 to 8 carbons and no additional functional groups** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Long-chain aliphatic acids can coordinate effectively with metal centers without significant steric hindrance. Their hydrophobic nature may also favor interactions within the reaction medium.
  - *Example*:
    - Octanoic acid

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) located beyond three carbons from the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Functional groups distant from the carboxyl group do not contribute effectively to coordination and may introduce steric hindrance or conformational flexibility that reduces effective interaction with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids where the carboxyl group is directly attached to a nitrogen-containing aromatic ring** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic rings can coordinate with metal centers through the nitrogen lone pair, providing additional binding interactions that enhance catalytic activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with perfluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoroacetyl substituents** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Highly electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups significantly stabilize the carboxylate anion, decreasing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. They may also introduce steric bulk and hydrophobicity that hinder effective interaction with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
    - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with flexible ether linkages in the chain** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether linkages increase chain flexibility and may disrupt the optimal positioning of the carboxyl group for coordination. The presence of multiple oxygen atoms can lead to unfavorable conformations or compete with the carboxyl group for metal interaction.
  - *Examples*:
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups directly attached to the ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups are reactive and can engage in side reactions or inhibit coordination by interacting with metal centers in undesired ways, negatively impacting catalyst performance.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with a chain length of four carbons or more, substituted with an aromatic ring at the terminal position, predict a high yield**, regardless of substituents on the aromatic ring.
  - *Rationale*: A longer aliphatic linker distances the aromatic ring from the carboxyl group, reducing steric hindrance and electronic interference. This allows the carboxyl group to coordinate effectively with the metal center.
  - *Examples*:
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Counterexample*:
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (**Low Yield**; shorter chain length increases electronic effects and steric hindrance)

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with a ketone group in the chain** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Additional carbonyl groups introduce competing coordination sites and can form internal chelates or complexes that interfere with the modifier's ability to interact effectively with the catalyst.
  - *Example*:
    - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group can participate in hydrogen bonding and additional coordination with metal centers, strengthening the modifier-catalyst interaction and improving solubility.
  - *Example*:
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **N-acetylated amino acids or contain amide bonds involving the amino group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: N-acetylation or amide formation reduces the availability of the amino group for coordination with metal centers, diminishing the modifier's effectiveness.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing additional oxygen atoms within the ring structure** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The presence of additional heteroatoms like oxygen can facilitate coordination through lone pair interactions, enhancing the binding to metal centers.
  - *Examples*:
    - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at positions other than the para position (e.g., ortho or meta) may have variable effects on yield and require further analysis**.
  - *Rationale*: The influence of electron-donating groups on coordination ability can depend on their position relative to the carboxyl group, affecting acidity and steric factors in complex ways.
  - *Example*:
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (**Low Yield**; complex electronic effects due to substituent positions)

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: *Adjust Rule 1 to Include Aromatic Systems*

  The current implementation of **Rule 1** does not account for molecules where the carboxylic acid and the primary amino group are attached directly to an aromatic ring, such as in 4-aminobenzoic acid. To fix this, the SMARTS pattern for the carboxylic acid should include aromatic bonds, and the path length calculation should consider traversing through aromatic systems.

  **Proposed Changes**:
  
  - **Update the carboxylic acid pattern** to include aromatic carbons:

    ```python
    patterns['Rule 1']['ca_pattern'] = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[c,CX3](=O)[O;H1,-]')
    ```

  - **Modify the path length calculation** to correctly compute distances through rings:

    Ensure that `GetShortestPath` correctly handles aromatic systems by verifying that the molecule is sanitized and kekulized if necessary.

- **Suggestion 2**: *Correct Substituent Position Identification in Rules 2 and 3*

  The current code for **Rules 2 and 3** does not accurately identify substituents at the para position relative to the carboxyl group on aromatic rings. The method of checking substituents and their positions needs refinement.

  **Proposed Changes**:

  - **Use atom mapping to identify positions** on the aromatic ring:

    Map the positions of the ring atoms and assign numerical positions to them (e.g., positions 1 to 6 on a benzene ring).

  - **Calculate the relative positions** of substituents:

    Determine the absolute difference in positions between the carboxyl group and other substituents, accounting for ring size.

    ```python
    # Example for a six-membered ring
    para_positions = [(ca_pos + 3) % ring_size]
    ```

  - **Check for specific substituents at these positions**:

    Modify the code to search for electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups specifically at the para position calculated.

- **Suggestion 3**: *Fix Chain Length Calculation in Rule 4*

  The current implementation of **Rule 4** does not correctly calculate the aliphatic chain length of carboxylic acids. The code needs a more reliable method to determine the number of carbons in the longest carbon chain starting from the carboxyl carbon.

  **Proposed Changes**:

  - **Use RDKit's `GetLongestChain` method or implement a custom function**:

    Traverse the molecule starting from the carboxyl carbon to find the longest path consisting of sp³ hybridized carbons.

    ```python
    from rdkit.Chem import rdmolops

    def get_longest_chain_length(mol, start_atom_idx):
        lengths = []
        paths = Chem.rdmolops.FindAllPathsOfLengthN(mol, n, useBonds=False)
        for path in paths:
            if start_atom_idx in path:
                lengths.append(len(path))
        return max(lengths)
    ```

  - **Exclude functional groups properly**:

    Ensure that only carbon atoms are counted in the chain, and that functional groups are not included in the chain length.

- **Suggestion 4**: *Refine Polar Functional Group Matching in Rule 5*

  For **Rule 5**, the code may incorrectly identify molecules where polar functional groups are within three carbons of the carboxyl group. The SMARTS patterns and distance calculations need refinement.

  **Proposed Changes**:

  - **Modify the polar functional group patterns** to be more specific if necessary (e.g., distinguish between different types of oxygens and nitrogens).

  - **Adjust the distance criteria** to ensure that only polar groups beyond three carbons are considered:

    ```python
    if len(path) - 1 >= 4:
        rule5_match = -1  # Low yield
    ```

  - **Include checks to prevent counting the same functional group multiple times or misidentifying adjacent groups**.

- **Suggestion 5**: *Implement Remaining Rules (6 to 15) and Verify Zero Entries*

  Since the feature matrix includes columns for **Rules 6 to 15**, but these are not implemented in the code, the entries are all zeros. This may lead to confusion.

  **Proposed Changes**:

  - **Implement the remaining rules** in the code to match the feature matrix columns.

  - **Alternatively, adjust the feature matrix** to include only the implemented rules to avoid misleading zeros.

- **Suggestion 6**: *Enhance Error Handling and Molecule Parsing*

  Some molecules may not be parsed correctly, leading to rows of zeros in the feature matrix.

  **Proposed Changes**:

  - **Include error handling for molecule parsing**:

    ```python
    mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smi)
    if mol is None:
        print(f"Warning: Could not parse SMILES {smi}")
        results.append([0]*number_of_rules)
        continue
    ```

  - **Ensure molecules are sanitized and kekulized** where necessary to improve substructure matching.

- **Suggestion 7**: *Validate SMARTS Patterns Against Chemical Logic*

  Review all SMARTS patterns to confirm they accurately represent the intended functional groups.

  **Proposed Changes**:

  - **For Rule 1**, ensure that the amino group is a primary amine (not substituted) and not part of an amide:

    ```python
    patterns['Rule 1']['pa_pattern'] = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[NX3;H2;!$(N-C=O)]')
    ```

  - **For Rule 2 and 3**, refine EWG and EDG patterns to match specific substituents:

    ```python
    # EWG examples
    patterns['Rule 2']['ewg_patterns'] = [
        Chem.MolFromSmarts('[N+](=O)[O-]'),  # Nitro group
        Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CH2]Br')        # Bromomethyl group
    ]
    # EDG examples
    patterns['Rule 3']['edg_patterns'] = [
        Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CH3]'),         # Methyl group
        Chem.MolFromSmarts('[SH]')           # Sulfanyl group (-SH)
    ]
    ```

  - **Test SMARTS patterns individually** on known compounds to ensure they match correctly.

** End of Suggestions **
---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Revise Rules Using SMARTS Patterns for Precise Feature Extraction**

  Redefine each rule using SMARTS (SMiles ARbitrary Target Specification) patterns to characterize the chemical features associated with high or low yield. SMARTS patterns allow for exact matching of substructures within SMILES representations, facilitating automated and consistent feature extraction. For example:

  - **Rule 1 Revised**: Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group (`C(=O)O`) and a free primary amino group (`[NH2]`) within three carbon atoms of the carboxyl group can be represented by a SMARTS pattern like `C(=O)OCCCN`.

- **Advice 2**: **Quantify Electronic Effects with Molecular Descriptors**

  Replace qualitative descriptions of electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups with quantitative molecular descriptors. Use parameters such as Hammett sigma constants, Mulliken charges, or calculated molecular electrostatic potentials. These descriptors can be numerically quantified and directly used in feature matrices.

- **Advice 3**: **Standardize Chain Lengths with Specific Numeric Ranges**

  Specify exact chain length ranges in the rules to eliminate ambiguity. For instance:

  - **Rule 4 Revised**: Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with unbranched carbon chains of length **n = 5 to 8** (inclusive) and no additional functional groups predict a high yield.

- **Advice 4**: **Simplify and Consolidate Overlapping Rules**

  Identify and merge rules with overlapping features to create a streamlined rule set. For example, combine rules related to aromatic carboxylic acids with substituents affecting electron density:

  - **New Rule**: Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with substituents having a Hammett sigma constant (σ) of **σ_p ≥ +0.4** predict high yield; those with **σ_p ≤ -0.1** predict low yield.

- **Advice 5**: **Define Clear Numerical Thresholds for Functional Group Positions**

  Specify the exact positional relationships between functional groups. Replace terms like "located within three carbons" with explicit numerical values:

  - Functional groups within **three bonds** from the carboxyl group.
  - Use molecular graphs to calculate the shortest path between functional groups.

- **Advice 6**: **Utilize Cheminformatics Tools for Automated Feature Generation**

  Implement cheminformatics libraries like RDKit to parse SMILES strings and extract features based on the revised rules. By programming the SMARTS patterns and numerical thresholds into scripts, you can automate the generation of the numerical feature matrix efficiently.

- **Advice 7**: **Incorporate Descriptors Reflecting Steric and Electronic Properties**

  Introduce molecular descriptors that capture steric hindrance (e.g., molar volume, steric parameters) and electronic properties (e.g., HOMO-LUMO gap, partial charges). These descriptors can be computed and included in your feature matrix to provide a more comprehensive understanding of factors affecting yield.

- **Advice 8**: **Develop a Hierarchical Rule Structure**

  Organize rules hierarchically from general to specific. Start with broad classifications (e.g., aliphatic vs. aromatic acids) and narrow down to specific functional group positions and types. This structure aids in systematic feature extraction and analysis.

- **Advice 9**: **Provide Computational Examples for Each Rule**

  For each rule, include a computational example demonstrating how the rule translates into numerical features. Show the SMARTS pattern, the feature extraction process, and how the presence or absence of the feature correlates with yield.

  - *Example for Revised Rule 1*:
    - **Modifier**: L-Aspartic acid
    - **SMILES**: `NC(CC(=O)O)C(=O)O`
    - **Features Extracted**:
      - Free primary amino group within three bonds of carboxyl group: **Yes (1)**
      - Predicted yield: **High**

- **Advice 10**: **Align Rules with Statistically Significant Features**

  Analyze the dataset using statistical methods to identify which features significantly correlate with high or low yield. Adjust the rules to emphasize these features, ensuring that the rule set is data-driven and grounded in empirical evidence.

- **Advice 11**: **Incorporate Solubility and Hydrophobicity Descriptors**

  Include descriptors like LogP (octanol-water partition coefficient) and polar surface area, which may influence the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst. These descriptors can provide insights into non-covalent interactions affecting yield.

- **Advice 12**: **Address Exceptions and Anomalies in the Dataset**

  Examine modifiers that do not fit the current rules and determine if new rules are needed or existing ones should be modified. For instance, if a compound predicted to have a high yield based on the rules actually shows low yield, investigate possible reasons (e.g., steric hindrance, side reactions) and adjust the rules accordingly.

- **Advice 13**: **Implement Machine Learning Models for Rule Refinement**

  Use machine learning algorithms to model the relationship between molecular features and reaction yield. Techniques like decision trees or random forests can handle complex interactions and may reveal new patterns not captured by the current rules.

- **Advice 14**: **Continuously Update Rules Based on New Data**

  As more experimental data become available, revisit and refine the rules. Dynamic rule sets that evolve with new findings will remain relevant and improve predictive accuracy over time.

  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxyl group, enhancing interaction with the catalyst. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and coordination ability, reducing effectiveness.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
    - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to a nitrogen-containing aromatic ring** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in the aromatic ring can coordinate with metal centers, providing additional binding interactions that enhance catalytic activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Counterexample*:
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (**Low Yield**; carboxyl group is not directly attached to the nitrogen-containing ring)

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 5 to 8 carbons and no additional functional groups** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Such modifiers can coordinate effectively with metal centers without steric hindrance from additional functional groups. Their hydrophobic nature may also favor interactions within the reaction medium.
  - *Example*:
    - Octanoic acid
  - *Counterexamples*:
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid (**Low Yield**; presence of hydroxyl group introduces polarity and potential hydrogen bonding)
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid (**Low Yield**; amino group distant from carboxyl group, reducing effective coordination)

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) located beyond three carbons from the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Functional groups distant from the carboxyl group have reduced ability to participate in effective coordination with the catalyst and may introduce steric hindrance or conformational flexibility that diminishes interaction.
  - *Examples*:
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with flexible ether linkages in the chain** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether linkages increase chain flexibility and introduce polar oxygen atoms that can disrupt the positioning of the carboxyl group for optimal coordination with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with perfluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoroacetyl substituents** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Strongly electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups reduce the nucleophilicity of the carboxylate anion, decreasing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. They may also increase steric bulk and hydrophobicity, hindering effective interaction with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
    - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups directly attached to the ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups are reactive and can engage in side reactions or interfere with metal coordination, negatively impacting catalyst performance.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **N-acetylated amino acids or contain amide bonds involving the amino group near the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: N-acetylation or amide formation reduces the availability of the amino group for coordination with metal centers, diminishing the modifier's effectiveness.
  - *Examples*:
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with a chain length of four carbons or more, substituted with an aromatic ring at the terminal position, predict a **high yield**, regardless of substituents on the aromatic ring.
  - *Rationale*: A longer aliphatic linker distances the aromatic ring from the carboxyl group, reducing steric hindrance and electronic interference, allowing effective coordination with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Counterexample*:
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (**Low Yield**; shorter chain increases electronic effects and steric hindrance)

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with additional carbonyl groups in the chain** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Additional carbonyl groups introduce competing coordination sites and can form internal chelates, interfering with the modifier's ability to interact effectively with the catalyst.
  - *Example*:
    - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups can enhance coordination through hydrogen bonding and additional interactions with metal centers, strengthening the modifier-catalyst interaction.
  - *Example*:
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing additional oxygen atoms within the ring structure, with the carboxyl group directly attached to the ring** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Additional heteroatoms like oxygen in the ring can participate in coordination through lone pair interactions, enhancing binding to metal centers.
  - *Examples*:
    - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar functional groups (e.g., sulfhydryl) located within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Polar functional groups near the carboxyl group enhance coordination ability through additional interaction sites.
  - *Example*:
    - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at positions other than the para position (e.g., ortho or meta) may have variable effects on yield and require further analysis**.
  - *Rationale*: The influence of electron-donating groups on coordination ability can depend on their position relative to the carboxyl group, affecting acidity and steric factors in complex ways.
  - *Example*:
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (**Low Yield**; complex electronic effects due to substituent positions)

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Translate Qualitative Rules into Quantitative Descriptors**

  Revise the current rules to define molecular features in terms of quantifiable descriptors that can be directly calculated from SMILES strings. For instance, specify numerical thresholds for properties like pKa, logP, or molecular weight, which can be used to generate a numeric feature matrix.

- **Advice 2**: **Encode Functional Groups as Binary or Count Features**

  Convert the presence of specific functional groups or structural motifs into binary (0 or 1) or count-based features. For example:
  
  - Create features like "Has primary amino group within three carbons of carboxyl group (Yes=1, No=0)."
  - Count the number of electron-withdrawing groups attached to an aromatic ring.

- **Advice 3**: **Utilize Molecular Fingerprints and Descriptors**

  Employ cheminformatics tools (e.g., RDKit) to calculate molecular fingerprints (e.g., Morgan fingerprints) and a standardized set of molecular descriptors for each modifier. This approach transforms molecular structures into high-dimensional numeric vectors suitable for modeling.

- **Advice 4**: **Simplify and Consolidate Rules**

  Review and streamline the existing rules to eliminate redundancy and overlap. Consolidate rules that address similar features to simplify the feature extraction process. For example, combine Rules 2 and 15 by creating a feature that counts electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups at all positions on the aromatic ring.

- **Advice 5**: **Incorporate Distance Metrics**

  Quantify the spatial relationships between functional groups using distance metrics. Calculate the number of bonds between key functional groups (e.g., between amino and carboxyl groups) to create numerical features that capture proximity effects.

- **Advice 6**: **Quantify Steric and Electronic Effects**

  Include descriptors that measure steric hindrance (e.g., bulkiness of substituents, calculated via van der Waals volumes) and electronic properties (e.g., electron density, partial charges) to numerically represent the effects described qualitatively in the current rules.

- **Advice 7**: **Define Clear Numeric Thresholds for Chain Lengths**

  Instead of categorical statements like "chain lengths of 5 to 8 carbons," define a numeric feature for chain length and identify optimal ranges through data analysis. This allows for more precise modeling and the possibility of discovering nonlinear relationships.

- **Advice 8**: **Address Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding Numerically**

  Quantify the polarity and hydrogen-bonding capacity of modifiers using descriptors like the number of hydrogen bond donors/acceptors or the topological polar surface area (TPSA). This provides a numeric basis for the effects of polar functional groups.

- **Advice 9**: **Use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for Feature Reduction**

  After calculating a comprehensive set of descriptors, apply PCA or other dimensionality reduction techniques to identify the most influential features. This can simplify the feature matrix while retaining the critical information needed for modeling.

- **Advice 10**: **Create a Standardized Feature Extraction Protocol**

  Develop a consistent procedure for feature extraction that includes all relevant descriptors. Ensure that this protocol is applied uniformly across all modifiers to maintain data integrity and facilitate model training.

  - *Examples*:
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (L-Aspartic acid)
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (L-Glutamic acid)
    - 5-aminopentanoic acid
    - 4-aminobenzoic acid
  - *Counterexamples*:
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid (**Low Yield**; amino group is distant from the carboxyl group)

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) at the para position relative to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**, while those with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy, sulfhydryl) at the same position predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxyl group, enhancing interaction with the catalyst. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and coordination ability, reducing effectiveness.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
    - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to a nitrogen-containing aromatic ring** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in the aromatic ring can coordinate with metal centers, providing additional binding interactions that enhance catalytic activity.
  - *Examples*:
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid

    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (**Low Yield**; carboxyl group is not directly attached to the nitrogen-containing ring)

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 5 to 8 carbons and no additional functional groups** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Such modifiers can coordinate effectively with metal centers without steric hindrance from additional functional groups. Their hydrophobic nature may also favor interactions within the reaction medium.
  - *Example*:
    - Octanoic acid
  - *Counterexamples*:
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid (**Low Yield**; presence of hydroxyl group introduces polarity and potential hydrogen bonding)
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid (**Low Yield**; amino group distant from the carboxyl group)

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino, sulfhydryl) located within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**, while those with such groups located further away predict a **low yield**.

  - *Examples*:
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with perfluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoroacetyl substituents** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Strongly electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups reduce the nucleophilicity of the carboxylate anion, decreasing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. They may also increase steric bulk and hydrophobicity, hindering effective interaction with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
    - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups directly attached to the ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups are reactive and can engage in side reactions or interfere with metal coordination, negatively impacting catalyst performance.
  - *Examples*:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **N-acetylated amino acids or contain amide bonds involving the amino group near the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with an aromatic ring attached via a chain of four carbons or more** predict a **high yield**, regardless of substituents on the aromatic ring.
  - *Rationale*: A longer aliphatic linker distances the aromatic ring from the carboxyl group, reducing steric hindrance and electronic interference, allowing effective coordination with the catalyst.
  - *Examples*:
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Counterexample*:
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (**Low Yield**; shorter chain increases electronic effects and steric hindrance)

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with additional carbonyl groups in the chain** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Additional carbonyl groups introduce competing coordination sites and can form internal chelates, interfering with the modifier's ability to interact effectively with the catalyst.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear, with a specific structural description—carboxylic acids with a free (unprotected) primary amino group within three carbons of the carboxyl group—making it straightforward to determine whether a modifier predicts high yield. The property insight is adequate, as the proximity of amino and carboxyl groups enhances coordination with metal centers in the catalyst. The rule considers combinations of functional groups, satisfying the complexity criterion. It is supported by multiple data points (four high yield examples and two low yield counterexamples), ensuring good coverage. Overall, Rule 1 is well-formulated with a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear in specifying that aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position predict high yield, while those with electron-donating groups predict low yield. The property insight logically connects the electronic effects of substituents to the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxyl group. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures (aromatic ring, carboxylic acid, para substituents), meeting the complexity criterion. Coverage includes multiple examples for both high and low yield, supporting the rule's validity. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 provides clear guidance by specifying that heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to a nitrogen-containing aromatic ring predict high yield. The property insight is sound, highlighting the role of nitrogen atoms in coordinating with metal centers. The rule combines multiple structural features, satisfying the complexity criterion. Coverage includes two high yield examples and one low yield counterexample, which strengthens the rule's reliability. The balance between complexity and coverage is acceptable.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear in its description of aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 5 to 8 carbons and no additional functional groups predicting high yield. The property insight is plausible, explaining minimal steric hindrance and favorable hydrophobic interactions within the reaction medium. However, the rule lacks sufficient coverage, as it is supported by only one high yield example. This weakens confidence in the rule's general applicability. While the rule meets the complexity criterion by considering the absence of additional functional groups, the limited coverage suggests that more supporting data are needed to validate this rule.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 specifies that aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar functional groups within three carbons of the carboxyl group predict high yield, while those with such groups further away predict low yield. The property insight is logical, as proximal polar groups can enhance coordination ability. Despite meeting the complexity criterion by considering combinations of functional groups and their positions, the rule has limited coverage with only one high yield example. This lack of sufficient supporting data reduces the reliability of the rule, indicating that additional examples are necessary for validation.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 clearly states that aliphatic carboxylic acids with flexible ether linkages in the carbon chain predict low yield. The property insight is reasonable, as ether linkages may disrupt the optimal positioning of the carboxyl group for effective coordination. The rule focuses on specific structural features, satisfying the complexity criterion. It is supported by two low yield examples, meeting the minimum coverage requirement. The balance between specificity and coverage is appropriate, making the rule reliable within its defined scope.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear in identifying that modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoroacetyl substituents predict low yield. The property insight is adequate, linking strong electron-withdrawing effects to reduced nucleophilicity and coordination ability of the carboxylate anion. The rule considers specific functional groups, satisfying the complexity criterion. Supported by two low yield examples, the rule meets the coverage requirement. The balance between specificity and coverage is acceptable, lending confidence to the rule's applicability.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 clearly indicates that aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups directly attached to the ring predict low yield. The property insight is logical, as reactive aldehyde groups can engage in side reactions or interfere with metal coordination. The rule involves combinations of sub-structures, meeting the complexity criterion. With two low yield examples supporting the rule, it satisfies the coverage requirement. The balance between complexity and coverage is well maintained, making the rule reliable.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 clearly states that N-acetylated amino acids or modifiers containing amide bonds involving the amino group near the carboxyl group predict low yield. The property insight is sound, as N-acetylation or amide formation reduces the availability of the amino group for coordination with metal centers. The rule considers specific structural modifications, satisfying the complexity criterion. It is supported by three low yield examples, providing adequate coverage. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate, enhancing the rule's validity.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 provides clear guidance that aliphatic carboxylic acids with an aromatic ring attached via a chain of four carbons or more predict high yield, regardless of substituents on the aromatic ring. The property insight is plausible, suggesting that a longer aliphatic linker reduces steric hindrance and electronic interference, allowing effective coordination. The rule involves combinations of structural features, satisfying the complexity criterion. Supported by two high yield examples and one low yield counterexample, the rule meets the coverage requirement. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate, reinforcing the rule's reliability.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 states that aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with additional carbonyl groups in the chain predict low yield. The property insight is reasonable, as additional carbonyl groups may introduce competing coordination sites or form internal chelates, interfering with the modifier's effectiveness. However, the rule is supported by only one low yield example, which does not meet the minimum coverage criterion. While the rule satisfies the complexity criterion by considering combinations of functional groups, the limited coverage reduces confidence in the rule, indicating a need for additional supporting data.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 specifies that polyhydroxy carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group predict high yield. The property insight is sound, as multiple hydroxyl groups can enhance coordination through hydrogen bonding and additional interactions with metal centers. Despite meeting the complexity criterion, the rule is supported by only one high yield example, failing to meet the minimum coverage requirement. This limitation suggests that more data are needed to validate the rule and increase its reliability.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Consolidate Rules with Limited Coverage**  
  Review rules that are supported by only one data point, such as Rule 4, Rule 5, Rule 11, and Rule 12. Consider combining these rules or integrating them into existing rules with similar themes. For example, merge Rule 4 (aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 5 to 8 carbons) with Rule 5 (position of polar functional groups) to create a more robust rule about chain length and functional group influence on yield.

- **Advice 2**: **Enhance Data Support for Underrepresented Rules**  
  For rules with limited supporting examples, gather additional data points to validate and strengthen these rules. This could involve experimental testing of more modifiers that fit the criteria or consulting literature to find relevant examples. Increasing the number of supporting data points will improve coverage and reliability.

- **Advice 3**: **Simplify or Eliminate Vague Rules**  
  Rules like Rule 15, which acknowledge variable effects and lack clear predictive guidance, should be revised or removed. If a rule cannot provide a definitive prediction, consider excluding it from the rule set to maintain clarity and usefulness.

- **Advice 4**: **Merge Overlapping Rules to Reduce Redundancy**  
  Identify rules that cover similar concepts and combine them to streamline the rule set. For instance, Rule 5 and Rule 14 both address the impact of polar functional groups near the carboxyl group. Merging these rules can create a more comprehensive rule about the influence of nearby polar groups on yield.

- **Advice 5**: **Standardize Rationale for Consistency**  
  Ensure that the rationales across all rules are consistent in depth and style. This helps in maintaining a uniform understanding of the underlying principles and makes the rule set more cohesive. Revise rationales to align with the level of detail provided in the most comprehensive explanations.

- **Advice 6**: **Increase Counterexamples to Strengthen Rules**  
  Where possible, add more counterexamples to each rule to illustrate exceptions and reinforce the rule's boundaries. This enhances the ability to predict outcomes accurately and understand the limitations of each rule.

- **Advice 7**: **Focus on High-Impact Functional Groups and Structural Features**  
  Prioritize rules that involve functional groups and structural features with significant influence on yield, such as amino groups, electron-withdrawing/donating substituents, and heteroaromatic rings. Refining these rules can improve predictive power and practical applicability.

- **Advice 8**: **Clarify Rules with Specific Structural Descriptors**  
  Use precise chemical terminology and structural descriptors in the rules to eliminate ambiguity. For example, specify the exact positions of substituents on aromatic rings (ortho, meta, para) and the definitions of "near" or "distant" in terms of carbon chain length.

- **Advice 9**: **Validate Rules Against Additional Data Sets**  
  Test the existing rules on new data sets or modifiers not originally included to assess their predictive accuracy. This could reveal gaps or inconsistencies that need to be addressed and improve the overall robustness of the rules.

- **Advice 10**: **Provide Visual Aids for Complex Structures**

- **Advice 1**: **Standardize Functional Group Definitions Using SMARTS Patterns**  
  To facilitate the generation of a numeric feature matrix from the rules, define all functional groups and structural features using SMARTS patterns. This allows for precise and automated identification of features within SMILES strings. For example, represent carboxylic acids, primary amines, aldehydes, etc., with specific SMARTS patterns that can be programmatically matched.

- **Advice 2**: **Quantify Distances Between Functional Groups Using Molecular Graph Paths**  
  Rules that involve the proximity of functional groups (e.g., "within three carbons") should be translated into measurable features by calculating the shortest path length between functional groups in the molecular graph. Implement algorithms to compute the number of bonds separating key functional groups to create numeric features reflecting their spatial relationships.

- **Advice 3**: **Simplify and Consolidate Overlapping Rules**  
  Review the current set of rules for overlaps and redundancies. Consolidate similar rules to reduce complexity. For instance, combine Rules 1 and 5, as both pertain to aliphatic carboxylic acids with polar functional groups near the carboxyl group. This simplification aids in creating a more streamlined feature set.

- **Advice 4**: **Create Binary Features for Presence or Absence of Key Structural Motifs**  
  For each rule, generate binary features indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of specific structural motifs. This approach simplifies the feature matrix and makes it easier to apply machine learning algorithms. For example, include features like "Has primary amine within three carbons of carboxyl group" or "Contains electron-withdrawing group at para position."

- **Advice 5**: **Incorporate Molecular Descriptors That Capture Electronic Effects**  
  Since electronic effects play a significant role (as noted in Rules 2 and 7), use molecular descriptors like Hammett sigma constants or calculate partial charges on atoms to numerically represent electron-donating or withdrawing characteristics. Software like RDKit can compute such descriptors from SMILES.

- **Advice 6**: **Represent Chain Lengths and Flexibility Numerically**  
  For rules involving carbon chain lengths and flexibility (e.g., Rules 4 and 6), include numeric features for the number of carbons in the longest aliphatic chain and counts of rotatable bonds. This quantification allows for direct numerical analysis and correlation with yields.

- **Advice 7**: **Quantify Steric Hindrance Through Molecular Volume or Surface Area**  
  To account for steric effects mentioned in several rules, calculate molecular volume or surface area descriptors. These numeric values provide a quantitative measure of steric hindrance, aiding in predicting yield based on the modifier's size.

- **Advice 8**: **Use Counts of Specific Functional Groups and Rings**  
  Generate features based on the counts of specific functional groups (e.g., hydroxyls, amines, carbonyls) and aromatic or heteroaromatic rings. This method simplifies the representation of complex molecules and aligns with several of the current rules.

- **Advice 9**: **Incorporate Topological and Geometrical Descriptors**  
  Compute topological indices (like Wiener or Balaban indices) and geometrical descriptors that capture the overall shape and connectivity of the molecules. These descriptors can reflect aspects of molecular structure that influence reactivity and yield.

- **Advice 10**: **Automate Feature Extraction Using Cheminformatics Libraries**  
  Utilize cheminformatics tools such as RDKit or Open Babel to automate the extraction of the proposed features from SMILES strings. This automation ensures consistency, reduces errors, and accelerates the data preparation process.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
    - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 5 to 8 carbons and no additional functional groups** predict a **high yield**.

- **Advice 13**: **Consider the Overall Molecular Geometry**  
  Incorporate descriptors that account for the 3D conformation of the molecules, such as dihedral angles or molecular flexibility indices, if they play a significant role in the reaction mechanism and can be computed efficiently.

- **Advice 14**: **Update Rules Based on Additional Data**  
  As more reaction data becomes available, refine the rules by validating them against experimental results. Remove rules that are consistently ineffective and strengthen those that show high predictive power.

- **Advice 15**: **Collaborate with Computational Chemists**  
  Work closely with computational chemists or data scientists to ensure that the rules are framed in a way that leverages computational capabilities. Their expertise can help in selecting appropriate descriptors and modeling techniques.

The rule is well-supported by multiple data points—entries 0, 2, 3, and 4 (high yield) and entries 33 and 34 (low yield)—demonstrating good coverage.

- **Comment 2**: *Rule 2* clearly distinguishes between electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids, correlating them with high and low yields, respectively. The chemical rationale is sound, linking acidity and coordination ability to electronic effects. The rule combines functional group type and positional information (complexity). It is supported by data points like entries 1 and 20 (high yield) and entries 10 and 22 (low yield), ensuring adequate coverage.

- **Comment 3**: *Rule 3* specifies that aliphatic carboxylic acids with chains of 6 to 8 carbons and no additional functional groups predict a high yield. The rule is clear and provides chemical insight into how chain length and absence of functional groups influence coordination without steric hindrance. It considers both chain length and functional group absence (complexity). However, coverage is limited, with octanoic acid (entry 5) as the primary example. Additional supporting data points would strengthen this rule.

- **Comment 4**: *Rule 4* is clear in stating that polar functional groups within three carbons of the carboxyl group in aliphatic acids predict a high yield, while those farther away predict a low yield. The chemical insight is strong, emphasizing the role of proximal polar groups in enhancing coordination. The rule combines the presence of polar groups with their position relative to the carboxyl group (complexity). It is supported by entries 17 (high yield) and entries 29 and 34 (low yield), indicating good coverage.

- **Comment 5**: *Rule 5* clearly identifies that aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups directly attached to the ring predict a low yield. The chemical rationale is plausible, considering potential side reactions and coordination interference by aldehydes. The rule addresses specific functional groups and their positions (complexity). It is backed by entries 18 and 19 (low yield), providing sufficient coverage.

- **Comment 6**: *Rule 6* succinctly states that modifiers with amide bonds near the carboxyl group or N-acetylated amino acids predict a low yield. The chemical insight is appropriate, reflecting the reduced availability of amino groups for coordination. The rule considers both the presence of amide bonds and their proximity (complexity). It is supported by entries 23, 26, and 33 (low yield), demonstrating adequate coverage.

- **Comment 7**: *Rule 7* is clear in indicating that aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages predict a low yield. The rule provides chemical insight into how ether linkages can disrupt coordination due to increased flexibility and polarity. It combines the presence of ether linkages within the carbon chain (complexity). Supported by entries 11 and 32 (low yield), the rule has acceptable coverage.

- **Comment 8**: *Rule 8* specifies that aliphatic carboxylic acids with an aromatic ring attached via chains of four or more carbons predict a high yield, while shorter chains predict a low yield. The rule is clear and offers chemical reasoning related to steric effects and electronic interference. It combines chain length and the presence of aromatic rings (complexity). It is supported by entries 7 and 24 (high yield) and entry 30 (low yield), providing good coverage.

- **Comment 9**: *Rule 9* clearly states that heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to a nitrogen-containing ring predict a high yield; otherwise, a low yield. The chemical rationale is sound, emphasizing direct coordination via the nitrogen atom. The rule combines ring type and attachment position (complexity). Supported by entries 15 and 21 (high yield) and entry 12 (low yield), the rule shows strong coverage.

- **Comment 10**: *Rule 10* indicates that polyhydroxy carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group predict a high yield. The rule is clear, and the chemical insight is solid, highlighting enhanced coordination through multiple interaction sites. It considers multiple adjacent functional groups (complexity). Entry 9 (high yield) supports the rule, but additional examples would improve coverage.

- **Comment 11**: *Rule 11* asserts that modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoroacetyl groups predict a low yield. The rule is clear, and the chemical rationale is acceptable, focusing on electron-withdrawing effects reducing coordination ability. However, coverage is limited, primarily supported by entry 13 (low yield). More data points are needed to strengthen this rule.

- **Comment 12**: *Rule 12* clearly states that additional carbonyl groups in the aliphatic chain predict a low yield, with the chemical insight addressing competing coordination sites. The rule considers the presence of specific functional groups within the chain (complexity). It is supported by entry 27 (low yield), but coverage is limited.

- **Comment 13**: *Rule 13* specifies that aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy groups on the ring attached via a chain of four or more carbons predict a high yield. The rule is clear, and the chemical reasoning is plausible, addressing the distancing of electron-donating groups. It combines functional groups, ring substitutions, and chain length (complexity). Supported by entry 25 (high yield), coverage is somewhat limited.

- **Comment 14**: *Rule 14* states that aromatic carboxylic acids fused with additional carbonyl-containing rings predict a high yield. The rule is clear, with chemical insight into enhanced coordination through extended conjugation. It considers complex fused ring systems (complexity). Entry 16 (high yield) supports the rule, but more examples are needed for better coverage.

- **Comment 15**: *Rule 15* describes modifiers that are complex polyfunctional carboxylic acids with multiple favorable coordination sites predicting a high yield. While the rule captures complexity and offers chemical insight into chelation effects, it lacks specificity, which may affect clarity. Supported by entry 6 (high yield), the coverage is limited, and the rule could benefit from additional examples or refinement.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with a free (unprotected) primary amino group within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The proximity of a free amino group enhances coordination with the metal center of the catalyst, improving catalytic activity.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (L-Aspartic acid)
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (L-Glutamic acid)
    - 5-aminopentanoic acid
    - 4-aminobenzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Counterexamples*:
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid (**Low Yield**; amino group is distant from the carboxyl group)
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (**Low Yield**; amino group is N-acetylated, reducing coordination ability)

- **Rule 2**: In **aromatic carboxylic acids**, the presence of **electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) at the para position** predicts a **high yield**, while **electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy, sulfhydryl) at the same position** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity and metal-binding ability of the carboxylate anion, enhancing interaction with the catalyst. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and coordination ability.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
    - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 6 to 8 carbons and no additional functional groups** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Straight-chain aliphatic acids of moderate length can effectively coordinate with the catalyst without steric hindrance from additional functional groups.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - Octanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Counterexamples*:
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid (**Low Yield**; presence of a hydroxyl group may interfere with coordination)
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid (**Low Yield**; amino group distant from carboxyl reduces coordination effectiveness)

- **Rule 4**: For **aliphatic carboxylic acids**, the presence of **polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino, sulfhydryl) within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predicts a **high yield**, while if these groups are located **more than three carbons away**, it predicts a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Polar groups near the carboxyl group enhance coordination through additional interaction sites. Distant polar groups may not contribute effectively to coordination.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups directly attached to the ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can engage in side reactions or form intramolecular interactions, interfering with metal coordination.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that contain **amide bonds involving functional groups near the carboxyl group** or are **N-acetylated amino acids** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide formation reduces the availability of amino groups for coordination, diminishing the modifier's effectiveness.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages in the carbon chain** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether linkages introduce flexibility and polar oxygen atoms that can disrupt optimal positioning of the carboxyl group for coordination.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with an aromatic ring attached via a chain of four or more carbons** predict a **high yield**, whereas those with shorter chains predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic linkers reduce electronic and steric interference from the aromatic ring, allowing effective coordination.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (**Low Yield**; shorter chain increases steric hindrance)

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to a nitrogen-containing aromatic ring** predict a **high yield**. If the carboxyl group is attached via a benzene ring or linker to the heterocycle, it predicts a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Direct attachment allows the nitrogen atom to participate in coordination with the catalyst, enhancing binding efficiency.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (**Low Yield**; carboxyl group not directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring)

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance coordination through hydrogen bonding and additional interaction sites with the catalyst.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with **perfluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoroacetyl groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Strongly electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups reduce the nucleophilicity of the carboxylate anion, decreasing coordination ability and potentially introducing steric hindrance.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
    - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that contain **additional carbonyl groups in the aliphatic chain** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Additional carbonyl groups create competing coordination sites and may form internal chelates, interfering with effective catalyst interaction.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy groups on the aromatic ring attached via an aliphatic chain of four or more carbons** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The aliphatic chain distances electron-donating methoxy groups from the carboxyl group, minimizing their impact on coordination.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids fused with additional carbonyl-containing rings** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Fused aromatic systems with carbonyl groups can enhance coordination through extended conjugation and multiple binding sites.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **complex polyfunctional carboxylic acids with multiple coordination sites positioned favorably** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple coordination sites can enhance binding through chelation effects, improving catalytic performance.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid

Matrix Checker Message:
After carefully reviewing the feature matrix generated by the current code against the provided language rules and SMILES structures, I have identified some discrepancies that indicate the transformation from language rules to the numeric feature matrix is not fully effective. Below are the detailed observations and suggestions for improvement.

**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: **Modify Rule 4 to Specifically Target Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids**

  - *Issue*: The current code for Rule 4 does not distinguish between aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids. It applies the rule to any molecule containing a carboxylic acid group, including aromatic carboxylic acids, which contradicts the natural language description of the rule.

  - *Evidence*:
    - The feature matrix shows a value of `1` for Rule 4 for SMILES 3 (`C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O`), which is an aromatic carboxylic acid. According to the rule, this should not occur.
    - The code uses the SMARTS pattern `carboxylic_acid = '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'` without distinguishing aliphatic from aromatic.

  - *Recommendation*:
    - Update the SMARTS pattern for aliphatic carboxylic acids to exclude aromatic systems. Use a pattern that ensures the carboxylic acid is attached to an aliphatic carbon:
      ```python
      aliphatic_carboxylic_acid = '[CX3;!$(C=[C,N,O,S])](=O)[OX2H1]'
      ```
    - Modify Rule 4 in the code to use `aliphatic_carboxylic_acid` instead of `carboxylic_acid`:
      ```python
      {
          'number': 4,
          'description': 'For aliphatic carboxylic acids, the presence of polar functional groups within three carbons predicts a high yield...',
          'patterns': [aliphatic_carboxylic_acid],
          'functional_groups': [hydroxyl_group, primary_amino, thiol_group],
          'distance': 4,
          'prediction': 1,
          'low_yield_prediction': -1
      }
      ```
    - Ensure that the code checks for the aliphatic nature before applying distance calculations.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Refine the Pattern Matching in Rule 2 for Substituent Positions**

  - *Issue*: The current code for Rule 2 may not accurately identify substituents at the para position due to the complexity of aromatic ring substitutions and may miss or erroneously assign electron-donating or -withdrawing groups.

  - *Recommendation*:
    - Implement a more robust method to identify substituents at the para position relative to the carboxyl group. Use SMARTS patterns with recursive queries or map indices to locate the para position.
    - For example, label the carboxyl carbon and identify the atom three bonds away in the ring:
      ```python
      aromatic_carboxylic_acid = '[c:1][c][c][c][c][c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
      ```
    - Then, for each match, identify the atom at the para position (atom mapped as `:1`) and check for substituents:
      ```python
      para_atom_idx = match[1]  # Adjust index based on mapping
      para_atom = mol.GetAtomWithIdx(para_atom_idx)
      ```
    - Check for electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups attached to `para_atom` using predefined SMARTS patterns.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Ensure Exclusion of Additional Functional Groups in Rule 3**

  - *Issue*: Rule 3 specifies no additional functional groups should be present, but the code may not comprehensively exclude all possible functional groups beyond those explicitly listed.

  - *Recommendation*:
    - Expand the `exclude_patterns` list to include other possible functional groups, such as carbonyl groups, halogens, ethers, etc.
    - Alternatively, invert the approach by defining a pattern for straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids explicitly and exclude molecules that do not match this pattern:
      ```python
      straight_chain_acid = '[CH3][CH2]{4,6}C(=O)O'  # Adjust chain length as needed
      ```
    - Use `AllChem.DeleteSubstructs()` or similar functions to remove or ignore fragments that do not fit the desired pattern.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Improve the Specificity of Functional Group Patterns**

  - *Issue*: Some SMARTS patterns used for functional groups may be too general or not accurately capture the intended groups.

  - *Recommendation*:
    - Review and refine SMARTS patterns for all functional groups to ensure they match the chemical structures accurately.
    - For example, modify the thiol group pattern to ensure it matches only free thiol groups:
      ```python
      thiol_group = '[SX2H1]'
      ```
    - Similarly, adjust the patterns for amide bonds, ethers, aldehydes, etc., to improve specificity.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Implement Error Handling for Invalid SMILES**

  - *Issue*: The current code continues processing even if `mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smi)` returns `None` due to invalid SMILES strings.

  - *Recommendation*:
    - Add error handling to skip invalid SMILES strings and possibly log a warning:
      ```python
      mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smi)
      if mol is None:
          print(f"Warning: Invalid SMILES string '{smi}'")
          results.append([0]*len(rules))
          continue
      ```

- **Suggestion 6**: **Optimize the Code for Efficiency and Readability**

  - *Issue*: The current code uses multiple nested loops and conditionals, which can be simplified for better readability and performance.

  - *Recommendation*:
    - Utilize functions and classes to encapsulate rule evaluations.
    - Use RDKit's `GetSubstructMatches()` with the `uniquify` and `useChirality` parameters as appropriate to optimize matching.
    - Consider using RDKit's built-in functions for calculating distances and analyzing ring systems.

**End of Suggestions**

By implementing these suggestions, the code will more accurately reflect the language rules in the generated feature matrix, ensuring that each rule is applied correctly to the appropriate modifiers. This will improve the effectiveness of the transformation from language rules to the numeric feature matrix.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

---

**1. Comparison with Reference Metrics**

**a. Train Support:**

- **Previous Metrics:**
  - Mean Train Support: 0.1667 and 0.1845
- **Current Metrics:**
  - Individual Train Supports: 0.0232, 0.0381, 0.0571, 0.0232, 0.0, 0.0571
  - Overall Train Support: **0.1429**

**Observation:**
The overall train support in the current iteration is slightly lower than the previous metrics. While previous supports averaged around 0.175, the current overall support is 0.1429. This indicates that the current rules apply to a slightly smaller portion of the dataset compared to previous rules.

---

**b. Train Confidence:**

- **Previous Metrics:**
  - Mean Train Confidence: 0.6352 and 0.5396
- **Current Metrics:**
  - Individual Train Confidences: 0.6889, 0.7031, 0.5963, 0.6719, 0.5, 0.6349
  - Overall Train Confidence: **0.7529**

**Observation:**
There is a notable improvement in train confidence in the current iteration. The overall train confidence has increased to 0.7529 from previous averages of around 0.5874. Higher confidence means that when the rule conditions are met, there is a greater likelihood that the prediction will be accurate.

---

**c. Train Lift:**

- **Previous Metrics:**
  - Mean Train Lift: 1.2048 and 1.0559
- **Current Metrics:**
  - Individual Train Lifts: 1.3772, 1.4043, 1.2027, 1.3524, 1.0, 1.2799
  - Overall Train Lift: **1.5038**

**Observation:**
The train lift has significantly improved in the current iteration, with an overall lift of 1.5038 compared to previous averages around 1.1304. A lift greater than 1 indicates that the rule condition increases the likelihood of the prediction. The higher the lift, the stronger the association between the condition and the prediction.

---

**d. Train Leverage:**

- **Previous Metrics:**
  - Mean Train Leverage: 0.0289 and -0.0041
- **Current Metrics:**
  - Individual Train Leverages: 0.0130, 0.0107, 0.0037, 0.0108, 0.0, 0.0141
  - Overall Train Leverage: **0.0170**

**Observation:**
Train leverage values are positive in the current iteration, suggesting a stronger association than expected by chance. While individual leverage values are slightly lower than the highest previous leverage, the overall leverage of 0.0170 reflects an improvement from the negative leverage observed previously.

---

**2. Determining if a Local Minimum Has Been Reached**

- **Improved Metrics:**
  - The current iteration shows higher train confidence and lift compared to previous metrics. This improvement suggests movement towards an optimal set of rules.
- **Support Levels:**
  - Although support is slightly lower, the trade-off for higher confidence and lift may be acceptable, especially if the rules are more accurate.
- **Potential Plateau:**
  - If subsequent iterations do not yield significant improvements in metrics, it may indicate that a local minimum has been reached.

**Conclusion:**
Based on the improved confidence and lift, it appears that the current rule set is nearing optimal performance. However, the slightly lower support suggests there may still be room for refinement to cover a broader portion of the dataset without sacrificing accuracy.

---

**3. Recommendations for Improving the Current Rules**

**a. Increase Rule Support without Compromising Confidence and Lift**

- **Generalize Conditions:**
  - Slightly broaden the rule conditions to include more examples. For example, if Rule 1 specifies "within three carbons," consider testing "within four carbons" to see if support increases without significantly reducing confidence.
- **Combine Similar Rules:**
  - Merge rules that have overlapping conditions to create broader rules with higher support.

**b. Re-examine Rules with Zero or Low Support**

- **Rule with Zero Support:**
  - Rule 5 has a train support of 0.0, indicating it does not apply to any examples in the training data. Investigate whether this rule is necessary or if it needs adjustment.
- **Optimize Low-Support Rules:**
  - For rules with very low support (e.g., 0.0232), consider adjusting conditions to increase applicability while monitoring the impact on confidence and lift.

**c. Balance Specificity and Generality**

- **Avoid Overfitting:**
  - Highly specific rules may not generalize well to new data. Ensure that rules are not overly tailored to the training set.
- **Assess Rule Impact:**
  - Evaluate whether highly specific rules contribute significantly to overall performance or if they can be combined or removed.

**d. Focus on Rules with High Leverage Potential**

- **Enhance Leverage:**
  - Rules with higher leverage contribute more to predictive power. Identify opportunities to adjust rules to increase leverage, possibly by incorporating additional relevant features.

**e. Validate with Test Data**

- **Ensure Generalization:**
  - Apply the current rules to a test dataset to verify that high train confidence and lift are not due to overfitting.
- **Monitor Test Metrics:**
  - Compare test confidence and lift to training metrics. Significant discrepancies may indicate overfitting.

**f. Incorporate Additional Features or Modifiers**

- **Explore New Variables:**
  - Introduce new structural features or descriptors that may influence catalytic activity.
- **Use Domain Knowledge:**
  - Leverage chemical insights to identify important functional groups or molecular properties that can enhance rule performance.

**g. Iterate and Refine**

- **Continuous Improvement:**
  - Continue to refine rules based on metric feedback. Small adjustments may lead to incremental improvements.
- **Set Thresholds:**
  - Establish minimum acceptable levels for support, confidence, and lift to guide rule acceptance.

**h. Engage with Domain Experts**

- **Expert Review:**
  - Have chemists review the rules for plausibility and relevance. Expert insights can help refine rules and suggest new avenues for exploration.
- **Understand Mechanisms:**
  - Deeper understanding of the catalytic mechanisms may reveal additional factors to include in rule conditions.

---

**Overall Summary**

The current rules have demonstrated improved performance in terms of **train confidence** and **train lift**, indicating stronger predictive power compared to previous iterations. However, **train support** is slightly lower, suggesting that while the rules are more accurate, they apply to a smaller portion of the dataset.

To enhance the current rules:

- **Aim to increase support** by generalizing conditions where possible without significantly affecting confidence and lift.
- **Review and adjust rules** with zero or low support to improve their applicability.
- **Balance specificity and generality** to ensure that rules are both accurate and broadly applicable.
- **Leverage domain expertise** to validate and refine rules based on chemical knowledge.

By focusing on these improvements, the rule set can achieve better overall performance, providing reliable predictions while covering a meaningful portion of the data.

---

**Next Steps**

- **Test the current rules** on validation and test datasets to confirm their predictive power.
- **Monitor key metrics** across datasets to ensure consistency.
- **Iteratively refine rules** based on feedback from test performance and expert input.
- **Document changes and rationale** for transparency and future reference.

---

This systematic approach will help ensure that the rules not only perform well statistically but also make practical sense in the context of the catalytic problem being studied.

**Overfitting:**

- **Unlikely in Current Iteration:** Given the low training and validation accuracies, overfitting is less likely.
- **Previous Iterations:** Higher validation accuracies in earlier iterations could have been due to overfitting, but the current data does not support this.

---

### **3. Analysis of Discrepancies Using SHAP Values**

**Understanding SHAP Values:**

- **Positive SHAP Values:** Indicate that a rule contributes to predicting a **high loading**.
- **Negative SHAP Values:** Indicate that a rule contributes to predicting a **low loading**.

**Overestimations (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**

- **Molecules with Overestimated Loadings:**
  - **C(=O)(C(C(C(C(F)(F)F)(F)F)(F)F)(F)F)O**
  - **C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O**
  - **C(CCCC(=O)O)CCCN**
- **Contributing Rules:**
  - **Rule2** and **Rule5** have high positive SHAP values in these cases.
- **Implication:**
  - **Rule2** and **Rule5** may be over-predicting high loading for certain molecules.

**Underestimations (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**

- **Molecules with Underestimated Loadings:**
  - In the latest iteration, underestimations are less evident.
  - Previous iterations showed molecules like **C([C@H](C(=O)O)N)C(=O)O** being underestimated.
- **Contributing Rules:**
  - Rules with high negative SHAP values in those cases need to be identified and adjusted.

**Rule Utilization:**

- **Limited Rule Influence:**
  - The model is primarily using **Rule2** and **Rule5**.
- **Underutilization of Other Rules:**
  - Rules that previously contributed to higher accuracies (e.g., **Rule1**, **Rule3**, **Rule9**, **Rule13**) are currently not influential.

---

### **4. Interpretation of Accuracy Improvements**

- **Declining Performance:** The decrease in validation accuracy suggests that the model's performance is deteriorating.
- **Local Minimum:** The model may have reached a local minimum, and further iterations without significant changes may not improve accuracy.
- **Iteration Effectiveness:** The number of iterations may not be sufficient, or the modifications may not be effectively enhancing the model.

---

### **5. Insights from SHAP Analysis for Rule Improvement**

**Rule Adjustments Based on SHAP Values:**

- **Rule2 and Rule5:**
  - Contributing significantly to overestimations.
  - Need to be refined to prevent incorrect high loading predictions.

**Potential Issues with Current Rules:**

- **Over-Simplification:**
  - Relying heavily on two rules may oversimplify the complex relationships in the data.
- **Rule Specificity:**
  - Rules may be too broad, leading to misclassifications.
- **Ignoring Other Influential Factors:**
  - Other chemical features captured by previously effective rules are not being considered.

---

### **Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

---

#### **1. Refine Rules Associated with Overestimations**

**Rule2:**

- **Current Statement:**
  - *Aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position predict a high yield.*
- **Issue:**
  - Over-predicting high loading for molecules where this may not be the case (e.g., molecules with additional steric hindrance or other functional groups).
- **Suggested Refinement:**
  - **Incorporate Steric Considerations:**
    - Modify Rule2 to exclude molecules where the electron-withdrawing group is bulky or where steric hindrance may impede coordination.
  - **Consider Additional Functional Groups:**
    - Add conditions to account for other substituents that may negate the effect of the electron-withdrawing group.

**Rule5:**

- **Current Statement:**
  - *Aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups directly attached to the ring predict a low yield.*
- **Issue:**
  - Contributing to overestimations in molecules where the aldehyde group may not significantly impact loading.
- **Suggested Refinement:**
  - **Specify Position Sensitivity:**
    - Adjust Rule5 to include the position of the aldehyde group (ortho, meta, para) relative to the carboxyl group.
  - **Exclude Certain Conjugations:**
    - Consider whether conjugation with other groups affects the rule's applicability.

---

#### **2. Reintroduce and Adjust Previously Effective Rules**

**Rule1:**

- **Previously Associated with Higher Accuracy:**
  - Involves modifiers that are carboxylic acids with a free primary amino group within three carbons of the carboxyl group.
- **Suggested Action:**
  - **Reintegrate Rule1:**
    - Bring back Rule1 to capture molecules where the amino group enhances coordination.
  - **Ensure Specificity:**
    - Add conditions to prevent misclassifications due to distance or protection of the amino group.

**Rule3, Rule9, Rule13:**

- **Positive Impact in Previous Iterations:**
  - These rules may have contributed to higher accuracies by capturing specific structural features.
- **Suggested Action:**
  - **Analyze and Adjust:**
    - Evaluate these rules for current applicability and adjust for any inconsistencies.
  - **Include in Model:**
    - Reintroduce these rules to provide a more comprehensive feature set.

---

#### **3. Improve Generalization and Address Underfitting**

**Increase Model Complexity:**

- **Diversify Rules:**
  - Introduce additional rules that capture other relevant chemical features.
- **Balance Rule Contributions:**
  - Ensure that no single rule dominates the predictions unless appropriately justified.

**Avoid Over-Pruning:**

- **Retain Useful Rules:**
  - Be cautious in removing rules that may seem less significant but contribute to capturing the data's complexity.
- **Iterative Testing:**
  - Use cross-validation to test the impact of each rule before deciding to exclude it.

---

#### **4. Adjust Rules with High Negative SHAP Values for Underestimations**

**Analyze Negative Contributions:**

- **Identify Rules:**
  - Determine which rules have high negative SHAP values in cases where the model underestimates the loading.
- **Modify Rules:**
  - Adjust these rules to reduce their negative impact on predictions where the experimental loading is high.

---

#### **5. Use Insights from SHAP Analysis for Iterative Refinement**

**Iterative Rule Refinement:**

- **Cycle of Analysis and Adjustment:**
  - Use SHAP values to inform which rules to adjust, test the impact, and repeat.
- **Monitor Model Performance:**
  - Continuously track validation accuracy to assess improvements.

**Rule Interaction Consideration:**

- **Analyze Rule Interactions:**
  - Investigate how rules interact and whether certain combinations lead to errors.
- **Hierarchical Rules:**
  - Consider establishing rule hierarchies or dependencies to capture more complex relationships.

---

### **Conclusion**

The current model's performance indicates that the rules in their present form are insufficient for accurate predictions. Overreliance on **Rule2** and **Rule5** has led to overestimations, while other potentially valuable rules have been underutilized or excluded. To improve the model:

- **Refine problematic rules** that contribute to misclassifications.
- **Reintroduce and adjust previously effective rules** to enhance the feature set.
- **Ensure that the model is neither overfitting nor underfitting** by balancing complexity and generalization.
- **Leverage SHAP analysis iteratively** to fine-tune the rules and improve predictive performance.

By implementing these recommendations, we aim to develop a more robust model that better aligns with experimental observations and achieves higher validation accuracies.

---

**Next Steps:**

- **Implement Adjustments:**
  - Apply the suggested refinements to Rule2 and Rule5.
  - Reintegrate and adjust Rules 1, 3, 9, and 13.
- **Test Model Performance:**
  - Re-evaluate the model with the updated rules using cross-validation.
- **Analyze Results:**
  - Assess whether the changes lead to improved validation accuracy.
- **Iterate as Necessary:**
  - Continuously refine the rules based on SHAP analysis and performance metrics.

By following this structured approach, we aim to enhance the model's accuracy and reliability in predicting catalyst loading based on molecular features.

**Summary of Discussions and Suggestions for Rule Optimization**

**1. Overview of Current Situation**

The current set of rules for predicting the catalytic performance of modified catalysts in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction has shown decreased effectiveness. Key observations include:

- **Decline in Validation Accuracy**: The latest 5-fold validation accuracy is **57.14%**, significantly lower than previous averages of around **76%**.
- **Model Underfitting**: The model is underfitting, failing to capture essential features influencing catalytic activity.
- **Over-Reliance on Specific Rules**: The model heavily depends on **Rule 2** and **Rule 5**, leading to overestimations of high yield and neglecting other influential features.
- **SHAP Analysis Insights**: Overestimations are primarily due to these two rules, while other potentially effective rules are underutilized or excluded.

**2. Issues Identified**

- **Discrepancies in Rule Implementation**: There are mismatches between the natural language rules and their code implementation, leading to incorrect application of rules to molecules.
- **Simplification Leading to Underfitting**: Over-simplification and over-pruning of rules have reduced the model's complexity, hindering its predictive capabilities.
- **Underutilization of Effective Rules**: Previously effective rules (e.g., **Rule 1**, **Rule 3**, **Rule 9**, **Rule 13**) are not contributing significantly to the current model.
- **Inaccurate Pattern Matching**: The SMARTS patterns used may not accurately capture the intended chemical structures, causing misclassifications.

**3. Suggestions for Improving Current Rules**

**a. Refine Existing Rules**

- **Rule 1 (Modifiers with Amino Groups)**
  - **Issue**: The code does not accurately identify modifiers with a free primary amino group within three carbons of the carboxyl group.
  - **Recommendation**:
    - Update the SMARTS patterns to differentiate between aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids.
    - Ensure accurate distance calculations to verify the proximity of the amino group to the carboxyl group.
    - Example of improved SMARTS pattern:
      ```python
      aliphatic_carboxylic_acid = '[CX3;!$(C=[C,N,O,S])](=O)[OX2H1]'
      primary_amino = '[NX3;H2][C;!$(C=[O,N,S])]'
      ```

- **Rule 2 (Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Para Substituents)**
  - **Issue**: The code may not accurately identify substituents at the para position due to complex aromatic ring substitutions.
  - **Recommendation**:
    - Implement more precise methods to identify substituents at the para position using atom mapping and bond traversal.
    - Refine the SMARTS patterns to target electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups at the correct position.

- **Rule 3 (Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Without Functional Groups)**
  - **Issue**: Additional functional groups may not be comprehensively excluded.
  - **Recommendation**:
    - Expand the exclusion criteria to cover all possible functional groups that could interfere with the rule.
    - Define explicit patterns for straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids of the desired chain length.

- **Rule 4 (Polar Functional Groups Near Carboxyl Group)**
  - **Issue**: The rule is applied to both aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids, contrary to its description.
  - **Recommendation**:
    - Modify the rule to apply only to aliphatic carboxylic acids.
    - Ensure that the code accurately calculates the distance between functional groups.

- **Rule 5 and **Rule 2** Overlap**
  - **Issue**: Both rules may be too broad, overestimating high yields.
  - **Recommendation**:
    - Refine these rules to prevent misclassifications.
    - Introduce additional conditions, such as excluding molecules with steric hindrance or conflicting functional groups.

**b. Reintroduce and Adjust Previously Effective Rules**

- **Rule 9 (Heteroaromatic Carboxylic Acids)**
  - **Recommendation**:
    - Re-evaluate and reintroduce Rule 9 to capture important features related to heteroaromatic carboxylic acids.
    - Ensure accurate implementation to identify molecules where the carboxyl group is directly attached to a nitrogen-containing ring.

- **Rule 13 (Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Methoxy Groups)**
  - **Recommendation**:
    - Reintroduce and adjust Rule 13 to specify the chain length and positioning of methoxy groups to improve specificity.

**c. Balance Specificity and Generality**

- **Avoid Overfitting and Underfitting**
  - **Recommendation**:
    - Adjust rules to achieve a balance between specificity and coverage.
    - Combine similar rules where appropriate to increase support while maintaining high confidence.

**d. Enhance Feature Extraction and Pattern Matching**

- **Improve SMARTS Patterns**
  - **Recommendation**:
    - Review and refine all SMARTS patterns to ensure accurate capture of functional groups and molecular structures.
    - Use more precise definitions for functional groups, such as `[SX2H1]` for free thiol groups.

- **Implement Error Handling**
  - **Recommendation**:
    - Add checks for invalid SMILES strings to prevent processing errors and ensure the integrity of the data.

**e. Utilize SHAP Analysis for Iterative Refinement**

- **Leverage SHAP Values**
  - **Recommendation**:
    - Use SHAP analysis to identify rules contributing to misclassifications.
    - Adjust or refine these rules to improve model predictions.

**f. Incorporate Additional Relevant Features**

- **Consider New Chemical Descriptors**
  - **Recommendation**:
    - Introduce rules capturing steric effects, electronic properties, or other functional groups that may influence catalytic activity.
    - Consult with chemists or domain experts to identify important features.

**g. Validate and Test Iteratively**

- **Iterative Testing**
  - **Recommendation**:
    - After adjustments, re-run cross-validation to evaluate improvements.
    - Continuously monitor performance metrics to guide further refinements.

**4. Possibility for Further Optimization**

Given the identified issues and the potential improvements outlined above, there is substantial room for further optimization without overfitting. The model currently underfits the data, indicating that increasing its complexity and correcting implementation errors can enhance its predictive capabilities.

**Please Optimize Rules**

Final Metric Message:

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with a free (unprotected) primary amino group within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The proximity of a free amino group enhances coordination with the metal center of the catalyst, improving catalytic activity.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (L-Aspartic acid)
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (L-Glutamic acid)
    - 5-aminopentanoic acid
    - 4-aminobenzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Counterexamples*:
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid (**Low Yield**; amino group is distant from the carboxyl group)
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (**Low Yield**; amino group is N-acetylated, reducing coordination ability)

- **Rule 2**: In **aromatic carboxylic acids**, the presence of **electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) at the para position** predicts a **high yield**, while **electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy, sulfhydryl) at the same position** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity and metal-binding ability of the carboxylate anion, enhancing interaction with the catalyst. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and coordination ability.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
    - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 6 to 8 carbons and no additional functional groups** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Straight-chain aliphatic acids of moderate length can effectively coordinate with the catalyst without steric hindrance from additional functional groups.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - Octanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Counterexamples*:
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid (**Low Yield**; presence of a hydroxyl group may interfere with coordination)
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid (**Low Yield**; amino group distant from carboxyl reduces coordination effectiveness)

- **Rule 4**: For **aliphatic carboxylic acids**, the presence of **polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino, sulfhydryl) within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predicts a **high yield**, while if these groups are located **more than three carbons away**, it predicts a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Polar groups near the carboxyl group enhance coordination through additional interaction sites. Distant polar groups may not contribute effectively to coordination.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups directly attached to the ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can engage in side reactions or form intramolecular interactions, interfering with metal coordination.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that contain **amide bonds involving functional groups near the carboxyl group** or are **N-acetylated amino acids** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide formation reduces the availability of amino groups for coordination, diminishing the modifier's effectiveness.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages in the carbon chain** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether linkages introduce flexibility and polar oxygen atoms that can disrupt optimal positioning of the carboxyl group for coordination.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with an aromatic ring attached via a chain of four or more carbons** predict a **high yield**, whereas those with shorter chains predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic linkers reduce electronic and steric interference from the aromatic ring, allowing effective coordination.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (**Low Yield**; shorter chain increases steric hindrance)

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to a nitrogen-containing aromatic ring** predict a **high yield**. If the carboxyl group is attached via a benzene ring or linker to the heterocycle, it predicts a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Direct attachment allows the nitrogen atom to participate in coordination with the catalyst, enhancing binding efficiency.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (**Low Yield**; carboxyl group not directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring)

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance coordination through hydrogen bonding and additional interaction sites with the catalyst.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with **perfluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoroacetyl groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Strongly electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups reduce the nucleophilicity of the carboxylate anion, decreasing coordination ability and potentially introducing steric hindrance.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
    - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that contain **additional carbonyl groups in the aliphatic chain** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Additional carbonyl groups create competing coordination sites and may form internal chelates, interfering with effective catalyst interaction.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy groups on the aromatic ring attached via an aliphatic chain of four or more carbons** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The aliphatic chain distances electron-donating methoxy groups from the carboxyl group, minimizing their impact on coordination.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids fused with additional carbonyl-containing rings** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Fused aromatic systems with carbonyl groups can enhance coordination through extended conjugation and multiple binding sites.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **complex polyfunctional carboxylic acids with multiple coordination sites positioned favorably** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple coordination sites can enhance binding through chelation effects, improving catalytic performance.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Refine Rule 1 (Modifiers with Amino Groups Near Carboxyl Group)**  
  - **Issue**: The current implementation may not accurately identify modifiers that are carboxylic acids with a free (unprotected) primary amino group within three carbons of the carboxyl group, especially differentiating between aliphatic and aromatic acids.
  - **Recommendation**:
    - **Update SMARTS Patterns**: Modify the SMARTS patterns to correctly identify aliphatic carboxylic acids with a free primary amino group within three carbons of the carboxyl group.
    - **Suggested SMARTS Pattern**:
      ```python
      pattern = '[NX3;H2]-[C;!$(C=O)]-[C;!$(C=O)]-[C;!$(C=O)]-C(=O)[O;H]'
      ```
      This pattern searches for a primary amine connected via a three-carbon chain to a carboxylic acid.
    - **Ensure Accurate Distance Calculations**: Use molecular graph traversal methods to calculate the shortest path between the amino nitrogen and the carboxyl carbon to confirm the three-carbon distance criterion.

- **Advice 2**: **Improve Rule 2 (Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Para Substituents)**
  - **Issue**: The code may not accurately identify electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids due to complex ring substitutions.
  - **Recommendation**:
    - **Implement Precise Position Identification**: Use atom mapping or substructure searches to accurately identify substituents at the para position relative to the carboxyl group on the aromatic ring.
    - **Separate Patterns for Electron-Withdrawing and Electron-Donating Groups**:
      - **Electron-Withdrawing Groups (High Yield)**:
        ```python
        pattern = 'c1cc([C](=O)[O;H])ccc1[$(N(=O)=O),$(CBr),$(CF3),$(CN)]'
        ```
      - **Electron-Donating Groups (Low Yield)**:
        ```python
        pattern = 'c1cc([C](=O)[O;H])ccc1[$(OC),$(O),$(S),$(NH2),$(CH3)]'
        ```
    - **Verify Aromaticity and Substituent Position**: Utilize RDKit functionalities to confirm that the carboxyl group and substituent are in the correct positions on the aromatic ring.

- **Advice 3**: **Enhance Rule 3 (Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Without Additional Functional Groups)**
  - **Issue**: The current rule may not comprehensively exclude modifiers with additional functional groups that could interfere with coordination.
  - **Recommendation**:
    - **Define Explicit Patterns for Straight-Chain Aliphatic Acids**:
      ```python
      pattern = 'C(=O)[O;H]-[CH2]{$(C),$(CC),$(CCC),$(CCCC)}[CH3]'
      ```
      Adjust the pattern to match aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 6 to 8 carbons and no additional functional groups.
    - **Exclude Additional Functional Groups**: Add exclusion criteria to the pattern to ensure that only modifiers without other functional groups are matched.
      ```python
      exclusion_pattern = '[!$(C=O),!$(O),!$(N),!$(S)]'
      ```

- **Advice 4**: **Correct Rule 4 (Polar Functional Groups Near Carboxyl Group)**
  - **Issue**: The rule is incorrectly applied to both aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids, and distance calculations for functional group proximity may be inaccurate.
  - **Recommendation**:
    - **Limit Rule to Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids**: Modify the rule to apply only to aliphatic carboxylic acids.
    - **Update SMARTS Patterns**:
      ```python
      pattern = '[C](=O)[O;H]-[C]-[C]-[C;$(O),$(N),$(S)]'
      ```
      This pattern identifies polar functional groups (hydroxyl, amino, sulfhydryl) within three carbons of the carboxyl group.
    - **Accurate Distance Calculations**: Use molecular graph traversal to ensure functional groups are within the specified distance from the carboxyl group.

- **Advice 5**: **Reintroduce and Refine Rule 9 (Heteroaromatic Carboxylic Acids)**
  - **Issue**: Rule 9 is underutilized or excluded, despite its importance in capturing key features affecting yield.
  - **Recommendation**:
    - **Reimplement Rule 9**: Include Rule 9 back into the model with accurate implementation.
    - **SMARTS Pattern for Direct Attachment**:
      ```python
      pattern = '[nH,cH]1[c,n]ccc1C(=O)[O;H]'
      ```
      This pattern searches for heteroaromatic rings containing nitrogen, with the carboxyl group directly attached.
    - **Exclude Indirect Attachments**: Ensure that modifiers where the carboxyl group is attached via a benzene ring or linker are not matched by this rule.

- **Advice 6**: **Refine Rule 5 and Reduce Overlapping with Rule 2**
  - **Issue**: Rule 5 may be too broad and overlapping with Rule 2, leading to misclassifications and overestimation of high yields.
  - **Recommendation**:
    - **Add Additional Conditions**: Include criteria to exclude molecules with potential steric hindrance or those prone to side reactions.
    - **SMARTS Pattern for Aldehyde Groups**:
      ```python
      pattern = 'c1ccc(C=O)cc1C(=O)[O;H]'
      ```
      This pattern specifically targets aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups directly attached to the ring.

- **Advice 7**: **Improve SMARTS Patterns Across All Rules**
  - **Issue**: Inaccurate SMARTS patterns may lead to incorrect matching and misclassification.
  - **Recommendation**:
    - **Review and Validate Patterns**: Go through each SMARTS pattern used in the rules to ensure they accurately represent the intended chemical structures.
    - **Use RDKit for Validation**: Utilize RDKit's `MolFromSmarts` and `MolFromSmiles` functions to test and validate patterns against known examples and counterexamples.
    - **Examples for Free Thiol Groups**:
      ```python
      free_thiol_pattern = '[SX2H]'
      ```

- **Advice 8**: **Balance Specificity and Coverage in Rules**
  - **Issue**: Over-simplification may lead to underfitting, while overly specific rules may cause overfitting.
  - **Recommendation**:
    - **Combine Similar Rules**: Where appropriate, merge rules that cover similar chemical features to increase support without sacrificing confidence.
    - **Adjust Rule Thresholds**: Modify criteria within rules to balance between being too exclusive and too inclusive.

- **Advice 9**: **Implement Error Handling and Data Validation**
  - **Issue**: Invalid SMILES strings or processing errors can affect rule application and model performance.
  - **Recommendation**:
    - **Add Validation Checks**: Before processing, validate all SMILES strings to ensure they are correct and can be parsed.
    - **Handle Exceptions Gracefully**: Implement try-except blocks around code that processes molecular structures to catch and handle errors without crashing.

- **Advice 10**: **Utilize SHAP Analysis for Targeted Rule Refinement**
  - **Issue**: Certain rules contribute disproportionately to misclassifications.
  - **Recommendation**:
    - **Analyze SHAP Values**: Use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to identify which rules have the most significant impact on incorrect predictions.
    - **Adjust or Remove Problematic Rules**: Refine rules that contribute heavily to misclassifications, or consider their removal if they cannot be adjusted effectively.

- **Advice 11**: **Incorporate Additional Chemical Descriptors into Rules**
  - **Issue**: Current rules may not capture all relevant chemical features influencing yield.
  - **Recommendation**:
    - **Consult Domain Experts**: Engage with chemists to identify additional functional groups or structural motifs that affect catalytic performance.
    - **Develop New Rules**: Based on expert input, create new rules that capture these features, ensuring they are implemented accurately.
    - **Examples of Potential New Rules**:
      - **Modifiers with Steric Bulk Near Coordination Sites**: Predict low yield due to steric hindrance.
      - **Modifiers with Strong Chelating Groups**: Predict high yield due to enhanced metal coordination.

- **Advice 12**: **Iteratively Validate Rules and Model Performance**
  - **Issue**: Changes to rules need to be tested to confirm improvements.
  - **Recommendation**:
    - **Conduct Cross-Validation**: After updating rules, perform k-fold cross-validation to evaluate model performance.
    - **Monitor Performance Metrics**: Track accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics to assess improvements.
    - **Adjust as Necessary**: Use validation results to make further refinements to rules and their implementations.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with a free (unprotected) amino group located within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**. This includes both aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids.
  - *Rationale*: The proximity of the amino group facilitates coordination with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (L-Aspartic acid)
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (L-Glutamic acid)
    - 5-aminopentanoic acid
    - 4-aminobenzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Counterexamples*:
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid (**Low Yield**; amino group is distant from the carboxyl group)
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid (**Low Yield**; amino group is N-acetylated)
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid (**Low Yield**; amino group is too far for effective coordination)

- **Rule 2**: In **aromatic carboxylic acids**, the presence of **electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) at the para position** predicts a **high yield**, while **electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy, sulfhydryl, hydroxyl) at the same position** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase acidity and enhance metal-binding ability of the carboxylate anion, improving interaction with the catalyst. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and coordination ability.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
    - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to a nitrogen-containing aromatic ring** predict a **high yield**. If the carboxyl group is attached via a linker or to a benzene ring fused to the heterocycle, it predicts a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Direct attachment allows the nitrogen atom to participate in coordination with the catalyst, enhancing binding efficiency.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Nicotinic acid)
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (**Low Yield**; carboxyl group not directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring)

- **Rule 4**: For **aliphatic carboxylic acids**, the presence of **polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, sulfhydryl) within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predicts a **high yield**, while if these groups are located **more than three carbons away**, it predicts a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Polar groups near the carboxyl group enhance coordination through additional interaction sites. Distant polar groups may not contribute effectively to coordination.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups attached to the ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can engage in side reactions or form intramolecular interactions, interfering with metal coordination.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with **perfluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoroacetyl groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Strongly electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups reduce the nucleophilicity of the carboxylate anion, decreasing coordination ability and potentially introducing steric hindrance.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
    - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages in the carbon chain** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether linkages introduce flexibility and polar oxygen atoms that can disrupt optimal positioning of the carboxyl group for coordination.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids linked to an aromatic ring via a chain of four or more carbons** predict a **high yield**, whereas those with shorter chains predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic linkers reduce electronic and steric interference from the aromatic ring, allowing effective coordination.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (**Low Yield**; shorter chain increases steric hindrance)

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance coordination through hydrogen bonding and additional interaction sites with the catalyst.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid (Gluconic acid)

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that contain **amide bonds involving functional groups near the carboxyl group** or are **N-acetylated amino acids** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide formation reduces the availability of amino groups for coordination, diminishing the modifier's effectiveness.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that contain **additional carbonyl groups in the aliphatic chain** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Additional carbonyl groups create competing coordination sites and may form internal chelates, interfering with effective catalyst interaction.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups, with chain lengths of 6 to 8 carbons** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Straight-chain aliphatic acids of moderate length can effectively coordinate with the catalyst without steric hindrance from additional functional groups.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - Octanoic acid

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- ** Advice 1 **: **Simplify and Quantify Functional Group Positions**  
  Redefine rules to focus on quantifiable distances between functional groups and the carboxyl group using numerical descriptors directly extractable from SMILES strings. For example, instead of stating "amino group within three carbons of the carboxyl group," use a descriptor like "the shortest path length (in number of bonds) between nitrogen atoms and carboxylic acid carbon atoms is ≤ 3."

- ** Advice 2 **: **Use Standard Molecular Descriptors**  
  Incorporate standard molecular descriptors such as LogP, molecular weight, topological polar surface area (TPSA), hydrogen bond donors (HBD), hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA), and counts of specific atom types or bonds. This allows quantitative analysis and eases the generation of a numerical feature matrix from SMILES.

- ** Advice 3 **: **Consolidate Electron-Withdrawing and Donating Effects**  
  Merge rules related to electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups into a single rule that uses calculated parameters like Hammett sigma constants or electronic descriptors. Define thresholds for these parameters that correlate with high or low yields.

- ** Advice 4 **: **Define Clear Structural Fragments for Substructure Searches**  
  Specify structural fragments using SMARTS patterns that can be used to identify substructures within SMILES strings. For example, define a high-yield fragment as "[NX3;H2,H1;!$(NC=O)]CCC[C](=O)O" to represent amino groups near carboxylic acids.

- ** Advice 5 **: **Assign Numerical Values to Functional Groups**  
  Create a scoring system where functional groups are assigned numerical values based on their ability to enhance or diminish yield. Sum the values for each modifier to predict the overall effect on yield.

- ** Advice 6 **: **Incorporate Steric and Electronic Descriptors**  
  Include steric parameters such as Verloop steric parameters or molecular descriptors like molecular volume and flexibility indices to account for the impact of steric hindrance on yield.

- ** Advice 7 **: **Automate Descriptor Calculation Using Cheminformatics Tools**  
  Utilize software like RDKit to automate the extraction of molecular descriptors from SMILES strings. This will facilitate the generation of the feature matrix needed for modeling.

- ** Advice 8 **: **Reevaluate and Update Rules Based on Data Analysis**  
  Analyze the existing dataset statistically to find correlations between descriptors and yield outcomes. Update the rules to reflect these findings, ensuring they are data-driven and quantifiable.

- ** Advice 9 **: **Establish Thresholds for Key Descriptors**  
  Define specific numerical thresholds for descriptors (e.g., TPSA ≥ X Å² predicts high yield) based on the data analysis to clearly differentiate between high and low yield modifiers.

- ** Advice 10 **: **Simplify Rules to Reduce Overlaps and Contradictions**  
  Review the existing rules to identify and eliminate redundancies or contradictions. Simplify complex rules into more general guidelines that are easier to apply uniformly across different molecules.

- ** Advice 11 **: **Integrate Machine Learning Models**  
  Consider developing a predictive model using machine learning algorithms trained on the numerical features extracted from the SMILES strings. This model can uncover nonlinear relationships and improve yield predictions beyond rule-based methods.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid *(Nicotinic acid)*
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid *(Carboxyl group not directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring)*

- **Rule 4**: For **aliphatic carboxylic acids**, the presence of **polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, sulfhydryl) within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predicts a **high yield**; if such groups are located further away, the yield is predicted to be **low**.
  - *Rationale*: Proximity of polar groups enhances coordination capabilities by providing additional interaction sites.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that have **amide bonds involving the amino group or near the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide formation reduces availability of amino or carboxyl groups for metal coordination, diminishing the modifier's effectiveness.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **simple aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 6 to 8 carbons and without additional functional groups** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Straight-chain aliphatic acids of moderate length can effectively coordinate with the catalyst without steric hindrance from additional functional groups.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - Octanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Counterexamples*:
    - None in the dataset

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that contain **strongly electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups (e.g., trifluoromethyl, perfluoroalkyl)** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Strong electron-withdrawing groups decrease the nucleophilicity of the carboxylate anion, reducing coordination ability and potentially introducing steric hindrance.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
    - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids containing ether linkages in the carbon chain** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether oxygen atoms and the increased flexibility may hinder effective coordination by disrupting the optimal conformation for metal binding.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups attached to the ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can engage in side reactions or form intramolecular interactions, interfering with metal coordination.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids linked to an aromatic ring via a chain of four or more carbons** predict a **high yield**, whereas those with shorter chains predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic linkers reduce electronic and steric interference from the aromatic ring, allowing effective coordination with the metal center.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic or aromatic carboxylic acids with a free (unprotected) amino group located within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**. This includes both linear and cyclic structures.
  - *Rationale*: The presence of a nearby free amino group enhances coordination with the metal center, increasing catalyst effectiveness.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid *(L-Aspartic acid)*
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid *(L-Glutamic acid)*
    - 5-aminopentanoic acid
    - 4-aminobenzoic acid
    - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid *(L-Tryptophan)*
  - *Low Yield Counterexamples*:
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid *(N-acetylated amino acid)*
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid *(Amino group distant from carboxyl group)*
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid

- **Rule 2**: In **aromatic carboxylic acids**, the presence of **electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) at the para position** predicts a **high yield**, while **electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxyl, sulfhydryl) at the same position** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups enhance acidity and coordination ability of the carboxylate, promoting better interaction with the catalyst. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and can hinder coordination.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
    - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to a nitrogen-containing aromatic ring** predict a **high yield**. If the carboxyl group is attached to an aromatic ring fused to the heterocycle or via a linker, it predicts a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Direct attachment permits the nitrogen to participate in coordination, enhancing catalyst interaction.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid *(Nicotinic acid)*
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid *(Carboxyl group not directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring)*

- **Rule 4**: For **aliphatic carboxylic acids**, the presence of **polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, sulfhydryl) within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predicts a **high yield**; if such groups are located further away, the yield is predicted to be **low**.
  - *Rationale*: Proximity of polar groups enhances coordination capabilities by providing additional interaction sites.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that have **amide bonds involving the amino group or near the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide formation reduces availability of amino or carboxyl groups for metal coordination, diminishing the modifier's effectiveness.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **simple aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 6 to 8 carbons and without additional functional groups** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Straight-chain aliphatic acids of moderate length can effectively coordinate with the catalyst without steric hindrance from additional functional groups.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - Octanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Counterexamples*:
    - None in the dataset

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that contain **strongly electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups (e.g., trifluoromethyl, perfluoroalkyl)** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Strong electron-withdrawing groups decrease the nucleophilicity of the carboxylate anion, reducing coordination ability and potentially introducing steric hindrance.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
    - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids containing ether linkages in the carbon chain** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether oxygen atoms and the increased flexibility may hinder effective coordination by disrupting the optimal conformation for metal binding.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups attached to the ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can engage in side reactions or form intramolecular interactions, interfering with metal coordination.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids linked to an aromatic ring via a chain of four or more carbons** predict a **high yield**, whereas those with shorter chains predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic linkers reduce electronic and steric interference from the aromatic ring, allowing effective coordination with the metal center.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Correct Rule 4 Implementation**

  The current implementation of Rule 4 incorrectly assigns a value of 1 to all molecules because it counts the hydroxyl group of the carboxylic acid itself as a polar group within three carbons of the carboxyl group. To fix this:

  - **Modify the SMARTS patterns for polar groups to exclude the carboxyl group's hydroxyl oxygen.** Specifically, ensure that the polar functional groups (hydroxyl `[OH]` and sulfhydryl `[SH]`) are not part of the carboxylic acid group.

    ```python
    # Exclude hydroxyl group directly attached to the carboxylic acid carbon
    hydroxyl_group = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[OX2H][!$(C=O)]')
    # Exclude sulfhydryl group directly attached to the carboxylic acid carbon
    sulfhydryl_group = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[SX2H][!$(C=O)]')
    polar_groups = [hydroxyl_group, sulfhydryl_group]
    ```

  - **Modify the code to avoid counting the carboxylic acid's own oxygen atoms.** Exclude atoms involved in the carboxylic acid when searching for polar groups.

    ```python
    # Get indices of atoms in carboxylic acid groups to exclude
    ca_atom_indices = set()
    for ca in ca_matches:
        ca_atom_indices.update(ca)

    # Search for polar groups excluding carboxylic acid atoms
    for polar_group in polar_groups:
        pg_matches = mol.GetSubstructMatches(polar_group)
        for pg in pg_matches:
            pg_atom_idx = pg[0]
            if pg_atom_idx in ca_atom_indices:
                continue  # Skip if the polar group is part of the carboxylic acid
            # Proceed with checking the distance
    ```

- **Suggestion 2**: **Fix Rule 2 Logic for Substituents at Para Position**

  The implementation of Rule 2 does not correctly identify electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids. To improve this:

  - **Use RDKit's ring perception to correctly identify the para position in aromatic rings.**

    ```python
    # For each aromatic carboxylic acid match
    for ac in ac_matches:
        ac_atom_idx = ac[0]  # Aromatic carbon attached to carboxyl group
        # Get the ring containing the aromatic carbon
        ring_info = mol.GetRingInfo()
        rings = ring_info.AtomRings()
        ring = None
        for r in rings:
            if ac_atom_idx in r and len(r) == 6:
                ring = list(r)
                break
        if not ring:
            continue  # Skip if no benzene ring found

        idx_in_ring = ring.index(ac_atom_idx)
        para_idx_in_ring = (idx_in_ring + 3) % len(ring)
        para_atom_idx = ring[para_idx_in_ring]
        para_atom = mol.GetAtomWithIdx(para_atom_idx)

        # Check for substituents at the para position
        for neighbor in para_atom.GetNeighbors():
            neighbor_idx = neighbor.GetIdx()
            if neighbor_idx not in ring:
                bond = mol.GetBondBetweenAtoms(para_atom_idx, neighbor_idx)
                substituent = Chem.PathToSubmol(mol, [para_atom_idx, neighbor_idx])
                # Check for EWGs
                for ewg in ewg_list:
                    if substituent.HasSubstructMatch(ewg):
                        row.append(1)
                        match2 = True
                        break
                # Check for EDGs
                for edg in edg_list:
                    if substituent.HasSubstructMatch(edg):
                        row.append(-1)
                        match2 = True
                        break
        if match2:
            break
    if not match2:
        row.append(0)
    ```

- **Suggestion 3**: **Ensure Rule 6 Correctly Identifies Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Without Functional Groups**

  The current SMARTS pattern for Rule 6 may not accurately capture simple aliphatic carboxylic acids of chain lengths 6 to 8 carbons without additional functional groups. To address this:

  - **Generalize the SMARTS pattern to match any aliphatic chain of 6 to 8 carbons terminating with a carboxylic acid and without additional functional groups.**

    ```python
    # Match aliphatic carboxylic acids with 6 to 8 carbons and no additional functional groups
    simple_aliphatic_acid = Chem.MolFromSmarts('CCCCCC[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]')
    # Consider variations for chain lengths of 6 to 8 carbons
    simple_aliphatic_acids = [
        Chem.MolFromSmarts('CCCCCC[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'),  # Hexanoic acid
        Chem.MolFromSmarts('CCCCCCC[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'),  # Heptanoic acid
        Chem.MolFromSmarts('CCCCCCCC[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]')   # Octanoic acid
    ]
    ```

  - **Modify the Rule 6 code to check for any of these patterns and ensure no other functional groups are present.**

    ```python
    try:
        match6 = False
        for pattern in simple_aliphatic_acids:
            if mol.HasSubstructMatch(pattern):
                # Ensure no other functional groups are present
                if not mol.HasSubstructMatch(non_permitted_functional_groups):
                    row.append(1)
                    match6 = True
                    break
        if not match6:
            row.append(0)
    except:
        row.append(0)
    ```

- **Suggestion 4**: **Refine the SMARTS Patterns to Accurately Represent the Functional Groups**

  The SMARTS patterns provided may not fully capture the functional groups as described in the rules. For instance:

  - **Update the fluorinated group SMARTS in Rule 7 to include perfluoroalkyl groups.**

    ```python
    # Match any perfluoroalkyl group
    perfluoroalkyl_group = Chem.MolFromSmarts('C(F)(F)(F)F')
    # Include longer chains
    perfluoroalkyl_chain = Chem.MolFromSmarts('C(F)(F)(F)[C,F]*')
    fluorinated_group_list = [trifluoromethyl_group, perfluoroalkyl_group, perfluoroalkyl_chain]
    ```

- **Suggestion 5**: **Add Error Handling and Debug Statements**

  To improve the robustness of the code and aid in debugging:

  - **Implement better error handling to catch and report exceptions without disrupting the flow.**

    ```python
    import logging
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.ERROR)

    try:
        # Code block
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error processing molecule {smi}: {e}")
        row.append(0)
    ```

  - **Include debug statements to verify which rules are matched for each molecule.**

    ```python
    if match_rule:
        logging.debug(f"Molecule {smi} matches Rule X")
    ```

- **Suggestion 6**: **Validate the Feature Matrix Against Known Examples**

  After updating the code:

  - **Manually verify the feature matrix entries for known examples to ensure accuracy.** Cross-reference high yield and low yield examples provided in the rules with the corresponding entries in the feature matrix.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Optimize Substructure Searches**

  To improve performance:

  - **Compile SMARTS patterns before the loop if they will be used multiple times.** This prevents re-parsing the SMARTS strings for each molecule.

    ```python
    compiled_patterns = {
        'carboxylic_acid': Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'),
        # ... other patterns
    }
    ```

- **Suggestion 8**: **Consider Using Descriptors or Fingerprints**

  For complex structural rules:

  - **Use molecular descriptors or fingerprints to capture features like chain length, ring substitutions, and functional group counts more effectively.** RDKit offers tools for calculating such descriptors.

    ```python
    from rdkit.Chem import Descriptors
    chain_length = Descriptors.NumAliphaticCarbocycles(mol)
    ```

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

After reviewing the current rule metrics and comparing them with the reference metrics from previous iterations, we have the following observations:

---

**Current Rule Metrics:**

- **Train Support:** 0.0886 (8.86%)
- **Train Confidence:** 0.7264 (72.64%)
- **Train Lift:** 1.4694
- **Train Leverage:** 0.0174

**Previous Reference Metrics (Average of Previous Rules):**

- **Train Support:** Average of 0.1667 and 0.1845 ≈ **0.1756** (17.56%)
- **Train Confidence:** Average of 0.6352 and 0.5396 ≈ **0.5874** (58.74%)
- **Train Lift:** Average of 1.2048 and 1.0559 ≈ **1.1304**
- **Train Leverage:** Average of 0.0289 and -0.0041 ≈ **0.0124**

---

**1. Confidence and Lift Analysis**

- **Confidence Improvement:**
  - The current **train confidence** is **72.64%**, which is a significant increase from the previous average of **58.74%**.
  - This indicates that when the rule conditions are met, the prediction of a high yield is correct approximately **72.64%** of the time, up from **58.74%** previously.
  
- **Lift Improvement:**
  - The current **train lift** is **1.4694**, compared to the previous average of **1.1304**.
  - A lift greater than 1 indicates the rule is better at predicting the outcome than random chance. The current lift of **1.4694** means the rule is **46.94%** better than random chance, an improvement from the previous **13.04%**.

**Interpretation:**

- The **increase in confidence and lift** suggests that the current rules are more effective at correctly identifying high-yield outcomes when the rule conditions are satisfied.
- Higher lift values indicate stronger associations between rule conditions and predictions, making the rules more interesting and valuable.

---

**2. Support and Leverage Analysis**

- **Support Decrease:**
  - The current **train support** is **8.86%**, which is a decrease from the previous average of **17.56%**.
  - This means the current rules apply to **8.86%** of the training data, covering a smaller portion compared to the previous rules.

- **Leverage Increase:**
  - The current **train leverage** is **0.0174**, slightly higher than the previous average of **0.0124**.
  - Positive leverage indicates that the rules find more cases of high yield than would be expected by chance, confirming the rules' usefulness.

**Interpretation:**

- The decrease in support suggests that while the rules are more accurate (higher confidence and lift), they apply to fewer cases.
- An increase in leverage, albeit slight, indicates a stronger association between the rule conditions and the high-yield outcome than expected by chance.

---

**3. Iterative Performance Evaluation**

Looking at the metrics over the iterations:

- **Iteration 7 Metrics:**
  - **Train Support:** 0.1429 (14.29%)
  - **Train Confidence:** 0.7529 (75.29%)
  - **Train Lift:** 1.5038
  - **Train Leverage:** 0.0170

- **Current Iteration Metrics:**
  - **Train Support:** **0.0886** (8.86%)
  - **Train Confidence:** **0.7264** (72.64%)
  - **Train Lift:** **1.4694**
  - **Train Leverage:** **0.0174**

**Observation:**

- **Confidence and Lift:**
  - Slight decrease in confidence and lift from Iteration 7 to the current iteration.
  - The current metrics are still substantially higher than the initial reference metrics.

- **Support:**
  - Notable decrease in support from **14.29%** to **8.86%**, indicating that the current rules cover fewer cases.

**Interpretation:**

- The peak performance in terms of confidence and lift was at Iteration 7.
- The decrease in support suggests that adjustments made after Iteration 7 may have made the rules too specific, reducing their applicability.

---

**4. Determining if a Local Minimum Has Been Reached**

- **Local Minimum Assessment:**
  - Considering that further iterations after Iteration 7 have not led to improvements in both confidence/lift and support, it appears we may have reached a local minimum.
  - The balance between rule accuracy (confidence and lift) and applicability (support) is skewed toward accuracy at the expense of coverage.

**Conclusion:**

- It seems that we have optimized the current rules as much as possible under the current framework.
- Additional iterations without significant changes to the approach are unlikely to yield better results.
- A reevaluation of the rules' structure and criteria is necessary to make further improvements.

---

**Suggestions for Improving Current Rules**

1. **Enhance Rule Generalization to Increase Support:**

   - **Relax Specific Conditions:** Consider broadening some rule conditions to cover more data points without significantly compromising confidence and lift.
     - For example, in **Rule 1**, instead of requiring the amino group to be within three carbons of the carboxyl group, extend it to four carbons to include more compounds.
     
   - **Merge Similar Rules:** Identify rules that overlap or are similar and combine them to create more general rules.

2. **Focus on High-Impact Conditions:**

   - **Identify Key Functional Groups:** Determine which functional groups most strongly influence the yield and emphasize them in the rules.
   - **Remove Less Influential Conditions:** Simplify rules by removing conditions that do not significantly impact confidence and lift but reduce support.

3. **Introduce Additional Data Analysis:**

   - **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Use PCA to identify underlying patterns in the modifiers that contribute to high yield.
   - **Feature Importance Analysis:** Utilize statistical methods to rank the importance of different molecular features.

4. **Reevaluate Low Yield Counterexamples:**

   - **Examine Exceptions:** Investigate why certain compounds do not fit the rules despite having similar structures to high-yield examples.
   - **Adjust Rules Accordingly:** Modify rules to account for these exceptions, potentially increasing support.

5. **Cross-Validation with Test Data:**

   - **Evaluate Rules on Test Set:** Apply the current rules to the test data to ensure they generalize well beyond the training set.
   - **Monitor Overfitting:** Ensure that the high confidence and lift are not artifacts of overfitting to the training data.

6. **Incorporate Additional Chemical Knowledge:**

   - **Consider Steric and Electronic Effects:** Include factors like steric hindrance and electronic resonance that could affect yield.
   - **Consult Literature:** Review academic research for insights on modifiers that have proven effective historically.

7. **Iterative Refinement with Expert Collaboration:**

   - **Expert Review:** Have chemists review the rules to provide insights that may not be immediately evident from data alone.
   - **Iterative Feedback Loop:** Use expert feedback to refine rules and test the impact on metrics.

---

**Final Remarks**

- **Balancing Accuracy and Coverage:** While high confidence and lift are desirable, it's important to maintain a reasonable level of support to ensure the rules are practical and applicable to a significant portion of the data.
- **Holistic Approach to Rule Development:** Combining data-driven insights with chemical expertise can lead to more robust and generalizable rules.
- **Potential for Further Improvement:** By implementing the suggestions above, we can strive to develop rules that achieve a better balance between accuracy and applicability, potentially moving beyond the current local minimum.

---

By focusing on increasing the support of the rules while maintaining high confidence and lift, we can improve the performance of our predictive model. This will enhance the utility of the rules in guiding experimental efforts and contribute positively to the research program's objectives.

**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

Based on the latest training results, the current set of rules has achieved an overall accuracy of **77.14%** on the validation set, which is an improvement over previous iterations where accuracies ranged from approximately 62.86% to 74.29%. This suggests that the current rules are more effective in predicting the loading of modifiers on catalysts compared to earlier versions.

When comparing to the reference metrics:

- **Previous Validation Accuracies**: Mostly around 76%, with some variations.
- **Previous Test Accuracies**: Fluctuated between 62.5% and 75%, indicating potential overfitting in earlier models.
- **Current Validation Accuracy**: 77.14%, indicating an improvement and better generalization.

However, upon closer examination, there is evidence of overfitting tendencies:

- The model accurately predicts **27 out of 35** samples.
- **All mispredictions** are **false positives**—cases where the model predicts a high loading but the experimental value is low.
- There are **no false negatives**, indicating that the model rarely predicts low loading when the actual loading is high.

This pattern suggests that the model has a bias towards predicting high loading, which could be due to class imbalance or the influence of certain rules that overly favor high loading predictions.

**SHAP Analysis Insights**

The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis provides valuable insights into which rules are contributing to the model's predictions, especially in misclassified cases.

For the mispredicted molecules (false positives), the following observations are made:

1. **Consistent Positive Contribution of Rule 5**:
   - **Rule 5** consistently shows high positive SHAP values in mispredicted molecules, indicating it contributes significantly to predicting high loading where the experimental value is low.
   - **Example**: For molecule *C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O*, Rule 5 has a SHAP value of **0.08798**, the highest among all rules for that molecule.

2. **Additional Positive Contribution from Rules 8 and 9**:
   - **Rule 8** and **Rule 9** also have significant positive SHAP values in several mispredicted cases.
   - These rules are intended to predict low yield but are contributing to high loading predictions.

3. **Negative SHAP Values from Rule 1**:
   - In mispredicted cases, **Rule 1** often has a negative SHAP value, correctly decreasing the probability of high loading as intended.

**Assessment of Specific Rules**

- **Rule 5**:
  - **Intended Function**: Predicts **low yield** when modifiers have amide bonds involving the amino group or near the carboxyl group.
  - **Issue**: Positive SHAP values in mispredicted cases suggest that Rule 5 is contributing to predicting **high loading**, opposite to its intended effect.
  - **Possible Reasons**:
    - The implementation of Rule 5 in the feature matrix may be incorrect.
    - The criteria defining Rule 5 may be too broad or overlapping with characteristics of high-yield modifiers.

- **Rule 8 and Rule 9**:
  - **Intended Function**: Predict **low yield** for specific structural features (e.g., ether linkages or aldehyde groups on aromatic rings).
  - **Issue**: Similar to Rule 5, these rules show positive SHAP values contributing to high loading predictions in misclassified molecules.
  - **Possible Reasons**:
    - Misimplementation or overlap with features promoting high yield.
    - Criteria may not be exclusive enough to differentiate between high and low yield modifiers.

**Overfitting and Model Bias**

- The model's tendency to overpredict high loading indicates a bias, possibly due to:
  - **Class Imbalance**: If the dataset has more high-loading samples, the model may be biased towards predicting high loading.
  - **Rule Overlap**: Some rules may be conflicting or overlapping, causing the model to misinterpret certain features.
  - **Feature Correlation**: Positive contributions from multiple rules could be reinforcing incorrect predictions.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

1. **Refine Rule 5**:
   - **Clarify Criteria**: Ensure that the definition of Rule 5 accurately captures modifiers that should predict low yield.
   - **Review Implementation**: Check the feature matrix to confirm that Rule 5 is correctly applied and that its activation contributes to predicting low loading.
   - **Avoid Overlap**: Adjust the rule to prevent overlap with characteristics of high-yield modifiers.

2. **Adjust Rules 8 and 9**:
   - **Enhance Specificity**: Refine the criteria to more precisely identify modifiers that should predict low yield.
   - **Correct Implementation**: Verify that these rules are correctly contributing to lower the probability of high loading when activated.
   - **Evaluate Interactions**: Consider potential interactions with other rules that may negate their intended effect.

3. **Address Overfitting and Model Bias**:
   - **Balance the Dataset**: If there is class imbalance, augment the dataset with more low-loading samples or apply techniques like resampling.
   - **Regularization**: Implement regularization techniques to prevent overfitting to certain features.
   - **Cross-Validation**: Continue using cross-validation to assess model generalization and adjust accordingly.

4. **Enhance the Feature Matrix**:
   - **Feature Importance Analysis**: Use SHAP values to identify and adjust features that contribute to mispredictions.
   - **Remove Redundant Features**: Eliminate or combine rules that are overlapping or redundant.
   - **Introduce New Features**: Consider additional rules or features that could help differentiate between high and low yield modifiers.

5. **Model Evaluation and Iteration**:
   - **Iterative Refinement**: Continuously refine rules based on model performance and SHAP analysis.
   - **Monitor Changes**: Track how adjustments to the rules affect the model's accuracy and prediction tendencies.
   - **Set Performance Thresholds**: Define acceptable metrics to determine when the model has reached satisfactory performance.

6. **Consult Domain Expertise**:
   - **Chemical Insights**: Leverage chemical knowledge to better understand why certain modifiers are misclassified.
   - **Revise Rule Rationales**: Re-evaluate the rationales behind each rule to ensure they are chemically sound and relevant.

**Conclusion**

While the current rules have improved the model's accuracy, there are clear indications that specific rules are not functioning as intended, particularly Rule 5, Rule 8, and Rule 9. By carefully reviewing and refining these rules, and addressing the model's bias towards predicting high loading, we can further enhance the model's performance. Continuous analysis using SHAP values will be crucial in guiding these refinements and achieving a balance between model accuracy and generalization.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

The current set of rules aims to predict the yield of remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reactions based on the structure of molecular modifiers. Recent analyses have identified several issues and areas for improvement in these rules, particularly concerning their implementation and effect on the model's predictive performance. Below are the key points from the discussions and suggestions for optimizing the current rules:

1. **Correct Rule 4 Implementation**:
   - **Issue**: Rule 4 incorrectly assigns a value of 1 to all molecules because it counts the hydroxyl group of the carboxylic acid itself as a polar group within three carbons of the carboxyl group. This leads to inaccurate predictions.
   - **Suggestion**: Modify the SMARTS patterns for polar groups to exclude the carboxylic acid's hydroxyl oxygen. Ensure that polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl `[OH]` and sulfhydryl `[SH]`) are not part of the carboxylic acid group. Adjust the code to avoid counting the carboxylic acid's own oxygen atoms when searching for polar groups.

2. **Fix Rule 2 Logic for Substituents at Para Position**:
   - **Issue**: Rule 2 does not correctly identify electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids, leading to incorrect yield predictions.
   - **Suggestion**: Use RDKit's ring perception to accurately identify the para position in aromatic rings. Update the code to detect substituents at the para position correctly and classify them as electron-withdrawing or electron-donating accordingly.

3. **Ensure Rule 6 Correctly Identifies Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Without Functional Groups**:
   - **Issue**: Rule 6 may not accurately capture simple aliphatic carboxylic acids of chain lengths 6 to 8 carbons without additional functional groups, which are supposed to predict high yield.
   - **Suggestion**: Generalize the SMARTS patterns to match any aliphatic chain of 6 to 8 carbons terminating with a carboxylic acid and without additional functional groups. Modify the code to check for these patterns and ensure no other functional groups are present.

4. **Refine SMARTS Patterns to Accurately Represent Functional Groups**:
   - **Issue**: Some SMARTS patterns may not fully capture the intended functional groups, leading to misclassification.
   - **Suggestion**: Update the SMARTS patterns to accurately represent functional groups, such as perfluoroalkyl groups in Rule 7. Ensure that patterns encompass all relevant variations of these groups.

5. **Correct Rule Directionality Based on SHAP Analysis**:
   - **Issue**: SHAP analysis indicates that some rules, particularly Rules 5, 8, and 9, are contributing positively to high-yield predictions when they are intended to predict low yield. This suggests misimplementation or overlapping criteria with high-yield modifiers.
   - **Suggestion**: Review and correct the implementation of these rules in the feature matrix to ensure they contribute appropriately to the predictions. Adjust the criteria to prevent overlap with high-yield characteristics and ensure they function as intended.

6. **Improve Model Balance and Reduce Overfitting**:
   - **Issue**: The model shows a bias toward predicting high loading, potentially due to class imbalance or overlapping rule criteria, leading to overfitting.
   - **Suggestion**: Balance the dataset by augmenting it with more low-yield samples or applying resampling techniques if there is class imbalance. Introduce regularization in the model to prevent overfitting. Use cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well and adjust rules accordingly.

7. **Enhance Rule Generalization to Increase Support**:
   - **Issue**: Some rules have low support, meaning they apply to a small portion of the data.
   - **Suggestion**: Consider broadening some rule conditions to cover more data points without significantly compromising confidence and lift. Merge similar rules to create more general rules, increasing their applicability.

8. **Focus on High-Impact Conditions**:
   - **Suggestion**: Identify key functional groups that most strongly influence the yield and emphasize them in the rules. Simplify rules by removing conditions that do not significantly impact confidence and lift but reduce support.

9. **Validate the Feature Matrix Against Known Examples**:
   - **Suggestion**: Manually verify the feature matrix entries for known examples to ensure accuracy. Cross-reference high-yield and low-yield examples with their corresponding feature matrix entries to validate rule implementation.

10. **Optimize Substructure Searches**:
    - **Suggestion**: Compile SMARTS patterns before the loop if they will be used multiple times to prevent re-parsing the SMARTS strings for each molecule, improving performance.

11. **Incorporate Additional Chemical Knowledge**:
    - **Suggestion**: Utilize chemical expertise to understand why certain modifiers are misclassified. Include factors like steric hindrance and electronic resonance that could affect yield. Review academic literature for insights on effective modifiers.

12. **Introduce Additional Data Analysis**:
    - **Suggestion**: Use principal component analysis (PCA) or feature importance analysis to identify underlying patterns and rank the importance of different molecular features.

**Judgment on Further Optimization Possibility**

There is significant potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. By addressing the implementation issues, refining the SMARTS patterns, correcting rule directionality, and incorporating additional chemical knowledge, the rules can be improved to enhance the model's predictive performance and applicability.

    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic or aromatic carboxylic acids with a free (unprotected) amino group located within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**. This includes both linear and cyclic structures.
  - *Rationale*: The presence of a nearby free amino group enhances coordination with the metal center, increasing catalyst effectiveness.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid *(L-Aspartic acid)*
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid *(L-Glutamic acid)*
    - 5-aminopentanoic acid
    - 4-aminobenzoic acid
    - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid *(L-Tryptophan)*
  - *Low Yield Counterexamples*:
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid *(N-acetylated amino acid)*
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid *(Amino group distant from carboxyl group)*
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid

- **Rule 2**: In **aromatic carboxylic acids**, the presence of **electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) at the para position** predicts a **high yield**, while **electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxyl, sulfhydryl) at the same position** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups enhance acidity and coordination ability of the carboxylate, promoting better interaction with the catalyst. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and can hinder coordination.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
    - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to a nitrogen-containing aromatic ring** predict a **high yield**. If the carboxyl group is attached to an aromatic ring fused to the heterocycle or via a linker, it predicts a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Direct attachment permits the nitrogen to participate in coordination, enhancing catalyst interaction.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid *(Nicotinic acid)*
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid *(Carboxyl group not directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring)*

- **Rule 4**: For **aliphatic carboxylic acids**, the presence of **polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, sulfhydryl) within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predicts a **high yield**; if such groups are located further away, the yield is predicted to be **low**.
  - *Rationale*: Proximity of polar groups enhances coordination capabilities by providing additional interaction sites.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that have **amide bonds involving the amino group or near the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide formation reduces availability of amino or carboxyl groups for metal coordination, diminishing the modifier's effectiveness.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **simple aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 6 to 8 carbons and without additional functional groups** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Straight-chain aliphatic acids of moderate length can effectively coordinate with the catalyst without steric hindrance from additional functional groups.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - Octanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Counterexamples*:
    - None in the dataset

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that contain **strongly electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups (e.g., trifluoromethyl, perfluoroalkyl)** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Strong electron-withdrawing groups decrease the nucleophilicity of the carboxylate anion, reducing coordination ability and potentially introducing steric hindrance.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
    - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids containing ether linkages in the carbon chain** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether oxygen atoms and the increased flexibility may hinder effective coordination by disrupting the optimal conformation for metal binding.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups attached to the ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can engage in side reactions or form intramolecular interactions, interfering with metal coordination.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids linked to an aromatic ring via a chain of four or more carbons** predict a **high yield**, whereas those with shorter chains predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic linkers reduce electronic and steric interference from the aromatic ring, allowing effective coordination with the metal center.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: Modify **Rule 4** to exclude the hydroxyl oxygen of the carboxylic acid group when identifying polar functional groups within three carbons of the carboxyl group. Update the SMARTS patterns to ensure that only hydroxyl (`[OX2H]`) and sulfhydryl (`[SH]`) groups not part of the carboxyl group are counted. This will prevent the carboxylic acid's own oxygen atoms from being incorrectly identified as additional polar groups.

- **Advice 2**: Refine **Rule 2** to accurately identify substituents at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids. Utilize RDKit's ring perception and molecular graph analysis to determine the para position relative to the carboxyl group. Update the code to correctly classify electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups located at the para position, ensuring accurate yield predictions based on their electronic effects.

- **Advice 3**: Update **Rule 6** to correctly identify simple aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 6 to 8 carbons that lack additional functional groups. Modify the SMARTS patterns to match linear aliphatic chains terminating with a carboxylic acid group and exclude molecules containing other functional groups such as hydroxyl, amino, or ether groups. This will accurately capture modifiers like octanoic acid.

- **Advice 4**: Review and refine the SMARTS patterns across all rules to accurately represent the intended functional groups. For **Rule 7**, expand the SMARTS patterns to include all relevant variations of fluorinated groups, such as trifluoromethyl and perfluoroalkyl chains. Ensure that the patterns are comprehensive and correctly identify modifiers containing these electron-withdrawing groups.

- **Advice 5**: Correctly implement **Rules 5, 8, and 9** to predict **low yield** as intended. Review the criteria to prevent overlap with high-yield characteristics. Ensure that modifiers containing amide bonds (Rule 5), ether linkages in aliphatic chains (Rule 8), and aldehyde groups attached to aromatic rings (Rule 9) are accurately identified and contribute negatively to the yield prediction in the feature matrix.

- **Advice 6**: Address model bias and potential overfitting by balancing the dataset. Augment the data with additional low-yield samples or apply resampling techniques to achieve class balance. Introduce regularization methods in the model, such as L1 or L2 regularization, to prevent overfitting. Utilize cross-validation techniques to validate the model's performance and generalization to new data.

- **Advice 7**: Enhance the generalization of rules with low support by broadening their conditions. Merge similar rules where appropriate to create more general rules that apply to a larger portion of the dataset. For example, combine rules that address electron-withdrawing groups to encompass a wider range of functional groups without significantly compromising confidence and lift.

- **Advice 8**: Focus on high-impact functional groups that strongly influence the yield. Simplify complex rules by removing conditions that do not substantially affect confidence and lift but reduce support. Prioritize conditions that have the most significant impact on yield to create more robust and broadly applicable rules.

- **Advice 9**: Validate the feature matrix against known examples by manually verifying the entries for both high-yield and low-yield modifiers. Cross-reference the modifiers with their corresponding rule features to ensure the rules are correctly implemented and the features accurately reflect the intended predictions.

- **Advice 10**: Optimize substructure searches by compiling SMARTS patterns before processing molecules. Store the compiled patterns in a list or dictionary to avoid re-parsing the SMARTS strings for each molecule. This will improve the performance of the code, especially when dealing with large datasets.

- **Advice 11**: Incorporate additional chemical knowledge into the rule development process. Consider factors such as steric hindrance, electronic resonance, and chelation effects that may influence the modifier's ability to coordinate with the metal center. Review the literature for insights on modifiers that have unexpected yields and adjust the rules to account for these factors.

- **Advice 12**: Introduce additional data analysis techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and feature importance ranking, to identify underlying patterns in the data. Use these analyses to determine which molecular features have the most significant impact on yield and prioritize these features when refining the rules.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids containing a free (unprotected) amino group within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The proximity of the amino group to the carboxyl group enhances the ability to chelate metal ions, improving catalyst performance through stronger coordination.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid *(L-Aspartic acid)*
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid *(L-Glutamic acid)*
    - 5-aminopentanoic acid
    - 4-aminobenzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Counterexamples*:
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid *(Amino group distant from carboxyl group)*
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid *(Amide formation reduces free amino availability)*

- **Rule 2**: In **aromatic carboxylic acids**, the presence of **electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) at the para position** predicts a **high yield**, while **electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxyl, sulfhydryl) at the same position** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and can hinder coordination.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
    - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to a nitrogen-containing aromatic ring** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Direct attachment allows the heteroatom (e.g., nitrogen) to participate in metal coordination, enhancing catalyst interaction.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid *(Nicotinic acid)*
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid *(Carboxyl group not directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring)*

- **Rule 4**: For **aliphatic carboxylic acids**, the presence of **polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, sulfhydryl) within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predicts a **high yield**; if such groups are located further away or absent, the yield is predicted to be **low**.
  - *Rationale*: Polar groups near the carboxyl group enhance metal coordination through additional binding sites.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid *(Functional group too distant)*
    - Octanoic acid *(No additional polar groups)*
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with an aliphatic chain of four or more carbons separating the carboxyl group from the ring** predict a **high yield**; shorter chains predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic linkers reduce electronic and steric interference from the aromatic ring, facilitating better metal coordination.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid *(Shorter linker chain)*

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that **contain amide bonds involving the amino group or near the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide formation decreases the availability of amino or carboxyl groups for metal coordination, diminishing the modifier's effectiveness.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that contain **strongly electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups (e.g., trifluoromethyl, perfluoroalkyl)** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: These groups decrease the electron density of the carboxylate, reducing its ability to coordinate with metal centers.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
    - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: **Modify Rule 4 High and Low to specifically match only aliphatic carboxylic acids.** Currently, the SMARTS pattern for `carboxylic_acid` matches both aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids, leading to incorrect matches (e.g., aromatic compounds matching Rule 4 High). To fix this, define a new SMARTS pattern `aliphatic_carboxylic_acid` that excludes aromatic carbons:

  ```python
  aliphatic_carboxylic_acid = '[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CX4]'
  ```

  Update the patterns for Rule 4 High and Rule 4 Low to use `aliphatic_carboxylic_acid` instead of `carboxylic_acid`:

  ```python
  'Rule 4 High': {
      'smarts': aliphatic_carboxylic_acid,
      'additional_checks': 'polar_within_three_carbons',
      'prediction': 1
  },
  'Rule 4 Low': {
      'smarts': aliphatic_carboxylic_acid,
      'additional_checks': 'polar_farther_than_three_carbons_or_absent',
      'prediction': -1
  },
  ```

- ** Suggestion 2 **: **Improve the positional analysis for substituents in Rule 2 High and Low to accurately identify para substitutions.** The current code lacks proper positional checks for substituents on the aromatic ring, leading to incorrect or missed matches. Enhance the code by:

  - Identifying the aromatic ring directly attached to the carboxyl group.
  - Numbering the ring atoms starting from the one bonded to the carboxyl group.
  - Checking for substituents at the para position (position 4 in a benzene ring).
  - Verifying if the substituents at the para position are electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups based on defined SMARTS patterns.

  Implement the positional checking using RDKit's substructure search with atom mapping or by analyzing the ring system.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: **Refine the SMARTS pattern for Rule 3 to ensure the carboxyl group is directly attached to a nitrogen-containing aromatic ring.** The current generic `heteroaromatic_nitrogen_ring` pattern may not guarantee direct attachment of the carboxyl group. Update the SMARTS pattern to:

  ```python
  heteroaromatic_carboxylic_acid = '[n][c]:[c]:[c]:[c]:[c][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'
  ```

  Or adjust the code to check that the carboxyl carbon is directly bonded to a nitrogen atom in an aromatic ring.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: **Ensure that polar groups farther than three carbons from the carboxyl group are correctly identified in Rule 4 Low.** The current logic may not properly exclude molecules where polar groups are present but too distant. Modify the code to:

  - Identify all polar functional groups in the molecule.
  - Calculate the shortest path lengths from the carboxylic acid carbon to each polar group atom.
  - Confirm that all polar groups are either absent or more than three bonds away (path length > 6 atoms).

- ** Suggestion 5 **: **For Rule 5 High and Low, accurately assess the length of the aliphatic chain separating the carboxyl group from the aromatic ring.** Modify the SMARTS patterns to:

  - For Rule 5 High (chain of four or more carbons):

    ```python
    'Rule 5 High': {
        'smarts': '[a][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]',
        'prediction': 1
    },
    ```

  - For Rule 5 Low (shorter chains):

    ```python
    'Rule 5 Low': {
        'smarts': '[a][CX4][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]',
        'prediction': -1
    },
    ```

  Ensure the code checks the exact length of the aliphatic linker between the aromatic ring and the carboxyl group.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: **In Rule 13, adjust the SMARTS pattern to match keto groups adjacent to carboxyl groups more precisely.** The current pattern may match unintended structures. Update the SMARTS to:

  ```python
  keto_adjacent_carboxyl = '[#6][CX3](=O)[#6][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'
  ```

  And ensure that the keto group is specifically adjacent to the carboxyl group.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: **Use more specific SMARTS patterns for functional groups.** For example, in electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups, ensure that the patterns precisely match the intended substituents. Define separate SMARTS for each group:

  ```python
  electron_withdrawing_groups = ['[N+](=O)[O-]', '[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]', '[F]', '[Cl]', '[Br]', '[I]', '[CX4](F)(F)F']
  electron_donating_groups = ['[OX2H]', '[OX2][CH3]', '[NX3H2]', '[SX2H]']
  ```

- ** Suggestion 8 **: **Add error handling and logging for molecules that cannot be parsed or for substructure search failures.** This will help in debugging issues with specific SMILES strings and ensure robust code execution.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Translate Qualitative Rules into Quantifiable Descriptors**

  - **Explanation**: The current rules are mostly qualitative, making it challenging to generate a numeric feature matrix. By translating these rules into quantifiable molecular descriptors, we can facilitate numerical analysis and modeling.
  - **Action**: Define specific, quantifiable parameters for each rule. For example, instead of "polar functional groups within three carbons," specify "count of polar functional groups within a three-bond distance from the carboxyl group." This allows for direct calculation from the molecular structure or SMILES strings.

- **Advice 2**: **Utilize Standard Molecular Descriptors and Fingerprints**

  - **Explanation**: Established molecular descriptors (e.g., atom counts, bond types, topological indices) and fingerprints can numerically represent structural features.
  - **Action**: Incorporate standardized descriptors such as the number of hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, ring counts, or electronic descriptors (e.g., Hammett sigma constants for substituents). Use cheminformatics tools (like RDKit) to calculate these descriptors for each modifier.

- **Advice 3**: **Simplify and Consolidate Overlapping Rules**

  - **Explanation**: Some rules overlap or are overly specific, which complicates feature extraction and may introduce redundancy.
  - **Action**: Merge similar rules and focus on broader categories. For instance, combine rules related to electron-withdrawing/donating groups into a single rule with a quantifiable parameter like the substituent constant (σ value). This reduces complexity and streamlines the feature matrix.

- **Advice 4**: **Incorporate Distance Metrics Between Functional Groups**

  - **Explanation**: Spatial relationships between functional groups are critical but need clear quantification.
  - **Action**: Define exact distance metrics (e.g., shortest path length in bonds) between key functional groups like amino and carboxyl groups. Use these distances as numerical features in the matrix.

- **Advice 5**: **Assign Numerical Scores to Functional Groups**

  - **Explanation**: Different functional groups contribute variably to yield.
  - **Action**: Develop a scoring system where functional groups are assigned numerical values based on their influence on yield (e.g., +1 for groups enhancing yield, -1 for groups decreasing yield). Sum the scores for each modifier to create a composite feature.

- **Advice 6**: **Quantify Electronic Effects Using Calculated Properties**

  - **Explanation**: Electronic properties impact reactivity and yield.
  - **Action**: Calculate properties like partial charges, dipole moments, and HOMO-LUMO gaps for the modifiers. Include these as continuous variables in the feature matrix to capture electronic effects numerically.

- **Advice 7**: **Include Global Molecular Properties**

  - **Explanation**: Overall molecular characteristics influence solubility, permeability, and interaction with the catalyst.
  - **Action**: Add descriptors such as molecular weight, logP (octanol-water partition coefficient), topological polar surface area (TPSA), and molecular flexibility indices to the feature set.

- **Advice 8**: **Use Binary Features for Presence or Absence of Key Structural Elements**

  - **Explanation**: Binary indicators simplify the representation of specific structural features.
  - **Action**: For each significant functional group or structural motif identified in the rules (e.g., presence of an aromatic ring, carboxylic acid group, amide bond), create a binary variable (1 for presence, 0 for absence).

- **Advice 9**: **Implement Machine Learning Techniques for Feature Selection**

  - **Explanation**: Machine learning can identify the most predictive features among numerous descriptors.
  - **Action**: Use algorithms like random forests or LASSO regression to analyze the dataset and determine which descriptors correlate most strongly with yield. Refine the rules based on these findings.

- **Advice 10**: **Develop Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) Models**

  - **Explanation**: QSAR models quantitatively relate chemical structures to activity (yield in this case).
  - **Action**: Build QSAR models using the numerical descriptors. This approach allows for the prediction of yields for new modifiers and provides insights that can refine and improve the existing rules.

- **Advice 11**: **Clarify Definitions and Thresholds in Rules**

  - **Explanation**: Ambiguities in definitions make automation difficult.
  - **Action**: Specify exact numerical thresholds in the rules (e.g., "Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups having σ_p > 0.5 at the para position predict a high yield"). This precision permits direct calculation and inclusion in the feature matrix.

- **Advice 12**: **Consider Stereochemistry Where Relevant**

  - **Explanation**: Stereochemistry can affect interactions with the catalyst.
  - **Action**: Include descriptors for stereocenters and chirality, if they impact yield. Use notation in SMILES strings to extract this information and represent it numerically.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to a nitrogen-containing aromatic ring** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Direct attachment allows the heteroatom (e.g., nitrogen) to participate in metal coordination, enhancing interaction with the catalyst.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid *(Nicotinic acid)*
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid *(Carboxyl group not directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring)*

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**
- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows for unambiguous classification of modifiers based on the presence of a free amino group within three carbons of the carboxyl group. The rationale provides strong physical-chemical insight, explaining how close proximity enhances metal coordination through chelation. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures (carboxylic acid and amino group), satisfying the complexity criterion. It is well-supported by multiple data points (four high-yield examples and two low-yield counterexamples), demonstrating good coverage and a balanced approach between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear in its structural description, allowing straightforward determination of modifiers based on the length of the linker between the carboxyl group and the aromatic ring. The rationale offers adequate physical-chemical insight by explaining the effects of linker length on flexibility and metal coordination. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures (aromatic ring, carboxyl group, linker length), meeting the complexity criterion. It is supported by multiple data points (three low-yield examples and two high-yield counterexamples), ensuring good coverage and a balanced approach.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear, specifying that an aliphatic chain of four or more carbons separating the carboxyl group from the aromatic ring predicts high yield. The rationale provides sound physical-chemical insight into how longer chains enhance flexibility and reduce steric hindrance, improving metal coordination. The rule combines multiple sub-structures, satisfying the complexity criterion. While coverage is limited to two high-yield examples and one low-yield counterexample, it is sufficient to support the rule, achieving a reasonable balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear in describing modifiers as aliphatic carboxylic acids with long (six or more carbons), unbranched chains predicting high yield. The rationale offers some physical-chemical insight related to hydrophobic interactions and alignment with the metal center. However, the rule's coverage is limited, with only one high-yield example and one low-yield counterexample, which affects its robustness. The balance could be improved by including more data points to strengthen the rule's validity.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear and specifies that modifiers containing amide bonds involving the amino group or near the carboxyl group predict low yield.

It is well-supported by multiple data points (three low-yield examples), demonstrating good coverage and an appropriate balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear, stating that heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to a nitrogen-containing aromatic ring predict high yield. The rationale gives adequate physical-chemical insight into the role of the heteroatom in metal coordination. The rule combines specific sub-structures, satisfying the complexity requirement. Supported by multiple data points (three high-yield examples and one low-yield counterexample), it demonstrates good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear in identifying modifiers with strongly electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups as predicting low yield. The rationale offers solid physical-chemical insight into how these groups affect electron density and coordination ability. The rule focuses on specific functional groups, fulfilling the complexity criterion. Coverage includes two low-yield examples, which is acceptable, though additional data would enhance robustness. The balance between simplicity and coverage is reasonable.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear, specifying that aliphatic carboxylic acids containing ether linkages predict low yield. The rationale provides adequate physical-chemical insight by explaining how ether linkages disrupt optimal coordination. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures, meeting the complexity expectation. Coverage is based on two low-yield examples, which is acceptable, but further data would strengthen the rule. The balance between complexity and coverage is adequate.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear in stating that aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups attached to the ring predict low yield. The rationale provides good physical-chemical insight into potential side reactions and interference with metal coordination. The rule combines multiple sub-structures, satisfying complexity criteria. Supported by two low-yield examples, the coverage is acceptable, with a reasonable balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear, indicating that polyhydroxy carboxylic acids or modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group predict high yield. The rationale offers strong physical-chemical insight into how additional coordination sites enhance metal interaction. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures, meeting the complexity criterion. While coverage includes only two high-yield examples, it is sufficient to support the rule, achieving an acceptable balance.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear, identifying modifiers containing peptide bonds or are peptides as predicting low yield. The rationale provides solid physical-chemical insight into the reduced availability of coordination sites due to peptide bonds. However, the rule's coverage is limited to a single low-yield example, weakening its robustness. Additional data points are needed to strengthen the rule and improve the balance between complexity and coverage.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids containing a free (unprotected) amino group within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The proximity of the amino group to the carboxyl group enhances metal coordination through chelation, improving catalyst performance.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid *(L-Aspartic acid)*
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid *(L-Glutamic acid)*
    - 5-aminopentanoic acid
    - 4-aminobenzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Counterexamples*:
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid *(Amino group distant from carboxyl group)*
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with a short linker (less than four carbons) between the carboxyl group and the aromatic ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Short linkers limit flexibility, hindering optimal metal coordination. The proximity to the aromatic ring may also introduce steric hindrance and electronic effects that reduce effectiveness.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *High Yield Counterexamples*:
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid *(Longer linker chain)*
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with an aliphatic chain of four or more carbons separating the carboxyl group from the ring** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility and reduce steric hindrance, facilitating better metal coordination and interaction with the catalyst.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid *(Shorter linker chain, low yield)*

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with long, unbranched carbon chains (six or more carbons)** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Long aliphatic chains may enhance hydrophobic interactions and allow for optimal alignment with the metal center, improving catalyst performance.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - Octanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid *(Presence of hydroxyl group may interfere with coordination)*

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that **contain amide bonds involving the amino group or near the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide formation decreases the availability of free amino or carboxyl groups for metal coordination, diminishing the modifier's effectiveness.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to a nitrogen-containing aromatic ring** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Direct attachment allows the heteroatom (e.g., nitrogen) to participate in metal coordination, enhancing interaction with the catalyst.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid *(Nicotinic acid)*
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid *(Carboxyl group not directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring)*

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that contain **strongly electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups (e.g., trifluoromethyl, perfluoroalkyl)** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: These groups decrease the electron density of the carboxylate, reducing its ability to coordinate with metal centers effectively.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
    - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids containing ether linkages within the carbon chain** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether linkages increase chain flexibility and may disrupt the optimal conformation required for effective metal coordination.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups attached to the ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can participate in side reactions or form intramolecular interactions, interfering with metal coordination and decreasing catalyst efficiency.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids (sugar acids) or contain multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites, enhancing interaction with the metal catalyst through chelation.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid *(Gluconic acid)*
    - 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers containing **peptide bonds or are peptides** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Peptide bonds reduce the availability of free amino and carboxyl groups for metal coordination, diminishing the modifier's effectiveness in enhancing the catalyst.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: **For Rule 9**, modify the code to ensure that the aldehyde group is directly attached to the aromatic ring. The current code checks for the presence of both an aromatic ring and an aldehyde group anywhere in the molecule, which may not accurately reflect the rule's intent. Update the SMARTS pattern for Rule 9 to specify that the aldehyde group is attached directly to the aromatic ring carbon. Use the SMARTS pattern `pattern_rule9 = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[c][CX3H1](=O)')` and then check with `match_rule9 = -1 if mol.HasSubstructMatch(pattern_rule9) else 0`.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: **For Rule 4**, ensure that the aliphatic chain is unbranched. The current SMARTS pattern does not account for branching in the carbon chain, which can lead to incorrect matches. Modify the SMARTS pattern to enforce unbranched chains by specifying that each carbon is bonded to two hydrogens (i.e., is a methylene group). Use the pattern `pattern_rule4 = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH3]')` to represent a carboxylic acid attached to an unbranched chain of six carbons.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: **For Rule 3**, adjust the code to match aliphatic chains of four or more carbons separating the carboxyl group from the ring. The current code only matches chains of exactly four carbons. Modify the SMARTS pattern to include variable-length chains of four or more carbons by using repetition operators or recursive SMARTS. For example, use `pattern_rule3 = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[c]-[C]-[C]-[C]-[C+,>=4]-[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]')` or employ the SMARTS syntax for repeats, such as `pattern_rule3 = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[c]-[C]-[C]-[C]-[C;R]{3,}-[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]')`.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: **For Rule 7**, expand the SMARTS pattern to detect perfluoroalkyl groups, not just trifluoromethyl groups. The current pattern only matches trifluoromethyl groups and may miss other fluorinated groups specified by the rule. Modify the SMARTS pattern to detect any carbon chain where carbons are fully substituted with fluorine atoms. Use a recursive SMARTS pattern like `fluorinated_group = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CX4]([F])([F])([F])')` for trifluoromethyl, and extend it for longer chains by allowing for repetition, such as `fluorinated_group = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CX4]([F])([F])[CX4]([F])([F])[CX4]([F])([F])')`, or more generally by using a pattern like `fluorinated_group = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CX4]([F])([F])[CX4]([F])([F])[CX4]([F])([F])[CX4]')`.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: **For Rule 11**, the peptide bond pattern may not capture all peptides or modifiers containing peptide bonds. The current SMARTS pattern `[NX3][CX3](=O)[NX3]` only matches a single peptide bond and may miss molecules with multiple peptide bonds or variations. Modify the pattern to detect multiple peptide bonds and consider different bonding scenarios. Use a recursive pattern like `peptide_bond = Chem.MolFromSmarts('([NX3][CX3](=O)){1,}[NX3]')` or `peptide_bond = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[NX3][CX3](=O)[NX3]([CX4])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]')` to match dipeptides and longer peptide chains.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: **For Rule 6**, ensure that the carboxyl group is directly attached to a nitrogen-containing aromatic ring. The current code may not explicitly enforce the direct attachment as per the rule's intent. Modify the SMARTS pattern to `[n][c]1[cH,c]...[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` to ensure that the carboxyl group is directly connected to the nitrogen-containing aromatic ring without any intervening atoms.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: **For Rule 5**, consider that amide bonds may form in different contexts, not just between carbon and nitrogen atoms directly adjacent to each other. Expand the SMARTS pattern to detect amide bonds involving the amino group or near the carboxyl group more comprehensively. Use patterns like `[NX3][CX3](=O)` near the carboxyl group or `[CX3](=O)[NX3]` near the amino group, and consider the proximity to functional groups.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: **For Rule 1**, ensure that the path length between the amino group and the carboxyl group accounts for all possible shortest paths, especially in molecules where alternative paths exist due to branching or ring structures. Confirm that the code calculates the shortest path correctly using `Chem.GetShortestPath` and adjust if necessary.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: **For Rule 10**, the code currently counts hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group but may not capture sugar acids effectively. Consider using more specific patterns that match sugar acid structures or multiple hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons. For example, use SMARTS patterns that detect polyhydroxy carboxylic acids, such as `[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CH]([OH])[CH]([OH])[CH2][OH]`.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: **For Rule 8**, ensure that the ether linkage detection accounts for linkages within the carbon chain and not in side groups or functional groups. Modify the SMARTS pattern to exclude ethers that are not part of the main carbon chain, possibly by specifying that the carbons are part of the main chain.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

Upon reviewing the current rule metrics in comparison with the reference metrics from previous iterations, several key observations emerge. The focus will be on **confidence** and **lift**, as per the instructions.

---

**Comparison of Metrics:**

1. **Train Support**:
   - **Previous Metrics**: Average train support ranged from **0.1667** to **0.1845**.
   - **Current Metrics**: Train support is **0.0519**.

   **Comment**: There is a significant decrease in train support. This means that the current set of rules applies to a smaller portion (approximately 5.2%) of the training data compared to previous rules (approximately 16.7% to 18.5%). While lower support can be acceptable if confidence and lift are high, it may also indicate that the rules are too specific and may not generalize well.

2. **Train Confidence**:
   - **Previous Metrics**: Average train confidence ranged from **0.5396** to **0.6352**.
   - **Current Metrics**: Train confidence is **0.7121**.

   **Comment**: The current rules exhibit a higher confidence level, indicating that when the rule conditions are met, there is a 71.2% chance of predicting a high yield correctly. This is an improvement over previous rules and suggests better predictive accuracy for the covered cases.

3. **Train Lift**:
   - **Previous Metrics**: Average train lift ranged from **1.0559** to **1.2048**.
   - **Current Metrics**: Train lift is **1.4347**.

   **Comment**: Lift has increased significantly, which implies that the rules are more effective at identifying high-yield cases compared to random chance. A lift greater than 1 indicates that the rule is useful, and the higher the lift, the more significant the association between the rule conditions and the high yield outcome.

4. **Train Leverage**:
   - **Previous Metrics**: Average train leverage ranged from **-0.0041** to **0.0289**.
   - **Current Metrics**: Train leverage is **0.0136**.

   **Comment**: Positive leverage indicates a stronger association than would be expected by chance. The current leverage falls within the range of previous metrics but is not the highest observed.

---

**Interpretation:**

- The **increase in confidence and lift** suggests that the current rules are more precise in predicting high-yield outcomes when the conditions are met.
- The **decrease in support** means that these rules apply to a smaller subset of the data. This could be acceptable if the goal is to identify specific high-yield cases with high certainty.
- The **leverage** is positive but moderate, indicating a reasonable association between the rule conditions and the high-yield outcome.

**Potential Concerns:**

- **Low Support**: With support dropping to around 5%, the rules may not be capturing enough of the data to be broadly useful. There is a risk that important cases are being missed.
- **Overfitting**: High confidence and lift with low support could indicate that the rules are overfitting the training data and may not perform well on unseen data.
- **Generalizability**: The rules may be too specific, reducing their applicability to new modifiers or broader chemical spaces.

---

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1. **Increase Support Without Sacrificing Confidence and Lift**:
   - **Broaden Rule Conditions**: Review the current rules to identify overly restrictive conditions that could be relaxed. For example, if a rule specifies a certain chain length or functional group position, consider testing whether slightly varying these parameters maintains high confidence.
   - **Merge Similar Rules**: Combine rules that have overlapping conditions or predictive capabilities. This can increase support by covering more data points while maintaining predictive power.

2. **Analyze Low-Support Rules**:
   - **Rule Effectiveness**: Investigate rules with very low support or those that predict low yield with high confidence. Determine if these rules are necessary or if they can be modified to capture more data points.
   - **Remove Redundant Rules**: Eliminate rules that do not significantly contribute to overall performance or that overlap excessively with more effective rules.

3. **Incorporate Additional Features**:
   - **Chemical Descriptors**: Introduce more general chemical descriptors or properties that may capture broader trends. This could include electronic properties, steric factors, or hydrophobicity.
   - **Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSAR)**: Utilize QSAR modeling to identify additional predictors of high yield that can be incorporated into the rules.

4. **Validate with External Data**:
   - **Test Set Evaluation**: Apply the current rules to a separate test dataset to assess their generalizability. Evaluate whether the high confidence and lift are maintained.
   - **Cross-Validation**: Perform cross-validation on the training data to check for overfitting.

5. **Iterative Refinement**:
   - **Expert Feedback**: Consult with domain experts to validate the rationale behind each rule. Their insights may help refine rule conditions or identify overlooked factors.
   - **Adjust Rule Thresholds**: Experiment with different thresholds for confidence and lift during rule generation to find an optimal balance between support and predictive power.

6. **Consider Alternative Modeling Approaches**:
   - If rule-based methods are not capturing sufficient support with high confidence and lift, consider complementary approaches such as machine learning classifiers that can handle complex, non-linear relationships.

---

**Conclusion:**

The current iteration of rules shows improvement in confidence and lift, indicating more accurate predictions when the rules apply. However, the reduced support suggests that these rules are not capturing a significant portion of the dataset, which may limit their practical utility. 

To enhance the performance of the rules, efforts should focus on increasing support while maintaining or improving confidence and lift. This can be achieved by generalizing rule conditions, merging similar rules, and incorporating additional predictive features. Validation with external data is crucial to ensure that the rules are not overfitting and will perform well in practical applications.

Continued iterative refinement, guided by both analytical metrics and chemical domain expertise, will help develop a robust set of rules that provide reliable predictions across a broader range of modifiers.

ML Commenter Message:
**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

Based on the latest training results, the current 5-fold validation accuracy of the classification model is **65.71%**. This is a decrease compared to the previous validation accuracies, which were consistently around **76%**. The test accuracies in prior iterations ranged from **62.5%** to **75%**, suggesting that the model previously performed better on unseen data.

**Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting**

The decrease in validation accuracy indicates that the current set of rules may not be capturing the underlying patterns as effectively as before. This could be due to:

- **Overfitting**: The rules may have become too specific to the training data, failing to generalize well to new molecules.
- **Underfitting**: The rules may not be complex enough to capture the necessary relationships, leading to poor performance on both training and validation sets.

Given that the validation accuracy has decreased while the complexity of the rules has increased, it's likely that the model is experiencing **overfitting**, where it models noise rather than the underlying signal.

**Analysis of SHAP Values and Rule Effectiveness**

SHAP values provide insights into how each rule contributes to the model's predictions. By examining molecules where the predicted loading does not match the experimental value, we can identify which rules may be contributing to mispredictions.

**Insights from SHAP Analysis**

- **Rule 5** (Modifiers containing amide bonds predict a low yield):
  - **Issue**: High positive SHAP values in overestimated loadings suggest that Rule 5 is incorrectly promoting a high loading prediction for certain molecules.
  - **Possible Cause**: The rule may not be accurately capturing the impact of amide bonds on the modifier's effectiveness.

- **Rule 8** (Aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages predict a low yield):
  - **Issue**: High negative SHAP values in underestimated loadings indicate that Rule 8 may be too broadly applied or too restrictive.
  - **Possible Cause**: The presence of ether linkages might not always diminish the modifier's effectiveness as previously thought.

- **Rule 9** (Aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups predict a low yield):
  - **Issue**: Contributing to overestimations when it should predict low yield, suggesting the rule may be misapplied or not specific enough.
  - **Possible Cause**: The rule might be failing to account for other molecular features that override the effect of aldehyde groups.

- **Rule 1** (Modifiers with amino groups near the carboxyl group predict high yield):
  - **Issue**: Negative SHAP values leading to underestimation suggest that the rule might be penalizing certain molecules incorrectly.
  - **Possible Cause**: The strict definition of "within three carbons" might exclude effective modifiers.

- **Rule 2** (Aromatic carboxylic acids with short linkers predict low yield):
  - **Issue**: Negative SHAP values in underestimated loadings indicate the rule may be too stringent.
  - **Possible Cause**: Some effective modifiers might have shorter linkers but still perform well due to other favorable interactions.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

1. **Refine Rule 5**

   - **Issue**: Rule 5 is contributing to overestimations.
   - **Action**: Reevaluate the definition of amide bonds affecting yield. Consider specifying the position and context of the amide bond. For instance, amide bonds directly adjacent to the carboxyl group may reduce coordination, but those further away might not have the same effect.

2. **Adjust Rule 8**

   - **Issue**: Rule 8 is causing underestimation in molecules that experimentally have high loading.
   - **Action**: Narrow down the rule to specific types of ether linkages. If certain ether-containing modifiers perform well, modify the rule to exclude them. Alternatively, incorporate additional criteria, such as the position of ether linkages relative to the carboxyl group.

3. **Reassess Rule 9**

   - **Issue**: Rule 9 is contributing to overestimations, meaning it's not effectively identifying low-yield modifiers.
   - **Action**: Make the rule more specific by considering the position of the aldehyde group and other substituents on the aromatic ring. Additional electronic effects or steric hindrance might influence the modifier's behavior.

4. **Modify Rule 1**

   - **Issue**: Rule 1 is causing underestimations due to negative SHAP values.
   - **Action**: Broaden the rule to include modifiers where the amino group is within a slightly longer distance from the carboxyl group (e.g., within four or five carbons). This could capture modifiers that still benefit from chelation effects.

5. **Relax Rule 2**

   - **Issue**: Rule 2 may be too restrictive, leading to underestimation.
   - **Action**: Adjust the linker length criterion to allow for shorter linkers if compensated by other favorable interactions. Consider additional factors like substituents on the aromatic ring that might enhance coordination despite a short linker.

6. **Improve Generalization**

   - **Issue**: The model may be overfitting due to overly specific rules.
   - **Action**: Simplify overly complex rules and focus on fundamental chemical principles. Ensure that each rule is based on robust experimental evidence and encompasses a wider range of applicable molecules.

7. **Incorporate Additional Molecular Features**

   - **Action**: Introduce new descriptors or features into the feature matrix, such as:
     - **Steric hindrance parameters**
     - **Electronic properties (e.g., Hammett constants)**
     - **Hydrogen bonding capabilities**
     - **Molecular conformational flexibility**
   - **Rationale**: These features may capture nuances that the current rules miss, improving predictive accuracy.

8. **Validate and Iterate**

   - **Action**: After adjusting the rules, retrain the model and evaluate performance. Use SHAP analysis to assess the impact of the changes.
   - **Rationale**: Iterative refinement allows for continuous improvement and helps avoid local minima in model performance.

**Conclusion**

The decrease in validation accuracy suggests that the current rules may not be effectively capturing the factors that influence modifier loading on the catalyst. By analyzing the SHAP values, we've identified specific rules that contribute to mispredictions:

- **Overestimated Loadings**: Rules 5, 8, and 9 need refinement to prevent false positives.
- **Underestimated Loadings**: Rules 1 and 2 may be too restrictive and require adjustments to reduce false negatives.

Improving these rules involves making them more precise and ensuring they are based on sound chemical reasoning. Additionally, incorporating more molecular descriptors can help the model capture complex interactions that the current rules overlook.

**Next Steps**

- **Refine Rules**: Implement the suggested adjustments to Rules 1, 2, 5, 8, and 9.
- **Enhance Feature Matrix**: Include additional molecular features to improve model input.
- **Retrain and Evaluate**: Update the feature matrix, retrain the model, and assess performance using validation metrics and SHAP analysis.
- **Iterate**: Continue the cycle of refinement and evaluation to progressively enhance model accuracy.

By systematically addressing the issues identified through SHAP analysis and validation performance, we can improve the model's predictive capabilities and better understand the factors influencing modifier loading on catalysts.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimization**

In the recent analysis of the current rules for predicting the yield of the remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction, several key points have been identified:

1. **Rule Metrics Analysis**:
   - **Train Confidence and Lift**: The current rules exhibit a **higher train confidence (71.2%)** and **lift (1.43)** compared to previous iterations. This suggests that when the rules apply, they are more likely to predict high yields correctly.
   - **Train Support**: There is a **significant decrease in train support to 5.2%**, indicating that the rules apply to a smaller portion of the dataset. This raises concerns about the generalizability and applicability of the rules.
   - **Potential Overfitting**: High confidence and lift with low support may indicate that the rules are **overfitting** the training data and may not perform well on unseen data.

2. **SHAP Analysis and Rule Effectiveness**:
   - **Overestimated Loadings**: Some rules (particularly **Rules 5, 8, and 9**) are contributing to overestimations where the model predicts a high yield, but the experimental yield is low.
   - **Underestimated Loadings**: Other rules (notably **Rules 1 and 2**) are causing underestimations where the model predicts a low yield, but the experimental yield is high.
   - **Specific Rule Issues**:
     - **Rule 5**: May not accurately capture the impact of amide bonds on yield, leading to mispredictions.
     - **Rule 8**: Might be overly broad, causing it to incorrectly lower predictions for certain modifiers.
     - **Rule 9**: The current pattern may not be specific enough regarding the position of the aldehyde group, leading to misclassifications.

3. **Performance Evaluation**:
   - **Validation Accuracy**: The 5-fold validation accuracy has decreased to **65.71%**, down from previous accuracies around **76%**. This decrease suggests that the model's predictive power has diminished.
   - **Overfitting Risk**: The combination of high confidence with low support and decreased validation accuracy indicates a risk of overfitting, where the model is too tailored to the training data and may not generalize well.

**Suggestions to Improve Current Rules**

To address the issues identified and optimize the current rules, the following specific suggestions are proposed:

1. **Modify Rule 9**:
   - **Issue**: The aldehyde group's direct attachment to the aromatic ring may not be enforced, leading to incorrect matches.
   - **Suggestion**: Update the SMARTS pattern to ensure the aldehyde group is directly attached to the aromatic ring carbon. Use:
     ```python
     pattern_rule9 = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[c][CX3H1](=O)')
     ```
     Then check:
     ```python
     match_rule9 = 1 if mol.HasSubstructMatch(pattern_rule9) else 0
     ```

2. **Refine Rule 4**:
   - **Issue**: The current pattern does not prevent branching in the aliphatic chain.
   - **Suggestion**: Enforce unbranched chains by specifying methylene groups:
     ```python
     pattern_rule4 = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH3]')
     ```

3. **Adjust Rule 3**:
   - **Issue**: The rule may only match chains of exactly four carbons.
   - **Suggestion**: Modify the pattern to include chains of four or more carbons using repetition operators:
     ```python
     pattern_rule3 = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[c]-[C]-[C]-[C]-[C+;X4]-[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]')
     ```
     Or:
     ```python
     pattern_rule3 = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[c]-[C]-[C]-[C]-[C;D2]-[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]')
     ```
     To represent variable-length chains, consider recursive SMARTS or advanced syntax.

4. **Expand Rule 7**:
   - **Issue**: Only detects trifluoromethyl groups, missing other perfluoroalkyl groups.
   - **Suggestion**: Extend the pattern to detect chains where carbons are fully substituted with fluorine:
     ```python
     fluorinated_group = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CX4]([F])([F])([F])[CX4]([F])([F])[CX4]([F])([F])')
     ```
     For general perfluoroalkyl chains, consider patterns that allow for repetition.

5. **Enhance Rule 11**:
   - **Issue**: May not capture all peptides or modifiers with multiple peptide bonds.
   - **Suggestion**: Use recursive patterns to detect multiple peptide bonds:
     ```python
     peptide_bond = Chem.MolFromSmarts('([NX3][CX3](=O)){1,}[NX3]')
     ```
     Or to match longer peptide chains with variations.

6. **Ensure Direct Attachment in Rule 6**:
   - **Issue**: The carboxyl group may not be directly attached to the nitrogen-containing aromatic ring as intended.
   - **Suggestion**: Modify the pattern to enforce direct attachment:
     ```python
     pattern_rule6 = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[n][c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]')
     ```

7. **Generalize Rule 5**:
   - **Issue**: Amide bonds may form in various contexts not captured by the current pattern.
   - **Suggestion**: Expand patterns to detect amide bonds involving the amino group or near the carboxyl group:
     ```python
     pattern_rule5 = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[NX3][CX3](=O)|[CX3](=O)[NX3]')
     ```
     And consider proximity to functional groups.

8. **Broaden Rule 1**:
   - **Issue**: The path length between the amino group and carboxyl group may be too restrictive.
   - **Suggestion**: Ensure the code checks all possible shortest paths:
     ```python
     paths = Chem.GetShortestPath(start_atom, end_atom)
     if len(paths) <= desired_length:
         match_rule1 = 1
     else:
         match_rule1 = 0
     ```
     Consider increasing the allowed distance if chemically justifiable.

9. **Refine Rule 10**:
   - **Issue**: Might not effectively capture sugar acids.
   - **Suggestion**: Use patterns that detect multiple hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons:
     ```python
     pattern_rule10 = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CH]([OH])[CH]([OH])[CH2][OH]')
     ```

10. **Fine-tune Rule 8**:
    - **Issue**: May include ethers not part of the main carbon chain.
    - **Suggestion**: Modify the pattern to focus on ether linkages within the main chain:
      ```python
      pattern_rule8 = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CX4][OX2][CX4]')
      ```
      Ensure the pattern excludes side-chain ethers.

**Possibility for Further Optimization**

Based on the analysis, there is a clear possibility for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting:

- **Improving Rule Specificity**: Refining the SMARTS patterns will make the rules more accurate and reduce misclassifications.
- **Balancing Support and Confidence**: Adjusting the rules to increase train support while maintaining high confidence and lift will enhance model performance and generalizability.
- **Iterative Refinement**: Implementing the suggested changes and retraining the model will help assess the impact on validation accuracy and overfitting.
- **Incorporating Additional Features**: Including more molecular descriptors (e.g., steric hindrance, electronic properties) may capture nuances that improve predictions.

**Please Optimize Rules**

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids containing a free (unprotected) amino group within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The proximity of the amino group to the carboxyl group enhances metal coordination through chelation, improving catalyst performance.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid *(L-Aspartic acid)*
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid *(L-Glutamic acid)*
    - 5-aminopentanoic acid
    - 4-aminobenzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Counterexamples*:
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid *(Amino group distant from carboxyl group)*
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with a short linker (less than four carbons) between the carboxyl group and the aromatic ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Short linkers limit flexibility, hindering optimal metal coordination. The proximity to the aromatic ring may also introduce steric hindrance and electronic effects that reduce effectiveness.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid
  - *High Yield Counterexamples*:
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid *(Longer linker chain)*
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with an aliphatic chain of four or more carbons separating the carboxyl group from the ring** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Longer aliphatic chains provide flexibility and reduce steric hindrance, facilitating better metal coordination and interaction with the catalyst.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid *(Shorter linker chain, low yield)*

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with long, unbranched carbon chains (six or more carbons)** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Long aliphatic chains may enhance hydrophobic interactions and allow for optimal alignment with the metal center, improving catalyst performance.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - Octanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid *(Presence of hydroxyl group may interfere with coordination)*

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that **contain amide bonds involving the amino group or near the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide formation decreases the availability of free amino or carboxyl groups for metal coordination, diminishing the modifier's effectiveness.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to a nitrogen-containing aromatic ring** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Direct attachment allows the heteroatom (e.g., nitrogen) to participate in metal coordination, enhancing interaction with the catalyst.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid *(Nicotinic acid)*
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid *(Carboxyl group not directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring)*

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that contain **strongly electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups (e.g., trifluoromethyl, perfluoroalkyl)** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: These groups decrease the electron density of the carboxylate, reducing its ability to coordinate with metal centers effectively.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid
    - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids containing ether linkages within the carbon chain** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether linkages increase chain flexibility and may disrupt the optimal conformation required for effective metal coordination.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups attached to the ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups can participate in side reactions or form intramolecular interactions, interfering with metal coordination and decreasing catalyst efficiency.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids (sugar acids) or contain multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites, enhancing interaction with the metal catalyst through chelation.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid *(Gluconic acid)*
    - 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers containing **peptide bonds or are peptides** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Peptide bonds reduce the availability of free amino and carboxyl groups for metal coordination, diminishing the modifier's effectiveness in enhancing the catalyst.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Modify Rule 9** to ensure the aldehyde group is directly attached to the aromatic ring carbon. Update the SMARTS pattern to detect aldehyde groups bonded to aromatic carbons:
  ```python
  pattern_rule9 = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[c][CX3H1](=O)')
  match_rule9 = 1 if mol.HasSubstructMatch(pattern_rule9) else 0
  ```
  This change will improve specificity and prevent misclassification of modifiers where the aldehyde is not directly attached.

- **Advice 2**: **Refine Rule 4** to enforce unbranched aliphatic chains. Modify the SMARTS pattern to specify a straight-chain of methylene groups:
  ```python
  pattern_rule4 = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH3]')
  ```
  This adjustment ensures that only modifiers with long, unbranched carbon chains (six or more carbons) are matched, improving the rule's accuracy.

- **Advice 3**: **Adjust Rule 3** to include aliphatic chains of four or more carbons between the aromatic ring and the carboxyl group. Modify the SMARTS pattern to accommodate variable-length chains:
  ```python
  pattern_rule3 = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[c]-[C]-[C]-[C]-[C+;X4]-[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]')
  ```
  Alternatively, use recursive SMARTS or repetition operators for flexibility:
  ```python
  pattern_rule3 = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[c]-[C]-[C]-[C]-[C;D2]-[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]')
  ```
  This change captures modifiers with longer linkers, improving the rule's applicability.

- **Advice 4**: **Expand Rule 7** to detect a broader range of fluorinated groups, including perfluoroalkyl chains. Extend the SMARTS pattern to identify carbons fully substituted with fluorine:
  ```python
  pattern_rule7 = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CX4]([F])([F])([F])[CX4]([F])([F])[CX4]([F])([F])')
  ```
  Adjusting the pattern will allow the rule to match various fluorinated groups that can impact yield.

- **Advice 5**: **Enhance Rule 11** by detecting modifiers containing multiple peptide bonds or longer peptide chains. Use recursive SMARTS patterns to identify sequences of peptide bonds:
  ```python
  pattern_rule11 = Chem.MolFromSmarts('([NX3][CX3](=O)){1,}[NX3]')
  ```
  This modification ensures that all relevant peptides are identified, improving the rule's effectiveness.

- **Advice 6**: **Modify Rule 6** to ensure the carboxyl group is directly attached to a nitrogen-containing aromatic ring. Update the SMARTS pattern:
  ```python
  pattern_rule6 = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[n][c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]')
  ```
  This refinement increases the rule's specificity, correctly identifying high-yield modifiers.

- **Advice 7**: **Generalize Rule 5** to capture all amide bonds involving the amino group or near the carboxyl group. Expand the SMARTS pattern:
  ```python
  pattern_rule5 = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[NX3][CX3](=O)|[CX3](=O)[NX3]')
  ```
  This change improves detection of modifiers where amide formation reduces coordination sites.

- **Advice 8**: **Broaden Rule 1** by checking all possible shortest paths between the amino group and the carboxyl group. Modify the code to consider varying distances:
  ```python
  paths = Chem.GetShortestPath(start_atom, end_atom)
  if len(paths) <= desired_length:
      match_rule1 = 1
  else:
      match_rule1 = 0
  ```
  Consider increasing the allowed path length if chemically justified, capturing more relevant modifiers.

- **Advice 9**: **Refine Rule 10** to better identify polyhydroxy carboxylic acids (sugar acids). Use SMARTS patterns that detect multiple hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons:
  ```python
  pattern_rule10 = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CH]([OH])[CH]([OH])[CH2][OH]')
  ```
  This enhancement ensures accurate detection of modifiers that enhance yield through multiple coordination sites.

- **Advice 10**: **Fine-tune Rule 8** by focusing on ether linkages within the main carbon chain and excluding side-chain ethers. Update the SMARTS pattern:
  ```python

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids containing a free (unprotected) amino group within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The close proximity of the amino group to the carboxyl group enhances metal coordination through chelation, improving catalyst performance.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid *(L-Aspartic acid)*
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid *(L-Glutamic acid)*
    - 4-aminobenzoic acid
    - 5-aminopentanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Counterexamples*:
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid *(Amino group distant from carboxyl group)*
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with functional groups capable of metal coordination (e.g., amino, nitro, hydroxyl) at the ortho or para positions** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Functional groups positioned to coordinate with metal ions can enhance catalyst interaction and performance.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - 4-aminobenzoic acid
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid *(Methyl group lacks coordination ability)*
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid *(Aldehyde group may not effectively coordinate)*

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with long, unbranched carbon chains (six or more carbons) and no additional functional groups** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Long hydrocarbon chains can enhance hydrophobic interactions and minimize interference from other functional groups, facilitating better catalyst engagement.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - Octanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid *(Additional functional group far from carboxyl reduces yield)*
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids containing functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) distant from the carboxyl group (more than three carbons away)** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Functional groups far from the carboxyl group are less effective in coordinating with the metal center and may introduce steric hindrance or unwanted interactions.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups incapable of metal coordination (e.g., methyl group) at the ortho or para positions** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups can decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing its ability to coordinate with metal ions.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with multiple electron-withdrawing groups capable of metal coordination (e.g., nitro, carbonyl groups)** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxylate, enhancing interaction with the metal catalyst.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids or contain multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.

  - *High Yield Example*:
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid *(Gluconic acid)*

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that contain **bulky substituents or long ether chains that can introduce steric hindrance** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Bulky groups can hinder effective coordination between the modifier and the metal center, reducing catalytic efficiency.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid *(Bulkiness from directly connected aromatic rings)*

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **fluorinated carboxylic acids or contain strongly electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Strongly electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups reduce the electron density of the carboxylate, diminishing its coordination ability with metal centers.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that **contain amide bonds involving the amino group or near the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide formation decreases the availability of free amino and carboxyl groups necessary for effective metal coordination.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups attached to the ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups may engage in side reactions or form intramolecular interactions that interfere with metal coordination, reducing catalyst efficiency.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms in the ring directly attached to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The nitrogen heteroatom can participate in metal coordination, enhancing the interaction with the catalyst.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid *(Nicotinic acid)*
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **long aliphatic chains connecting functional groups to the carboxyl group (four or more carbons)** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Longer chains provide flexibility, reducing steric hindrance and allowing optimal alignment for metal coordination.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid *(Shorter chain, low yield)*

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids containing ether linkages within the carbon chain** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether linkages can increase chain flexibility and disrupt the optimal conformation required for effective metal coordination.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **peptides or contain peptide bonds** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Peptide bonds reduce the availability of free amino and carboxyl groups for metal coordination, diminishing the modifier's effectiveness.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**:

  Rule 1 is clear and precisely defines the structural criteria for predicting high yield: modifiers that are carboxylic acids containing a free amino group within three carbons of the carboxyl group. This allows for unambiguous classification of modifiers. The rationale provides strong physico-chemical insight by explaining that the proximity of the amino group enhances metal coordination through chelation, improving catalyst performance. The rule considers combinations of functional groups and their spatial arrangement, meeting the complexity criterion. Multiple data points, including high-yield examples and low-yield counterexamples, support the rule, satisfying the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 2**:

  Rule 2 clearly specifies that aromatic carboxylic acids with functional groups capable of metal coordination at the ortho or para positions predict high yield. The structural description allows for straightforward application. The rationale offers adequate physico-chemical insight by highlighting how the positioning of functional groups enhances catalyst interaction and performance. The rule involves a combination of sub-structures (aromatic ring, carboxyl group, coordinating functional groups at specific positions), demonstrating appropriate complexity. There are sufficient data points supporting the rule, fulfilling the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 3**:

  Rule 3 is clear in stating that aliphatic carboxylic acids with long, unbranched carbon chains (six or more carbons) and no additional functional groups predict high yield. The structural criteria are easy to identify in modifiers. The rationale provides insight into how long hydrocarbon chains can enhance hydrophobic interactions, facilitating better catalyst engagement. While the rule is simpler, it appropriately considers the absence of interfering functional groups along with chain length, meeting the complexity criterion at an acceptable level. The rule is supported by examples such as octanoic acid, satisfying the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 4**:

  Rule 4 clearly defines that aliphatic carboxylic acids containing functional groups distant from the carboxyl group (more than three carbons away) predict low yield. This allows for easy classification based on the position of functional groups. The rationale gives physico-chemical insight by explaining that distant functional groups are less effective in metal coordination and may introduce unwanted interactions. The rule combines considerations of functional group presence and spatial arrangement, meeting the complexity criterion. There are multiple data points supporting this rule, including low-yield examples like 7-aminoheptanoic acid, fulfilling the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 5**:

  Rule 5 is clear in specifying that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups incapable of metal coordination at the ortho or para positions predict low yield. The structural description is precise, aiding in unambiguous classification. The rationale provides insight into how electron-donating groups decrease carboxyl group acidity, reducing metal coordination ability. The rule considers both the electronic nature and positioning of substituents, demonstrating appropriate complexity. Sufficient data points, including low-yield examples like 4-methylbenzoic acid, support the rule, satisfying the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 6**:

  Rule 6 clearly states that aromatic carboxylic acids with multiple electron-withdrawing groups capable of metal coordination predict high yield. This precise structural description facilitates easy application. The rationale offers strong physico-chemical insight by explaining that electron-withdrawing groups increase acidity and coordination ability of the carboxylate. The rule involves complex structural considerations, including multiple functional groups and their coordination capabilities, meeting the complexity criterion. There are high-yield examples like 4-nitrobenzoic acid supporting the rule, fulfilling the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 7**:

  Rule 7 specifies that polyhydroxy carboxylic acids or modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group predict high yield. The structural criteria are clear. The rationale provides adequate physico-chemical insight by noting that multiple hydroxyl groups offer additional coordination sites, promoting strong chelation with the metal center. While the rule considers combinations of functional groups and their proximity, which meets the complexity criterion, the coverage is limited due to fewer supporting data points. Only one high-yield example, gluconic acid, is provided, suggesting the need for more data to strengthen the rule's validity.

- **Comment 8**:

  Rule 8 clearly states that modifiers containing bulky substituents or long ether chains that can introduce steric hindrance predict low yield. The structural description allows for straightforward identification of such modifiers. The rationale gives physico-chemical insight into how steric hindrance can impede effective coordination between the modifier and the metal center. The rule considers combinations of structural features that contribute to steric effects, meeting the complexity criterion. There are supporting low-yield examples like 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, satisfying the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 9**:

  Rule 9 is clear in stating that fluorinated carboxylic acids or those containing strongly electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups predict low yield. The presence of fluorinated groups is easily identifiable. The rationale provides insight by explaining that these groups reduce electron density, diminishing coordination ability with metal centers. The rule considers the strong electron-withdrawing effects of fluorinated groups, meeting the complexity criterion. Low-yield examples like 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid support the rule, fulfilling the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 10**:

  Rule 10 clearly defines that modifiers containing amide bonds involving the amino group or near the carboxyl group predict low yield. The structural criteria are precise, enabling easy identification. The rationale offers physico-chemical insight by explaining that amide formation decreases the availability of free amino and carboxyl groups necessary for effective metal coordination. The rule considers specific functional group transformations, meeting the complexity criterion. Supporting low-yield examples like (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid are provided, satisfying the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 11**:

  Rule 11 states clearly that aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups attached to the ring predict low yield. The structural description is specific, facilitating straightforward application. The rationale provides insight into how aldehyde groups may engage in side reactions or interfere with metal coordination. The rule combines considerations of specific functional groups and their potential reactivity, meeting the complexity criterion. Low-yield examples like 4-formylbenzoic acid support the rule, fulfilling the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 12**:

  Rule 12 is clear in specifying that heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms in the ring directly attached to the carboxyl group predict high yield. The structural criteria are precise and easily identifiable. The rationale provides strong physico-chemical insight by highlighting the role of the nitrogen heteroatom in metal coordination. The rule considers specific heteroaromatic structures, demonstrating appropriate complexity. High-yield examples like pyridine-3-carboxylic acid support the rule, satisfying the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 13**:

  Rule 13 states that modifiers with long aliphatic chains connecting functional groups to the carboxyl group (four or more carbons) predict high yield. While the rule attempts to address the effect of chain length, the structural description lacks clarity due to the broad definition of "functional groups" and potential overlap with other rules. Additionally, the rule seems contradictory to Rule 4, which suggests that distant functional groups lead to low yield. The rationale provides some insight into flexibility and reduced steric hindrance but may oversimplify the structural considerations. The complexity is present but may introduce confusion. Although supported by some data points like 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, the conflicting aspects reduce the rule's effectiveness.

- **Comment 14**:

  Rule 14 clearly specifies that aliphatic carboxylic acids containing ether linkages within the carbon chain predict low yield. The structural criteria are precise, allowing for unambiguous identification of such modifiers. The rationale offers insight into how ether linkages can disrupt optimal conformation required for effective metal coordination. The rule considers the combination of aliphatic chains and ether functionalities, meeting the complexity criterion. Low-yield examples like 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid support the rule, fulfilling the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 15**:

  Rule 15 clearly states that modifiers that are peptides or contain peptide bonds predict low yield. The structural description is specific, facilitating easy classification. The rationale provides physico-chemical insight by explaining that peptide bonds reduce the availability of free amino and carboxyl groups necessary for metal coordination. The rule considers specific functional group linkages, meeting the complexity criterion. While there is at least one supporting low-yield example, such as 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid, the coverage is limited, suggesting a need for more data points to strengthen the rule.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids containing a free (unprotected) amino group within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The close proximity of the amino group to the carboxyl group enhances metal coordination through chelation, improving catalyst performance.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid *(L-Aspartic acid)*
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid *(L-Glutamic acid)*
    - 4-aminobenzoic acid
    - 5-aminopentanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Counterexamples*:
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid *(Amino group distant from carboxyl group)*
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with functional groups capable of metal coordination (e.g., amino, nitro, hydroxyl) at the ortho or para positions** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Functional groups positioned to coordinate with metal ions can enhance catalyst interaction and performance.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - 4-aminobenzoic acid
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid *(Methyl group lacks coordination ability)*
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid *(Aldehyde group may not effectively coordinate)*

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with long, unbranched carbon chains (six or more carbons) and no additional functional groups** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Long hydrocarbon chains can enhance hydrophobic interactions and minimize interference from other functional groups, facilitating better catalyst engagement.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - Octanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid *(Additional functional group far from carboxyl reduces yield)*
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids containing functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) distant from the carboxyl group (more than three carbons away)** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Functional groups far from the carboxyl group are less effective in coordinating with the metal center and may introduce steric hindrance or unwanted interactions.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups incapable of metal coordination (e.g., methyl group) at the ortho or para positions** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups can decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing its ability to coordinate with metal ions.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with multiple electron-withdrawing groups capable of metal coordination (e.g., nitro, carbonyl groups)** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxylate, enhancing interaction with the metal catalyst.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids or contain multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites, promoting strong chelation with the metal center.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid *(Gluconic acid)*

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that contain **bulky substituents or long ether chains that can introduce steric hindrance** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Bulky groups can hinder effective coordination between the modifier and the metal center, reducing catalytic efficiency.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid *(Bulkiness from directly connected aromatic rings)*

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **fluorinated carboxylic acids or contain strongly electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Strongly electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups reduce the electron density of the carboxylate, diminishing its coordination ability with metal centers.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that **contain amide bonds involving the amino group or near the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide formation decreases the availability of free amino and carboxyl groups necessary for effective metal coordination.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups attached to the ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups may engage in side reactions or form intramolecular interactions that interfere with metal coordination, reducing catalyst efficiency.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms in the ring directly attached to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The nitrogen heteroatom can participate in metal coordination, enhancing the interaction with the catalyst.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid *(Nicotinic acid)*
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **long aliphatic chains connecting functional groups to the carboxyl group (four or more carbons)** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Longer chains provide flexibility, reducing steric hindrance and allowing optimal alignment for metal coordination.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid *(Shorter chain, low yield)*

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids containing ether linkages within the carbon chain** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether linkages can increase chain flexibility and disrupt the optimal conformation required for effective metal coordination.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **peptides or contain peptide bonds** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Peptide bonds reduce the availability of free amino and carboxyl groups for metal coordination, diminishing the modifier's effectiveness.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: In **Rule 2**, instead of manually identifying ortho and para positions through ring traversal, use explicit SMARTS patterns that directly match substituents at ortho or para positions relative to the carboxylic acid group. For example, you can define SMARTS patterns like `'c1ccc([NX3;H2,H1])cc1C(=O)O'` for amino groups or `'c1cc([OX2H])ccc1C(=O)O'` for hydroxyl groups at ortho/para positions. This will simplify the code and improve accuracy in detecting relevant functional groups.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: In **Rule 3**, the current chain pattern `'[CX4](-[CX2]-[CX2]-[CX2]-[CX2]-[CX2]-[CX3](=O)[OX2H1])'` may not capture all aliphatic carboxylic acids with long unbranched chains of six or more carbons. Consider generalizing the pattern to detect chains with six or more aliphatic carbons ending with a carboxylic acid. For example, use a recursive SMARTS pattern like `'[CX4][CX2]{$([CX2][CX2]),$([CX2][CX2][CX2]),$([CX2][CX2][CX2][CX2]),$([CX2][CX2][CX2][CX2][CX2])}[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'` to match chains of variable lengths.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: In **Rule 4**, the code checks for functional groups distant from the carboxyl group by considering path lengths greater than six bonds (`len(path)-1 > 6`). Since the rule specifies functional groups more than three carbons away, adjust the path length condition to match this. Because each carbon-to-carbon bond represents a single bond, you should consider `len(path)-1 >= 4` to represent functional groups more than three carbons away from the carboxyl carbon.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: In **Rule 5**, to accurately detect electron-donating groups incapable of metal coordination (like methyl groups) at ortho or para positions, use specific SMARTS patterns such as `'c1cc([CH3])ccc1C(=O)O'` for para-methylbenzoic acid or include both ortho and para positions. This direct approach ensures that only methyl groups at the desired positions are considered.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: In **Rule 6**, the code checks for nitro groups or aromatic carbonyls anywhere in the molecule, but the rule specifies that these electron-withdrawing groups should be capable of metal coordination and attached to the aromatic ring of the carboxylic acid. Modify the code to ensure these groups are at positions that allow coordination (e.g., ortho or para to the carboxyl group) by using SMARTS patterns like `'c1cc([N+](=O)[O-])ccc1C(=O)O'` for nitro groups.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: For **Rule 8**, the pattern for bulky substituents `'[CX4]([#6])([#6])([#6])[#6]'` matches any quaternary carbon, which might not accurately represent all bulky groups causing steric hindrance. Refine this pattern to target specific bulky groups known to cause steric hindrance, such as tert-butyl groups (`'C(C)(C)(C)'`) or long-chain substituents. Similarly, for ether chains, ensure that the pattern detects long, flexible ether chains by adjusting the pattern to `'[OX2][CX4][OX2][CX4]'` repeated multiple times.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: In **Rule 11**, to specifically detect aldehyde groups attached directly to an aromatic ring with a carboxylic acid, use SMARTS patterns like `'c1cc(C=O)ccc1C(=O)O'`. This ensures that the aldehyde group is directly connected to the ring and that both the aldehyde and carboxylic acid are on the same aromatic system, as specified in the rule.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: For **Rule 13**, adjust the chain pattern to detect any functional group connected to the carboxyl group via long aliphatic chains of four or more carbons. You can use a pattern like `'[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4,$([CX4][CX4])][*]'`, allowing for chains longer than four carbons by making the last `[CX4]` recursive.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: In **Rule 12**, verify that the pattern `'[n][C](=O)[OX2H1]'` accurately matches heteroaromatic carboxylic acids where the nitrogen atom in the ring is directly attached to the carboxyl group. If necessary, adjust the pattern to `'[nX2][c][C](=O)[OX2H1]'` to ensure that the nitrogen is part of the heteroaromatic system and directly connected to the carboxyl group.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Implement unit tests for each rule using known examples and counterexamples provided in the rules. By testing the code against these examples, you can verify the accuracy of each rule's implementation. This will help identify mismatches between the rules and their code representations.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: Consider potential tautomers, resonance structures, and protonation states. For instance, nitro groups may be represented differently in SMILES strings. Ensure that the SMARTS patterns and code can recognize these variations by including alternative patterns or using tautomer-aware matching.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: For complex rules involving spatial arrangements or specific distances (e.g., functional groups within certain numbers of atoms), consider using molecular fingerprints or descriptors that capture distance information, or use cheminformatics toolkits capable of 3D spatial searches if 3D structures are available.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids containing a free (unprotected) amino group within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The close proximity of the amino group to the carboxyl group enhances metal coordination through chelation, improving catalyst performance.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid *(L-Aspartic acid)*
    - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid *(L-Glutamic acid)*
    - 4-aminobenzoic acid
    - 5-aminopentanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Counterexamples*:
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid *(Amino group distant from carboxyl group)*
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with functional groups capable of metal coordination (e.g., amino, nitro, hydroxyl) at the ortho or para positions** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Functional groups positioned to coordinate with metal ions can enhance catalyst interaction and performance.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - 4-aminobenzoic acid
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid *(Methyl group lacks coordination ability)*
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid *(Aldehyde group may not effectively coordinate)*

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with long, unbranched carbon chains (six or more carbons) and no additional functional groups** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Long hydrocarbon chains can enhance hydrophobic interactions and minimize interference from other functional groups, facilitating better catalyst engagement.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - Octanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid *(Additional functional group far from carboxyl reduces yield)*
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids containing functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) distant from the carboxyl group (more than three carbons away)** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Functional groups far from the carboxyl group are less effective in coordinating with the metal center and may introduce steric hindrance or unwanted interactions.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 7-aminoheptanoic acid
    - 8-aminooctanoic acid
    - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups incapable of metal coordination (e.g., methyl group) at the ortho or para positions** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups can decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing its ability to coordinate with metal ions.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - 4-methylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with multiple electron-withdrawing groups capable of metal coordination (e.g., nitro, carbonyl groups)** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxylate, enhancing interaction with the metal catalyst.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - 4-nitrobenzoic acid
    - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids or contain multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites, promoting strong chelation with the metal center.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid *(Gluconic acid)*

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that contain **bulky substituents or long ether chains that can introduce steric hindrance** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Bulky groups can hinder effective coordination between the modifier and the metal center, reducing catalytic efficiency.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid *(Bulkiness from directly connected aromatic rings)*

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **fluorinated carboxylic acids or contain strongly electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Strongly electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups reduce the electron density of the carboxylate, diminishing its coordination ability with metal centers.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that **contain amide bonds involving the amino group or near the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide formation decreases the availability of free amino and carboxyl groups necessary for effective metal coordination.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid
    - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups attached to the ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde groups may engage in side reactions or form intramolecular interactions that interfere with metal coordination, reducing catalyst efficiency.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 4-formylbenzoic acid
    - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms in the ring directly attached to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The nitrogen heteroatom can participate in metal coordination, enhancing the interaction with the catalyst.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid *(Nicotinic acid)*
    - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **long aliphatic chains connecting functional groups to the carboxyl group (four or more carbons)** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Longer chains provide flexibility, reducing steric hindrance and allowing optimal alignment for metal coordination.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid
    - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid *(Shorter chain, low yield)*

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids containing ether linkages within the carbon chain** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether linkages can increase chain flexibility and disrupt the optimal conformation required for effective metal coordination.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid
    - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **peptides or contain peptide bonds** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Peptide bonds reduce the availability of free amino and carboxyl groups for metal coordination, diminishing the modifier's effectiveness.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: For **Rule 2**, the code should be modified to use a general SMARTS pattern that identifies any aromatic carboxylic acid with coordinating functional groups (e.g., amino `[NH2]`, nitro `[N+](=O)[O-]`, hydroxyl `[OH]`) at the ortho or para positions relative to the carboxyl group. Instead of matching specific compounds, you can use a pattern like `c1ccc(cc1)[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` and then check the positions of the substituents programmatically to determine if they are at ortho or para positions.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: For **Rule 3**, adjust the chain pattern to match aliphatic carboxylic acids with **six or more unbranched carbons**. Use a SMARTS pattern that allows for variable chain lengths, such as `'[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CX4][CX2]{$([CX2]),$([CX2][CX2]),$([CX2][CX2][CX2]),$([CX2][CX2][CX2][CX2]),$([CX2][CX2][CX2][CX2][CX2]),$([CX2][CX2][CX2][CX2][CX2][CX2])}[CX3]'`, which matches chains of 6 or more carbons.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For **Rule 5**, expand the methyl patterns to detect any **electron-donating groups incapable of metal coordination** (e.g., alkyl groups) at the ortho or para positions. A more general SMARTS pattern could be used, such as `c1ccc([CX4H3])cc1C(=O)[OX2H1]` for para-substituted and `c1c([CX4H3])cccc1C(=O)[OX2H1]` for ortho-substituted compounds.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: For **Rule 6**, create a general pattern that identifies **aromatic carboxylic acids with multiple electron-withdrawing groups** capable of metal coordination, regardless of their specific type. You might use a pattern that finds aromatic rings with two or more substituents like nitro or carbonyl groups, such as `[$([NX3](=O)[O-]),$([CX3](=O)[#6])]c1ccc([#6])cc1C(=O)[OX2H1]`.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: For **Rule 8**, broaden the definition of bulky substituents in your pattern. Instead of only matching tert-butyl groups, you can include patterns for other bulky groups, such as isopropyl (`[CX4H]([CX4H3])[CX4H3]`), phenyl (`[c]1[c][c][c][c][c]1`), or fused rings. Additionally, for ether chains, consider patterns that match any long-chain ethers, not just a specific length, like `'[CX4][OX2][CX4][OX2][CX4]'` repeated multiple times.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: For **Rule 9**, modify the pattern to detect any **fluorinated groups**, not just trifluoromethyl. Use a pattern like `'[CX4][F]'` to find any carbon atom bonded to fluorine, and check if these fluorines are part of electron-withdrawing groups affecting the carboxylate's coordination ability.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: For **Rule 11**, generalize the pattern to detect **aldehyde groups attached to the aromatic ring**, regardless of their position. A pattern like `'c[CX3H](=O)'` can identify an aldehyde group attached to any carbon in an aromatic ring. Combine this with the carboxylic acid pattern to ensure both functionalities are present.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: For **Rule 14**, refine the ether linkage pattern to specifically match **ether linkages within aliphatic chains leading to the carboxyl group**. Use recursive SMARTS or specify that the ether oxygen is connected via single bonds to aliphatic carbons only, such as `'[CX4][OX2][CX4][CX2][CX2][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'`.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: For **Rule 2** and other positional substitution rules, implement code to **programmatically determine the position** (ortho, meta, para) of substituents relative to the carboxyl group on the aromatic ring. Use the RDKit functionality to find the aromatic ring, identify the carboxylic acid attachment point, and then check for coordinating groups at the desired positions.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: For **Rule 3**, ensure that the chain is **unbranched and contains no additional functional groups**. After matching the long chain, check for side chains or heteroatoms bonded to the chain carbons (excluding the terminal carboxyl group) to confirm the absence of branching and additional groups.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify Rules into Quantifiable Descriptors**

  Revise the current rules to focus on quantifiable molecular descriptors that can be directly calculated from SMILES strings. For example, instead of stating "functional groups within three carbons of the carboxyl group," specify the exact number of atoms or bonds, which can be numerically quantified.

- **Advice 2**: **Utilize Computational Molecular Descriptors**

  Incorporate descriptors such as the number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, molecular weight, topological polar surface area (TPSA), and specific functional group counts. These can be readily computed from SMILES and facilitate the generation of a numeric feature matrix.

- **Advice 3**: **Implement Distance Metrics Between Functional Groups**

  Define rules based on calculated distances between functional groups (e.g., the number of bonds between an amino group and a carboxyl group). Utilize cheminformatics tools to compute these distances, making the rules more precise and quantifiable.

- **Advice 4**: **Adopt Molecular Fingerprints and Structural Keys**

  Use molecular fingerprints (like MACCS keys or Morgan fingerprints) to represent the presence or absence of specific substructures numerically. Base the rules on these fingerprints to enable easy conversion into a numeric feature matrix.

- **Advice 5**: **Incorporate Physicochemical Properties**

  Include properties such as LogP (lipophilicity), pKa (acid dissociation constant), and electronic parameters (e.g., HOMO-LUMO gap). These properties can be calculated from SMILES and may correlate with the reaction yield.

- **Advice 6**: **Use Standardized Chemical Descriptors and SMARTS Patterns**

  Rewrite the rules using standardized descriptors or SMARTS (SMILES Arbitrary Target Specification) patterns to identify functional groups or substructures. This allows for automated parsing of SMILES strings and extraction of numerical data.

- **Advice 7**: **Quantify Electronic Effects Numerically**

  Assign numerical values to electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups based on Hammett sigma constants or other relevant scales. This provides a quantitative measure of electronic effects influencing the yield.

- **Advice 8**: **Measure Steric Hindrance Through Calculated Steric Parameters**

  Utilize parameters like Taft steric parameters or calculated van der Waals volumes to quantify steric effects. Incorporate these values into the rules to assess the impact of steric hindrance on yield.

- **Advice 9**: **Consolidate and Generalize Similar Rules**

  Combine rules with overlapping concepts to reduce complexity. For example, merge rules about distant functional groups causing low yield into a single rule with a specified numerical distance threshold.

- **Advice 10**: **Create a Feature Matrix Framework**

  Develop a structured framework where each modifier is associated with a vector of numerical features extracted from the SMILES. Align the rules to utilize these features, facilitating statistical analysis and machine learning applications.

- **Advice 11**: **Validate New Rules with Statistical Modeling**

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Enhance Coverage for Underrepresented Rules**
  
  Several rules lack sufficient supporting data points, which affects their robustness. Specifically, Rules 4, 7, 8, 9, 12, and 13 have limited examples (often only one supporting example). To improve these rules:
  
  - **Action**: Collect additional data points by identifying more modifiers that fit these rules and determine their yields. This will strengthen the rules' validity and ensure they meet the coverage criterion.
  
  - **Example**: For Rule 7 (polyhydroxy carboxylic acids predicting high yield), find additional sugar acids or polyhydroxy compounds and evaluate their performance in the reaction.

- **Advice 2**: **Resolve Conflicting or Overlapping Rules**

  Some rules may conflict with each other or cause confusion due to overlapping criteria. For instance, Rule 13 suggests that long aliphatic chains connecting functional groups to the carboxyl group predict high yield, which seems to contradict Rule 4 (predicting high yield for long unbranched chains with no additional functional groups) and Rule 5 (predicting low yield when functional groups are distant from the carboxyl group).

  - **Action**: Review and redefine these rules to eliminate contradictions. Consider combining rules with similar themes or clearly specifying the conditions under which each rule applies.

  - **Example**: Merge Rules 4, 5, and 13 into a unified rule that clarifies the effect of chain length and the position of functional groups on yield.

- **Advice 3**: **Increase Specificity in Structural Criteria**

  Some rules are too broad or vague, which can lead to misclassification. Providing more specific structural descriptions will enhance clarity.

  - **Action**: Refine the language of the rules to include precise structural features, such as exact positions of substituents, ring sizes, or the presence of particular functional groups.

  - **Example**: In Rule 15, instead of stating "modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with extended conjugation," specify the types of conjugated systems (e.g., "aromatic carboxylic acids with fused benzene rings or indole structures").

- **Advice 4**: **Clarify Rationales with Detailed Mechanisms**

  Some rationales lack depth or are based on assumptions without thorough explanation. Providing detailed mechanistic insights will strengthen the rules.

  - **Action**: Expand the rationales to include explanations of how the structural features influence the reaction mechanism and yield.

  - **Example**: For Rule 6, explain how electron-withdrawing groups at specific positions stabilize intermediates, enhancing coordination with the metal center.

- **Advice 5**: **Eliminate Redundant or Weak Rules**

  Rules that are not well-supported by data or significantly overlap with other rules may reduce the overall quality of the rule set.

  - **Action**: Identify rules with minimal support or redundancy and consider removing or consolidating them.

  - **Example**: If Rule 12 (short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids predicting low yield) overlaps with other rules predicting low yield due to lack of coordinating groups, consolidate them for simplicity.

- **Advice 6**: **Incorporate Exceptions and Counterexamples**

  Recognizing exceptions improves the accuracy of the rules.

  - **Action**: Include known exceptions and provide explanations for these cases within the rules or as separate notes.

  - **Example**: If a modifier with a bulky group shows high yield due to a specific interaction, note this exception and explain the underlying reason.

- **Advice 7**: **Align Rules with Chemical Principles and Reaction Mechanisms**

  Ensure that the rules are consistent with established chemical knowledge.

  - **Action**: Cross-verify each rule with relevant literature and reaction mechanisms to confirm their validity.

  - **Example**: Consult recent studies on metal coordination chemistry to validate the role of specific functional groups described in the rules.

- **Advice 8**: **Use Consistent Terminology and Definitions**

  Inconsistent terms can cause confusion.

  - **Action**: Standardize the terminology used across all rules, defining any technical terms or abbreviations.

  - **Example**: Clearly define what constitutes "bulky substituents" or "electron-withdrawing groups" at the beginning of the rules.

- **Advice 9**: **Visual Aids for Complex Structures**

  Complex rules involving intricate structures may benefit from visual representation.

  - **Action**: Include chemical structures or SMILES annotations for examples and counterexamples to aid understanding.

  - **Example**: Provide diagrams for modifiers mentioned in Rule 3 to illustrate how heteroatoms participate in coordination.

- **Advice 10**: **Prioritize Rules Based on Impact**

  Focus on rules that significantly influence the reaction outcome.

  - **Action**: Rank the rules according to their predictive power and data support, emphasizing those with the most substantial impact on yield.

  - **Example**: Place rules with broad applicability and strong data support, like Rule 1, at the forefront of the rule set.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: Simplify the rules to focus on structural features that can be directly extracted and quantified from SMILES representations. For example, instead of specifying "amino groups within three carbons of the carboxyl group," define rules based on the **number of atoms between functional groups**, which can be calculated numerically.

- **Advice 2**: Convert qualitative descriptors into quantitative features. Replace terms like "electron-withdrawing groups at ortho or para positions" with numerical counts or indicator variables (e.g., **count of electron-withdrawing substituents on the aromatic ring**, or **binary indicators for specific positions**).

- **Advice 3**: Utilize cheminformatics tools (e.g., RDKit) to generate **molecular descriptors** and **structural fingerprints** from SMILES strings. These descriptors can include features like **molecular weight**, **topological polar surface area**, **hydrogen bond donors/acceptors**, and **counts of specific functional groups**, providing a numerical feature matrix for modeling.

- **Advice 4**: Develop rules that are based on **quantifiable molecular properties**. For example:
  - **Rule Modification**: Modifiers with a **hydrocarbon chain length of six or more carbons** without branching predict a high yield.
  - **Rule Modification**: Modifiers with a **total of two or more nitrogen or oxygen atoms capable of coordination** predict a high yield.

- **Advice 5**: Create a standardized **functional group coding system** to numerically represent the presence and position of key functional groups. For example:
  - Assign **binary variables** for the presence (1) or absence (0) of functional groups like amino, hydroxyl, carboxyl, nitro, etc.
  - Calculate **distance metrics** between functional groups (e.g., number of bonds between amino and carboxyl groups).

- **Advice 6**: Implement **substructure searches** using SMILES patterns to detect specific motifs. Define substructures for functional groups or ring systems that correlate with high or low yield, enabling automated feature extraction.

- **Advice 7**: Quantify electronic effects using parameters like **Hammett sigma constants** or **Taft parameters**. Assign numerical values to substituents based on their electron-withdrawing or -donating properties, which can be summed or averaged for the molecule.

- **Advice 8**: Replace ambiguous terms like "bulky substituents" with quantifiable measures such as **steric hindrance parameters** (e.g., molar refractivity, Verloop steric parameters) or **molecular volume**.

- **Advice 9**: Incorporate **3D molecular descriptors** if spatial arrangement is important. Calculate features like **connected surface area**, **molecular flexibility**, or **coordination geometry**, which may influence metal-ligand interactions.

- **Advice 10**: Group modifiers into **classes or clusters** based on structural similarity using methods like **hierarchical clustering** or **principal component analysis** on molecular descriptors. Assign cluster labels as numerical features.

- **Advice 11**: Use **machine learning feature selection** techniques to identify the most predictive features from a large set of descriptors. This data-driven approach can reveal important properties that correlate with yield.

- **Advice 12**: Redefine rules to include **numerical thresholds**. For example:
  - Modifiers with a **logP value greater than X** predict a high yield.
  - Modifiers with **aromatic ring count equal to Y** predict a low yield.

- **Advice 13**: Incorporate **counts of specific atom types** (e.g., total number of nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur atoms) as features, providing a straightforward numerical representation.

- **Advice 14**: Develop a set of **computationally accessible rules** that can be programmatically applied to SMILES strings, ensuring consistency and reproducibility in feature generation.

- **Advice 15**: Prioritize rules that align with the **mechanistic understanding** of the reaction but are also compatible with computational methods. Focus on features that influence metal coordination and radical stability, which can often be quantified.

  - **Complexity**: Combines functional group presence and spatial considerations.
  - **Coverage**: Good coverage with multiple low yield examples [4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid, 4-oxoheptanedioic acid].

- **Comment 12**:
  - **Clarity**: Rule 12 clearly identifies the structural criteria of hydroxylated aromatic rings with short linkers.
  - **Property Insight**: Plausible rationale; short linkers may limit effective interaction with the catalyst.
  - **Complexity**: Considers functional group type, ring substitution, and linker length.
  - **Coverage**: Limited coverage with only one low yield example [3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid] and a high yield counterexample, suggesting the need for more data.

- **Comment 13**:
  - **Clarity**: Rule 13 is clear, specifying aliphatic carboxylic acids with sulfur-containing groups near the carboxyl.
  - **Property Insight**: Logical rationale; sulfur groups can enhance coordination.
  - **Complexity**: Focuses on functional group type and proximity.
  - **Coverage**: Limited coverage with one high yield example [3-sulfanylpropanoic acid] and a low yield counterexample [4-sulfanylbenzoic acid], indicating inconsistency.

- **Comment 14**:
  - **Clarity**: Rule 14 clearly defines modifiers with directly connected multiple aromatic rings.
  - **Property Insight**: Reasonable rationale; steric hindrance from fused rings may impede coordination.
  - **Complexity**: Addresses overall molecular architecture and its impact.
  - **Coverage**: Insufficient coverage with only one low yield example [4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid].

- **Comment 15**:
  - **Clarity**: Rule 15 is clear, focusing on aromatic carboxylic acids with extended conjugation or fused rings capable of coordination.
  - **Property Insight**: Valid rationale; extended conjugation may enhance electron delocalization and coordination ability.
  - **Complexity**: Considers complex structural features affecting electronic properties.
  - **Coverage**: Supported by high yield examples [(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid, 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid], providing reasonable coverage.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Enhance Coverage for Rule 4**  
  Rule 4 lacks sufficient coverage, with only one high-yield example (*octanoic acid*). To strengthen this rule, incorporate additional high-yield data points of long, unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups. Examples to consider adding include *nonanoic acid* and *decanoic acid* if data is available. This will meet the coverage criterion and reinforce the validity of the rule.

- **Advice 2**: **Expand Data for Rule 7**  
  Rule 7 has limited coverage with only two high-yield examples. Seek out or test additional polyhydroxy carboxylic acids or modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group to bolster the rule. Compounds such as *ascorbic acid* or *citric acid* derivatives may provide additional high-yield examples.

- **Advice 3**: **Improve Coverage and Clarity for Rule 8**  
  Rule 8 is supported by only one low-yield example. To enhance coverage, include more fluorinated carboxylic acids known to result in low yields. If additional data is scarce, consider merging Rule 8 with Rule 10, as both address the impact of electron-withdrawing groups on yield, and refine the combined rule for clarity.

- **Advice 4**: **Refine Rule 9 and Increase Data Points**  
  Rule 9 currently has limited coverage and focuses on amide bonds involving the amino group or near the carboxyl group. Expand the dataset by including more modifiers containing amide bonds that result in low yield. Alternatively, consider broadening the rule to encompass other functional group transformations that reduce the availability of coordination sites, such as esterifications.

- **Advice 5**: **Clarify and Strengthen Rule 12**  
  Rule 12 lacks sufficient coverage and may benefit from refinement. Review the dataset for additional low-yield examples of aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups on the ring and short linkers. If such examples are limited, adjust the rule to focus on steric hindrance or electronic factors that can be supported by existing data.

- **Advice 6**: **Reassess Rule 13 for Consistency**  
  Rule 13 shows inconsistency between the high-yield example (*3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*) and the low-yield counterexample (*4-sulfanylbenzoic acid*). Investigate whether the aromatic nature of the counterexample or the position of the sulfur atom contributes to the low yield. Modify the rule to specify that aliphatic carboxylic acids with sulfur-containing groups in specific positions predict high yield, while aromatic variants may not.

- **Advice 7**: **Increase Data and Precision for Rule 14**  
  Rule 14 is supported by a single low-yield example. To improve this rule, gather more low-yield data points involving modifiers with directly connected aromatic rings. Specify structural reasons for low yield, such as increased steric hindrance or rigidity, and ensure these are reflected in the examples provided.

- **Advice 8**: **Address Inconsistencies in Rule 3**  
  In Rule 3, the low-yield counterexample (*4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*) may have multiple factors contributing to low yield beyond steric hindrance. Re-express the rule to account for such complexities or provide additional counterexamples where steric hindrance is the primary cause of low yield.

- **Advice 9**: **Ensure Minimum Data Points for Coverage**  
  Review all rules to confirm that each meets the coverage criterion of at least two supporting data points for both high and low yield. For rules that do not meet this criterion, either gather additional data or consider integrating them with other rules to form a more comprehensive guideline.

- **Advice 10**: **Consolidate Similar Rules for Clarity**  
  Identify rules with overlapping concepts, such as Rules 8 and 10, which both deal with electron-withdrawing or electron-donating effects on coordination ability. Merge these rules to simplify the rule set, reduce redundancy, and enhance clarity for users applying the rules.

- **Advice 11**: **Leverage Additional Data to Form New Rules**  
  Analyze the dataset for patterns not currently captured by existing rules. For example, if certain modifiers with specific steric or electronic properties consistently result in high or low yields, formulate new rules to capture these observations, ensuring they meet the criteria of clarity, property insight, complexity, and coverage.

- **Advice 12**: **Incorporate Project Manager's Input Promptly**  
  Given that optimizing current rules is a priority as per the Project Manager's advice, focus on refining existing rules before introducing new ones. Addressing the coverage and clarity issues in current rules will improve the overall reliability and applicability of the rule set.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids containing a free (unprotected) amino group within two carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: A proximal amino group enhances chelation with metal centers, improving catalyst performance.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (L-Aspartic acid)
    - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (L-Glutamic acid)
    - *5-aminopentanoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexamples*:
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid* (Amino group too distant)
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups capable of metal coordination (e.g., nitro, amino) at the para position** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase acidity and coordination ability, enhancing interaction with metal centers.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *4-nitrobenzoic acid*
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (Methyl group lacks coordination ability)

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids where the heteroatom is capable of coordinating with the metal center** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Heteroatoms like nitrogen provide additional coordination sites, enhancing metal-ligand interactions.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
    - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Steric hindrance due to directly connected rings)

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with long, unbranched carbon chains (six or more carbons) and no additional functional groups** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Long hydrocarbon chains enhance hydrophobic interactions and minimize interference from other groups, facilitating better catalyst engagement.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *Octanoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexamples*:
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid* (Additional functional group reduces yield)
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) located more than three carbons away from the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Distant functional groups are less effective in coordinating with the metal center and may introduce steric hindrance.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing **ether linkages or flexible chains within the carbon backbone** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether linkages increase flexibility and may hinder effective coordination between the modifier and metal center.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids or contain multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites, promoting strong chelation with the metal center.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
    - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **fluorinated carboxylic acids or contain strongly electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Strongly electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups reduce electron density, diminishing coordination ability with metal centers.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that **contain amide bonds involving the carboxyl group or amino group near the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide formation decreases availability of free amino and carboxyl groups necessary for effective metal coordination.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid*
    - *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups incapable of metal coordination (e.g., methyl group) at the ortho or para positions** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups decrease acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing coordination ability with metal ions.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid*

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids containing aldehyde or ketone groups near the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde and ketone groups may engage in side reactions or interfere with metal coordination, reducing catalyst efficiency.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*
    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups on the aromatic ring and a short linker (three carbons or fewer) between the carboxyl group and the ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Short linkers may cause steric hindrance or insufficient interaction with the catalyst.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*
  - *High Yield Counterexample*:
    - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid* (Longer linker allows better interaction)

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids containing sulfur-containing groups near the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Sulfur-containing groups can serve as strong ligands, enhancing coordination with metal centers.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* (Aromatic ring may alter coordination dynamics)

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that **contain multiple aromatic rings connected directly (biaryls or fused systems)** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Directly connected rings can introduce steric hindrance and reduce flexibility, hindering effective coordination.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid*

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with extended conjugation or fused ring systems capable of metal coordination** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Extended conjugation enhances electron delocalization, increasing coordination ability with metal ions.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (L-Tryptophan)
    - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Adjust Atom Indexing in Pattern Matching Functions**
  
  In the `check_amino_proximity` and similar functions, the code uses `c[0]` and `a[0]` directly, which may not correspond to the correct atoms (e.g., the carbonyl carbon or amino nitrogen). Since `GetSubstructMatches` returns tuples of atom indices for the entire matched pattern, you should identify and use the specific atom indices corresponding to the functional groups of interest within these tuples. For example, for the carboxylic acid pattern `[CX3](=O)[OX1H1]`, the carbon atom might be at index `c[0]`, and for the primary amine `[NX3H2]`, the nitrogen atom is at `a[0]`. Ensure that these indices correctly refer to the atoms needed for distance calculations.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Review and Correct SMARTS Patterns**

  Some SMARTS patterns may not accurately reflect the structural features described in the natural language rules. For example:
  
  - For **Rule 1**, the carboxylic acid pattern `[CX3](=O)[OX1H1]` may not match all carboxylic acids if the carboxylate form is present. Consider using `[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]` to include both protonated and deprotonated forms.
  
  - For the primary amine, `[NX3H2]` may not match amines connected to more complex structures. You might need a broader pattern like `[NX3;H2]`.
  
  - For **Rule 2**, the pattern `[c]1ccc([NX3H2,NX3+0,NX3](=O)=O)cc1` is specific to amino or nitro groups in the para position but may miss other electron-withdrawing groups capable of metal coordination. Consider generalizing the pattern or including additional patterns for groups like nitro (`[N+](=O)[O-]`) or cyano (`[C]#N`) groups.
  
  - For **Rule 3**, the heteroaromatic pattern `[n]1cccc1` matches a pyridine ring but may not include other heteroaromatic systems. Expand the pattern to include other heteroatoms and ring sizes, such as `[a][a][a][a][a]` where `a` is any aromatic atom.
  
  Carefully review each SMARTS pattern to ensure it captures all intended structures.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Fix Functional Scope and Function Calls**

  The use of `locals()[func_name]` assumes that the additional check functions are in the local scope, which may not be the case in all environments. To ensure that these functions are accessible, define them at the module level (top of the script) or within a class if object-oriented programming is used. Alternatively, construct a dictionary mapping function names to function objects, such as:
  
  ```python
  function_map = {
      'check_amino_proximity': check_amino_proximity,
      'check_long_chain': check_long_chain,
      # Add other functions here
  }
  ```
  
  Then, retrieve the function using `func = function_map[func_name]`.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Correct Exclude Patterns**

  In **Rule 4**, the exclude pattern `'[#6][OX2][#6]'` (ether linkage) and `[!#6;!#1]` (any atom that is not carbon or hydrogen) may not work as intended. The pattern `[!#6;!#1]` matches non-carbon, non-hydrogen atoms, which could unintentionally exclude molecules containing heteroatoms elsewhere. Consider refining the exclude patterns to specifically match the undesired features. For example, to exclude molecules with any heteroatoms in the chain, use:
  
  ```python
  exclude_patterns = ['[#6;!R][OX2][#6;!R]', '[#6;!R][!#6;!#1;!R]']
  ```
  
  This targets ether linkages and non-carbon/hydrogen atoms in aliphatic (non-ring) chains.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Enhance Debugging with Detailed Logging**

  Include print statements or logging to output intermediate results, such as matched substructures and atom indices. For instance, within the rule loop, add:
  
  ```python
  if match:
      print(f"Rule {rule['number']} matched for SMILES {smi}")
  else:
      print(f"Rule {rule['number']} did not match for SMILES {smi}")
  ```
  
  This helps identify where and why matches are failing, allowing for targeted troubleshooting.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Refine Additional Check Functions**

  Ensure that additional check functions accurately implement the logic described in the rules. For example, in `check_long_chain`, the SMARTS pattern `'[C]' + '[C]'*(min_length-1)` may not match chains longer than `min_length`. Instead, use a recursive SMARTS pattern like `'C' + 'C' * (min_length - 1)` and account for longer chains with the `+` quantifier:
  
  ```python
  chain_pattern = f'CC{{{min_length},}}'
  chain = Chem.MolFromSmarts(chain_pattern)
  return mol.HasSubstructMatch(chain)
  ```
  
  This ensures that any chain of at least `min_length` carbons is matched.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Validate Patterns with Known Examples**

  Test the SMARTS patterns and functions against the provided high-yield and low-yield examples for each rule to verify that they produce the expected results. For instance, check if L-Aspartic acid (`C([C@@H](C(=O)O)N)C(=O)O`) matches **Rule 1** using the current code. If it doesn't, adjust the patterns or functions accordingly.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Utilize RDKit's Molecular Features**

  Leverage RDKit's built-in features for identifying common functional groups and substructures. For example, use `rdkit.Chem.Fragments` or predefined SMARTS patterns from RDKit's `FunctionalGroups.txt` to improve pattern matching accuracy.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Handle Ionization States and Tautomers**

  The SMARTS patterns may not account for different ionization states (e.g., carboxylate anion `[CX3](=O)[O-]`). Modify patterns to include common ionic forms:
  
  ```python
  carboxylic_acid = '[CX3](=O)[OX1H1,OX1-,OX2H0-]'
  ```
  
  This accounts for protonated and deprotonated carboxyl groups.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Verify Atom Mapping in Substructure Matches**

  When retrieving atom indices from `GetSubstructMatches`, ensure that you're referencing the correct atoms within the matched substructure. If necessary, annotate the SMARTS patterns with atom maps to clarify atom positions. For example:
  
  ```python
  carboxylic_acid = '[C:1](=O)[O:2][H]'
  ```
  
  Then, in the code, you can access specific atoms using `match[group_index]`.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rules Based on Metrics**

The performance of the current set of rules can be assessed by examining the provided metrics and comparing them with the reference data. Focusing on confidence and lift, the key indicators of rule quality, we can analyze how well the current rules predict high yields in the catalytic problem.

---

**Comparison with Reference Metrics**

1. **Train Support**:
   - **Previous Reference**: 0.1667 to 0.1845
   - **Current**: 0.0152
   - **Observation**: The current train support is significantly lower than the reference values. This indicates that the current rules apply to a much smaller portion of the training data compared to previous iterations.

2. **Train Confidence**:
   - **Previous Reference**: 53.96% to 63.52%
   - **Current**: 56.67%
   - **Observation**: The current train confidence is within the previous range but on the lower end. Earlier iterations during this program had higher confidence values (up to 75.29%), suggesting a decline in the reliability of the current rules in predicting high yields when their conditions are met.

3. **Train Lift**:
   - **Previous Reference**: 1.0559 to 1.2048
   - **Current**: 1.1431
   - **Observation**: The current lift is within the reference range but lower than the peak values observed in earlier iterations (up to 1.5038). A higher lift indicates a stronger association between the rule's condition and the high yield prediction. The decrease suggests that the current rules are less effective at distinguishing high-yield outcomes from the overall dataset.

4. **Train Leverage**:
   - **Previous Reference**: -0.0041 to 0.0289
   - **Current**: 0.00599
   - **Observation**: The current leverage is positive but lower than some previous values, indicating a modest improvement over random chance but less than previous iterations.

---

**Interpretation of Current Metrics**

- **Decreased Support**: The substantial drop in train support implies that the rules are becoming too specific, covering fewer instances in the dataset. This over-specialization can limit the practical applicability of the rules.

- **Confidence Levels**: While still within the historical range, the confidence has decreased from earlier peaks. This suggests that when the current rules' conditions are met, they are less likely to predict high yields correctly compared to previous rules.

- **Lift Value**: The reduction in lift indicates a weaker association between the rule conditions and the prediction of high yield. The lift being closer to 1 suggests that the rules are not providing significant predictive power beyond the baseline probability.

- **Potential Local Minimum**: The declining trend in both confidence and lift, along with the reduced support, may indicate that the optimization process has reached a local minimum. Continuing iterations without changes may not lead to substantial improvements.

---

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

1. **Reassess Rule Specificity**:
   - **Issue**: Overly specific rules may capture anomalies instead of general trends, leading to low support.
   - **Action**: Generalize rules where appropriate to increase coverage without significantly compromising confidence. For example, broaden constraints that are too restrictive or merge similar rules.

2. **Focus on High-Performing Rules**:
   - **Issue**: Some rules may contribute more significantly to predictive performance than others.
   - **Action**: Identify rules from earlier iterations with higher confidence and lift (e.g., those with confidence above 70% and lift above 1.4). Analyze why their performance was better and consider reintegrating or adjusting them.

3. **Eliminate Redundant or Contradictory Rules**:
   - **Issue**: Conflicting or overlapping rules can dilute the overall effectiveness and introduce noise.
   - **Action**: Review the current rules for redundancy and inconsistencies. Remove or consolidate rules that do not add unique value or that contradict higher-performing rules.

4. **Increase Support Through Generalization**:
   - **Issue**: Low support limits the impact of the rules.
   - **Action**: Identify commonalities among high-yield examples that are not currently captured. Adjust rules to include these broader patterns, thereby increasing support.

5. **Balance Specificity and Generality**:
   - **Issue**: There's a trade-off between covering more data (increasing support) and maintaining high accuracy (confidence).
   - **Action**: Fine-tune rules to achieve an optimal balance. Avoid overfitting by not making rules too narrow, and prevent underfitting by ensuring they are not too broad.

6. **Incorporate Additional Data or Features**:
   - **Issue**: Current rules may be missing key predictive features.
   - **Action**: Analyze the dataset for additional variables or descriptors that could enhance the rules' predictive power. For example, consider steric factors, electronic properties, or experimental conditions.

7. **Domain Expertise Consultation**:
   - **Issue**: Quantitative metrics may not capture all relevant chemical intuition.
   - **Action**: Collaborate with domain experts to interpret the results and refine rules based on chemical knowledge, ensuring that the rules make sense scientifically.

8. **Cross-Validation and Testing**:
   - **Issue**: The absence of test metrics in the current iteration prevents assessment of generalizability.
   - **Action**: Evaluate the rules using a test dataset to ensure they perform well on unseen data, thereby avoiding overfitting to the training set.

9. **Iterative Refinement with Feedback Loops**:
   - **Issue**: Continuous cycles without evaluation checkpoints may lead to diminishing returns.
   - **Action**: Implement regular assessment intervals where rules are evaluated, and feedback is used to guide subsequent iterations.

---

**Conclusion**

The current rules exhibit decreased performance compared to previous iterations, as evidenced by lower support, confidence, and lift. This decline suggests that the rules may have become too specialized or may not effectively capture the key predictors of high yields.

To enhance the performance of the rules:

- **Broaden Rule Applicability**: Modify overly specific rules to cover a wider range of data without significantly sacrificing accuracy.
- **Prioritize High-Impact Rules**: Reintegrate and focus on rules that previously demonstrated strong predictive capabilities.
- **Streamline Rule Set**: Remove less effective or redundant rules to improve clarity and efficiency.
- **Leverage Domain Knowledge**: Use chemical insights to guide the refinement process, ensuring that the rules align with known catalytic behaviors.
- **Validate with Test Data**: Assess the rules on a separate dataset to confirm their generalizability and adjust accordingly.

By incorporating these recommendations, the predictive performance of the rules is expected to improve, moving beyond the current local minimum and contributing more effectively to the catalytic research program.

ML Commenter Message:
**Evaluation of Current Performance:**

The latest validation accuracy achieved is **65.71%**, which is lower than the previous validation accuracies that were consistently around **76%**. This decrease in performance suggests that the current set of rules may not be as effective as those in previous iterations. Throughout the iterations, the validation accuracies have fluctuated, ranging from **42.86%** to **77.14%**, indicating that while modifications to the rules are impacting performance, they have not led to a consistent improvement or stabilization beyond the initial baseline. This pattern suggests that the rules may not have fully captured the underlying patterns necessary for accurate predictions.

**Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting:**

The reduction in validation accuracy compared to previous results could indicate **underfitting**, where the current rules are too simplistic or general to capture the complexity of the data. Alternatively, it might suggest **overfitting**, particularly if certain rules are too narrowly defined, causing the model to perform well on specific training instances but poorly on unseen data. The lack of a significant improvement over multiple iterations implies that the model may be oscillating between overfitting and underfitting without finding an optimal balance.

**SHAP Analysis and Discrepancies:**

Analyzing the SHAP values provides insights into how individual rules contribute to the model's predictions, particularly in cases where there is a discrepancy between predicted and experimental values.

- **Overprediction (Predicted High Loading, Experimental Low Loading):**

  - **Molecule C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O**:
    - *Predicted Loading*: High
    - *Experimental Value*: Low
    - *Contributing Rules*:
      - **Rule 8**: SHAP value of **0.00999537**
      - **Rule 9**: SHAP value of **0.07333796**
    - *Analysis*: Both Rule 8 and Rule 9 are contributing positively to a high loading prediction, potentially overestimating the impact of certain molecular features.

  - **Molecule C(CCCC(=O)O)CCCN**:
    - Similar SHAP contributions from Rule 8 and Rule 9 leading to overprediction.

- **Underprediction (Predicted Low Loading, Experimental High Loading):**

  - **Molecule C([C@H](C(=O)O)N)C(=O)O**:
    - *Predicted Loading*: Low
    - *Experimental Value*: High
    - *Contributing Rules*:
      - **Rule 8**: SHAP value of **0.03121756**
      - **Rule 9**: SHAP value of **0.05211577**
    - *Analysis*: Despite positive contributions from Rule 8 and Rule 9, the overall prediction is low, indicating that other rules may be negatively influencing the prediction or the positive contributions are insufficient.

- **Consistent Misclassifications**:
  - Rules with high positive SHAP values in overpredicted cases indicate that these rules may be overemphasizing certain features, leading to incorrect high loading predictions.
  - Rules with high negative SHAP values in underpredicted cases suggest that modifiers with certain features are incorrectly being assigned low loading due to the rules undervaluing those features.

**Interpretation:**

The SHAP analysis highlights that **Rule 8** and **Rule 9** frequently contribute significant positive SHAP values in cases of overprediction. This suggests that these rules may be attributing too much importance to the presence of certain features, such as fluorinated groups or amide bonds, leading to an overestimation of the modifier's effectiveness. In underpredicted cases, the positive contributions from these rules are not sufficient to overcome negative contributions from other rules, which may be unnecessarily penalizing certain beneficial features.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

1. **Refine Rule 8 (Fluorinated Carboxylic Acids Predict Low Yield):**

   - **Issue Identified**: Rule 8 is contributing positively to high loading predictions in cases where the experimental value is low, indicating possible misclassification.
   - **Action**:
     - Re-evaluate the scope of Rule 8 to ensure it accurately reflects the impact of fluorinated groups.
     - Consider specifying the position of fluorination and its proximity to the carboxyl group.
     - Examine whether exceptions exist where fluorinated groups may not diminish coordination ability as previously thought.

2. **Adjust Rule 9 (Amide Bonds Predict Low Yield):**

   - **Issue Identified**: Rule 9 is also contributing to overpredictions, suggesting it may not be effectively capturing the influence of amide bonds on metal coordination.
   - **Action**:
     - Refine the rule to distinguish between different types of amide bonds, such as primary versus secondary amides.
     - Assess the context in which amide bonds reduce availability of coordination sites and update the rule accordingly.

3. **Re-express Rule 5 (Distant Functional Groups Predict Low Yield):**

   - **Issue Identified**: Rule 5 has high positive SHAP values in overpredicted cases, implying that it may not be accurately accounting for the impact of functional group positioning.
   - **Action**:
     - Review and possibly tighten the distance criteria for functional groups relative to the carboxyl group.
     - Incorporate considerations for the type of functional group and its electronic or steric effects.

4. **Enhance Rules for Underpredicted High Loadings:**

   - **Issue Identified**: Some molecules with high experimental loading are being underpredicted, indicating that beneficial features are not sufficiently recognized.
   - **Action**:
     - Identify which rules are contributing negatively in these cases and assess whether they are too punitive.
     - Consider adding new rules or modifying existing ones to capture additional coordination sites or beneficial electronic properties.

5. **Balance Rule Complexity to Address Overfitting/Underfitting:**

   - **Issue Identified**: The fluctuation in accuracy suggests that some rules may be overfitting to specific data points, while others are too general.
   - **Action**:
     - Simplify overly complex rules that may only apply to a narrow set of molecules.
     - Ensure each rule has a strong chemical rationale and applies broadly to relevant cases.
     - Avoid overreliance on a single feature or rule to make predictions.

6. **Incorporate Additional Molecular Features:**

   - **Action**:
     - Introduce new descriptors that capture electronic properties, such as **Hammett sigma constants**, to better account for substituent effects.
     - Consider steric parameters like **Taft steric constants** to evaluate the impact of bulky groups.
     - Use molecular modeling to assess the spatial orientation and potential steric hindrances.

7. **Iterative Refinement Using SHAP Insights:**

   - **Action**:
     - Continuously monitor the SHAP values for each rule and molecule to identify patterns of misprediction.
     - Use this information to iteratively refine rules, ensuring that changes are validated against both training and validation sets.
     - Implement cross-validation to test the generalizability of the refined rules.

8. **Validate Against an Independent Test Set:**

   - **Action**:
     - Evaluate the performance of the updated rules on an independent dataset not used during rule development.
     - This will help assess the predictive power and prevent overfitting to the current data.

**Conclusion:**

The current set of rules provides a foundation for predicting the loading of modifiers on catalysts, but the performance indicates that refinements are necessary. By focusing on the rules that contribute most to incorrect predictions, particularly **Rules 5, 8, and 9**, we can enhance the model's accuracy. It's crucial that these refinements are grounded in chemical reasoning, ensuring that the rules not only fit the data but also make sense from a mechanistic standpoint. Incorporating additional molecular descriptors and validating the updated rules across different datasets will further improve the robustness and generalizability of the predictions.

---

**Note to the Team:**

In implementing these recommendations, it's essential to maintain a balance between chemical intuition and data-driven insights. While SHAP analysis offers valuable information on the influence of each rule, adjustments should be made considering both statistical significance and chemical plausibility. Continuous collaboration between computational analysis and experimental validation will be key to developing an effective predictive model.

**Summary of Discussions and Recommendations for Optimizing Current Rules**

**Summary:**

Recent analyses of the current set of rules for predicting the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction have revealed several issues affecting their predictive performance:

1. **Decline in Performance Metrics:**
   - **Train Support:** Significantly decreased compared to previous iterations, indicating that the rules apply to a smaller portion of the dataset and may be too specific.
   - **Train Confidence and Lift:** Lower than previous values, suggesting weaker associations between the rules and high yield outcomes.
   - **Validation Accuracy:** Decreased to **65.71%** from previous accuracies around **76%**, pointing to potential overfitting or underfitting.

2. **SHAP Analysis Insights:**
   - **Overprediction Issues:** Rules such as **Rule 8** (fluorinated carboxylic acids) and **Rule 9** (amide bonds) are contributing positively to high yield predictions even when experimental values are low, indicating that these rules may not be accurately capturing their intended effects.
   - **Underprediction Cases:** Some high-yielding modifiers are being predicted as low yield, suggesting that beneficial features are not sufficiently recognized by the current rules.

3. **Rule Specificity and Applicability:**
   - Some rules may be overly specific, capturing anomalies rather than general trends, leading to low support.
   - There may be redundant or contradictory rules that dilute overall effectiveness and introduce noise.

4. **SMARTS Patterns and Function Implementation:**
   - Issues with SMARTS patterns not accurately reflecting the intended chemical features.
   - Potential problems with atom indexing and mapping in pattern matching functions, leading to incorrect matching and distance calculations.

**Suggestions to Improve Current Rules:**

1. **Reassess and Refine Specific Rules:**
   - **Rule 8 (Fluorinated Carboxylic Acids Predict Low Yield):**
     - **Action:** Reevaluate the scope of this rule. Determine if all fluorinated carboxylic acids lead to low yield or if there are exceptions based on the position and number of fluorine atoms.
     - **Modification:** Specify the position of fluorine atoms relative to the carboxyl group and consider partial fluorination.
   - **Rule 9 (Amide Bonds Predict Low Yield):**
     - **Action:** Differentiate between types of amide bonds (primary, secondary, tertiary) and their proximity to the carboxyl group.
     - **Modification:** Adjust the rule to consider only amide bonds that significantly reduce the availability of coordination sites.
   - **Rule 5 (Distant Functional Groups Predict Low Yield):**
     - **Action:** Reevaluate the definition of "distant" functional groups. Consider whether certain functional groups at specific distances actually impact yield.
     - **Modification:** Incorporate the electronic and steric effects of these functional groups into the rule.

2. **Review and Correct SMARTS Patterns:**
   - **Carboxylic Acid Pattern:**
     - **Issue:** The pattern `[CX3](=O)[OX1H1]` may miss some carboxylic acids, especially in their deprotonated form.
     - **Action:** Modify the pattern to `[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]` to include both protonated and deprotonated forms.
   - **Primary Amine Pattern:**
     - **Issue:** The pattern `[NX3H2]` might not match all primary amines.
     - **Action:** Broaden the pattern to `[NX3;H2]` or include additional patterns as needed.
   - **Heteroaromatic Rings:**
     - **Issue:** Current patterns may miss heteroaromatic systems with different ring sizes or heteroatoms.
     - **Action:** Expand patterns to include various heteroatoms (N, O, S) and ring sizes.

3. **Fix Atom Indexing in Pattern Matching Functions:**
   - **Issue:** Incorrect atom indices may lead to wrong distance calculations.
   - **Action:** Use atom maps in SMARTS patterns to clearly identify atoms of interest.
     - Example: `[C:1](=O)[O:2][H]` allows referencing specific atoms in code.

4. **Enhance Additional Check Functions:**
   - **Issue:** Functions like `check_amino_proximity` may not correctly implement the intended logic.
   - **Action:** Review and correct these functions, ensuring they accurately calculate distances and account for molecular geometry.

5. **Eliminate Redundant or Contradictory Rules:**
   - **Issue:** Overlapping or conflicting rules can reduce model effectiveness.
   - **Action:** Identify such rules and either consolidate or remove them to streamline the rule set.

6. **Increase Rule Support Through Generalization:**
   - **Issue:** Low train support indicates rules are too restrictive.
   - **Action:** Generalize rules where possible without significantly lowering confidence.
     - Merge similar rules to cover more cases.
     - Broaden the scope of rules to include additional relevant functional groups.

7. **Balance Rule Specificity and Generality:**
   - **Issue:** Overly specific rules may cause overfitting, while overly general rules may underfit.
   - **Action:** Adjust rules to find a balance that maximizes predictive power and applicability.

8. **Utilize RDKit's Built-in Features and Databases:**
   - **Action:** Use RDKit's `FunctionalGroups.txt` and fragment identification tools to improve pattern matching and cover functional groups accurately.

9. **Validate Patterns with Known Examples:**
   - **Issue:** Uncertainty about whether patterns match intended molecules.
   - **Action:** Test SMARTS patterns against the provided high-yield and low-yield examples to verify accuracy.
   - **Adjustment:** Modify patterns based on test results to ensure correct matching.

10. **Incorporate Additional Molecular Features:**
    - **Action:** Introduce descriptors for electronic effects (e.g., Hammett sigma constants) and steric hindrance (e.g., Taft steric constants).
    - **Benefit:** Enhance rules to capture subtler effects influencing metal coordination and yield.

11. **Handle Ionization States and Tautomers:**
    - **Issue:** Current patterns may not account for different ionization states.
    - **Action:** Modify patterns to include common ionic forms and tautomers.

12. **Iterative Refinement and Cross-Validation:**
    - **Action:** Regularly assess model performance on validation sets and adjust rules accordingly.
    - **Benefit:** Prevent overfitting and ensure that rules generalize well to unseen data.

**Judgment on Further Optimization:**

Based on the current performance metrics and insights from the SHAP analysis, there is clear potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. The decrease in validation accuracy and the identified issues with specific rules suggest that refining the rules can lead to improved predictive performance.

**Please Optimize Rules**

    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups capable of metal coordination (e.g., nitro, amino) at the para position** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase acidity and coordination ability, enhancing interaction with metal centers.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *4-nitrobenzoic acid*
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (Methyl group lacks coordination ability)

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids where the heteroatom is capable of coordinating with the metal center** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Heteroatoms like nitrogen provide additional coordination sites, enhancing metal-ligand interactions.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
    - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Steric hindrance due to directly connected rings)

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with long, unbranched carbon chains (six or more carbons) and no additional functional groups** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Long hydrocarbon chains enhance hydrophobic interactions and minimize interference from other groups, facilitating better catalyst engagement.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *Octanoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexamples*:
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid* (Additional functional group reduces yield)
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) located more than three carbons away from the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Distant functional groups are less effective in coordinating with the metal center and may introduce steric hindrance.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing **ether linkages or flexible chains within the carbon backbone** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether linkages increase flexibility and may hinder effective coordination between the modifier and metal center.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids or contain multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites, promoting strong chelation with the metal center.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
    - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **fluorinated carboxylic acids or contain strongly electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Strongly electron-withdrawing fluorinated groups reduce electron density, diminishing coordination ability with metal centers.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that **contain amide bonds involving the carboxyl group or amino group near the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide formation decreases availability of free amino and carboxyl groups necessary for effective metal coordination.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid*
    - *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups incapable of metal coordination (e.g., methyl group) at the ortho or para positions** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups decrease acidity of the carboxyl group, reducing coordination ability with metal ions.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid*

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids containing aldehyde or ketone groups near the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde and ketone groups may engage in side reactions or interfere with metal coordination, reducing catalyst efficiency.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*
    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups on the aromatic ring and a short linker (three carbons or fewer) between the carboxyl group and the ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Short linkers may cause steric hindrance or insufficient interaction with the catalyst.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Redefine Rules Using Quantifiable Descriptors**  
  Replace qualitative terms in the rules with quantifiable molecular descriptors that can be directly calculated from SMILES strings. For example, specify exact distances by counting the number of bonds between functional groups and the carboxyl group, enabling numerical representation.

- **Advice 2**: **Consolidate Overlapping Rules for Simplicity**  
  Identify and merge overlapping or redundant rules to create a streamlined rule set. For instance, Rules 1 and 5 both address functional groups near the carboxyl group; combining them will reduce complexity and improve clarity.

- **Advice 3**: **Utilize Standardized Molecular Features**  
  Define rules based on standardized features such as the number of hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, rotatable bonds, and ring counts. These features can be easily calculated and used to generate a numeric feature matrix.

- **Advice 4**: **Quantify Electronic Effects Using Calculated Parameters**  
  Replace subjective terms like "electron-withdrawing" or "electron-donating" with calculated electronic descriptors such as Hammett sigma constants, partial charges, or electrostatic potentials. This makes the rules based on measurable properties.

- **Advice 5**: **Incorporate Molecular Flexibility Descriptors**  
  Address rules related to molecular flexibility (e.g., Rules 6 and 15) by including descriptors like rotatable bond count, flexible bond counts, and molecular conformational entropy. This quantifies flexibility and steric effects numerically.

- **Advice 6**: **Specify Functional Group Positions Numerically**  
  For rules concerning the position of functional groups (e.g., "within three carbons of the carboxyl group"), define the exact number of atoms or bonds separating functional groups. This allows for precise calculation and modeling.

- **Advice 7**: **Use Substructure Patterns with SMARTS Notation**  
  Identify key substructures or functional groups using SMARTS patterns, which can be matched computationally within SMILES strings. This method enables the detection of specific features like aromatic rings with particular substituents.

- **Advice 8**: **Integrate Molecular Fingerprints for Feature Generation**  
  Employ molecular fingerprinting techniques (e.g., Morgan fingerprints) to capture the presence or absence of molecular substructures. These fingerprints can serve as input features for machine learning models without relying solely on predefined rules.

- **Advice 9**: **Validate and Refine Rules Based on Data Analysis**  
  Analyze the existing dataset to assess the predictive power of each rule. Use statistical methods or machine learning feature importance to determine which rules significantly correlate with high or low yields, refining the rules accordingly.

- **Advice 10**: **Ensure Algorithmic Implementability of Rules**  
  Rewrite rules to eliminate ambiguity and ensure they can be implemented algorithmically. Avoid vague language and focus on precise, measurable criteria to facilitate automated feature extraction from molecular structures.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*
    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that contain **amide bonds involving the carboxyl group or amino group near the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyl-L-lysine)
    - *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups incapable of metal coordination (e.g., methyl, methoxy) at the ortho or para positions** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group and reduce its coordination ability with metal ions.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (P-Toluic acid)
  - *Additional Low Yield Example*:
    - *3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (Hypothetical example with methoxy group)

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating and coordinating groups (e.g., hydroxyl) positioned to minimize steric hindrance** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Hydroxyl groups can coordinate with metal centers if appropriately positioned, enhancing catalyst interaction without causing steric interference.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid* (Hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring with flexible linker)
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (Short linker may cause steric hindrance and reduce flexibility)

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids containing thiol groups near the carboxyl group in short chains (three carbons or fewer)** predict a **high yield**.

  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid* (3-Mercaptopropionic acid)
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* (Thiol on aromatic ring may not coordinate as effectively due to resonance stabilization)

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with fused ring systems or extended conjugation capable of metal coordination** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Extended conjugation and fused rings increase electron delocalization, enhancing coordination ability with metal ions and potentially stabilizing catalytic intermediates.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (L-Tryptophan)
    - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino group located within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The nearby amino group can effectively coordinate with metal centers, enhancing chelation and improving catalyst performance.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (L-Aspartic acid)
    - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (L-Glutamic acid)
    - *5-aminopentanoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexamples*:
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid* (Amino group too distant)
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups capable of metal coordination at the para position**, such as **amino, nitro, or halogen groups**, predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity and coordination ability of the modifier, enhancing interaction with metal centers.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid* (PABA)
    - *4-nitrobenzoic acid*
    - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexamples*:
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (Electron-donating methyl group reduces coordination)
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (Hydroxyl group in less favorable position)

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of coordinating with metal centers** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles serve as additional coordination sites, strengthening metal-ligand interactions and enhancing catalyst activity.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
    - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Steric hindrance due to directly connected rings reduces coordination efficiency)

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance chelation by providing additional coordination sites to the metal center, increasing catalyst stability.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
    - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with a thiol group within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Thiol groups are strong ligands that can form stable complexes with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity through effective coordination.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid* (3-Mercaptopropionic acid)
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* (Thiol group on aromatic ring may not coordinate as effectively)

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde and ketone groups may participate in side reactions or interfere with metal coordination, reducing catalyst efficiency.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*
    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) located more than four carbons away from the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Distant functional groups are less effective in coordinating with the metal center and may introduce flexibility that hinders effective catalyst interaction.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that contain **multiple ether linkages within their backbone** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Increased flexibility due to ether linkages may reduce the ability of the modifier to effectively coordinate with the metal center because of unfavorable entropy during binding.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **perfluorinated carboxylic acids or contain perfluoroalkyl groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine reduces electron density on coordinating atoms, diminishing their ability to interact effectively with metal centers.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups incapable of metal coordination (e.g., methyl, methoxy) at the ortho or para positions** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group and reduce its coordination ability with metal ions.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (P-Toluic acid)
  - *Additional Low Yield Example*:
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with long unbranched hydrophobic chains of eight carbons** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The hydrophobic chain may facilitate favorable interactions within the catalyst environment, promoting better reactivity and catalyst-substrate alignment.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *Octanoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Introduction of polar groups may disrupt hydrophobic interactions)

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that contain **amide bonds involving the carboxyl group or have N-acetyl modifications near the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide formation reduces the availability of free amino and carboxyl groups necessary for effective metal coordination, hindering catalyst activity.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyl-L-lysine)
    - *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*
    - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid*

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with bulky substituents causing steric hindrance** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Bulky groups can prevent effective coordination with the metal center due to steric interference.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Biaryl system introduces steric hindrance)

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups at positions that favor coordination without steric hindrance** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Appropriately positioned hydroxyl groups can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst interaction.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid* (Flexible linker reduces steric hindrance)
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (Shorter linker may cause steric hindrance)

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with fused ring systems or extended conjugation capable of metal coordination** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Extended conjugation and fused rings increase electron delocalization, enhancing coordination ability with metal ions and potentially stabilizing catalytic intermediates.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (L-Tryptophan)
    - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: Update the SMARTS pattern for the carboxylic acid group. The current pattern `'[CX3](=O)[OX1H0]'` matches deprotonated carboxylate ions but misses the protonated form present in most carboxylic acids. Replace it with a more inclusive pattern like `'[CX3](=O)[OX1H1]'` or `'C(=O)[O;H1,H0]'` to match both protonated and deprotonated forms of carboxylic acids.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Revise the SMARTS patterns for the amino group. The current pattern `'[NX3;H2]'` may miss primary amines attached to carbons with additional substituents. Use a more general pattern like `'[NX3;!$(N[OX2]);!$(N=[CX3])]'` to match primary amino groups excluding those involved in amides or imines.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: Correct the SMARTS patterns for aldehyde and ketone groups in Rule 6. The current patterns may not accurately match these functional groups adjacent to the carboxyl group. Use patterns like `'[CX3H1](=O)[#6]'` for aldehydes and `'[CX3](=O)[#6]'` for ketones to ensure correct matching.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Improve the method for determining the position of substituents on aromatic rings (ortho, meta, para) in Rules 2 and 10. Implement a function that calculates the shortest path within the aromatic ring and checks for substituents at specific positions relative to the carboxyl group.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: Modify the `ewg_in_para_position` and `edg_ortho_para_positions` functions to accurately identify electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups at the correct positions. Ensure that these functions consider ring size and handle cases where multiple rings are fused or connected.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Enhance the `amine_within_three_carbons`, `thiol_within_three_carbons`, and similar functions to correctly calculate the number of bonds between functional groups, accounting for branching and ring structures. Use RDKit's `GetShortestPath` method carefully to ensure accurate distance measurements.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: Update the SMARTS pattern for ethers in Rule 8. The current pattern may match irrelevant structures. Use a more precise pattern like `'[#6]-O-[#6]'` and adjust the `multiple_ether_linkages` function to count the number of ether linkages accurately.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: For Rule 9, expand the SMARTS pattern to match perfluoroalkyl groups of varying lengths, not just trifluoromethyl groups. Use a pattern like `'[CX4]([F])([F])[F]'` and consider additional patterns to catch longer perfluorinated chains.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: Add more comprehensive SMARTS patterns for bulky substituents in Rule 13, such as t-butyl groups or polycyclic systems. Consider using descriptors like molecular weight or steric parameters if SMARTS patterns are insufficient.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Test each rule individually with known positive and negative examples to validate the SMARTS patterns and additional checks. Adjust the patterns based on these tests to improve accuracy.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: Consider protonation states and tautomeric forms in SMARTS matching. Use RDKit's tautomer enumeration or standardization to ensure that functional groups are recognized regardless of their protonation state.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: Use RDKit's substructure search options like `useChirality=False` and `useQueryQueryMatches=True` to ensure broader matching when stereochemistry is not critical for the rule.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: Improve error handling in the code to catch and report exceptions during pattern matching, which will help in debugging and refining the SMARTS patterns and functions.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: Document each function and SMARTS pattern clearly, explaining the reasoning behind them. This will make it easier to identify discrepancies between the natural language rules and their implementations.

- ** Suggestion 15 **: Collaborate with a cheminformatics expert to refine SMARTS patterns and ensure that the code effectively captures the chemical logic described in the natural language rules.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rules Based on Current Metrics**

**Introduction**

The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the performance of the current set of rules (Rules 1 through 15) based on the provided metrics, with a focus on **confidence** and **lift**. We will compare the current metrics to the previous metrics to assess improvements, determine if a local minimum has been reached, and suggest ways to enhance the current rules.

---

**Summary of Metrics**

**Previous Metrics for Reference:**

- **Train Support:** [0.1667, 0.1845]
- **Train Confidence:** [0.6352, 0.5396]
- **Train Lift:** [1.2048, 1.0559]

**Current Metrics (Most Recent Iteration):**

- **Train Support:** 0.0152
- **Train Confidence:** 0.5778
- **Train Lift:** 1.1660

---

**Detailed Analysis**

1. **Confidence**

   - **Previous Confidence:** 
     - Average: (0.6352 + 0.5396) / 2 = **~0.5874** (58.74%)
   - **Current Confidence:** **0.5778** (57.78%)
   - **Comparison:** The current confidence is slightly below the average of the previous metrics. While there hasn't been a substantial decrease, there isn't a significant improvement either.
   - **Interpretation:** The current rules correctly predict the outcome approximately 57.78% of the time when the rule conditions are met. This suggests moderate predictive power.

2. **Lift**

   - **Previous Lift:** 
     - Average: (1.2048 + 1.0559) / 2 = **~1.1304**
   - **Current Lift:** **1.1660**
   - **Comparison:** The current lift is slightly higher than the average of the previous metrics but lower than the highest previous lift (1.2048).
   - **Interpretation:** A lift of 1.1660 indicates that the likelihood of achieving a high yield, given the rule conditions, is increased by 16.60% compared to random chance. This demonstrates that the rules have a positive association with the desired outcome.

3. **Support**

   - **Previous Support:** 
     - Average: (0.1667 + 0.1845) / 2 = **~0.1756** (17.56%)
   - **Current Support:** **0.0152** (1.52%)
   - **Comparison:** The current support is significantly lower than the previous average support, dropping from around 17.56% to 1.52%.
   - **Interpretation:** The rules apply to a much smaller portion of the dataset, which may limit their practical usefulness despite acceptable confidence and lift values.

---

**Assessment of Local Minimum and Iterations**

- **Stagnation in Confidence and Lift:**
  - The confidence and lift have not shown significant improvement compared to previous metrics.
  - Slight fluctuations suggest that we may be oscillating around a local minimum.
  
- **Decrease in Support:**
  - The sharp decrease in support indicates that the rules are becoming more specific, covering fewer data points.
  - This could be a sign of overfitting to the training data.

- **Conclusion on Iterations:**
  - Given the lack of substantial improvement and the decrease in support, it appears that the current approach may have reached a local minimum.
  - Continuing with the same methodology is unlikely to yield significant benefits.

---

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

1. **Generalize Rule Conditions:**

   - **Issue:** Highly specific rules reduce support.
   - **Solution:** Broaden the conditions of existing rules to cover more instances without overly compromising confidence and lift.
   - **Example:** Instead of focusing on modifiers with an amino group within three carbons of the carboxyl group, consider including those within four or five carbons if they still demonstrate reasonable performance.

2. **Prioritize High Confidence and Lift Rules:**

   - **Issue:** Not all rules contribute equally to predictive performance.
   - **Solution:** Identify and retain rules that have both high confidence and high lift. Reassess or discard rules with low metrics.
   - **Action:** Reevaluate Rules 5, 6, and any others that may underperform.

3. **Balance Specificity and Coverage:**

   - **Issue:** Overly specific rules may have high confidence but low support.
   - **Solution:** Find a balance where rules are specific enough to be meaningful but general enough to apply to a significant portion of the data.
   - **Action:** Combine similar rules where appropriate to increase support.

4. **Incorporate Additional Features:**

   - **Issue:** Current rules may not capture all relevant factors.
   - **Solution:** Analyze the dataset for additional features that could improve prediction, such as electronic effects, steric hindrance, or solvent interactions.
   - **Action:** Include descriptors like pKa values, molecular weight, or calculated steric parameters in rule development.

5. **Cross-Validation:**

   - **Issue:** Potential overfitting to training data.
   - **Solution:** Use cross-validation techniques to ensure that the rules generalize well to unseen data.
   - **Action:** Evaluate the rules on a validation set and compare metrics to confirm consistency.

6. **Algorithmic Adjustments:**

   - **Issue:** Current rule generation method may have limitations.
   - **Solution:** Experiment with different rule induction algorithms or machine learning models such as decision trees, random forests, or support vector machines.
   - **Action:** Implement alternative models and compare their performance with the current rules.

7. **Iterative Feedback Loop:**

   - **Issue:** Need for continuous improvement.
   - **Solution:** Establish an iterative process where rules are regularly updated based on the latest metrics and domain knowledge.
   - **Action:** After applying the above recommendations, reassess the rules and metrics to evaluate improvements.

---

**Specific Suggestions for Current Rules**

- **Revise Rules with Low Support:**

  - **Example:** Rule 5 (Modifiers with a thiol group within three carbons of the carboxyl group) may have low support due to the rarity of such compounds in the dataset.
  - **Action:** Consider merging with similar rules or broadening the conditions.

- **Enhance Rules with Moderate Confidence and Lift:**

  - **Example:** Rule 3 (Heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms) shows promise.
  - **Action:** Investigate if expanding this rule to include additional heterocycles improves metrics.

- **Eliminate Redundant or Conflicting Rules:**

  - **Issue:** Some rules may overlap or contradict each other, causing confusion.
  - **Action:** Streamline the rule set to remove redundancies and ensure clarity.

---

**Conclusion**

The current set of rules demonstrates moderate predictive power but has not significantly improved upon previous metrics. The low support indicates that the rules are not widely applicable across the dataset, limiting their usefulness. It is recommended to:

- Broaden the applicability of the rules to increase support.
- Focus on enhancing confidence and lift without excessively narrowing the rules.
- Consider additional features and alternative modeling approaches.
- Use cross-validation to ensure that improvements are genuine and not due to overfitting.

By implementing these recommendations, we can work towards developing a more robust and effective set of rules that offer better predictive performance and practical applicability.

---

**Next Steps**

1. **Implement the suggested changes to the rules.**
2. **Recalculate the metrics after adjustments.**
3. **Evaluate the new metrics against previous ones to assess improvements.**
4. **Repeat the process iteratively until satisfactory performance is achieved.**

This systematic approach will help in moving past the local minimum and achieving a more optimal set of predictive rules for the catalytic problem at hand.

ML Commenter Message:
**1. Evaluation of Model Performance**

The previous model iterations demonstrated validation accuracies consistently around **0.76**, with test accuracies of **0.75** and **0.625**:

- **Previous Validation Accuracies**:
  - [0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]; Test Accuracy: 0.75
  - [0.76, 0.68, 0.72, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]; Test Accuracy: 0.75
  - [0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]; Test Accuracy: 0.625
  - [0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]; Test Accuracy: 0.625

In the current iteration, the model achieved a validation accuracy of **0.6857**, which is lower than the previous accuracies:

- **Current Validation Accuracy**:
  - An accuracy of **0.6857** was obtained using the classification model.

**Interpretation**:

- The decrease in validation accuracy from **0.76** to **0.6857** suggests that the current set of rules may not be performing as effectively as previous iterations.
- This reduction indicates potential issues with the generalization capability of the model, possibly due to overfitting or underfitting.

---

**2. Analysis of SHAP Values**

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values provide insights into the contribution of each rule to the model's predictions. By analyzing the SHAP values, we can identify which rules are contributing to incorrect predictions.

**2.1. Overestimated Loadings (Predicted High, Experimental Low)**

- **Molecules with Overestimated Loadings**:
  - **C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O**
  - **C(CCCC(=O)O)CCCN**

- **SHAP Values for Overestimated Molecules**:

  | Molecule                                      | Rule8 SHAP Value | Rule9 SHAP Value | Rule12 SHAP Value |
  |-----------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|
  | C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O                       | 0.0296           | 0.0108           | **0.0787**        |
  | C(CCCC(=O)O)CCCN                              | 0.0296           | 0.0108           | **0.0787**        |

- **Interpretation**:
  - **Rule12** has the highest positive SHAP value among the rules for these molecules.
  - This suggests that **Rule12** is heavily contributing to the overestimation of the loading for these molecules.
  
**2.2. Underestimated Loadings (Predicted Low, Experimental High)**

- **Molecule with Underestimated Loading**:
  - **COC1=C(C=C(C=C1)C(=O)CCC(=O)O)OC**

- **SHAP Values for Underestimated Molecule**:

  | Molecule                                      | Rule8 SHAP Value   | Rule9 SHAP Value | Rule12 SHAP Value |
  |-----------------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------|-------------------|
  | COC1=C(C=C(C=C1)C(=O)CCC(=O)O)OC              | **-0.5431**        | 0.0107           | 0.0325            |

- **Interpretation**:
  - **Rule8** has a significant negative SHAP value, indicating it strongly pushes the prediction toward a low loading.
  - This suggests that **Rule8** may be causing underestimation for this molecule.

**2.3. Consistent Incorrect Predictions**

- Repeated patterns where certain rules consistently contribute to misclassifications highlight potential issues with those rules.
- **Rule8** and **Rule12** appear frequently in cases of incorrect predictions, either with high positive or negative SHAP values.

---

**3. Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting**

- **Overfitting**:
  - The model may be capturing noise from the training data due to overly specific rules, leading to poor performance on unseen data.
- **Underfitting**:
  - The model may be too simple to capture the underlying patterns, possibly due to generalized rules that don't adequately differentiate between high and low yield modifiers.

**Conclusion**:

- The decrease in validation accuracy suggests that the model may not be generalizing well.
- The presence of rules contributing to both overestimations and underestimations indicates potential overfitting to the training data.

---

**4. Recommendations for Rule Refinement**

Based on the SHAP analysis and performance metrics, the following recommendations can be made to improve the current rules:

**4.1. Review and Refine Rule12**

- **Issue**:
  - **Rule12** contributes significantly to overestimations.
- **Current Rule12**:
  - **Rule 12**: Modifiers that contain **amide bonds involving the carboxyl group or have N-acetyl modifications near the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
- **Possible Problems**:
  - Rule12 may be incorrectly classifying certain modifiers as high yield when they should be low yield.
- **Recommendation**:
  - **Re-express Rule12** to improve specificity.
    - Consider adding structural constraints or exceptions.
    - Example Modification:
      - "Modifiers that contain **amide bonds involving the carboxyl group without additional coordinating groups nearby** predict a **low yield**."
    - This adjustment may exclude modifiers where amide bonds are present but other functional groups compensate by enhancing coordination.

**4.2. Adjust Rule8**

- **Issue**:
  - **Rule8** contributes to both overestimations and underestimations.
  - High negative SHAP values in cases where the model underestimates loading.
- **Current Rule8**:
  - **Rule 8**: Modifiers that contain **multiple ether linkages within their backbone** predict a **low yield**.
- **Possible Problems**:
  - Rule8 may be too general, incorrectly penalizing modifiers where ether linkages do not hinder coordination significantly.
- **Recommendation**:
  - **Refine Rule8** to target more specific cases.
    - Include considerations for the position and context of ether linkages.
    - Example Modification:
      - "Modifiers with **multiple ether linkages that increase molecular flexibility and distance coordinating groups from the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**."
    - This revision focuses on the impact of ether linkages on coordination rather than their mere presence.

**4.3. General Recommendations**

- **Increase Specificity**:
  - Review rules to ensure they are not overly broad.
  - Specificity can reduce misclassifications by targeting the structural features that truly impact loading.
- **Incorporate Exceptions**:
  - Identify and document exceptions to the rules based on observed data.
  - Updating rules to account for these exceptions can improve accuracy.
- **Combine or Split Rules**:
  - Consider splitting complex rules into simpler sub-rules.
  - Alternatively, combine similar rules to reduce redundancy.
- **Regular Validation**:
  - Continue iterative testing and validation after rule adjustments.
  - Use cross-validation to ensure generalization.

**4.4. Utilize SHAP Insights**

- **Leverage SHAP Analysis**:
  - Use SHAP values to identify which features (rules) are most influential in incorrect predictions.
- **Iterative Refinement**:
  - Continuously refine rules based on model feedback.
  - After each iteration, analyze the impact of changes on model performance.

---

**5. Conclusion**

The current model shows a decrease in validation accuracy compared to previous iterations, indicating potential issues with the existing rules. Analysis of SHAP values reveals that **Rule12** and **Rule8** are contributing to misclassifications. By refining these rules and making them more specific, the model's performance can potentially improve. Continuing this iterative process of analysis and refinement, guided by SHAP insights, should enhance the model's accuracy and generalization capabilities.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

**1. Evaluation of Current Rules and Metrics**

The analysis of the current set of rules (Rules 1 through 15) indicates that the model's performance has reached a plateau and may not be optimal. Key observations include:

- **Train Support Decrease**: The train support has significantly decreased from approximately 17.56% in previous metrics to 1.52% in the current iteration. This suggests that the rules have become overly specific, applying to a minimal portion of the dataset.

- **Confidence and Lift**: The train confidence is around 57.78%, with a train lift of 1.1660. While these metrics are moderately positive, they have not improved substantially over previous iterations.

- **Validation Accuracy Drop**: The validation accuracy has decreased from prior values of around 76% to 68.57%, indicating potential issues with the model's generalization capability.

**2. SHAP Analysis Insights**

The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis provided further insights:

- **Rule 8** is contributing to the underestimation of yield in cases where experimental values are high. Its overly general application might be penalizing modifiers where ether linkages do not hinder coordination significantly.

- **Rule 12** is contributing to the overestimation of yield in cases where experimental values are low. The rule might not be specific enough, leading to misclassifications.

**Directions and Suggestions for Improving Current Rules**

To optimize the current rules, the following suggestions are proposed:

**A. Refine SMARTS Patterns and Functional Group Recognition**

1. **Update Carboxylic Acid Patterns**: Modify the SMARTS pattern for carboxylic acids to include both protonated and deprotonated forms. Use patterns like `'C(=O)[O;H1,H0]'` to capture all relevant species.

2. **Revise Amino Group Patterns**: Broaden the SMARTS pattern for amino groups to ensure all primary amines are included. Utilize patterns like `'[NX3;!$(N[OX2]);!$(N=[CX3])]'` to exclude amides and imines but include necessary amines.

3. **Correct Aldehyde and Ketone Patterns in Rule 6**: Use precise SMARTS patterns such as `'[CX3H1](=O)[#6]'` for aldehydes and `'[CX3](=O)[#6]'` for ketones to improve the accuracy of Rule 6.

4. **Enhance Ether Linkage Patterns in Rule 8**: Refine the SMARTS pattern to `'[#6]-O-[#6]'` and adjust the corresponding function to accurately count multiple ether linkages, ensuring only relevant modifiers are identified.

5. **Expand Perfluoroalkyl Group Patterns in Rule 9**: Include additional SMARTS patterns to capture various lengths of perfluoroalkyl groups, not just trifluoromethyl groups. Patterns like `'[CX4][F][F][F]'` can be used to match a broader range of perfluorinated compounds.

6. **Include Bulky Substituents in Rule 13**: Add SMARTS patterns for common bulky groups such as tert-butyl or polycyclic systems to better identify steric hindrance effects.

**B. Improve Functional Group Position and Distance Calculations**

7. **Accurately Determine Substituent Positions**: Implement functions that accurately calculate ortho, meta, and para positions on aromatic rings for Rules 2 and 10. This can be achieved by calculating the shortest paths in the ring systems.

8. **Precisely Measure Distances Between Functional Groups**: Enhance functions like `amine_within_three_carbons` to accurately measure the number of bonds between functional groups, considering branching and ring systems.

**C. Adjust Rule Specificity and Coverage**

9. **Broaden Overly Specific Rules**: Increase the generality of rules with very low support to encompass more modifiers. For instance, extend the allowable distance for functional groups in Rules 1 and 5 from three to four or five carbons if chemically justifiable.

10. **Refine Overly General Rules**: Narrow down rules that are too broad and lead to misclassifications. Rule 8, for example, could specify that only certain positions of ether linkages negatively impact yield.

11. **Balance between Specificity and Applicability**: Ensure that rules are specific enough to be meaningful but also cover a sufficient portion of the dataset to be valuable.

**D. Incorporate Additional Molecular Features**

12. **Include Electronic and Steric Descriptors**: Integrate additional descriptors such as pKa values, steric parameters, or molecular weight into the rules to capture factors influencing metal coordination and catalytic activity.

**E. Test and Validate Rules Individually**

13. **Validate Each Rule with Examples**: Use known positive and negative examples to test each rule's effectiveness, adjusting patterns and criteria based on the outcomes.

14. **Apply Cross-Validation Techniques**: Utilize cross-validation to assess the generalizability of the rules and prevent overfitting.

**F. Enhance Code Implementation**

15. **Consider Tautomeric and Protonation States**: Implement RDKit tools for tautomer enumeration and protonation state standardization to ensure functional groups are correctly recognized.

16. **Improve Error Handling and Documentation**: Strengthen the code by adding error handling mechanisms and thoroughly documenting the functions and SMARTS patterns for clarity.

17. **Use RDKit Substructure Search Options**: Leverage RDKit's options like `useChirality=False` and `useQueryQueryMatches=True` to capture a broader range of matching structures.

**3. Judgment on Possibility for Further Optimization**

Based on the analysis, there is clear potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting:

- **Performance Metrics Indicate Room for Improvement**: The decrease in validation accuracy and train support suggests that the current model is not performing optimally.

- **Rules Contributing to Misclassifications**: SHAP analysis highlights specific rules that are leading to incorrect predictions, indicating that adjusting these rules could enhance model performance.

- **Ability to Refine Rules**: By refining SMARTS patterns, adjusting rule specificity, and incorporating additional molecular features, it is possible to improve the applicability and accuracy of the rules without overfitting.

**Conclusion**

There is a significant opportunity to optimize the current rules further. Implementing the suggested modifications can enhance the model's predictive power and generalizability, leading to better control and optimization of the reaction yield.

    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino group located within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The nearby amino group can effectively coordinate with metal centers, enhancing chelation and improving catalyst performance.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (L-Aspartic acid)
    - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (L-Glutamic acid)
    - *5-aminopentanoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexamples*:
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid* (Amino group too distant)
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups capable of metal coordination at the para position**, such as **amino, nitro, or halogen groups**, predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity and coordination ability of the modifier, enhancing interaction with metal centers.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid* (PABA)
    - *4-nitrobenzoic acid*
    - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexamples*:
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (Electron-donating methyl group reduces coordination)
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (Hydroxyl group in less favorable position)

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of coordinating with metal centers** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles serve as additional coordination sites, strengthening metal-ligand interactions and enhancing catalyst activity.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
    - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Steric hindrance due to directly connected rings reduces coordination efficiency)

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance chelation by providing additional coordination sites to the metal center, increasing catalyst stability.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
    - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with a thiol group within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Thiol groups are strong ligands that can form stable complexes with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity through effective coordination.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid* (3-Mercaptopropionic acid)
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* (Thiol group on aromatic ring may not coordinate as effectively)

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde and ketone groups may participate in side reactions or interfere with metal coordination, reducing catalyst efficiency.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*
    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) located more than four carbons away from the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Distant functional groups are less effective in coordinating with the metal center and may introduce flexibility that hinders effective catalyst interaction.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that contain **multiple ether linkages within their backbone** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Increased flexibility due to ether linkages may reduce the ability of the modifier to effectively coordinate with the metal center because of unfavorable entropy during binding.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **perfluorinated carboxylic acids or contain perfluoroalkyl groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine reduces electron density on coordinating atoms, diminishing their ability to interact effectively with metal centers.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups incapable of metal coordination (e.g., methyl, methoxy) at the ortho or para positions** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group and reduce its coordination ability with metal ions.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (P-Toluic acid)
  - *Additional Low Yield Example*:
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid*

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with long unbranched hydrophobic chains of eight carbons** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The hydrophobic chain may facilitate favorable interactions within the catalyst environment, promoting better reactivity and catalyst-substrate alignment.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *Octanoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Introduction of polar groups may disrupt hydrophobic interactions)

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that contain **amide bonds involving the carboxyl group or have N-acetyl modifications near the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide formation reduces the availability of free amino and carboxyl groups necessary for effective metal coordination, hindering catalyst activity.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyl-L-lysine)
    - *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*
    - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid*

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with bulky substituents causing steric hindrance** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Bulky groups can prevent effective coordination with the metal center due to steric interference.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Biaryl system introduces steric hindrance)

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups at positions that favor coordination without steric hindrance** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Appropriately positioned hydroxyl groups can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst interaction.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid* (Flexible linker reduces steric hindrance)
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (Shorter linker may cause steric hindrance)

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with fused ring systems or extended conjugation capable of metal coordination** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Extended conjugation and fused rings increase electron delocalization, enhancing coordination ability with metal ions and potentially stabilizing catalytic intermediates.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (L-Tryptophan)
    - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Update Carboxylic Acid Patterns**  
  Modify the SMARTS patterns in all relevant rules to accurately identify carboxylic acid groups, including both protonated and deprotonated forms. Use the SMARTS pattern `'C(=O)[O;H1,H0]'` to ensure comprehensive detection of carboxyl groups regardless of their protonation state. This will improve the accuracy of rules involving carboxylic acids.

- **Advice 2**: **Revise Amino Group Patterns**  
  Adjust the SMARTS patterns for amino groups to capture all primary amines while excluding amides and imines. Use a pattern like `'[NX3;H2,H1;!$(N[OX2]);!$(N=[CX3])]'` to match primary amino groups that can effectively coordinate with metal centers. This refinement will enhance the specificity of rules involving amino groups, such as Rule 1 and Rule 7.

- **Advice 3**: **Correct Aldehyde and Ketone Patterns in Rule 6**  
  Improve Rule 6 by using precise SMARTS patterns for aldehyde and ketone groups. Use `'[CX3H1](=O)[#6]'` to identify aldehydes and `'[CX3](=O)[#6]'` for ketones. This correction will ensure that modifiers with these functional groups adjacent to the carboxyl group are accurately classified as predicting a low yield.

- **Advice 4**: **Enhance Ether Linkage Patterns in Rule 8**  
  Refine the SMARTS pattern for ether linkages in Rule 8 to `'[#6]-O-[#6]'`, which will match the ether bonds between carbon atoms. Modify the rule's function to count the number of ether linkages within the molecule and set a threshold (e.g., more than one ether linkage) to identify modifiers that may cause reduced yield due to increased flexibility.

- **Advice 5**: **Expand Perfluoroalkyl Group Patterns in Rule 9**  
  Broaden the SMARTS patterns in Rule 9 to include various lengths of perfluoroalkyl groups. Use patterns like `'[CX4][CX2]([F])([F])[F]'` to capture perfluoroethyl groups and extend to longer chains as needed. This expansion will improve the detection of perfluorinated modifiers that may negatively impact yield.

- **Advice 6**: **Include Bulky Substituents in Rule 13**  
  Add SMARTS patterns for common bulky substituents that cause steric hindrance. Include patterns for tert-butyl groups `'C(C)(C)C'` and polycyclic systems like naphthalene `'c1ccc2ccccc2c1'`. This addition will enhance Rule 13's ability to identify modifiers where steric bulk interferes with metal coordination.

- **Advice 7**: **Accurately Determine Substituent Positions**  
  Implement functions to accurately calculate the positions (ortho, meta, para) of substituents on aromatic rings. Use methods to determine the shortest path between the carboxyl group and other substituents within the ring system. This will refine Rules 2 and 10 by precisely identifying modifiers with substituents at positions that affect yield.

- **Advice 8**: **Precisely Measure Distances Between Functional Groups**  
  Improve the functions that measure distances between functional groups, such as `amine_within_three_carbons`. Utilize graph-based algorithms to compute the shortest path lengths between atoms, accounting for ring structures and branching. This enhancement will increase the accuracy of Rules 1, 5, and 7.

- **Advice 9**: **Broaden Overly Specific Rules**  
  Review rules with very low support and consider relaxing their criteria to increase their applicability. For example, in Rule 1, extend the allowed distance between the amino group and the carboxyl group from within three carbons to within four carbons, if supported by chemical rationale. This will improve the rule's coverage without significantly compromising specificity.

- **Advice 10**: **Refine Overly General Rules**  
  Adjust rules that are too broad and may lead to misclassifications. For Rule 8, specify that only modifiers with multiple ether linkages or with ether groups in specific positions contribute to a low yield. This refinement will prevent the rule from incorrectly penalizing modifiers where ether linkages do not hinder coordination.

- **Advice 11**: **Balance Between Specificity and Applicability**  
  Evaluate all rules to ensure they strike an appropriate balance between specificity (correctly identifying relevant modifiers) and applicability (covering a meaningful portion of the dataset). Adjust the criteria of each rule to optimize this balance, aiming to improve overall model performance metrics such as support, confidence, and lift.

- **Advice 12**: **Incorporate Additional Molecular Descriptors**  
  Enhance the rules by integrating additional molecular features that influence metal coordination and catalytic activity. Include electronic descriptors like pKa values to assess acidity, steric parameters to evaluate hindrance, and molecular weights. This incorporation will allow the rules to capture subtler effects on yield.

- **Advice 13**: **Validate Each Rule with Examples**  
  Test each rule individually using known high-yield and low-yield examples from the dataset. Confirm that the rule correctly classifies these examples and adjust the SMARTS patterns or criteria as needed based on the outcomes. This validation will help ensure that each rule is effective and accurate.

- **Advice 14**: **Apply Cross-Validation Techniques**  
  Use cross-validation methods to assess the generalizability of the rules. Split the dataset into training and validation subsets multiple times to evaluate the rules' performance across different samples. This practice will help prevent overfitting and ensure that the rules perform well on unseen data.

- **Advice 15**: **Consider Tautomeric and Protonation States**  
  Utilize RDKit tools to account for tautomeric forms and protonation states of the modifiers. Implement functions for tautomer enumeration and protonation state standardization before applying the rules. This consideration will ensure that all relevant functional groups are correctly identified, regardless of their specific forms.

- **Advice 16**: **Improve Error Handling and Documentation**  
  Enhance the code by adding error handling mechanisms to manage exceptions during SMARTS matching or functional group recognition. Ensure that the code is robust and can handle unexpected molecular structures. Additionally, thoroughly document all functions, SMARTS patterns, and rules to facilitate understanding and future modifications.

- **Advice 17**: **Use RDKit Substructure Search Options**  
  Leverage RDKit's advanced substructure search options to improve matching accuracy. Set parameters like `useChirality=False` to ignore chirality when it is not relevant and `useQueryQueryMatches=True` to enable more flexible matching. This will help capture a broader range of structures that fit the intended patterns.

    - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Hydroxyl group too distant from carboxyl group to effectively coordinate)

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde and ketone groups can participate in side reactions or interfere with metal coordination. They may also bind irreversibly to the metal center, deactivating the catalyst.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*
    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrocarbon chains (six or more carbons) and no other polar functional groups** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Long hydrophobic chains can enhance interactions within the hydrophobic regions of the catalyst environment, potentially improving substrate alignment and accessibility.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *Octanoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Introduction of polar hydroxyl group disrupts hydrophobic interactions)

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **perfluorinated carboxylic acids or contain perfluoroalkyl groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The strong electron-withdrawing effect of perfluoroalkyl groups reduces the electron density on coordinating atoms, diminishing their ability to interact effectively with metal centers.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids containing ether linkages and terminal amino groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether linkages introduce flexibility and increase the distance between functional groups, reducing the effectiveness of simultaneous coordination with the metal center.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups incapable of metal coordination (e.g., methyl, methoxy) at the ortho or para positions** predict a **low yield**.

    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyl-L-lysine)
    - *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*
    - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid*

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with fused ring systems or extended conjugation capable of metal coordination** predict a **high yield**, provided there is minimal steric hindrance.
  - *Rationale*: Fused ring systems and extended conjugation enhance electron delocalization, increasing the molecule's ability to coordinate with metal centers and potentially stabilizing catalytic intermediates.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (L-Tryptophan)
    - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear, specifying that aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino or thiol group within three carbons of the carboxyl group predict a high yield. The physical-chemical insight is sound, as close proximity of these groups enhances chelation with metal centers, improving catalyst performance. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures, and the dataset provides strong coverage with multiple supporting examples (e.g., L-Aspartic acid, L-Glutamic acid) and counterexamples (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid). The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 clearly states that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups capable of metal coordination at the para position predict a high yield. The rationale is logical, as electron-withdrawing groups enhance acidity and coordination ability. The rule incorporates combinations of sub-structures, and the dataset supports it with multiple examples (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid) and counterexamples (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid). The rule effectively balances complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear in its description of heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms that coordinate with metal centers predicting high yield. The physical-chemical insight is appropriate, highlighting the role of nitrogen atoms in coordination. The rule considers complex sub-structures, and the dataset provides adequate coverage with examples like pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid. The balance between complexity and coverage is maintained.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 specifies that carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups proximal to the carboxyl group predict high yield. The rationale is strong, as additional hydroxyl groups enhance chelation. The rule involves combinations of functional groups and is supported by the dataset with examples like gluconic acid and its analogs. Coverage and balance are adequate.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 clearly indicates that aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxyl group predict low yield. The rationale is valid due to potential side reactions and interference with metal coordination. The rule considers specific combinations of functional groups. The dataset supports this rule with examples such as 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid. The rule achieves a good balance of complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 states that aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrocarbon chains (six or more carbons) and no other polar functional groups predict high yield. The rationale involves enhanced hydrophobic interactions. While the rule is clear and provides property insight, the coverage is limited, with only one supporting example (octanoic acid) and one counterexample (7-hydroxyheptanoic acid) in the dataset. This minimal coverage weakens the rule according to the scoring criteria.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 posits that perfluorinated carboxylic acids or those containing perfluoroalkyl groups predict low yield due to reduced coordination ability from strong electron-withdrawing effects. The rule is clear, and the rationale makes sense. However, the coverage is inadequate, with only one supporting example in the dataset (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid). According to the criteria, at least two data points are needed for adequate coverage, so the rule lacks sufficient support.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 asserts that aliphatic carboxylic acids containing ether linkages and terminal amino groups predict low yield. The rationale is reasonable, as ether linkages increase flexibility, reducing coordination efficiency. The rule is clear and considers combinations of sub-structures. The dataset provides adequate coverage with examples like 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid and 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, both yielding low results. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 indicates that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups incapable of metal coordination at the ortho or para positions predict low yield. The rationale is that electron-donating groups reduce the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxyl group. The rule is clear and considers specific functional group positioning. The dataset supports this rule with examples like 4-methylbenzoic acid and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid showing low yield. The rule has good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 states that modifiers containing amide bonds involving the carboxyl group or N-acetyl modifications near the carboxyl group predict low yield. The rationale is sound since these modifications reduce the availability of free coordinating groups. The rule is clear and considers combinations of sub-structures. The dataset supports it with examples like (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid and 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid, both showing low yield. The coverage and balance are adequate.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 suggests that aromatic carboxylic acids with fused ring systems or extended conjugation capable of metal coordination predict high yield if there is minimal steric hindrance. The rationale is based on enhanced electron delocalization aiding coordination. The rule is clear and considers complex sub-structures. The dataset supports this with examples like L-Tryptophan and 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid showing high yield. However, the counterexample 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid, which shows low yield due to steric hindrance, highlights the importance of steric factors. The rule balances complexity and coverage well.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 states that aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups positioned to enable chelation without steric hindrance predict high yield. The rationale is that appropriately positioned hydroxyl groups enhance coordination. The rule is clear and considers functional group positioning. The dataset provides supporting examples, such as 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid showing high yield, and counterexamples like 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid showing low yield due to steric hindrance. Coverage and balance are satisfactory.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 asserts that aliphatic carboxylic acids with functional groups located more than four carbons away from the carboxyl group predict low yield. The rationale is that distant functional groups are less effective in coordination. The rule is clear and considers functional group positioning. The dataset supports this rule with examples like 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid, and 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, all showing low yield. The coverage is strong, and the rule balances complexity and coverage effectively.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 indicates that modifiers with sterically hindered structures or bulky substituents that impede effective coordination predict low yield. While the rationale is logical, the dataset reveals inconsistencies. For instance, 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid shows low yield, supporting the rule. However, 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid is listed as high yield in the dataset, which contradicts the rule's prediction. This inconsistency suggests that the rule does not accurately predict yield in all cases and lacks the necessary coverage and reliability.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 posits that carboxylic acids with both electron-withdrawing substituents and coordinating heteroatoms in positions facilitating chelation predict high yield. The rationale combines increased acidity and additional coordination sites enhancing performance. The rule is clear and considers complex sub-structures. The dataset supports this rule with examples like 4-nitrobenzoic acid, pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, and 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid, all showing high yield. Coverage and balance are strong.

**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Enhance Rule 6 by increasing data support or refining the rule.** Currently, Rule 6 (Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrocarbon chains predict a high yield) is supported by only one high-yield example (octanoic acid) and one low-yield counterexample (7-hydroxyheptanoic acid). To improve this rule:
  - **Collect additional data** on similar aliphatic carboxylic acids with varying chain lengths to verify if the trend holds.
  - **Refine the rule criteria** to specify the optimal chain length and the absence of polar functional groups that may disrupt hydrophobic interactions.
  - **Consider merging** this rule with another if sufficient data cannot be gathered to support it independently.

- **Advice 2**: **Strengthen Rule 7 by incorporating more examples of perfluorinated carboxylic acids.** Rule 7 predicts low yield for perfluorinated carboxylic acids but currently relies on a single data point (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid). To improve this rule:
  - **Acquire additional data** on other perfluorinated carboxylic acids to confirm the consistency of low yields.
  - **Reassess the rule** if new data show variability in yields, potentially modifying it to account for specific structural features that influence performance.

- **Advice 3**: **Reevaluate Rule 14 to address inconsistencies related to steric hindrance.** Rule 14 indicates that sterically hindered modifiers predict low yield, but there is a contradiction in the dataset where *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid* yields high despite bulky substituents. To refine this rule:
  - **Analyze the structural differences** between high-yield and low-yield bulky modifiers to identify factors that mitigate steric hindrance.
  - **Modify the rule** to include exceptions or additional criteria, such as the presence of flexible linkers that reduce steric effects.
  - **Increase data coverage** by testing more modifiers with bulky groups to establish a more accurate correlation between steric factors and yield.

- **Advice 4**: **Augment Rule 13 by adding high-yield examples or refining its scope.** Rule 13 associates functional groups located more than four carbons away from the carboxyl group with low yield but lacks high-yield examples for comparison. To improve the rule:
  - **Seek out modifiers** where distant functional groups do not adversely affect yield, providing high-yield counterexamples.
  - **Clarify the rule's boundaries** by specifying the types of functional groups or molecular contexts where distance impacts coordination.
  - **Refine the rule's rationale** to incorporate additional factors like molecular flexibility or overall molecular size that may influence yield.

- **Advice 5**: **Ensure all rules meet the minimum data coverage criterion.** According to the scoring guidelines, a rule should be supported by at least two data points. To comply:
  - **Review each rule** to verify it is backed by sufficient high-yield examples and low-yield counterexamples.
  - **Collect more experimental data** where necessary to bolster rules that currently lack adequate support.
  - **Consider consolidating rules** that overlap or are similar, improving coverage and simplifying the rule set.

- **Advice 6**: **Incorporate exceptions into rules where appropriate.** For rules with noted exceptions in the dataset:
  - **Amend the rules** to account for these exceptions by adding conditions or modifiers.
  - **Provide clearer guidelines** on the limits of each rule's applicability to improve predictive accuracy.
  - **Use structural analysis** to understand why certain modifiers do not conform to the expected outcomes, and adjust the rules accordingly.

- **Advice 7**: **Improve clarity and specificity in rule descriptions.** To enhance understanding and application of the rules:
  - **Use precise chemical terminology** and avoid ambiguous language.
  - **Include structural diagrams** or SMILES notations where possible to illustrate key features.
  - **Define terms and parameters** clearly, such as specifying what constitutes a "bulky" substituent or an "electron-withdrawing group capable of coordination."

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino group (primary or secondary) within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The close proximity of the amino group to the carboxyl group facilitates effective chelation with metal centers, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst complex.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (L-Aspartic acid)
    - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (L-Glutamic acid)
    - *5-aminopentanoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexamples*:
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid* (Amino group too distant for effective chelation)
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid* (Functional group too far to coordinate effectively)

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., nitro, halogens) at the para position** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups enhance the acidity of the carboxyl group and improve its ability to coordinate with metal centers, strengthening the catalyst's performance.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *4-nitrobenzoic acid*
    - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (Methyl group is electron-donating, reducing coordination ability)

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with an amino group at the para position** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The amino group acts as an additional coordination site, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and catalyst efficiency.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid* (P-Aminobenzoic acid)
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (Lacks coordinating amino group)

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of coordinating with metal centers** predict a **high yield**, unless steric hindrance is significant.
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles provide effective coordination sites, strengthening the interaction with metal centers.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
    - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Steric hindrance due to bulky structure reduces coordination efficiency)

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Proximal hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites, enhancing chelation with the metal center and improving catalytic activity.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
    - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Hydroxyl group too distant for effective coordination)

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrocarbon chains (six or more carbons) and no other polar functional groups** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Long hydrophobic chains may improve substrate-catalyst interactions within hydrophobic regions, enhancing yield.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *Octanoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Presence of hydroxyl group disrupts hydrophobic interactions)

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde and ketone groups can form inactive complexes with metal centers or engage in side reactions, reducing catalyst effectiveness.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*
    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with amide bonds involving the carboxyl group or N-acetyl modifications near the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide formation decreases the availability of free carboxyl and amino groups necessary for metal coordination, hindering catalytic activity.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyl-L-lysine)
    - *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*
    - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid*

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that have **perfluoroalkyl groups attached to the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Perfluoroalkyl groups are strong electron-withdrawing substituents, reducing electron density on coordinating atoms and diminishing metal-ligand interactions.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages and terminal amino groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether linkages increase flexibility and distance between functional groups, reducing effective simultaneous coordination with the metal center.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy) incapable of metal coordination at the para position** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups increase electron density, reducing the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxyl group.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (P-Toluic acid)
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (Hydroxyl group not favorably positioned for coordination)

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) located more than four carbons away from the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Distant functional groups are less effective in coordinating simultaneously with the metal center, reducing catalyst efficiency.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that have **bulky substituents or sterically hindered structures near the coordination sites** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Steric hindrance can impede effective alignment and interaction with the metal center, diminishing catalytic performance.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Biaryl system introduces steric bulk)
    - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid* (Bulky methoxy groups)

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with multiple coordinating groups positioned to enable chelation without steric hindrance** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple coordinating groups enhance metal-ligand interactions, stabilizing the catalyst complex and improving activity.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*
    - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (L-Tryptophan)
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid* (Amide bond reduces coordination sites)

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **thiol-containing aliphatic carboxylic acids with the thiol group within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**, whereas **thiol-containing aromatic carboxylic acids** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: In aliphatic acids, proximal thiol and carboxyl groups can coordinate simultaneously with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity. In aromatic acids, resonance in the ring reduces thiol coordination effectiveness.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid* (3-Mercaptopropionic acid)
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* (Thiol group less effective due to aromatic resonance)

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino group (primary or secondary) within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The close proximity of the amino group to the carboxyl group facilitates effective chelation with metal centers, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst complex.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (L-Aspartic acid)
    - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (L-Glutamic acid)
    - *5-aminopentanoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexamples*:
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid* (Amino group too distant for effective chelation)
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid* (Functional group too far to coordinate effectively)

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., nitro, halogens) at the para position** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups enhance the acidity of the carboxyl group and improve its ability to coordinate with metal centers, strengthening the catalyst's performance.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *4-nitrobenzoic acid*
    - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (Methyl group is electron-donating, reducing coordination ability)

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with an amino group at the para position** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The amino group acts as an additional coordination site, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and catalyst efficiency.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid* (P-Aminobenzoic acid)
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (Lacks coordinating amino group)

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of coordinating with metal centers** predict a **high yield**, unless steric hindrance is significant.
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles provide effective coordination sites, strengthening the interaction with metal centers.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
    - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Steric hindrance due to bulky structure reduces coordination efficiency)

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Proximal hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites, enhancing chelation with the metal center and improving catalytic activity.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
    - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Hydroxyl group too distant for effective coordination)

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrocarbon chains (six or more carbons) and no other polar functional groups** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Long hydrophobic chains may improve substrate-catalyst interactions within hydrophobic regions, enhancing yield.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *Octanoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Presence of hydroxyl group disrupts hydrophobic interactions)

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde and ketone groups can form inactive complexes with metal centers or engage in side reactions, reducing catalyst effectiveness.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*
    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with amide bonds involving the carboxyl group or N-acetyl modifications near the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide formation decreases the availability of free carboxyl and amino groups necessary for metal coordination, hindering catalytic activity.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyl-L-lysine)
    - *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*
    - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid*

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that have **perfluoroalkyl groups attached to the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Perfluoroalkyl groups are strong electron-withdrawing substituents, reducing electron density on coordinating atoms and diminishing metal-ligand interactions.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages and terminal amino groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether linkages increase flexibility and distance between functional groups, reducing effective simultaneous coordination with the metal center.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy) incapable of metal coordination at the para position** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups increase electron density, reducing the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxyl group.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (P-Toluic acid)
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (Hydroxyl group not favorably positioned for coordination)

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) located more than four carbons away from the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Distant functional groups are less effective in coordinating simultaneously with the metal center, reducing catalyst efficiency.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that have **bulky substituents or sterically hindered structures near the coordination sites** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Steric hindrance can impede effective alignment and interaction with the metal center, diminishing catalytic performance.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Biaryl system introduces steric bulk)
    - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid* (Bulky methoxy groups)

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with multiple coordinating groups positioned to enable chelation without steric hindrance** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple coordinating groups enhance metal-ligand interactions, stabilizing the catalyst complex and improving activity.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*
    - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (L-Tryptophan)
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid* (Amide bond reduces coordination sites)

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **thiol-containing aliphatic carboxylic acids with the thiol group within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**, whereas **thiol-containing aromatic carboxylic acids** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: In aliphatic acids, proximal thiol and carboxyl groups can coordinate simultaneously with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity. In aromatic acids, resonance in the ring reduces thiol coordination effectiveness.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid* (3-Mercaptopropionic acid)
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* (Thiol group less effective due to aromatic resonance)

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- **Suggestion 1**: The SMARTS patterns in the code are overly specific and may not capture all modifiers that fit the natural language rules. For example, in **Rule 1**, the pattern `"[NX3;H2,H1][C][C][CX3](=O)[OX1H1]"` only matches molecules where the amino group is exactly three carbons away from the carboxyl group. To align with the rule, which states the amino group should be within three carbons, modify the pattern to allow for variable chain lengths up to three carbons, such as `"[NX3;H2,H1][$([C;X4])]{0,2}[CX3](=O)[OX1H1]"`.

- **Suggestion 2**: For rules involving distances between functional groups (e.g., **Rule 12**), use SMARTS patterns with variable-length chains to capture all relevant molecules. Replace fixed-length chains like `"[CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4]"` with a pattern like `"[CX4]{$([CX4])}{3,}"` to match chains with four or more carbons.

- **Suggestion 3**: In rules concerning substituents at specific positions on aromatic rings (e.g., **Rule 2** and **Rule 3**), ensure the SMARTS patterns account for different ring substitutions and positions. Use position-specific descriptors like `":1"` for ring numbering and wildcard atoms where appropriate. For example, modify **Rule 2**'s pattern to `"[cH1,cH0]1[cH1,cH0][cH1,cH0][cH1,cH0]([F,Cl,Br,I,N+](=O)[O-])[cH1,cH0][cH1,cH0]1C(=O)[O;H]"` to accurately capture para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups.

- **Suggestion 4**: For **Rule 6**, which involves aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrocarbon chains, the current pattern only matches a specific chain length. Adjust the pattern to match chains of six or more carbons by using repetition qualifiers, such as `"[CX3](=O)[OX1H1][CH2]{5,}[CH3]"`.

- **Suggestion 5**: Incorporate recursive SMARTS or logical operators to enhance pattern flexibility. For example, in **Rule 4**, to match heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms, use a more general pattern like `"[n,c]1[c,n][c,n][c,n][c,n][c,n]1C(=O)[O;H]"` to include various heterocycles without being overly restrictive.

- **Suggestion 6**: For **Rule 8**, the pattern `"[CX3](=O)[NX3][C]"` may inadvertently match amides not involving the carboxyl group of interest. Use atomic mapping or include the carboxyl group's oxygen atoms in the pattern to ensure accurate matches, such as `"[C:1](=O)[NX3][C]"`, where `[C:1](=O)` refers specifically to the carboxyl carbon.

- **Suggestion 7**: In **Rule 11**, to capture aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups incapable of metal coordination at the para position, expand the pattern to include various electron-donating groups and account for different ring substitutions. For example, use `"[c]1cc([CH3,OCH3,NH2])ccc1C(=O)[O;H]"`.

- **Suggestion 8**: For rules involving steric hindrance (**Rule 13**), define patterns that represent bulky groups more generally. Instead of specifying exact bulky substituents, use patterns like `"[CX3](=O)[OX1H1][CX4][C](C)(C)"` to match tertiary carbons near coordination sites.

- **Suggestion 9**: Implement negative look-ahead patterns to exclude molecules that should not match certain rules. For instance, in **Rule 6**, to exclude molecules with polar functional groups, use an exclude pattern like `"[CX3](=O)[OX1H1][C;!$(C[!#6;!#1])][CH2]{4,}[CH3]"`, ensuring no polar groups are attached to the chain.

- **Suggestion 10**: For **Rule 15**, which differentiates between aliphatic and aromatic thiol-containing carboxylic acids, ensure the patterns accurately reflect this distinction. Modify the aliphatic pattern to `"[SX2H][CX4][$([CX4])]{0,2}[CX3](=O)[OX1H1]"` and the aromatic pattern to `"[c]1[cH,c](c)[cH,c](c)[cH,c]([SX2H])[cH,c](c)1C(=O)[O;H]"` to capture the respective structures.

- **Suggestion 11**: Test each SMARTS pattern against both the provided high-yield examples and low-yield counterexamples to verify accuracy. Adjust the patterns based on whether the examples are correctly matched or not matched according to the rule's prediction.

- **Suggestion 12**: Utilize cheminformatics software or consult with experts to refine the SMARTS patterns further, ensuring they align closely with the natural language descriptions and cover all relevant molecular variations.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino group (primary or secondary) within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The close proximity of the amino group to the carboxyl group facilitates effective chelation with metal centers, enhancing the stability and reactivity of the catalyst complex.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (L-Aspartic acid)
    - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (L-Glutamic acid)
    - *5-aminopentanoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexamples*:
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid* (Amino group too distant for effective chelation)
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid* (Functional group too far to coordinate effectively)

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., nitro, halogens) at the para position** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups enhance the acidity of the carboxyl group and improve its ability to coordinate with metal centers, strengthening the catalyst's performance.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *4-nitrobenzoic acid*
    - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (Methyl group is electron-donating, reducing coordination ability)

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with an amino group at the para position** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The amino group acts as an additional coordination site, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and catalyst efficiency.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid* (P-Aminobenzoic acid)
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (Lacks coordinating amino group)

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of coordinating with metal centers** predict a **high yield**, unless steric hindrance is significant.
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles provide effective coordination sites, strengthening the interaction with metal centers.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
    - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Steric hindrance due to bulky structure reduces coordination efficiency)

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Proximal hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites, enhancing chelation with the metal center and improving catalytic activity.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
    - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Hydroxyl group too distant for effective coordination)

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrocarbon chains (six or more carbons) and no other polar functional groups** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Long hydrophobic chains may improve substrate-catalyst interactions within hydrophobic regions, enhancing yield.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *Octanoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Presence of hydroxyl group disrupts hydrophobic interactions)

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde and ketone groups can form inactive complexes with metal centers or engage in side reactions, reducing catalyst effectiveness.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*
    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with amide bonds involving the carboxyl group or N-acetyl modifications near the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide formation decreases the availability of free carboxyl and amino groups necessary for metal coordination, hindering catalytic activity.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyl-L-lysine)
    - *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*
    - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid*

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that have **perfluoroalkyl groups attached to the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Perfluoroalkyl groups are strong electron-withdrawing substituents, reducing electron density on coordinating atoms and diminishing metal-ligand interactions.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages and terminal amino groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether linkages increase flexibility and distance between functional groups, reducing effective simultaneous coordination with the metal center.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy) incapable of metal coordination at the para position** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups increase electron density, reducing the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxyl group.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (P-Toluic acid)
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (Hydroxyl group not favorably positioned for coordination)

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) located more than four carbons away from the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Distant functional groups are less effective in coordinating simultaneously with the metal center, reducing catalyst efficiency.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that have **bulky substituents or sterically hindered structures near the coordination sites** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Steric hindrance can impede effective alignment and interaction with the metal center, diminishing catalytic performance.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Biaryl system introduces steric bulk)
    - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid* (Bulky methoxy groups)

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with multiple coordinating groups positioned to enable chelation without steric hindrance** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Multiple coordinating groups enhance metal-ligand interactions, stabilizing the catalyst complex and improving activity.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*
    - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (L-Tryptophan)
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid* (Amide bond reduces coordination sites)

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **thiol-containing aliphatic carboxylic acids with the thiol group within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**, whereas **thiol-containing aromatic carboxylic acids** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: In aliphatic acids, proximal thiol and carboxyl groups can coordinate simultaneously with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity. In aromatic acids, resonance in the ring reduces thiol coordination effectiveness.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid* (3-Mercaptopropionic acid)
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* (Thiol group less effective due to aromatic resonance)

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- **Suggestion 1**: For **Rule 1**, the SMARTS patterns are too restrictive and do not match molecules like amino acids where the amino group and the carboxyl group are attached to the same carbon (alpha amino acids). Modify the SMARTS patterns to allow for amino groups directly attached to the same carbon as the carboxyl group or within three bonds, regardless of branching. Consider using a pattern like `[NX3;H2,H1][C;X4][CH2,CH,CH0][CX3](=O)[OX1H1]` and include recursive queries or adjust the patterns to account for different paths.

- **Suggestion 2**: For **Rule 1**, instead of fixed linear patterns, use SMARTS that captures any molecule where the amino group is within three carbons of the carboxyl group. You can use shortest path calculations or SMARTS with variable-length chains, such as `[NX3;H2,H1]@[#6][$([#6]@[#6])][CX3](=O)[OX1H1]` with a specified maximum path length.

- **Suggestion 3**: Implement a function to calculate the shortest path between the amino nitrogen and the carboxyl carbon in the molecule for **Rule 1**. If the shortest path is three atoms or fewer, the molecule should match the rule. This approach is more flexible and aligns better with the natural language description.

- **Suggestion 4**: For **Rule 4**, the SMARTS pattern `[n,c]1[c,n][c,n][c,n][c,n][c,n]1C(=O)[O;H]` may miss heteroaromatic rings larger than six members or with different substitution patterns. Modify the pattern to `[n,c]1[a][a][a][a][a]1C(=O)[O;H]` or more general to capture various heteroaromatic carboxylic acids. Ensure that steric hindrance is considered where appropriate.

- **Suggestion 5**: For **Rule 6**, the `exclude_patterns` in the code (`'[!#6;!#1]'`) may inadvertently exclude molecules that should match. Instead of excluding molecules with atoms other than C and H globally, adjust the pattern to specifically exclude only those functional groups not allowed by the rule. Alternatively, define the inclusion criteria more precisely.

- **Suggestion 6**: For **Rule 12**, the patterns may not account for all possible functional groups located more than four carbons away from the carboxyl group. Consider using a more general approach by calculating the shortest path between the functional group and the carboxyl group and checking if it exceeds four carbons.

- **Suggestion 7**: For **Rule 14**, ensure that the SMARTS pattern accounts for various orientations and positions of multiple coordinating groups on the aromatic ring without steric hindrance. The pattern `[c]1cc([OX2H,NX3H2])ccc1C(=O)[O;H]` may be limited; consider generalizing it to include other possible substitution patterns.

- **Suggestion 8**: Include unit tests or validation checks for each rule using the high yield examples and low yield counterexamples provided. This will help verify that the SMARTS patterns correctly match the intended molecules and adjust them if they do not.

- **Suggestion 9**: Review the use of `[CX3](=O)[OX1H1]` in patterns, which specifies a carboxylic acid group. Ensure that this pattern is correctly defined and recognized in all relevant rules, as any error here can affect multiple rules.

- **Suggestion 10**: For complex molecules, consider using more advanced features of RDKit, like molecular fingerprints or descriptors, along with SMARTS patterns, to capture the rules more effectively.

- **Suggestion 11**: In the code, ensure that the `Chem.MolFromSmarts` function is correctly compiling the SMARTS patterns without errors. Include error handling and logging to catch any patterns that fail to compile.

- **Suggestion 12**: Provide comments or documentation within the code explaining the rationale behind each SMARTS pattern. This will help collaborators understand the patterns and make necessary adjustments.

- **Suggestion 13**: For rules involving electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups (e.g., **Rule 2** and **Rule 11**), explicitly define these groups in the SMARTS patterns, possibly using predefined lists or patterns for common substituents.

- **Suggestion 14**: Consider using more general patterns where appropriate, and avoid over-specifying the patterns, which can lead to missing valid matches. Flexibility in the patterns can help capture more molecules that fit the natural language descriptions.

- **Suggestion 15**: Re-evaluate all SMARTS patterns to ensure they are neither too general (leading to false positives) nor too specific (leading to false negatives). Adjust the level of specificity based on the rule's intent and the examples provided.

- **Suggestion 16**: Collaborate with a cheminformatics specialist to refine the SMARTS patterns and ensure they align with chemical intuition and the natural language rules.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Quantify Functional Groups and Molecular Descriptors**  
  Revise the rules to focus on quantifiable molecular features that can be directly extracted from SMILES strings using cheminformatics tools. Replace qualitative descriptions with specific counts of functional groups or numerical values of molecular descriptors. For example:
  - Instead of "Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino group within three carbons of the carboxyl group," specify "Modifiers with a carboxylic acid group and an amino nitrogen atom within a three-atom path length from the carboxyl carbon."
  - Use counts of specific atoms (e.g., number of nitrogen atoms, oxygen atoms) or specific bonds (e.g., carbon-nitrogen single bonds) as features.

- **Advice 2**: **Define Structural Features Using SMARTS Patterns**  
  Utilize SMARTS (SMILES Arbitrary Target Specification) patterns to precisely define structural motifs associated with high or low yield. This allows for automated pattern recognition and numerical feature extraction. For instance:
  - High yield if the modifier contains the SMARTS pattern for amino acids: `NCC(=O)O`
  - Low yield if the modifier contains a ketone adjacent to a carboxyl group: `C(=O)C(=O)O`

- **Advice 3**: **Create Binary Features for Presence or Absence of Key Substructures**  
  Encode the presence or absence of key functional groups or substructures as binary features in the numeric matrix. For example:
  - Feature 1: Presence of electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halogens) on aromatic rings (1 if present, 0 if absent)
  - Feature 2: Presence of electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy) on aromatic rings

- **Advice 4**: **Incorporate Topological Descriptors and Molecular Properties**  
  Include numerical molecular descriptors that capture the topological and physicochemical properties influencing yield. Examples include:
  - Topological polar surface area (TPSA)
  - Molecular weight
  - Octanol-water partition coefficient (LogP)
  - Number of rotatable bonds

- **Advice 5**: **Simplify and Consolidate Redundant Rules**  
  Review the current rules for overlap and redundancy. Consolidate similar rules to reduce complexity and focus on the most impactful features. For instance:
  - Combine Rules 2, 3, and 14, which all relate to aromatic carboxylic acids with specific substituents, into a single rule with quantifiable parameters.
  - Clearly distinguish whether steric hindrance or electronic effects are the primary factors.

- **Advice 6**: **Prioritize Features Based on Statistical Correlation with Yield**  
  Perform statistical analysis to identify which molecular features most strongly correlate with high or low yield. Prioritize these features in the rule set. For example:
  - Use correlation coefficients to rank features.
  - Discard features that show minimal impact on yield.

- **Advice 7**: **Develop Continuous Quantitative Rules Where Possible**  
  Where appropriate, create rules that use continuous variables rather than categorical ones. This allows for more granular modeling of the relationship between molecular features and yield. For example:
  - Instead of a binary high/low yield prediction based on chain length, model yield as a function of the number of carbons in the hydrocarbon chain.
  - Express electronic effects quantitatively using Hammett sigma constants for substituents on aromatic rings.

- **Advice 8**: **Automate Feature Generation Using Molecular Fingerprints**  
  Utilize molecular fingerprinting methods (e.g., MACCS keys, Morgan fingerprints) to generate numerical representations of modifiers. These high-dimensional binary vectors capture the presence of various substructures and can be used in data-driven modeling.

- **Advice 9**: **Include Steric and Electronic Parameters Explicitly**  
  Quantify steric and electronic factors using established parameters such as Taft steric parameters or Fuki electronic indices. Incorporate these into the feature matrix to better model their effects on yield.

- **Advice 10**: **Leverage Machine Learning for Rule Refinement**  
  Use machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and relationships in the data that may not be evident through manual rule creation. This data-driven approach can complement and refine existing rules:
  - Train classification models (e.g., decision trees, random forests) on the numerical feature matrix and use feature importance scores to adjust rules.
  - Utilize unsupervised learning to cluster modifiers based on features and yields.

    - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Steric hindrance due to bulky structure reduces coordination efficiency)

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups** near the carboxyl group predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Proximal hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites, enhancing chelation with the metal center and improving catalytic activity.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
    - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Hydroxyl group too distant for effective coordination)

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrocarbon chains (six or more carbons) and no other polar functional groups** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Long hydrophobic chains may improve substrate-catalyst interactions within hydrophobic regions, enhancing yield.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *Octanoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexamples*:
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Presence of hydroxyl group disrupts hydrophobic interactions)
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid* (Polar amino group reduces hydrophobic interaction)

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids containing both aromatic and aliphatic components** with functional groups positioned to enable **chelation** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The combination of aromatic and aliphatic groups with coordinating functional groups enhances metal-ligand interactions.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid* (Hydroxy group on the aromatic ring and carboxyl group enable chelation)
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (Shorter aliphatic chain may not allow effective chelation)

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that have **carbonyl groups (aldehyde or ketone) adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde and ketone groups can interact with metal centers or participate in side reactions, reducing catalyst effectiveness.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*
    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with amide bonds involving the carboxyl group or N-acetyl modifications** near the carboxyl group predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide formation decreases the availability of free carboxyl and amino groups necessary for metal coordination, hindering catalytic activity.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyl-L-lysine)
    - *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that have **bulky substituents or sterically hindered structures near coordination sites** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Steric hindrance can impede effective alignment and interaction with the metal center, diminishing catalytic performance.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Biaryl system introduces steric bulk)
    - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid* (Bulky methoxy groups and ketone)

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) located more than four carbons away from the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Distant functional groups are less effective in coordinating simultaneously with the metal center, reducing catalyst efficiency.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that have **perfluoroalkyl groups attached to the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Perfluoroalkyl groups are strong electron-withdrawing substituents, reducing electron density on coordinating atoms and diminishing metal-ligand interactions.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages and terminal amino or hydroxyl groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether linkages increase flexibility and distance between functional groups, reducing effective simultaneous coordination with the metal center.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **thiol-containing aliphatic carboxylic acids with the thiol group within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**, whereas **thiol-containing aromatic carboxylic acids** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: In aliphatic acids, proximal thiol and carboxyl groups can coordinate simultaneously with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity. In aromatic acids, resonance in the ring reduces thiol coordination effectiveness.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid* (3-Mercaptopropionic acid)
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* (Thiol group less effective due to aromatic resonance)

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic amino acids** with the **amino group within three carbons** of the **carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The close proximity of the amino group to the carboxyl group allows for bidentate coordination with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (L-Aspartic acid)
    - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (L-Glutamic acid)
    - *5-aminopentanoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexamples*:
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid* (Amino group too distant for effective coordination)
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid* (Functional group too far to coordinate effectively)

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-withdrawing groups** (e.g., nitro, halogens) at the **para position** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group and enhance its ability to coordinate with metal centers, strengthening the catalyst's performance.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *4-nitrobenzoic acid*
    - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (Methyl group is electron-donating, reducing coordination ability)

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with an **amino group at the para position** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The amino group provides an additional coordination site, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and catalyst efficiency.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid* (P-Aminobenzoic acid)
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (Lacks coordinating amino group)

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids** containing **nitrogen atoms** capable of coordinating with metal centers predict a **high yield**, unless significant **steric hindrance** is present.
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles provide effective coordination sites, strengthening interactions with metal centers.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
    - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Steric hindrance due to bulky structure reduces coordination efficiency)

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups** near the carboxyl group predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Proximal hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites, enhancing chelation with the metal center and improving catalytic activity.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
    - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Hydroxyl group too distant for effective coordination)

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrocarbon chains (six or more carbons) and no other polar functional groups** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Long hydrophobic chains may improve substrate-catalyst interactions within hydrophobic regions, enhancing yield.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *Octanoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexamples*:
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Presence of hydroxyl group disrupts hydrophobic interactions)
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid* (Polar amino group reduces hydrophobic interaction)

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids containing both aromatic and aliphatic components** with functional groups positioned to enable **chelation** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The combination of aromatic and aliphatic groups with coordinating functional groups enhances metal-ligand interactions.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid* (Hydroxy group on the aromatic ring and carboxyl group enable chelation)
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (Shorter aliphatic chain may not allow effective chelation)

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that have **carbonyl groups (aldehyde or ketone) adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde and ketone groups can interact with metal centers or participate in side reactions, reducing catalyst effectiveness.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*
    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with amide bonds involving the carboxyl group or N-acetyl modifications** near the carboxyl group predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide formation decreases the availability of free carboxyl and amino groups necessary for metal coordination, hindering catalytic activity.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyl-L-lysine)
    - *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that have **bulky substituents or sterically hindered structures near coordination sites** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Steric hindrance can impede effective alignment and interaction with the metal center, diminishing catalytic performance.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Biaryl system introduces steric bulk)
    - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid* (Bulky methoxy groups and ketone)

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) located more than four carbons away from the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Distant functional groups are less effective in coordinating simultaneously with the metal center, reducing catalyst efficiency.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that have **perfluoroalkyl groups attached to the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Perfluoroalkyl groups are strong electron-withdrawing substituents, reducing electron density on coordinating atoms and diminishing metal-ligand interactions.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages and terminal amino or hydroxyl groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether linkages increase flexibility and distance between functional groups, reducing effective simultaneous coordination with the metal center.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **thiol-containing aliphatic carboxylic acids with the thiol group within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**, whereas **thiol-containing aromatic carboxylic acids** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: In aliphatic acids, proximal thiol and carboxyl groups can coordinate simultaneously with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity. In aromatic acids, resonance in the ring reduces thiol coordination effectiveness.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid* (3-Mercaptopropionic acid)
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* (Thiol group less effective due to aromatic resonance)

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: Correct the SMARTS patterns in the code to be valid and accurately reflect the natural language rules. For instance, in Rule 2, the '>>' operator is invalid in SMARTS patterns and should be removed. The 'carboxylic_acid' pattern should be corrected to '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]' to match carboxylic acids properly.
- ** Suggestion 2 **: For Rule 2, to detect electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position on an aromatic ring, the code needs to correctly identify substituents at specific positions. Implement a method to map the positions on the aromatic ring and check for EWGs at the para position relative to the carboxyl group.
- ** Suggestion 3 **: Update the SMARTS patterns for EWG recognition to include common electron-withdrawing groups. For example, '[NX3+(=O)[O-]]' for nitro groups and '[F,Cl,Br,I]' for halogens.
- ** Suggestion 4 **: For Rule 3, similarly, the code should detect amino groups at the para position on aromatic carboxylic acids. Implement position mapping on the aromatic ring to check for amino groups at the para position relative to the carboxyl group.
- ** Suggestion 5 **: For Rule 4, adjust the SMARTS pattern for heteroaromatic rings containing coordinating nitrogen atoms. The current pattern may not match all relevant heteroaromatic carboxylic acids. Use more general patterns like '[nH]1cccc1' to include different heteroaromatic systems.
- ** Suggestion 6 **: For Rule 6, generalize the pattern to match aliphatic carboxylic acids with chains of six or more carbons. Use a pattern like '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CX4]CCCC[CX4]', where the chain length is adjustable, or implement a check on the number of carbons in the chain.
- ** Suggestion 7 **: Implement a more accurate method to check for steric hindrance in Rule 4 and Rule 10. Instead of relying on SMARTS patterns alone, consider using molecular descriptors or calculating the steric bulk of substituents near coordination sites.
- ** Suggestion 8 **: For rules involving distances between functional groups (e.g., Rule 1 and Rule 14), ensure that the distances are correctly calculated using atom indices and bond counts in the molecular graph. Verify that the paths account for all possible routes between functional groups.
- ** Suggestion 9 **: Utilize RDKit's advanced functionalities for substructure matching, such as atom mapping and recursive SMARTS patterns, to improve the accuracy of pattern matching, especially for positional isomers and substituted rings.
- ** Suggestion 10 **: Thoroughly test each rule with known high-yield and low-yield examples and counterexamples to validate the code's accuracy. Adjust the patterns and logic based on these tests to ensure that the code aligns with the intended natural language rules.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

Upon reviewing the current rule metrics in comparison to the reference metrics, several key observations emerge. Focusing on the confidence and lift values, we can assess the effectiveness of the current rules and consider potential improvements.

---

**1. Support**

- **Current Train Support**: **0.0076** (0.76%)
- **Reference Train Support**: [0.1667 (16.67%), 0.1845 (18.45%)]

*Comment*: The current rules have a significantly lower support compared to the reference metrics. With only 0.76% of the training data covered, the rules are too specific and apply to a very small subset of the dataset. This low support suggests that the rules may not generalize well and could miss important patterns present in the data.

---

**2. Confidence**

- **Current Train Confidence**: **0.5048** (50.48%)
- **Reference Train Confidence**: [0.5396 (53.96%), 0.6352 (63.52%)]

*Comment*: The confidence of the current rules is slightly below the lower bound of the reference metrics. A confidence of 50.48% indicates that, when the rule conditions are met, there is just over a 50% chance that the prediction (high yield) is correct. This decrease in confidence compared to previous iterations suggests that the current rules are less reliable in making accurate predictions.

---

**3. Lift**

- **Current Train Lift**: **1.0074**
- **Reference Train Lift**: [1.0559, 1.2048]

*Comment*: The lift value of approximately 1.0074 is very close to 1, indicating that the presence of the rule conditions does not significantly increase the likelihood of a high yield compared to random chance. In previous iterations, the lift values ranged from 1.0559 to 1.2048, demonstrating a stronger association between the rule conditions and the prediction. The current lift suggests that the rules have minimal impact on improving predictive power.

---

**4. Leverage**

- **Current Train Leverage**: **0.00076**
- **Reference Train Leverage**: [-0.0041, 0.0289]

*Comment*: The leverage is positive but close to zero, indicating minimal additional support for the rule over what would be expected by chance. Previous leverage values included higher positive values, reflecting stronger associations. The low leverage reinforces the notion that the current rules are not significantly contributing to predicting high yields.

---

**Overall Assessment**

The current rules show a decline in performance across all key metrics:

- **Support**: Drastically reduced, indicating over-specialization and limited applicability.
- **Confidence**: Slightly lower than previous iterations, suggesting reduced reliability.
- **Lift**: Approximately equal to 1, implying no substantial improvement over random guessing.
- **Leverage**: Minimal, showing negligible association strength.

These metrics indicate that the current rules may have become too narrow or specific, failing to capture broader patterns necessary for effective prediction.

---

**Assessment of Iterations and Local Minimum**

Given that successive iterations have led to diminishing performance metrics, it is plausible that the current approach is converging to a local minimum. The iterations may have over-fitted the rules to accommodate exceptions or rare cases, thereby reducing their general effectiveness. It appears that sufficient iterations have occurred to reach this point, suggesting a need to reconsider the strategy for rule development.

---

**Recommendations for Improving the Current Rules**

1. **Broaden Rule Conditions**

   - **Action**: Relax overly strict or narrow conditions in the rules to increase support. Consider combining similar rules or identifying core features common to high-yield modifiers.
   - **Rationale**: Increasing support will help the rules apply to a larger portion of the dataset, enhancing generalizability and potentially improving confidence and lift.

2. **Focus on High-Impact Features**

   - **Action**: Identify structural features or functional groups that have shown strong positive associations with high yields in previous iterations. Emphasize these features in the rules.
   - **Rationale**: Leveraging features with established predictive power can improve confidence and lift, making the rules more effective.

3. **Simplify and Consolidate Rules**

   - **Action**: Reduce the complexity of the rules by eliminating redundant or overlapping conditions. Merge rules that predict similar outcomes based on related features.
   - **Rationale**: Simplified rules tend to perform better due to reduced overfitting and increased interpretability.

4. **Reevaluate Low-Yield Predictions**

   - **Action**: Examine the rules that predict low yields to ensure they are not excessively penalizing modifiers with potential. Adjust conditions that may be unnecessarily excluding high-performing modifiers.
   - **Rationale**: Reducing false negatives can improve overall performance metrics, particularly confidence and lift.

5. **Incorporate Domain Knowledge**

   - **Action**: Consult chemical literature or subject matter experts to validate the chemical rationale behind the rules. Ensure that the rules align with known principles of catalysis and coordination chemistry.
   - **Rationale**: Grounding rules in established chemical knowledge can enhance their validity and effectiveness.

6. **Implement Cross-Validation**

   - **Action**: Use cross-validation techniques to test the rules on different subsets of data. This can help assess their robustness and prevent overfitting to the training data.
   - **Rationale**: Ensuring that the rules perform well across various data splits will increase confidence in their predictive capabilities.

7. **Adjust Weighting of Metrics**

   - **Action**: Prioritize lift and confidence over support during rule development. Accept lower support if it results in significantly higher lift and confidence, as long as the rules remain applicable to a reasonable portion of the data.
   - **Rationale**: High lift and confidence are more indicative of strong predictive rules, even if they cover fewer instances.

8. **Explore Alternative Rule Induction Methods**

   - **Action**: Consider using different algorithms or methodologies for rule extraction, such as decision trees or association rule mining techniques that optimize for lift and confidence.
   - **Rationale**: Alternative methods may uncover patterns not detected by the current approach, leading to improved rules.

9. **Monitor for Overfitting**

   - **Action**: Be cautious of rules that are too specific to the training data. Introduce constraints to prevent the inclusion of overly specific conditions that do not generalize.
   - **Rationale**: Overfitting reduces the model's ability to perform well on unseen data, negatively impacting confidence and lift in practical applications.

10. **Iterate with Strategic Adjustments**

    - **Action**: Make informed changes based on metric feedback, focusing on rules that have the potential for improvement. Avoid random or exhaustive searches that may not yield beneficial results.
    - **Rationale**: Targeted iterations are more likely to enhance rule performance efficiently.

---

**Conclusion**

The current iteration of rules shows reduced performance, indicating that the rules may be too narrowly defined and not effectively capturing the relationships between modifiers and high yields. To improve the rules:

- **Broaden** the scope of rules to increase support.
- **Emphasize** high-impact features to enhance confidence and lift.
- **Simplify** rules to avoid overfitting and improve generalizability.
- **Align** rules with chemical principles to ensure validity.
- **Validate** using cross-validation to assess robustness.

By implementing these recommendations, future iterations can aim to develop more effective rules that provide stronger predictive power, thereby enhancing the overall success of the research program.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Revise Rule 4 to Include Flexible Heteroaromatic Carboxylic Acids with Nitrogen Atoms**

  - *Modification*: Adjust Rule 4 to consider not just the presence of steric hindrance but also the flexibility of the molecule. Include heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms even if they have bulky groups, provided they possess flexible linkers that allow effective coordination.
  - *Implementation*: Modify Rule 4 to read:

    > **Rule 4 Revised**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids** containing **nitrogen atoms** capable of coordinating with metal centers predict a **high yield**, especially if molecular flexibility allows effective coordination despite steric bulk.

  - *Rationale*: This adjustment accounts for compounds like **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**, which, despite potential steric hindrance, yields high results due to its flexible aliphatic linker facilitating coordination.

- **Advice 2**: **Add a New Rule for Amino Acids with Aromatic Side Chains Predicting High Yield**

  - *New Rule*:

    > **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with aromatic side chains** (e.g., indole, phenol groups) within **three carbons** of the **carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
    >
    > - *Rationale*: The presence of both amino and aromatic groups close to the carboxyl group allows for multiple coordination sites, enhancing catalyst performance.
    > - *High Yield Examples*:
    >   - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (L-Tryptophan)
    >   - *(2S)-2-amino-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (L-Tyrosine)

  - *Implementation*: Introduce Rule 15 to cover compounds like L-Tryptophan and L-Tyrosine, which are not currently addressed by existing rules.

- **Advice 3**: **Refine Rule 10 to Account for Bulky Substituents That Do Not Impede Coordination**

  - *Modification*: Specify in Rule 10 that bulky substituents predict low yield **only when they are proximal enough to obstruct coordination sites**.
  - *Implementation*: Modify Rule 10 to read:

    > **Rule 10 Revised**: Modifiers that have **bulky substituents or sterically hindered structures near coordination sites** that **directly impede metal coordination** predict a **low yield**.
    >
    > - *Rationale*: Bulky groups distant from coordination sites may not hinder catalyst performance. For example, compounds where bulky substituents are separated by flexible linkers can still coordinate effectively.
    > - *High Yield Example*:
    >   - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid* (Bulky groups do not impede coordination due to molecular flexibility)

  - *Rationale*: This refinement allows inclusion of compounds like **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**, which have bulky groups but still exhibit high yield.

- **Advice 4**: **Introduce a Rule for Cyclic Carboxylic Acids Capable of Chelation**

  - *New Rule*:

    > **Rule 16**: Modifiers that are **cyclic carboxylic acids** (e.g., lactones, cyclic anhydrides) with oxygen or nitrogen atoms in the ring capable of coordinating with metal centers predict a **high yield**.
    >
    > - *Rationale*: Cyclic structures with heteroatoms can act as chelating agents, stabilizing the metal center and enhancing catalytic activity.
    > - *High Yield Example*:
    >   - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*

  - *Implementation*: Add Rule 16 to cover compounds like **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**, which are not addressed by existing rules.

- **Advice 5**: **Expand Rule 2 to Include Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Electron-Donating Groups That Facilitate Chelation**

  - *Modification*: Broaden Rule 2 to encompass electron-donating groups (e.g., hydroxyl, methoxy) at positions that enable chelation without significantly reducing acidity.
  - *Implementation*: Modify Rule 2 to read:

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **short-chain aliphatic amino acids** with the **amino group within two carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The close proximity of the amino and carboxyl groups enables effective bidentate coordination with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (L-Aspartic acid)
    - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (L-Glutamic acid)
  - *Low Yield Counterexamples*:

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with an **amino group at the para position** predict a **high yield**, whereas those with **alkyl or hydroxy groups** at the same position predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The amino group provides an additional coordination site, enhancing metal-ligand interactions. Alkyl and hydroxy groups are less effective in metal coordination and may not enhance catalytic activity.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid* (p-Aminobenzoic acid)
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (Lacks coordinating amino group)
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (Hydroxy group less effective for coordination)

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids** containing **nitrogen atoms capable of coordinating** with metal centers predict a **high yield**, unless significant **steric hindrance** is present.
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles act as effective coordination sites, strengthening interactions with metal centers and enhancing catalytic performance.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups** near the **carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Proximal hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites through chelation, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and improving catalytic activity.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
    - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*

  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid* (3-Mercaptopropionic acid)
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* (Thiol group on aromatic ring less effective due to resonance stabilization)

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** (six or more carbons) with **no other polar functional groups** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Long hydrophobic chains may enhance substrate-catalyst interactions within hydrophobic regions of the catalytic system, improving yield.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *Octanoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexamples*:
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Polar hydroxyl group disrupts hydrophobic interactions)
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid* (Amino group introduces polarity, reducing hydrophobic interaction)

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that contain **carbonyl groups (aldehyde or ketone) adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.

    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*
    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that have **perfluoroalkyl groups** attached to the **carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Perfluoroalkyl groups are strong electron-withdrawing substituents, significantly reducing electron density on coordinating atoms and weakening metal-ligand interactions.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **ether linkages** and **terminal amino or hydroxyl groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether linkages increase molecular flexibility and distance between functional groups, reducing the ability to coordinate effectively with metal centers.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that have **amide bonds involving the carboxyl group** or **N-acetyl modifications** near the carboxyl group predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide formation decreases the availability of free carboxyl and amino groups necessary for effective metal coordination, hindering catalytic activity.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyl-L-lysine)
    - *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **bulky substituents** or **sterically hindered structures** near potential coordination sites predict a **low yield**.

  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Biaryl system introduces steric bulk)
    - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid* (Bulky methoxy groups and ketone)

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **polar functional groups** (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) located more than **four carbons away** from the **carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Distant polar functional groups are less effective in simultaneous coordination with the metal center and may interfere with hydrophobic interactions.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-rich aromatic systems** and **electron-donating groups** (other than amino) at positions that do not assist in coordination predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-rich aromatics may not favor coordination due to decreased acidity of the carboxyl group, and electron-donating groups can hinder effective metal-ligand interactions.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (Hydroxy group does not aid coordination)

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids** where the **heteroatom is unable to coordinate effectively** due to **steric hindrance** or **electron delocalization** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ineffective coordination with the metal center diminishes catalyst activity and overall yield.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Rigid structure limits coordination flexibility)

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Translate Qualitative Rules into SMARTS Patterns for Automated Feature Extraction**

  - *Implementation*: Convert each rule's descriptive criteria into SMARTS (SMiles ARbitrary Target Specification) patterns. SMARTS patterns allow for the precise definition of molecular substructures and can be directly applied to SMILES strings using cheminformatics tools like RDKit.
  
  - *Example*: For Rule 2, instead of stating "Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position," define a SMARTS pattern that captures an aromatic ring with a carboxylic acid group and an electron-withdrawing group (e.g., nitro, halogens) at the para position.

- **Advice 2**: **Standardize Functional Group Definitions and Create a Comprehensive List**

  - *Implementation*: Establish a standardized list of functional groups and substituents with their corresponding electronic effects (electron-withdrawing or electron-donating). This facilitates consistent identification and categorization of modifiers.
  
  - *Example*: Create dictionaries for electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., NO₂, Cl, Br) and electron-donating groups (e.g., OH, NH₂, CH₃), which can be programmatically matched to positions on aromatic rings.

- **Advice 3**: **Quantify Structural Features for Numerical Representation**

  - *Implementation*: Assign numerical values to structural features mentioned in the rules. This includes counts of specific atoms or functional groups, distances between functional groups (in terms of bond counts), and molecular descriptors like logP (octanol-water partition coefficient) and pKa.
  
  - *Example*: For Rule 7, instead of "long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (six or more carbons)," define a feature as "Aliphatic chain length ≥ 6 carbons," which can be extracted as an integer value for each modifier.

- **Advice 4**: **Eliminate Redundancies and Merge Overlapping Rules**

  - *Implementation*: Review existing rules to identify and combine overlapping criteria, simplifying the rule set and reducing complexity.
  
  - *Example*: Rules 12, 14, and 15 all address low yields associated with steric hindrance or electron-rich aromatic systems. Merge these into a single rule focusing on modifiers with sterically hindered or electron-donating substituents that reduce coordination efficiency.

- **Advice 5**: **Incorporate Molecular Descriptors and Computational Chemistry Data**

  - *Implementation*: Utilize computed molecular descriptors such as topological polar surface area (TPSA), molecular weight, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and aromaticity indexes. These descriptors can enhance the feature matrix and improve predictive modeling.
  
  - *Example*: Calculate the TPSA for each modifier to assess its potential for coordinating with metal centers, as higher TPSA may correlate with increased interaction sites.

- **Advice 6**: **Implement Binary Feature Encoding for Presence or Absence of Key Functional Groups**

  - *Implementation*: Create binary features indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of specific functional groups or substructures relevant to the catalytic activity.
  
  - *Example*: Features could include "Has amino group within two carbons of carboxyl group," "Has para electron-withdrawing group on aromatic ring," or "Contains heteroaromatic nitrogen capable of coordination."

- **Advice 7**: **Use Hierarchical Rule Structuring for Clarity and Scalability**

  - *Implementation*: Organize rules in a hierarchical manner, starting with broad categories and refining with specific criteria. This approach aids in the systematic analysis and ensures all potential modifiers are adequately covered.
  
  - *Example*: Begin with the distinction between aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids, then subdivide based on the presence of additional coordinating groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, thiol).

- **Advice 8**: **Employ Cheminformatics Tools for Automated Feature Extraction**

  - *Implementation*: Utilize cheminformatics libraries such as RDKit to automate the extraction of features from SMILES strings based on the updated rules. This ensures consistency and efficiency in generating the numerical feature matrix.
  
  - *Example*: Write scripts that parse SMILES strings to identify substructures matching the SMARTS patterns defined in Advice 1.

- **Advice 9**: **Define Clear Criteria for Electron-Withdrawing and Electron-Donating Groups**

  - *Implementation*: Establish quantitative parameters (e.g., Hammett sigma constants) to classify substituents as electron-withdrawing or electron-donating, which can be included as numerical features.
  
  - *Example*: Assign numerical values based on substituent constants and include them in the feature matrix to represent the electronic effects quantitatively.

- **Advice 10**: **Adjust Rules to Focus on Measurable Distances Between Functional Groups**

  - *Implementation*: Specify the exact number of atoms between coordinating groups, which can be directly calculated from molecular structures.
  
  - *Example*: Modify Rule 6 to state "Modifiers with a thiol group exactly three atoms away from the carboxyl carbon," allowing for precise identification and feature extraction.

- **Advice 11**: **Simplify Complex Structural Descriptions into Quantifiable Features**

  - *Implementation*: Break down complex rules involving multiple functional groups into individual features that can be counted or measured.
  
  - *Example*: For Rule 5, instead of "multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group," define features like "Number of hydroxyl groups within three bonds of the carboxyl carbon."

- **Advice 12**: **Reclassify and Update Rules Based on Data Patterns**

  - *Implementation*: Analyze the dataset to identify patterns or exceptions not captured by current rules, and adjust the rules accordingly.
  
  - *Example*: If certain modifiers with unexpected yields are observed, revise the rules to account for these anomalies, ensuring that the rules align closely with empirical data.

- **Advice 13**: **Integrate Steric Hindrance Quantification**

  - *Implementation*: Include steric parameters such as molar refractivity or Sterimol parameters to evaluate the impact of bulky substituents quantitatively.
  
  - *Example*: Calculate the molar refractivity for modifiers to quantify steric bulk and include this as a numerical feature in the dataset.

- **Advice 14**: **Ensure Mutual Exclusivity and Collective Exhaustiveness of Rules**

  - *Implementation*: Refine the rules so that each modifier fits into one category, avoiding overlaps that could cause confusion in feature assignment.
  
  - *Example*: Adjust rules to eliminate cases where a modifier could satisfy both a high-yield and a low-yield rule, specifying priority rules if necessary.

- **Advice 15**: **Create a Feature Matrix Compatible with Machine Learning Models**

  - *Implementation*: Structure the extracted features into a matrix format suitable for input into machine learning algorithms, facilitating the development of predictive models.
  
  - *Example*: Compile all numerical and binary features into a Pandas DataFrame, with each row representing a modifier and each column representing a feature, ready for model training.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **ether linkages** and **terminal polar groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether linkages increase molecular flexibility and distance between functional groups, reducing effective coordination with metal centers.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that have **amide bonds involving the carboxyl group** or **N-acetyl modifications** near the **carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide formation decreases the availability of free carboxyl and amino groups necessary for effective metal coordination, hindering catalytic activity.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyl-L-Lysine)
    - *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **bulky substituents** directly attached to the aromatic ring predict a **low yield** due to **steric hindrance** affecting coordination.
  - *Rationale*: Bulky groups near coordinating sites can impede effective alignment and interaction with the metal center, reducing catalytic performance.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Bulky bipyridine structure introduces steric hindrance)
  - *High Yield Counterexample*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid* (Additional methylene group reduces steric hindrance, allowing better coordination)

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **polar functional groups** (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) located more than **four carbons away** from the **carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Distant polar functional groups are less effective in coordination with the metal center and may disrupt hydrophobic interactions crucial for catalyst performance.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that have **multiple functional groups** capable of **intramolecular interactions** (e.g., hydrogen bonding), leading to **conformational constraints** and hindering coordination with metal centers, predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Intramolecular interactions can reduce the availability of functional groups for metal coordination, diminishing catalyst activity.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid* (Complex amino acid derivative with potential intramolecular hydrogen bonding)
    - *4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid* (Trifluoroacetyl group may engage in intramolecular interactions)

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and well-supported by multiple data points. It accurately predicts high yield for short-chain aliphatic amino acids with the amino group adjacent to the carboxyl group. The rationale provides strong physical-chemical insight into bidentate coordination enhancing catalyst reactivity. This rule effectively balances complexity and coverage, considering specific functional group arrangements.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear in its prediction that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position yield high results. The property insight regarding increased acidity and enhanced coordination ability is sound. The rule has good coverage with supporting data points and appropriately considers combinations of functional groups, achieving a balance between complexity and applicability.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 effectively differentiates modifiers based on the presence of amino groups versus electron-donating groups on aromatic carboxylic acids. The rule is clear, with a logical rationale about how functional groups influence metal-ligand interactions. It is supported by multiple data points and balances complexity by considering both the type and position of substituents.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 clearly identifies that heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating nitrogen atoms and minimal steric hindrance predict high yield. The rationale is strong, focusing on nitrogen atoms enhancing coordination. Supported by several data points, the rule considers both electronic and steric factors, providing adequate complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 distinguishes between high and low yield modifiers among long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids based on the presence and position of polar functional groups. It is clear and well-supported by data. The property insight into hydrophobic interactions and coordination efficiency is valid, and the rule effectively balances complexity and coverage by considering chain length and functional group positioning.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear in predicting high yield for aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group. The rationale about chelation enhancing catalytic activity is sound. However, the coverage is somewhat limited, with fewer data points supporting the rule, which may affect its general applicability.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 predicts high yield for modifiers with a thiol group within three carbons of the carboxyl group. The rule is clear, and the rationale regarding simultaneous coordination is valid. Coverage is limited to two data points, which suggests the need for more data to strengthen the rule's applicability.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 addresses modifiers with hydroxyl or methoxy groups positioned to assist in coordination. While the rule is clear and provides sound property insight, the complexity increases due to positional considerations. The coverage is moderate, with supporting data points that help balance complexity and applicability.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 clearly predicts low yield for modifiers with carbonyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group due to potential side reactions or coordination interference. It is well-supported by multiple data points and offers solid property insight. The rule maintains a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 predicts low yield for modifiers with perfluoroalkyl groups attached to the carboxyl group. While the property insight is valid, the coverage is limited to a single data point, which reduces the robustness of the rule and suggests the need for additional data to confirm its generality.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear in predicting low yield for aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages and terminal polar groups. The rationale about molecular flexibility affecting coordination is sound. However, coverage is limited, and more data points would strengthen the rule's applicability.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 deals with modifiers having amide bonds involving the carboxyl group or N-acetyl modifications predicting low yield. The clarity and property insight are good, focusing on decreased availability of coordination sites. Coverage is limited to two examples, indicating that additional data would be beneficial.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 predicts low yield for aromatic carboxylic acids with bulky substituents due to steric hindrance. The rule is clear and rational, but coverage is limited to two data points. While it considers important steric factors, more supporting data would enhance its applicability.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 effectively outlines that long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with distant polar functional groups predict low yield. The rule is clear and well-supported by multiple data points. It provides strong property insight and achieves a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 addresses modifiers with multiple functional groups leading to intramolecular interactions that hinder coordination. While the property insight is valid, the rule is complex, and coverage is limited. This may affect its general applicability, and additional data points could strengthen the rule.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **short-chain aliphatic amino acids** with the **amino group attached to the α-carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The close proximity of the amino and carboxyl groups allows for effective bidentate coordination with metal centers, enhancing catalyst reactivity through chelation.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (L-Aspartic acid)
    - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (L-Glutamic acid)
    - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (L-Tryptophan)
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyl-L-Lysine; acetylation reduces coordination sites)

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-withdrawing groups** (e.g., **nitro**, **bromomethyl**) at the **para position** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers and improving catalyst performance.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *4-nitrobenzoic acid*
    - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (Methyl group is electron-donating, reducing coordination ability)

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with an **amino group at the para position** predict a **high yield**; those with **electron-donating groups** like **alkyl** or **hydroxy** groups at positions that do not assist in coordination predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The amino group provides an additional coordination site, enhancing metal-ligand interactions. Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening coordination.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid* (p-Aminobenzoic acid)
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (Electron-donating methyl group)
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (Hydroxy group not positioned for effective coordination)

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids** containing **nitrogen atoms capable of coordinating with metal centers** and exhibit **minimal steric hindrance** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles act as additional coordination sites, strengthening interactions with metal centers and enhancing catalytic performance.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
    - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid* (Chelidamic acid)
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Steric hindrance due to bulky bipyridine structure reduces coordination efficiency)

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** (six or more carbons) with **no polar functional groups** predict a **high yield**; those with **polar groups distant from the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Nonpolar chains enhance hydrophobic interactions within the catalytic system, improving substrate access to active sites. Distant polar groups do not effectively participate in coordination and may disrupt these interactions.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *Octanoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid* (Amino group too distant for effective coordination)
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid* (Amino group introduces polarity far from the carboxyl group)
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Hydroxyl group too distant from carboxyl group)

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups** near the **carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Adjacent hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites through chelation, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and catalytic activity.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
    - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Single hydroxyl group too distant for effective coordination)

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with a **thiol group within three carbons** of the **carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The thiol and carboxyl groups can coordinate simultaneously with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and activity through chelation.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid* (3-Mercaptopropionic acid)
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* (Thiol group on aromatic ring may not coordinate effectively due to aromatic stabilization)

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aromatic or aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **hydroxyl or methoxy groups** positioned to assist in coordination predict a **high yield**; if these groups are too distant or hindered, they predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Hydroxyl and methoxy groups can serve as additional coordination sites when in proximity to the carboxyl group.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid* (Hydroxy group can assist in coordination)
    - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid* (Methoxy groups near coordinating sites)
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (Hydroxyphenyl group too distant from carboxyl group for effective coordination)

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that contain **carbonyl groups (aldehyde or ketone) adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield** due to potential side reactions or interference with coordination.
  - *Rationale*: Carbonyl groups can engage in side reactions or compete with the carboxyl group for metal coordination, reducing catalyst effectiveness.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*
    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that have **perfluoroalkyl groups** attached to the **carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Perfluoroalkyl groups are strongly electron-withdrawing, significantly reducing electron density on coordinating atoms and weakening metal-ligand interactions.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **ether linkages** and **terminal polar groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether linkages increase molecular flexibility and distance between functional groups, reducing effective coordination with metal centers.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that have **amide bonds involving the carboxyl group** or **N-acetyl modifications** near the **carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide formation decreases the availability of free carboxyl and amino groups necessary for effective metal coordination, hindering catalytic activity.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyl-L-Lysine)
    - *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **bulky substituents** directly attached to the aromatic ring predict a **low yield** due to **steric hindrance** affecting coordination.
  - *Rationale*: Bulky groups near coordinating sites can impede effective alignment and interaction with the metal center, reducing catalytic performance.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Bulky bipyridine structure introduces steric hindrance)
  - *High Yield Counterexample*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid* (Additional methylene group reduces steric hindrance, allowing better coordination)

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **polar functional groups** (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) located more than **four carbons away** from the **carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Distant polar functional groups are less effective in coordination with the metal center and may disrupt hydrophobic interactions crucial for catalyst performance.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that have **multiple functional groups** capable of **intramolecular interactions** (e.g., hydrogen bonding), leading to **conformational constraints** and hindering coordination with metal centers, predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Intramolecular interactions can reduce the availability of functional groups for metal coordination, diminishing catalyst activity.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid* (Complex amino acid derivative with potential intramolecular hydrogen bonding)
    - *4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid* (Trifluoroacetyl group may engage in intramolecular interactions)

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: **For Rule 1**, the SMARTS patterns are too restrictive and do not match the target amino acids. Modify the patterns to generalize the amino acid backbone. Use a pattern like `[NX3;H2][CX4H][CX3](=O)[OX1H]` to match a primary amine (`[NX3;H2]`) attached to the alpha-carbon (`[CX4H]`), which is adjacent to a carboxyl group (`[CX3](=O)[OX1H]`). This will correctly identify amino acids like L-Aspartic acid and L-Glutamic acid.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: **For Rule 2**, the current patterns do not specifically target electron-withdrawing groups at the **para position**. Refine the SMARTS to ensure the electron-withdrawing group is at the para position relative to the carboxyl group. Use a pattern like `c1cc([$(N(=O)=O),$(CBr)])ccc1C(=O)O` to match a benzene ring with a nitro or bromomethyl group at the para position to the carboxyl group.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: **For Rule 3**, expand the patterns to include aromatic carboxylic acids with an amino group at the para position. Use `c1ccc(cc1[NH2])C(=O)O` to capture para-aminobenzoic acid. For low-yield modifiers, ensure patterns like `c1ccc(cc1C)C(=O)O` (alkyl groups) and `c1ccc(cc1O)C(=O)O` (hydroxy groups) are correctly identified, paying attention to the position of the substituents.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: **For Rule 4**, modify the patterns to accurately reflect heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating nitrogen atoms. Use patterns like `n1cccc1C(=O)O` for nicotinic acid and `n1nccc1C(=O)O` for pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid. Ensure that steric hindrance is accounted for by identifying bulky substituents that may interfere with coordination.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: **For Rule 5**, the pattern should match any long-chain (six or more carbons) aliphatic carboxylic acid without polar functional groups. Use a more general pattern like `CCCCCCC(=O)O` to match octanoic acid. For low-yield modifiers, ensure that patterns like `CCCCCCC[NH2]` (amino group distant from carboxyl) and `CCCCCCCO` (hydroxyl group distant from carboxyl) are correctly identified.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: **For Rule 6**, adjust the pattern to match aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group. Use a pattern like `OC[C@@H](O)[C@@H](O)[C@@H](O)C(=O)O` to capture gluconic acid. Ensure distant single hydroxyl groups do not match this pattern.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: **For Rule 7**, the pattern should detect aliphatic carboxylic acids with a thiol group within three carbons of the carboxyl group. Use `C(=O)OCC[SH]` to match 3-mercaptopropionic acid. Exclude aromatic thiols by specifying aliphatic chains in the pattern.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: **For Rule 8**, ensure that hydroxyl or methoxy groups assisting in coordination are correctly matched when they are positioned appropriately. Use patterns like `C(=O)OCCCc1ccc(O)cc1` to capture modifiers where the hydroxy group is close enough to assist in coordination. Exclude distant or hindered groups.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: **For the overall code**, review and test each SMARTS pattern to ensure it accurately represents the corresponding natural language rule. Consider utilizing recursive SMARTS or more advanced pattern matching to capture complex features. Ensure that the SMARTS account for variations in molecular structures, such as different chain lengths or positions of functional groups.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: **Improve matching logic** by implementing a hierarchical approach where high-yield patterns are matched first, and low-yield patterns override only if they strictly match. This prevents false negatives and ensures that the most relevant prediction is captured in the feature matrix.

**Analysis of Current Rule Performance**

Based on the provided metrics and comparing them to the reference data, we can evaluate the performance of the current set of rules in the context of the catalytic problem.

---

**Current Metrics:**

- **Train Support**: 0.0114 (1.14%)
- **Train Confidence**: 0.5296 (52.96%)
- **Train Lift**: 1.0615
- **Train Leverage**: 0.00076

**Reference Metrics (Previous Rule Metrics):**

- **Train Support**: [0.1667 (16.67%), 0.1845 (18.45%)]
- **Train Confidence**: [0.6352 (63.52%), 0.5396 (53.96%)]
- **Train Lift**: [1.2048, 1.0559]
- **Train Leverage**: [0.0289, -0.0041]

---

**Interpretation of Metrics:**

1. **Support**:

   - **Current**: 1.14%
   - **Previous**: ~16.67% - 18.45%

   *Analysis*:

   - The current support is significantly lower than the previous iterations. This means that the current rules apply to a much smaller portion of the dataset.
   - Low support suggests that the rules are capturing very specific cases and may not be generalizable.

2. **Confidence**:

   - **Current**: 52.96%
   - **Previous**: ~53.96% - 63.52%

   *Analysis*:

   - The current confidence is slightly lower than the average of previous iterations.
   - Confidence reflects the accuracy of the rule when the condition is met. A confidence around 50% indicates that the rule's prediction is only slightly better than a random guess.

3. **Lift**:

   - **Current**: 1.0615
   - **Previous**: ~1.0559 - 1.2048

   *Analysis*:

   - The current lift is slightly above 1, indicating that the rule provides a marginal improvement over random chance.
   - Compared to previous values, the lift is on the lower end, suggesting that the rules do not significantly enhance the prediction of high yield.

4. **Leverage**:

   - **Current**: 0.00076
   - **Previous**: 0.0289, -0.0041

   *Analysis*:

   - The leverage is positive but very close to zero, implying that the rule does not add much predictive power beyond chance.
   - A low leverage further supports the notion that the rule is not capturing a strong association.

---

**Assessment of Current Rules:**

- The current rules have **very low support**, meaning they cover only about 1% of the training data. This limits their applicability and usefulness.
- The **confidence** is marginally better than a coin toss, indicating that when the rule conditions are met, the prediction is correct only about half the time.
- The **lift** being close to 1 suggests that the rules do not significantly improve the prediction of high yield over the baseline probability.
- **Comparing to previous iterations**, the current rules perform worse in terms of support and confidence, and only marginally better in lift compared to the lower end of previous values.

---

**Potential Reasons for Current Performance:**

1. **Over-Specialization**:

   - The rules might be too specific, focusing on rare combinations of features that do not frequently occur in the dataset.
   - Overly complex rules can capture noise rather than meaningful patterns.

2. **Overfitting**:

   - The rules may fit the training data very closely but fail to generalize, leading to poor performance on unseen data.
   - Signs of overfitting include low support and high complexity without corresponding improvements in confidence or lift.

3. **Insufficient Coverage**:

   - With low support, the rules do not cover enough examples to make a significant impact.
   - Important patterns and relationships might be missing from the rules.

---

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1. **Increase Rule Support**:

   - **Simplify Rules**: Reduce the complexity of the rules to make them more general.
     - Combine similar rules where possible.
     - Remove redundant or overly specific conditions.
   - **Focus on Frequent Features**: Identify features and conditions that occur more frequently in the dataset and incorporate them into the rules.

2. **Enhance Confidence and Lift**:

   - **Refine Key Predictors**: Re-evaluate the functional groups and structural features used in the rules to ensure they are strong predictors of high yield.
   - **Incorporate Statistical Significance**: Prioritize rules with statistically significant confidence and lift values.

3. **Avoid Overfitting**:

   - **Cross-Validation**: Use cross-validation techniques to test the rules on different subsets of the data, ensuring they perform consistently.
   - **Prune Rules**: Remove or modify rules that do not contribute significantly to predictive performance or that only apply to outliers.

4. **Iterative Refinement**:

   - **Review and Revise**: Examine each rule for its contribution to the overall metrics and adjust accordingly.
   - **Domain Expertise**: Leverage chemical knowledge to guide rule adjustments, ensuring they make sense chemically and are not just statistically driven.

5. **Introduce New Features**:

   - **Explore Additional Descriptors**: Consider incorporating other molecular descriptors that may have a stronger correlation with yield.
   - **Chemical Properties**: Use properties such as pKa, logP, or electronic descriptors that might influence catalytic activity.

6. **Balance Between Generality and Specificity**:

   - **Optimal Complexity**: Strive for rules that are neither too general (leading to low confidence) nor too specific (leading to low support).
   - **Hierarchy of Rules**: Establish a hierarchy where general rules capture broad patterns and specific rules capture exceptional cases.

---

**Determining if a Local Minimum Has Been Reached:**

- The current metrics suggest that performance has plateaued or even degraded compared to previous iterations.
- The low support and marginal improvements in confidence and lift indicate that the current set of rules may have reached a **local minimum**.
- **Further Iterations**:

  - Simply continuing with more iterations without changing the approach is unlikely to yield significant improvements.
  - A change in strategy, such as revisiting the rule creation process or incorporating new data, is needed.

---

**Action Plan for Rule Improvement:**

1. **Rule Consolidation**:

   - **Combine Overlapping Rules**: Merge rules that predict similar outcomes based on similar conditions to increase support.
   - **Eliminate Redundancies**: Remove rules that do not uniquely contribute to predictive power.

2. **Chemical Validation**:

   - **Expert Consultation**: Engage with chemists to validate the plausibility of the rules.
   - **Mechanistic Insights**: Ensure that the rules align with known chemical mechanisms and will likely hold true beyond the dataset.

3. **Data Augmentation**:

   - **Expand Dataset**: If possible, include more data points to improve support and robustness.
   - **Balance Classes**: Ensure that both high-yield and low-yield examples are adequately represented.

4. **Algorithmic Enhancements**:

   - **Machine Learning Techniques**: Consider supplementing rule-based methods with machine learning models to capture complex patterns.
   - **Feature Selection**: Use statistical methods to identify the most important features influencing yield.

5. **Monitoring Metrics**:

   - **Set Thresholds**: Define acceptable ranges for support, confidence, and lift to guide rule acceptance.
   - **Iterative Testing**: After each modification, test the rules against the metrics to monitor improvements.

---

**Conclusion**

The current rules, as evidenced by the metrics, are not performing optimally. The low support and marginal gains suggest that the rules are too narrowly defined and may be overfitted to specific cases in the training data. To enhance performance, it's essential to revisit and refine the rules, focusing on increasing their applicability (support) and predictive power (confidence and lift).

By simplifying the rules, incorporating domain expertise, and potentially introducing new features or data, we can develop a more effective set of rules that better predict high yields in the catalytic reaction. Balancing the complexity and generalizability of the rules will be key to improving their performance in subsequent iterations.

This performance is **significantly lower** than the accuracies observed in previous iterations, which consistently achieved validation accuracies around **0.76** and test accuracies ranging from **0.625 to 0.75**. The substantial drop in accuracy suggests that the current set of rules may not be effectively capturing the underlying patterns necessary for accurate predictions.

Comparing the current accuracy to the reference metrics:

- **Previous Iterations**:
  - Validation Accuracies: Consistently around **0.76**
  - Test Accuracies: **0.625 to 0.75**
- **Current Iteration**:
  - Validation Accuracy: **0.4857**

The decrease in accuracy indicates that the model's predictive performance has deteriorated, potentially due to issues with the current rules leading to underfitting.

---

**Assessment of Rule Effectiveness**

The effectiveness of the current rules appears to be **insufficient** based on the latest training results. The low validation accuracy suggests that the rules are not adequately capturing the relationships between the molecular features and the catalyst loading outcomes. Specifically, the rules may be too generalized or misaligned with the data, leading to incorrect predictions.

---

**Evaluation of Overfitting/Underfitting**

Given the low validation accuracy and, presumably, a similarly low training accuracy (though not explicitly provided), the model is likely experiencing **underfitting**. This means that the model is too simple to capture the complexity of the data, possibly due to overly broad or ineffective rules that fail to differentiate between high and low loading modifiers adequately.

---

**Analysis of SHAP Values and Discrepancies**

To identify problem areas within the rules, we analyze molecules where there is a discrepancy between the predicted loading and the experimental value, focusing on the SHAP values of the rules contributing to these predictions.

---

**1. Molecules with Predicted High Loading but Experimental Low Loading**

**Molecules**:

- **C(=O)(C(C(C(C(F)(F)F)(F)F)(F)F)(F)F)O**
- **C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O**
- **C(CCCC(=O)O)CCCN**
- **C1=CC(=CC=C1CCC(=O)O)O**
- **C1=CC(=C(C=C1C=O)C(=O)O)O**
- **CC(=O)NCCCC[C@@H](C(=O)O)N**
- **CSCC[C@@H](C(=O)NCC(=O)O)N**
- **C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)NCC(=O)O)O**
- **C(CCCO)CCC(=O)O**
- **C(CCCN)CCC(=O)O**

**Observations**:

- **Rule 2** consistently has a **positive SHAP value** for these molecules, contributing to the incorrect prediction of high loading.
- **Rule 12** also has a **positive SHAP value**, reinforcing the incorrect prediction.

**Interpretation**:

- The positive SHAP values indicate that **Rule 2** and **Rule 12** are influencing the model towards predicting high loading when the experimental value is low.
- This suggests that these rules may be **overestimating** the loading for certain molecular structures.

---

**2. Molecules with Predicted Low Loading but Experimental High Loading**

**Molecules**:

- **C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O**
- **C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)N**
- **C1=CC(=CC=C1C2=CC=NC=C2)C(=O)O**
- **C1=CC2=C(C=C1C(=O)O)C(=O)OC2=O**
- **C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)[N+](=O)[O-]**
- **COC1=C(C=C(C=C1)C(=O)CCC(=O)O)OC**
- **C(C(=O)O)NC(CO)(CO)CO**
- **C1=CN=CC=C1CCCC(=O)O**

**Observations**:

- **Rule 2** has a **negative SHAP value** for these molecules, contributing to the incorrect prediction of low loading.
- **Rule 12** has a **positive SHAP value**, but its impact is insufficient to override the negative influence of **Rule 2**.

**Interpretation**:

- The negative SHAP values from **Rule 2** indicate that it is strongly influencing the model towards predicting low loading when the experimental value is high.
- This suggests that **Rule 2** may be incorrectly penalizing certain molecular features that are actually associated with high loading.

---

**Insights from SHAP Analysis**

The SHAP analysis reveals that **Rule 2** is a significant contributor to incorrect predictions in both overestimation and underestimation scenarios:

- **Overestimated Loading**: Positive SHAP values from **Rule 2** contribute to predicting high loading for molecules where the experimental loading is low.
- **Underestimated Loading**: Negative SHAP values from **Rule 2** contribute to predicting low loading for molecules where the experimental loading is high.

This pattern suggests that **Rule 2** may be **misclassifying** key molecular features, leading to systematic errors in the model's predictions.

---

**Interpretation of Accuracy Metrics**

The decrease in validation accuracy from approximately **0.76** in previous iterations to **0.4857** in the current iteration indicates that the changes made to the rules have negatively impacted the model's ability to generalize from the training data to new, unseen data.

- The model's poor performance suggests that the **current set of rules is less effective** than previous versions.
- The repeated misclassification of certain molecules highlights the need to **refine the rules**, particularly those contributing most significantly to incorrect predictions (e.g., **Rule 2**).

---

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

**1. Refinement of Rule 2**

**Issue Identified**:

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) at the para position predict a high yield.*
- **Problem**: Rule 2 erroneously assigns negative SHAP values to some high-yielding modifiers and positive SHAP values to low-yielding ones, indicating misclassification.

**Suggested Refinements**:

- **Broaden the Scope**: Include additional factors such as the presence of ortho and meta substituents, steric effects, and resonance stabilization that may influence the modifier's effectiveness.
- **Specificity**: Refine Rule 2 to account for substituents that, despite being electron-withdrawing, may lead to steric hindrance or other effects that reduce catalyst loading.
- **Reassess Examples**: Re-evaluate the high and low yield examples provided in Rule 2 to ensure they accurately reflect the relationship described.

**Revised Rule 2**:

- *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro) at the para position predict a high yield, **provided that these substituents do not introduce significant steric hindrance or deactivate the carboxyl group's coordination ability**.*
  - **High Yield Examples**:
    - *4-nitrobenzoic acid*
  - **Low Yield Counterexamples**:
    - *4-bromomethylbenzoic acid* (Bromomethyl group may introduce steric hindrance or participate in side reactions)
    - *4-bromobenzoic acid* (Potential for steric hindrance)

**2. Reassessment of Molecular Examples**

- For molecules like **C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O** (p-bromobenzoic acid), which were predicted low but have high experimental loading, consider the potential steric effects of the bromo group.
- Investigate whether certain electron-withdrawing groups, such as halogens, may not always enhance coordination due to steric or electronic factors.

**3. Adjustments to Rule 12**

**Observation**:

- **Rule 12** generally contributes positively to predictions but with smaller SHAP values.
- It may not be the primary cause of mispredictions but could be refined to improve overall model performance.

**Suggested Refinements**:

- **Clarify Scope**: Ensure Rule 12 accurately distinguishes between modifiers with amide bonds that hinder coordination and those where amide formation does not significantly affect the coordinating groups.
- **Expand Examples**: Include more examples of both high and low yield modifiers affected by amide bonds to enhance the rule's predictive power.

**4. Addressing Underfitting**

- **Increase Rule Complexity**: Introduce additional rules or sub-rules that capture more nuanced relationships between molecular features and catalyst loading.
- **Feature Engineering**: Consider incorporating other molecular descriptors (e.g., electronic properties, steric parameters) to provide the model with more information.
- **Data Analysis**: Re-examine the dataset for patterns or clusters that could inform new rules or adjustments to existing ones.

**5. Utilize SHAP Analysis for Rule Refinement**

- **Target High Impact Rules**: Focus on rules that consistently show high absolute SHAP values in mispredicted cases.
- **Iterative Testing**: After adjusting rules, reassess their impact using SHAP values to determine if changes improve predictions.
- **Balance Rule Contributions**: Aim for a set of rules where no single rule dominates the prediction, reducing the risk of over-reliance on a potentially flawed rule.

**6. Generalization Improvement**

- **Avoid Overgeneralization**: Ensure that rules are not too broad, which can lead to incorrect predictions for specific cases.
- **Incorporate Exceptions**: Where applicable, include exceptions or conditions within rules to account for known outliers or conflicting cases.
- **Cross-Validation**: Use cross-validation techniques to test the robustness of the rules across different subsets of the data.

---

**Conclusion**

The analysis indicates that the current set of rules, particularly **Rule 2**, is contributing to inaccurate predictions due to misclassification of key molecular features. By refining **Rule 2** to account for steric effects and re-evaluating the assumptions underlying its formulation, we can improve the model's predictive performance. Additionally, adjustments to other rules, enhanced feature engineering, and iterative testing informed by SHAP analysis will help address underfitting and enhance the model's ability to generalize. By implementing these recommendations, we aim to develop a more accurate and reliable predictive model for catalyst loading.

**Summary and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

**Summary:**

The current set of rules intended to predict the catalytic performance of modifiers in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)-H bond functionalization reaction has been analyzed. The evaluation metrics indicate that the rules are underperforming:

- **Low Support:** The rules apply to only about 1% of the training data, making them too specific and not widely applicable.
- **Marginal Confidence and Lift:** With a confidence of approximately 53% and a lift close to 1, the rules offer minimal predictive advantage over random chance.
- **Reduced Validation Accuracy:** The validation accuracy has dropped significantly to around 48%, compared to previous iterations with accuracies around 76%.

**Issues Identified:**

- **Rule 2 Misclassifications:** Rule 2 is contributing to incorrect predictions by misclassifying modifiers due to oversimplified assumptions about electron-withdrawing groups.
- **Over-Specialization and Underfitting:** The rules are too narrowly defined, failing to capture broader patterns and leading to underfitting.
- **Inconsistent SHAP Values:** Some rules are inconsistently influencing predictions, as indicated by SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) analysis, contributing to both overestimations and underestimations of yield.

**Suggestions to Improve Current Rules:**

1. **Refine Rule 2:**

   - **Issue:** Rule 2 oversimplifies the effect of electron-withdrawing groups at the para position, not accounting for steric hindrance or resonance effects that may impact coordination.
   - **Action:** Modify Rule 2 to accurately reflect the influence of different substituents, considering both electronic and steric factors.
   - **Revised Rule 2:**
     - *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro) at the para position, which enhance coordination without introducing significant steric hindrance or deactivating the carboxyl group's ability to coordinate, predict a high yield.*
   - **Implementation:** Adjust SMARTS patterns to specifically target electron-withdrawing groups that do not cause steric hindrance, and exclude those that may interfere with coordination.

2. **Increase Rule Support and Generalization:**

   - **Issue:** Low support indicates that rules are too specific.
   - **Action:** Simplify overly complex rules to make them more general while retaining chemical relevance.
   - **Implementation:** Combine similar rules, remove redundant conditions, and focus on features common among high-yield modifiers.

3. **Enhance Chemical Accuracy:**

   - **Issue:** Some rules may not align with chemical principles.
   - **Action:** Reassess each rule using chemical domain knowledge to ensure mechanistic plausibility.
   - **Implementation:** Collaborate with chemists to validate rules, and adjust them to reflect known coordination chemistry and catalytic mechanisms.

4. **Utilize SHAP Analysis for Rule Refinement:**

   - **Issue:** SHAP values indicate certain rules are misinforming predictions.
   - **Action:** Focus on refining or eliminating rules contributing to mispredictions, as identified by high SHAP values.
   - **Implementation:** Iteratively adjust rules and observe changes in SHAP values to achieve more accurate predictions.

5. **Address Underfitting by Introducing New Features:**

   - **Issue:** The model is underfitting due to oversimplified rules.
   - **Action:** Incorporate additional molecular descriptors such as pKa, logP, steric parameters, or electronic descriptors that may influence catalytic activity.
   - **Implementation:** Use statistical methods to identify features with strong correlations to yield and integrate them into the rule set.

6. **Balance Complexity and Specificity:**

   - **Issue:** Overly general or overly specific rules are ineffective.
   - **Action:** Strike a balance by creating rules that are comprehensive yet precise enough to capture key patterns without overgeneralizing.
   - **Implementation:** Establish a hierarchy of rules where general rules are supplemented by specific sub-rules to account for exceptions.

7. **Improve Matching Logic and SMARTS Patterns:**

   - **Issue:** Current SMARTS patterns may not accurately capture the intended molecular features.
   - **Action:** Review and refine SMARTS patterns to ensure they align with the chemical structures described in the rules.
   - **Implementation:** Use advanced pattern matching techniques and consider recursive SMARTS to capture complex molecular features.

8. **Implement Hierarchical Rule Application:**

   - **Issue:** Conflicts between rules may lead to incorrect predictions.
   - **Action:** Apply rules in a hierarchical manner, where high-confidence rules take precedence, and subsequent rules refine the prediction.
   - **Implementation:** Design the model to prioritize rules based on their confidence and support levels.

9. **Cross-Validate and Monitor Metrics:**

   - **Issue:** Overfitting or underfitting may not be immediately apparent.
   - **Action:** Use cross-validation to test the rules on different subsets of data, ensuring consistency and robustness.
   - **Implementation:** Monitor support, confidence, lift, and leverage after each iteration to guide further refinements.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

There is significant potential for further optimizing the current rules without overfitting. By broadening the applicability of the rules, refining them based on chemical principles, and carefully adjusting SMARTS patterns, we can enhance their predictive power while maintaining generalizability. Employing cross-validation and leveraging SHAP analysis will help ensure that the rules improve in performance without becoming overfitted to the training data.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **short-chain aliphatic amino acids** with the **amino group attached to the α-carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The close proximity of the amino and carboxyl groups allows for effective bidentate coordination with metal centers, enhancing catalyst reactivity through chelation.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (L-Aspartic acid)
    - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (L-Glutamic acid)
    - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (L-Tryptophan)
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyl-L-Lysine; acetylation reduces coordination sites)

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-withdrawing groups** (e.g., **nitro**, **bromomethyl**) at the **para position** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers and improving catalyst performance.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *4-nitrobenzoic acid*
    - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (Methyl group is electron-donating, reducing coordination ability)

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with an **amino group at the para position** predict a **high yield**; those with **electron-donating groups** like **alkyl** or **hydroxy** groups at positions that do not assist in coordination predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The amino group provides an additional coordination site, enhancing metal-ligand interactions. Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening coordination.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid* (p-Aminobenzoic acid)
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (Electron-donating methyl group)
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (Hydroxy group not positioned for effective coordination)

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids** containing **nitrogen atoms capable of coordinating with metal centers** and exhibit **minimal steric hindrance** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles act as additional coordination sites, strengthening interactions with metal centers and enhancing catalytic performance.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
    - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid* (Chelidamic acid)
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Steric hindrance due to bulky bipyridine structure reduces coordination efficiency)

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** (six or more carbons) with **no polar functional groups** predict a **high yield**; those with **polar groups distant from the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Nonpolar chains enhance hydrophobic interactions within the catalytic system, improving substrate access to active sites. Distant polar groups do not effectively participate in coordination and may disrupt these interactions.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *Octanoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid* (Amino group too distant for effective coordination)
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid* (Amino group introduces polarity far from the carboxyl group)
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Hydroxyl group too distant from carboxyl group)

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups** near the **carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Adjacent hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites through chelation, enhancing metal-ligand interactions and catalytic activity.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
    - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Single hydroxyl group too distant for effective coordination)

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with a **thiol group within three carbons** of the **carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The thiol and carboxyl groups can coordinate simultaneously with metal centers, enhancing catalyst stability and activity through chelation.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid* (3-Mercaptopropionic acid)
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* (Thiol group on aromatic ring may not coordinate effectively due to aromatic stabilization)

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aromatic or aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **hydroxyl or methoxy groups** positioned to assist in coordination predict a **high yield**; if these groups are too distant or hindered, they predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Hydroxyl and methoxy groups can serve as additional coordination sites when in proximity to the carboxyl group.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid* (Hydroxy group can assist in coordination)
    - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid* (Methoxy groups near coordinating sites)
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (Hydroxyphenyl group too distant from carboxyl group for effective coordination)

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that contain **carbonyl groups (aldehyde or ketone) adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield** due to potential side reactions or interference with coordination.
  - *Rationale*: Carbonyl groups can engage in side reactions or compete with the carboxyl group for metal coordination, reducing catalyst effectiveness.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*
    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that have **perfluoroalkyl groups** attached to the **carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Perfluoroalkyl groups are strongly electron-withdrawing, significantly reducing electron density on coordinating atoms and weakening metal-ligand interactions.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **ether linkages** and **terminal polar groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether linkages increase molecular flexibility and distance between functional groups, reducing effective coordination with metal centers.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that have **amide bonds involving the carboxyl group** or **N-acetyl modifications** near the **carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide formation decreases the availability of free carboxyl and amino groups necessary for effective metal coordination, hindering catalytic activity.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyl-L-Lysine)
    - *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **bulky substituents** directly attached to the aromatic ring predict a **low yield** due to **steric hindrance** affecting coordination.
  - *Rationale*: Bulky groups near coordinating sites can impede effective alignment and interaction with the metal center, reducing catalytic performance.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Bulky bipyridine structure introduces steric hindrance)
  - *High Yield Counterexample*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid* (Additional methylene group reduces steric hindrance, allowing better coordination)

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **polar functional groups** (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) located more than **four carbons away** from the **carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Distant polar functional groups are less effective in coordination with the metal center and may disrupt hydrophobic interactions crucial for catalyst performance.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that have **multiple functional groups** capable of **intramolecular interactions** (e.g., hydrogen bonding), leading to **conformational constraints** and hindering coordination with metal centers, predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Intramolecular interactions can reduce the availability of functional groups for metal coordination, diminishing catalyst activity.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid* (Complex amino acid derivative with potential intramolecular hydrogen bonding)
    - *4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid* (Trifluoroacetyl group may engage in intramolecular interactions)

**End of Rules**

These rules combine multiple functional groups and consider underlying physicochemical properties to predict the impact of molecular modifiers on the reaction yield. By focusing on the interplay between functional groups and their proximity to coordination sites, the rules provide a framework for understanding and predicting the catalytic performance of different modifiers.---------------------------------------------------------------

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Refine Rule 2 to Accurately Reflect Substituent Effects**

  - **Action**: Modify Rule 2 to account for both electronic and steric effects of substituents on aromatic carboxylic acids. Focus on electron-withdrawing groups that enhance coordination without causing steric hindrance or deactivating the carboxyl group's ability to coordinate.
  
  - **Implementation**:
    - **Revise Rule 2**:
      - **New Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro) at positions that enhance acidity and coordination without introducing significant steric hindrance predict a high yield.*
    - **Adjust SMARTS Patterns**:
      - Update SMARTS patterns to specifically target electron-withdrawing groups that are small enough to avoid steric interference (e.g., nitro, cyano).
      - Exclude bulky substituents (e.g., bromomethyl) that may hinder coordination.
    - **Examples**:
      - **High Yield**: *4-nitrobenzoic acid* (electron-withdrawing, minimal steric hindrance).
      - **Low Yield Counterexample**: *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid* (bulky group may cause steric hindrance).

- **Advice 2**: **Increase Rule Support and Generalization**

  - **Action**: Simplify and generalize the rules to cover a broader range of modifiers, increasing their applicability and support.
  
  - **Implementation**:
    - **Combine Similar Rules**:
      - Merge rules that have overlapping criteria (e.g., Rules 6 and 7 about additional coordinating groups near the carboxyl group).
    - **Create Broader Rules**:
      - **New General Rule**: *Modifiers that are carboxylic acids with additional coordinating functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, thiol) within three atoms of the carboxyl group predict a high yield.*
    - **Remove Redundancies**:
      - Eliminate conditions that overly narrow the rule applicability without significantly improving accuracy.
    - **Examples**:
      - **High Yield**: *Gluconic acid*, *3-mercaptopropionic acid*, *L-Aspartic acid*.
      - **Low Yield Counterexample**: Modifiers lacking nearby coordinating groups.

  - **Action**: Reassess each rule for chemical validity and mechanistic plausibility, ensuring they align with known principles of coordination chemistry and catalysis.
  
  - **Implementation**:
    - **Collaborate with Chemists**:
      - Consult with experts to validate the chemical rationale behind each rule.
    - **Refine or Remove Chemically Unsound Rules**:
      - For example, re-evaluate Rule 5:
        - **Issue**: Suggests nonpolar long-chain acids enhance yield, which may not be chemically supported.
        - **Action**: Remove or adjust the rule to reflect accurate chemical interactions.
    - **Update Rules Accordingly**:
      - Ensure rules emphasize functional groups and structural features known to enhance coordination and catalytic activity.

    - **Monitor Impact**:
      - After adjustments, re-assess SHAP values to ensure improvements.

- **Advice 5**: **Introduce New Features to Address Underfitting**

  - **Action**: Incorporate additional molecular descriptors and features into the rule set to capture more variability and improve model performance.
  
  - **Implementation**:
    - **Include Physicochemical Properties**:
      - Add parameters like pKa (acid dissociation constant), logP (partition coefficient), steric hindrance factors, and electronic descriptors.
    - **Develop New Rules Based on These Features**:
      - For example:
        - *Modifiers with carboxyl groups having pKa values between X and Y predict high yield due to optimal acidity for coordination.*
    - **Data Collection**:
      - Gather necessary data for these properties for all modifiers in the dataset.
    - **Integration into Rules**:
      - Adjust existing rules or create new ones incorporating these features.

  - **Action**: Ensure that rules are neither too general (leading to overfitting) nor too specific (leading to underfitting).
  
  - **Implementation**:
    - **Simplify Overly Complex Rules**:
      - Remove unnecessary conditions that do not significantly contribute to predictive power.
    - **Avoid Over-Generalization**:
      - Ensure that the rules still capture key differentiating features between high and low yield modifiers.
    - **Create Sub-Rules if Necessary**:
      - For broad rules, introduce sub-rules to account for exceptions or specific cases.
    - **Examples**:
      - General Rule: *Modifiers with coordinating groups near the carboxyl predict high yield.*
      - Sub-Rule: *Exceptions include modifiers where steric hindrance prevents effective coordination.*

- **Advice 7**: **Improve Matching Logic and SMARTS Patterns**

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids** with the **amino group attached directly to the α-carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The proximity of the amino and carboxyl groups facilitates effective bidentate coordination with metal centers, enhancing catalyst reactivity through chelation.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (L-Aspartic acid)
    - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (L-Glutamic acid)
    - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (L-Tryptophan)
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyl-L-Lysine; acetylation hinders coordination)

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-withdrawing groups** (e.g., **nitro**, **bromomethyl**, **amino**) at the **para position** predict a **high yield**; those with **electron-donating groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. Electron-donating groups reduce acidity and coordination efficiency.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *4-nitrobenzoic acid*
    - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid*
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid* (Amino group acts as additional coordination site)
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (Methyl group is electron-donating)
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (Hydroxy group too distant for coordination)

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids** containing **nitrogen atoms capable of coordinating with metal centers** and exhibit **minimal steric hindrance** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles serve as additional coordination sites, strengthening interactions with metal centers.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
    - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid* (Chelidamic acid)
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Bulky structure introduces steric hindrance)

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **long hydrophobic chains (six or more carbons)** and **no additional polar functional groups** predict a **high yield**; those with **distant polar groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Hydrophobic chains enhance substrate access to active sites through favorable interactions. Polar groups distant from the carboxyl group do not aid coordination and may disrupt these interactions.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *Octanoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid* (Amino group too distant)
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **adjacent hydroxyl groups** near the **carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Hydroxyl groups close to the carboxyl group provide additional coordination sites, enhancing metal-ligand interactions through chelation.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
    - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Hydroxyl group too distant)

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with a **thiol group within three carbons** of the **carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**; those where the thiol group is part of an aromatic system predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The thiol group can coordinate with metal centers when in close proximity. Aromatic thiols may have reduced availability due to resonance stabilization.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid* (3-Mercaptopropionic acid)
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* (Thiol group less available for coordination)

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aromatic or aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **hydroxyl or methoxy groups** positioned to assist in coordination predict a **high yield**; if these groups are **too distant or sterically hindered**, they predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Hydroxyl and methoxy groups can serve as additional coordination sites. Distance and steric hindrance reduce effectiveness.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid* (Hydroxy group aids coordination)
    - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (Hydroxy group too distant)

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **perfluoroalkyl groups** attached to the **carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Perfluoroalkyl groups are strongly electron-withdrawing, significantly reducing the electron density on coordinating atoms and weakening metal-ligand interactions.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **carbonyl groups (aldehyde or ketone) adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Adjacent carbonyl groups can interfere with metal coordination or engage in side reactions, reducing catalyst effectiveness.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*
    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that have **amide bonds involving the carboxyl group** or are **N-acetylated** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide formation reduces the availability of free carboxyl and amino groups necessary for effective metal coordination.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyl-L-Lysine)
    - *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **ether linkages** and **terminal polar groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether linkages increase molecular flexibility and distance between functional groups, reducing effective coordination with metal centers.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **bulky substituents** directly attached to the aromatic ring predict a **low yield** due to **steric hindrance** affecting coordination.
  - *Rationale*: Bulky groups near coordinating sites impede effective alignment and interaction with the metal center.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Bulky bipyridine structure)
  - *High Yield Counterexample*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid* (Additional methylene units reduce steric hindrance)

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that have **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **polar functional groups** (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) located more than **four carbons away** from the **carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Distant polar groups are less effective in metal coordination and may introduce unfavorable interactions within the catalytic system.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with **multiple functional groups** capable of **intramolecular interactions** (e.g., hydrogen bonding) that lead to **conformational constraints**, hindering coordination with metal centers, predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Intramolecular interactions reduce the availability of functional groups for metal coordination, diminishing catalyst activity.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid* (Complex amino acid derivative)
    - *4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid*

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids** with **ketone groups adjacent to the aromatic ring** predict a **high yield** if the ketone participates in chelation.
  - *Rationale*: Ketone groups can enhance coordination ability when properly oriented, contributing to stronger metal-ligand interactions.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid* (Chelidamic acid)

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids** with the **amino group attached directly to the α-carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The proximity of the amino and carboxyl groups facilitates effective bidentate coordination with metal centers, enhancing catalyst reactivity through chelation.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (L-Aspartic acid)
    - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (L-Glutamic acid)
    - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (L-Tryptophan)
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyl-L-Lysine; acetylation hinders coordination)

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-withdrawing groups** (e.g., **nitro**, **bromomethyl**, **amino**) at the **para position** predict a **high yield**; those with **electron-donating groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. Electron-donating groups reduce acidity and coordination efficiency.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *4-nitrobenzoic acid*
    - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid*
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid* (Amino group acts as additional coordination site)
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (Methyl group is electron-donating)
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (Hydroxy group too distant for coordination)

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids** containing **nitrogen atoms capable of coordinating with metal centers** and exhibit **minimal steric hindrance** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles serve as additional coordination sites, strengthening interactions with metal centers.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
    - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid* (Chelidamic acid)
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Bulky structure introduces steric hindrance)

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **long hydrophobic chains (six or more carbons)** and **no additional polar functional groups** predict a **high yield**; those with **distant polar groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Hydrophobic chains enhance substrate access to active sites through favorable interactions. Polar groups distant from the carboxyl group do not aid coordination and may disrupt these interactions.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *Octanoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid* (Amino group too distant)
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **adjacent hydroxyl groups** near the **carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Hydroxyl groups close to the carboxyl group provide additional coordination sites, enhancing metal-ligand interactions through chelation.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
    - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (Hydroxyl group too distant)

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with a **thiol group within three carbons** of the **carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**; those where the thiol group is part of an aromatic system predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The thiol group can coordinate with metal centers when in close proximity. Aromatic thiols may have reduced availability due to resonance stabilization.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid* (3-Mercaptopropionic acid)
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* (Thiol group less available for coordination)

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aromatic or aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **hydroxyl or methoxy groups** positioned to assist in coordination predict a **high yield**; if these groups are **too distant or sterically hindered**, they predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Hydroxyl and methoxy groups can serve as additional coordination sites. Distance and steric hindrance reduce effectiveness.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid* (Hydroxy group aids coordination)
    - *4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (Hydroxy group too distant)

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **perfluoroalkyl groups** attached to the **carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Perfluoroalkyl groups are strongly electron-withdrawing, significantly reducing the electron density on coordinating atoms and weakening metal-ligand interactions.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **carbonyl groups (aldehyde or ketone) adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Adjacent carbonyl groups can interfere with metal coordination or engage in side reactions, reducing catalyst effectiveness.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*
    - *4-oxoheptanedioic acid*

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that have **amide bonds involving the carboxyl group** or are **N-acetylated** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide formation reduces the availability of free carboxyl and amino groups necessary for effective metal coordination.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyl-L-Lysine)
    - *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **ether linkages** and **terminal polar groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether linkages increase molecular flexibility and distance between functional groups, reducing effective coordination with metal centers.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **bulky substituents** directly attached to the aromatic ring predict a **low yield** due to **steric hindrance** affecting coordination.
  - *Rationale*: Bulky groups near coordinating sites impede effective alignment and interaction with the metal center.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (Bulky bipyridine structure)
  - *High Yield Counterexample*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid* (Additional methylene units reduce steric hindrance)

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that have **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **polar functional groups** (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) located more than **four carbons away** from the **carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Distant polar groups are less effective in metal coordination and may introduce unfavorable interactions within the catalytic system.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with **multiple functional groups** capable of **intramolecular interactions** (e.g., hydrogen bonding) that lead to **conformational constraints**, hindering coordination with metal centers, predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Intramolecular interactions reduce the availability of functional groups for metal coordination, diminishing catalyst activity.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid* (Complex amino acid derivative)
    - *4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid*

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids** with **ketone groups adjacent to the aromatic ring** predict a **high yield** if the ketone participates in chelation.
  - *Rationale*: Ketone groups can enhance coordination ability when properly oriented, contributing to stronger metal-ligand interactions.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid* (Chelidamic acid)

**End of Rules**

---

These refined rules consider the underlying physicochemical properties of the molecular modifiers and their functional groups, focusing on how these features influence coordination with the metal centers in the catalyst. By combining multiple sub-structures and prioritizing broader coverage of the dataset, the rules aim to effectively predict whether a modifier will result in a high or low yield in the reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: For **Rule 1**, modify the SMARTS pattern to exclude N-acetylated amino acids. The current pattern `[NX3][CX4H][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` does not distinguish between free amino groups and acetylated ones, leading to incorrect matches (e.g., N-Acetyl-L-Lysine). Update the pattern to `[NX3;!$(N[C]=O)][CX4H][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` to exclude amino groups bonded to a carbonyl (acetylated).

- **Suggestion 2**: For **Rule 2**, refine the SMARTS patterns to specifically target substituents at the **para position** relative to the carboxyl group on the aromatic ring. The current implementation does not consider positional isomerism, resulting in incorrect matches. Use a pattern like `c1ccc(cc1)[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` for the aromatic carboxylic acid and incorporate substructure queries to identify para-substituents with electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups.

- **Suggestion 3**: In **Rule 2**, clarify the classification of **electron-withdrawing (EWG)** and **electron-donating groups (EDG)**. The amino group is listed in both EWG and EDG patterns, causing misclassification. Determine based on context whether the amino group acts as an EWG or EDG and ensure it is only included in the appropriate list.

- **Suggestion 4**: For rules involving the **proximity of functional groups** (e.g., **Rules 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 13**), enhance the SMARTS patterns to include **distance constraints**. Utilize recursive SMARTS or atom mapping to specify the number of bonds between functional groups, ensuring accurate matching of structures where the functional groups are within the required proximity.

- **Suggestion 5**: In **Rule 4**, adjust the code to accurately identify modifiers with **long hydrophobic chains** and **exclude** those with **distant polar groups**. The current implementation may not correctly consider the presence of polar groups beyond a certain distance. Incorporate patterns that detect polar groups beyond four carbons from the carboxyl group and assign a low yield prediction accordingly.

- **Suggestion 6**: For **Rule 6**, improve the pattern to differentiate between **thiol groups** on aliphatic chains and those on **aromatic systems**. The current exclusion pattern `[c][SX2H]` might not be sufficient. Modify it to `[c][SX2H0]` to ensure thiol groups bonded to aromatic carbons (with zero hydrogens) are correctly identified and excluded.

- **Suggestion 7**: In **Rule 7**, develop more precise criteria to assess whether **hydroxyl or methoxy groups** are positioned to assist in coordination and whether they are **too distant or sterically hindered**. Consider calculating the distance between these groups and the carboxyl group or using 3D conformational analysis if necessary.

- **Suggestion 8**: For **Rule 10**, refine the patterns to accurately detect **amide bonds involving the carboxyl group** and **N-acetylated** compounds. The current patterns `[NX3][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` and `[CX3](=O)[NX3]` may match unintended structures. Specify that the amide bond must involve the carboxyl group directly, possibly using `[CX3](=O)[NX3;$([NX3][#6])]` to ensure correct matching.

- **Suggestion 9**: In **Rule 12**, enhance the pattern to detect **bulky substituents directly attached to the aromatic ring**. The simplified pattern `[c][c]([c])[c]([#6])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` may not capture all relevant cases. Define what constitutes a bulky group and create specific patterns (e.g., t-butyl groups, fused aromatic rings) to identify steric hindrance accurately.

- **Suggestion 10**: Overall, for all rules, ensure that the SMARTS patterns and logic **precisely reflect the structural requirements** detailed in the language rules. This includes specifying atom connectivity, functional group positions, and exclusion criteria to prevent misclassification. Regularly cross-validate patterns against known examples and counterexamples to verify accuracy.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Translate Qualitative Descriptions into Quantifiable Features**  
  Modify the rules to focus on quantifiable molecular features that can be directly computed from SMILES strings using cheminformatics tools like RDKit. For example, instead of stating "electron-withdrawing groups," specify the presence and count of specific functional groups such as nitro groups, halogens, or carbonyls at defined positions.

- **Advice 2**: **Define SMARTS Patterns for Functional Groups and Substructures**  
  For each rule, create SMARTS patterns that accurately represent the functional groups or substructures involved. These patterns can be used to programmatically search the SMILES strings and generate binary or numerical features indicating the presence, absence, or count of these groups.

- **Advice 3**: **Standardize Rule Criteria Based on Molecular Properties**  
  Rephrase the rules to utilize standard molecular descriptors that are easily calculable, such as:
  - **Functional Group Counts**: Number of carboxyl, amino, hydroxyl, thiol groups, etc.
  - **Positional Relationships**: Distance (in number of bonds) between functional groups.
  - **Molecular Size Parameters**: Number of heavy atoms, molecular weight.
  - **Topological Descriptors**: Counts of rings, heteroatoms in rings, chain lengths.

- **Advice 4**: **Create a Feature Matrix with Clear, Computable Columns**  
  Design a feature matrix where each column represents a specific, computable feature derived from the SMILES string. Examples include:
  - Binary indicators for the presence of specific functional groups.
  - Counts of certain atom types or bonds (e.g., number of nitrogen atoms, double bonds).
  - Calculated properties like LogP, polar surface area, or rotatable bonds.

- **Advice 5**: **Automate Feature Extraction with Cheminformatics Tools**  
  Use tools like RDKit to automate the extraction of features from the SMILES strings. Write scripts to parse the SMILES and calculate all the features defined in your standardized rules, ensuring reproducibility and scalability.

- **Advice 6**: **Eliminate Ambiguity and Increase Specificity in Rules**  
  Remove vague terms like "bulky substituents" or "minimal steric hindrance." Instead, define steric bulk quantitatively, perhaps by using the concept of steric parameters or by specifying the size (number of atoms) of substituents at particular positions.

- **Advice 7**: **Incorporate Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSAR) Descriptors**  
  Include QSAR descriptors that capture electronic, steric, and hydrophobic properties. These descriptors can provide numerical values representing properties like electronic effects (Hammett constants), molar refractivity, or solvent-accessible surface area.

- **Advice 8**: **Use Position-Specific Functional Group Identifiers**  
  For rules that depend on the position of functional groups (e.g., para substitution), specify algorithms to detect functional groups at particular positions relative to other groups within the molecule.

- **Advice 9**: **Account for Steric Effects with 3D Descriptors**  
  If steric hindrance is significant, consider generating 3D conformations of the molecules and calculating descriptors like van der Waals volume or steric maps to quantify steric effects numerically.

- **Advice 10**: **Integrate Electronic Property Calculations**  
  For rules involving electronic effects (e.g., electron-withdrawing/donating groups), calculate properties such as partial atomic charges, molecular orbital energies, or electrostatic potentials.

- **Advice 11**: **Reclassify Modifiers with Overlapping Features**  
  Identify and address any modifiers that fit multiple rules, especially if the rules predict different outcomes. Create a hierarchy or weighting system to resolve conflicts and improve predictive accuracy.

- **Advice 12**: **Provide Explicit Examples with Computation Steps**  
  For each rule, include examples showing how to compute the relevant features from the SMILES strings, possibly with code snippets. This will aid in implementing the rules effectively.

- **Advice 13**: **Validate and Refine Rules Using Machine Learning**  
  Use the dataset to train machine learning models with the computed features to validate the effectiveness of the rules. Refine the rules based on feature importance and model performance.

- **Advice 14**: **Consider Removing or Merging Redundant Rules**  
  Analyze the rules for redundancy or overlaps. Merge similar rules or remove those that have minimal impact on the prediction to streamline the rule set.

- **Advice 15**: **Document Assumptions and Limitations Clearly**  
  For each rule, document any assumptions made and the scope of its applicability. This transparency will help in understanding the limitations and contexts in which the rules are valid.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids** (having both an amino group and a carboxyl group attached to the same carbon) predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The α-amino and carboxyl groups can act as bidentate ligands, chelating metal centers and enhancing catalyst performance through strong coordination bonds.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (L-Aspartic acid)
    - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (L-Glutamic acid)
    - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (L-Tryptophan)
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyl-L-Lysine; acylation reduces amino group availability for coordination)

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-withdrawing groups at the para position** predict a **high yield**; those with **electron-donating groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and hinder coordination.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *4-nitrobenzoic acid* (nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing)
    - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid* (bromomethyl group withdraws electrons)
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid* (amino group acts as an additional coordination site)
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (methyl group is electron-donating)
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (hydroxy group is electron-donating and too distant for effective coordination)

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids** containing **pyridine nitrogen atoms** predict a **high yield**, provided steric hindrance is minimal.
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles serve as additional coordination sites, strengthening interactions with metal centers.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
    - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid* (Chelidamic acid)
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (bulky structure introduces steric hindrance, impeding coordination)

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **long hydrocarbon chains (six or more carbons)** and **no polar substituents** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Hydrophobic chains enhance substrate access to active sites through favorable van der Waals interactions within the catalyst's environment.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *Octanoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid* (terminal amino group may interfere with catalyst interactions)
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that have **hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**; those with hydroxyl groups distant from the carboxyl group predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Adjacent hydroxyl groups can participate in chelation with metal centers, enhancing coordination. Distant hydroxyl groups are less effective.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
    - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (hydroxyl group is too distant to assist in coordination)

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that have **thiol groups within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**; those where the thiol group is part of an aromatic ring predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Proximal thiol groups enhance metal coordination through sulfur atoms. Aromatic thiols may have reduced availability due to resonance stabilization.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid* (3-Mercaptopropionic acid)
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* (thiol group is less available due to aromaticity)

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing **perfluoroalkyl groups** attached to the carboxyl group predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Strong electron-withdrawing perfluoroalkyl groups reduce electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening metal-ligand interactions.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the aromatic ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Adjacent carbonyl groups can interfere with metal coordination or engage in side reactions, reducing catalyst effectiveness.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that have **amide bonds involving the carboxyl group** or are **N-acetylated amino acids** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide formation reduces the availability of free carboxyl and amino groups necessary for effective metal coordination.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyl-L-Lysine)
    - *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **ether linkages** and **terminal polar groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether linkages increase molecular flexibility and distance between functional groups, reducing effective coordination with metal centers.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **bulky substituents near coordinating sites** predict a **low yield** due to steric hindrance.
  - *Rationale*: Bulky groups impede effective alignment and interaction with the metal center.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (biphenyl structure causes steric hindrance)
  - *High Yield Counterexample*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid* (additional methylene units alleviate steric effects)

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** where **polar functional groups** are located more than **four carbons away** from the carboxyl group predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Distant polar groups are less effective in metal coordination and may disrupt favorable interactions within the catalytic system.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **ortho-hydroxyl groups** predict a **high yield** due to the potential for chelation.
  - *Rationale*: Ortho-hydroxyl groups can form stable chelates with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid* (although containing an aldehyde, the ortho-hydroxyl can chelate)
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (hydroxyl group is not ortho to the carboxyl group)

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with **functional groups capable of intramolecular interactions** (e.g., hydrogen bonding) that **reduce availability** of coordinating sites predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Intramolecular interactions sequester functional groups, limiting their ability to coordinate with metal centers.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid* (complex intramolecular interactions)
    - *4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid*

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers containing **chelating groups** such as **adjacent carbonyl and hydroxyl groups** predict a **high yield** due to enhanced coordination.
  - *Rationale*: Chelating groups form strong, multidentate interactions with metal centers, stabilizing the catalyst.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid* (Chelidamic acid)

**End of Rules**

---

These rules combine multiple functional groups and consider underlying physicochemical properties such as coordination abilities, electron-withdrawing or -donating effects, steric hindrance, and potential for chelation. Each rule is designed to predict whether a modifier will result in a high or low yield based on its structural features, aiming to cover a broad range of the dataset. By balancing simple rules with higher coverage and more complex rules with specific conditions, these guidelines can effectively assist in selecting molecular modifiers to optimize the reaction yield.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**:
  
  **Rule 1** is clear in identifying modifiers that are **α-amino acids** as predictors of high yield. The rule provides strong physical-chemical insight by explaining how the α-amino and carboxyl groups act as bidentate ligands, enhancing catalyst performance through chelation. It considers a combination of functional groups (amino and carboxyl groups attached to the same carbon), demonstrating appropriate complexity. The rule is well-supported by multiple data points in the dataset, such as *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid*, *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid*, and *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid*, all showing high yield. Therefore, **Rule 1 effectively meets all the criteria**.

- **Comment 2**:
  
  **Rule 2** aims to predict yield based on the presence of electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups on aromatic carboxylic acids. While the rule is generally clear, there is a discrepancy with the example of *4-aminobenzoic acid*, which has an electron-donating amino group yet results in a high yield. The rationale mentions that amino groups can act as additional coordination sites, which may override their electron-donating nature. This indicates that the rule could be refined to include substituents that provide additional coordination, regardless of their electronic effects. The physical-chemical insight is sound, but the **rule lacks clarity due to conflicting examples**, and it may benefit from revision for better accuracy.

- **Comment 3**:
  
  **Rule 3** is clear in stating that **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids** containing **pyridine nitrogen atoms** predict a high yield when steric hindrance is minimal. The rule provides solid physical-chemical insight, explaining how nitrogen atoms serve as additional coordination sites. It appropriately considers combinations of sub-structures, reflecting suitable complexity. The rule is well-supported by data points such as *pyridine-3-carboxylic acid*, *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*, and *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid*, all yielding high results. Therefore, **Rule 3 effectively meets all the criteria**.

- **Comment 4**:
  
  **Rule 4** clearly identifies that **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **long hydrocarbon chains (six or more carbons)** and **no polar substituents** predict a high yield. The rationale provides adequate physical-chemical insight by explaining how hydrophobic chains enhance substrate access through favorable van der Waals interactions. The rule considers multiple structural features, demonstrating appropriate complexity. It is supported by data points like *octanoic acid* showing high yield and contrasts with *7-aminoheptanoic acid* and *8-aminooctanoic acid* showing low yield due to polar substituents. Thus, **Rule 4 meets all the criteria effectively**.

- **Comment 5**:
  
  **Rule 5** is clear in stating that modifiers with **hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a high yield, while those with distant hydroxyl groups predict a low yield. The rationale offers sound physical-chemical insight into how adjacent hydroxyl groups participate in chelation. The rule considers combinations of functional groups, demonstrating appropriate complexity. It is supported by high yield examples like *gluconic acid* and *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*, and low yield examples like *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*. Therefore, **Rule 5 effectively meets all the criteria**.

- **Comment 6**:
  
  **Rule 6** is clear and specifies that modifiers with **thiol groups within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a high yield, while those with thiol groups in an aromatic ring predict a low yield. The physical-chemical insight is strong, explaining how proximal thiol groups enhance metal coordination and how aromatic thiols are less effective due to resonance stabilization. The rule demonstrates appropriate complexity and is supported by data points like *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid* (high yield) and *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* (low yield). Thus, **Rule 6 effectively meets all the criteria**.

- **Comment 7**:
  
  **Rule 7** is clear in predicting that modifiers containing **perfluoroalkyl groups** attached to the carboxyl group result in a low yield. The rationale provides solid physical-chemical insight by explaining how strong electron-withdrawing groups reduce electron density on coordinating atoms. However, the rule is only supported by a single data point (*2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*), which limits its coverage. While the rule is valid, **the limited data support reduces its overall effectiveness**.

- **Comment 8**:
  
  **Rule 8** clearly states that **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the aromatic ring** predict a low yield. The rationale provides adequate physical-chemical insight by highlighting how these groups can interfere with metal coordination. The rule is appropriately complex and is supported by data points like *4-formylbenzoic acid* and *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid* (both showing low yield). Therefore, **Rule 8 effectively meets all the criteria**.

- **Comment 9**:
  
  **Rule 9** is clear in indicating that modifiers with **amide bonds involving the carboxyl group** or are **N-acetylated amino acids** predict a low yield. The physical-chemical insight is solid, explaining how amide formation reduces the availability of coordinating groups. The rule considers combinations of sub-structures and is supported by data points such as *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* and *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*. Thus, **Rule 9 effectively meets all the criteria**.

- **Comment 10**:
  
  **Rule 10** clearly predicts that **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **ether linkages** and **terminal polar groups** result in a low yield. The rationale offers sound physical-chemical insight into how ether linkages reduce effective coordination due to increased flexibility. The rule demonstrates appropriate complexity and is supported by data points like *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid* and *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*. Therefore, **Rule 10 meets all the criteria effectively**.

- **Comment 11**:
  
  **Rule 11** is clear in stating that modifiers with **bulky substituents near coordinating sites** predict a low yield due to steric hindrance. The physical-chemical insight is strong, explaining how steric effects impede metal coordination. The rule is appropriately complex and is supported by data points like *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (low yield) and *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid* (high yield due to reduced steric hindrance). Thus, **Rule 11 effectively meets all the criteria**.

- **Comment 12**:
  
  **Rule 12** clearly indicates that modifiers with **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** where **polar functional groups** are located more than **four carbons away** from the carboxyl group predict a low yield. The rationale provides adequate physical-chemical insight by explaining the diminished effectiveness of distant polar groups in coordination. The rule is appropriately complex and supported by data points like *7-aminoheptanoic acid*, *8-aminooctanoic acid*, and *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (all showing low yield). Therefore, **Rule 12 meets all the criteria effectively**.

- **Comment 13**:
  
  **Rule 13** suggests that **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **ortho-hydroxyl groups** predict a high yield due to chelation potential. However, the example provided, *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*, shows a low yield in the dataset, which contradicts the rule. This inconsistency indicates a lack of clarity and suggests that other factors (such as the presence of an adjacent aldehyde group, as noted in Rule 8) may override the effect of the ortho-hydroxyl group. Therefore, **Rule 13 lacks clarity and is not sufficiently supported by data**, reducing its effectiveness.

- **Comment 14**:
  
  **Rule 14** clearly states that modifiers with **functional groups capable of intramolecular interactions** that reduce availability of coordinating sites predict a low yield. The rationale provides solid physical-chemical insight into how intramolecular interactions can sequester coordinating groups. The rule is appropriately complex and is supported by data points like *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid* and *4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid*. Thus, **Rule 14 effectively meets all the criteria**.

- **Comment 15**:
  
  **Rule 15** is clear in indicating that modifiers containing **chelating groups** (e.g., adjacent carbonyl and hydroxyl groups) predict a high yield due to enhanced coordination. The physical-chemical insight is strong, explaining how chelating groups form multidentate interactions with metal centers. The rule is appropriately complex and is supported by data points like *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid* and *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid* (both showing high yield). Therefore, **Rule 15 effectively meets all the criteria**.

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (L-Aspartic acid)
    - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (L-Glutamic acid)
    - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (L-Tryptophan)
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyl-L-Lysine; acylation reduces amino group availability for coordination)

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-withdrawing groups at the para position** predict a **high yield**; those with **electron-donating groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and hinder coordination.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *4-nitrobenzoic acid* (nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing)
    - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid* (bromomethyl group withdraws electrons)
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid* (amino group acts as an additional coordination site)
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (methyl group is electron-donating)
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (hydroxy group is electron-donating and too distant for effective coordination)

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids** containing **pyridine nitrogen atoms** predict a **high yield**, provided steric hindrance is minimal.
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles serve as additional coordination sites, strengthening interactions with metal centers.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
    - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid* (Chelidamic acid)
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (bulky structure introduces steric hindrance, impeding coordination)

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **long hydrocarbon chains (six or more carbons)** and **no polar substituents** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Hydrophobic chains enhance substrate access to active sites through favorable van der Waals interactions within the catalyst's environment.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *Octanoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid* (terminal amino group may interfere with catalyst interactions)
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that have **hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**; those with hydroxyl groups distant from the carboxyl group predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Adjacent hydroxyl groups can participate in chelation with metal centers, enhancing coordination. Distant hydroxyl groups are less effective.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
    - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (hydroxyl group is too distant to assist in coordination)

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that have **thiol groups within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**; those where the thiol group is part of an aromatic ring predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Proximal thiol groups enhance metal coordination through sulfur atoms. Aromatic thiols may have reduced availability due to resonance stabilization.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid* (3-Mercaptopropionic acid)
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* (thiol group is less available due to aromaticity)

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing **perfluoroalkyl groups** attached to the carboxyl group predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Strong electron-withdrawing perfluoroalkyl groups reduce electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening metal-ligand interactions.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the aromatic ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Adjacent carbonyl groups can interfere with metal coordination or engage in side reactions, reducing catalyst effectiveness.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that have **amide bonds involving the carboxyl group** or are **N-acetylated amino acids** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide formation reduces the availability of free carboxyl and amino groups necessary for effective metal coordination.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyl-L-Lysine)
    - *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **ether linkages** and **terminal polar groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether linkages increase molecular flexibility and distance between functional groups, reducing effective coordination with metal centers.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **bulky substituents near coordinating sites** predict a **low yield** due to steric hindrance.
  - *Rationale*: Bulky groups impede effective alignment and interaction with the metal center.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (biphenyl structure causes steric hindrance)
  - *High Yield Counterexample*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid* (additional methylene units alleviate steric effects)

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** where **polar functional groups** are located more than **four carbons away** from the carboxyl group predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Distant polar groups are less effective in metal coordination and may disrupt favorable interactions within the catalytic system.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **ortho-hydroxyl groups** predict a **high yield** due to the potential for chelation.
  - *Rationale*: Ortho-hydroxyl groups can form stable chelates with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid* (although containing an aldehyde, the ortho-hydroxyl can chelate)
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (hydroxyl group is not ortho to the carboxyl group)

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with **functional groups capable of intramolecular interactions** (e.g., hydrogen bonding) that **reduce availability** of coordinating sites predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Intramolecular interactions sequester functional groups, limiting their ability to coordinate with metal centers.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid* (complex intramolecular interactions)
    - *4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid*

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers containing **chelating groups** such as **adjacent carbonyl and hydroxyl groups** predict a **high yield** due to enhanced coordination.
  - *Rationale*: Chelating groups form strong, multidentate interactions with metal centers, stabilizing the catalyst.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid* (Chelidamic acid)

**End of Rules**

---

These rules combine multiple functional groups and consider underlying physicochemical properties such as coordination abilities, electron-withdrawing or -donating effects, steric hindrance, and potential for chelation. Each rule is designed to predict whether a modifier will result in a high or low yield based on its structural features, aiming to cover a broad range of the dataset. By balancing simple rules with higher coverage and more complex rules with specific conditions, these guidelines can effectively assist in selecting molecular modifiers to optimize the reaction yield.---------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Revise the SMARTS pattern for Rule 2 to accurately capture para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups.**
  
  The current SMARTS patterns for Rule 2 are too general and do not specify the relative positions of the substituents on the aromatic ring. To detect electron-withdrawing groups at the *para* position relative to the carboxyl group, the SMARTS pattern should specify this positional relationship. Consider using:

  - For electron-withdrawing groups at the *para* position (predicting **high yield**):
    ```python
    aromatic_para_ewg = '[cH]1[cH][cH][c]([CX3](=O)[OX2H1])[cH][c]1[EWG]'
    ```
    Where `[EWG]` represents electron-withdrawing groups like `F`, `Cl`, `Br`, `I`, `N(=O)=O`, `C(F)(F)F`.

  - For electron-donating groups at the *para* position (predicting **low yield**):
    ```python
    aromatic_para_edg = '[cH]1[cH][cH][c]([CX3](=O)[OX2H1])[cH][c]1[EDG]'
    ```
    Where `[EDG]` represents electron-donating groups like `OCH3`, `CH3`, `OH`, `NH2`.

  Use these patterns to match *para*-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids more accurately.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Update the SMARTS pattern for Rule 3 to detect heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing pyridine nitrogen atoms without excessive specificity.**

  The current pattern may not match all relevant heteroaromatic structures. Use a more general pattern that identifies a pyridine ring with a carboxyl group:

  ```python
  pyridine_carboxylic_acid = 'n1ccccc1C(=O)O'
  ```

  This pattern matches pyridine rings substituted with a carboxyl group, ensuring that the nitrogen atom is part of the ring.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Modify the SMARTS pattern for Rule 5 to capture modifiers with hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group more effectively.**

  The current pattern may miss cases where there are multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups or ring structures. Use:

  ```python
  adjacent_hydroxyl_carboxylic_acid = '[OX2H][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
  ```

  Additionally, to include cases like gluconic acid with multiple hydroxyls:

  ```python
  multiple_adjacent_hydroxyls = '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CX4][OX2H][CX4][OX2H]'
  ```

  Combine these patterns to match molecules with one or more hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Implement positional specificity in SMARTS patterns for aromatic rings using indexing or recursive smarts.**

  For rules involving ortho, meta, or para substitutions (e.g., Rule 2 and Rule 13), specify atom indices to define the positions:

  ```python
  # Para substitution pattern
  para_substituted_aromatic = '[cH]1[cH][cH][cH][cH][c]1[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
  ```

  Use recursive SMARTS to define relationships between substituents on the ring.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Correct the SMARTS pattern for Rule 6 to account for variable carbon chain lengths up to three carbons between the thiol and carboxyl groups.**

  The current pattern is too rigid. Use a pattern that allows up to three carbons:

  ```python
  thiol_near_carboxylic_acid = '[SX2H][CX4]([CX4H2])[CX4H2][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
  ```

  Or use a more flexible pattern:

  ```python
  thiol_within_three_carbons = '[SX2H]C{0,2}C(=O)O'
  ```

- **Suggestion 6**: **Enhance Rule 7's pattern to detect any perfluoroalkyl group attached to the carboxyl group, not just trifluoromethyl.**

  The current pattern may miss longer perfluoroalkyl chains. Use:

  ```python
  perfluoroalkyl_carboxylic_acid = '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CX4][C;$(C(F)(F)F)]'
  ```

  Or a pattern that matches any perfluoroalkyl chain:

  ```python
  perfluoroalkyl_chain = '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CX4]([F])([F])[F,C]'
  ```

- **Suggestion 7**: **Refine the SMARTS pattern for Rule 9 to specifically detect amide bonds involving the carboxyl group.**

  The current pattern may incorrectly match amines adjacent to carboxylic acids. Use:

  ```python
  amide_bond_carboxylic_acid = '[CX3](=O)[NX3][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
  ```

  This ensures the pattern matches molecules where the carboxyl group forms an amide bond.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Adjust the SMARTS pattern for Rule 15 to detect chelating groups with adjacent carbonyl and hydroxyl groups accurately.**

  The current pattern may be too general. Use:

  ```python
  chelating_groups = '[#6][CX3](=O)[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
  ```

  Or for adjacent carbonyl and hydroxyl groups:

  ```python
  carbonyl_adjacent_hydroxyl = '[CX3](=O)[CX4]([OX2H])[#6]'
  ```

- **Suggestion 9**: **Incorporate checks for steric hindrance in patterns where relevant (e.g., Rule 3 and Rule 11).**

  Steric hindrance is challenging to capture with SMARTS alone. Consider using molecular descriptors or evaluating the size of substituents attached to key atoms.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Implement a validation step by cross-referencing the SMARTS matches with known examples and counterexamples provided in the rules.**

  After adjusting the SMARTS patterns, test them against the examples to ensure they match the intended molecules and not the counterexamples.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

---

**1. Comparison of Current Metrics with Reference Metrics**

**Confidence:**

- **Reference Metrics:**
  - *Train Confidence:* 0.6351 and 0.5396
  - *Test Confidence:* 0.3333 and 0.4639
- **Current Metrics (Latest Iteration):**
  - *Train Confidence:* Ranging from 0.5048 to 0.7529
  - *Final Train Confidence:* **0.6278**

**Observation:**

- The **current train confidence** of **0.6278** is comparable to the highest reference train confidence of **0.6351**, indicating a similar level of predictive accuracy on the training data.
- The **current confidence values** in the iteration generally exceed the lower reference confidence of **0.5396**, suggesting an overall improvement.

**Lift:**

- **Reference Metrics:**
  - *Train Lift:* 1.2048 and 1.0559
  - *Test Lift:* 0.6889 and 0.9137
- **Current Metrics (Latest Iteration):**
  - *Train Lift:* Ranging from 1.0074 to 1.5038
  - *Final Train Lift:* **1.2443**

**Observation:**

- The **current train lift** of **1.2443** surpasses both reference train lift values, indicating that the rules are more effective at improving prediction over the base rate.
- The higher lift values in the current iteration (up to **1.5038**) demonstrate the presence of more "interesting" rules with stronger associations.

---

**2. Evaluation of Rule Performance**

- **Improved Predictive Power:**
  - The **increase in confidence and lift** suggests that the current rules are more effective at predicting high yields than the previous set.
  - **Higher confidence** indicates that when a rule's conditions are met, the prediction is more likely to be correct.
  - **Higher lift** demonstrates that the rules provide greater predictive power over random chance.

- **Support Considerations:**
  - While **confidence and lift have improved**, **train support** has decreased in the current iteration (final train support of **0.0152**) compared to the reference metrics (train support ranging from **0.1667** to **0.1845**).
  - **Lower support** means the rules apply to a smaller portion of the dataset, potentially limiting their practical utility.

---

**3. Analysis of Iterations and Local Minimum**

- **Metrics Stabilization:**
  - Over the iterations, **lift and confidence values** have shown **incremental improvements** but with diminishing returns.
  - The latest metrics are comparable to previous high points, suggesting that further iterations yield minimal gains.

- **Local Minimum Indication:**
  - The **plateauing of confidence and lift** improvements, coupled with decreasing support, suggests that a **local minimum** may have been reached.
  - **Overfitting Risk:** The decrease in support could indicate that the rules are becoming too specific, capturing noise rather than general patterns.

---

**4. Recommendations for Improving the Current Rules**

**A. Increase Rule Generality to Improve Support**

- **Broaden Rule Conditions:**
  - **Generalize specific functional groups** to broader categories where possible (e.g., expand from "α-amino acids" to "amino acids").
  - **Combine similar rules** that target overlapping molecular features to increase coverage.

- **Example Improvement:**
  - Merge **Rule 1** (α-amino acids) and **Rule 5** (adjacent hydroxyl groups) into a rule about **small biomolecules with adjacent polar groups**, potentially increasing support.

**B. Optimize the Balance Between Confidence, Lift, and Support**

- **Assess Trade-offs:**
  - Accept a **slightly lower confidence** in exchange for a **significantly higher support** to make the rules more applicable.
  - **Aim for rules** with confidence similar to the reference metrics but with higher support than currently observed.

- **Example Adjustment:**
  - Modify **Rule 4** to include **medium-length hydrocarbon chains** (e.g., four or more carbons) to capture more modifiers while maintaining reasonable confidence.

**C. Refine Rules to Reduce Overfitting**

- **Avoid Overly Specific Conditions:**
  - **Review rules with very low support** (e.g., **Rules 11, 12**), which may be too narrow.
  - **Simplify complex rules** that may be capturing idiosyncratic patterns rather than generalizable features.

- **Example Modification:**
  - For **Rule 12**, instead of specifying "more than four carbons away," consider the general impact of distant polar groups on yield.

**D. Incorporate Negative Evidence Effectively**

- **Strengthen Discrimination:**
  - **Include more low-yield counterexamples** to enhance the rules' ability to distinguish between high and low yields.
  - **Explicitly state exceptions** within rules to clarify boundaries.

- **Example Enhancement:**
  - In **Rule 3**, specify that heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with significant steric hindrance or electron-donating substituents predict a low yield.

**E. Validate Rules with External Data**

- **Testing on Independent Data:**
  - **Evaluate the rules on an external test set** to ensure they generalize beyond the training data.
  - **Compare test metrics** to verify improvements are not due to overfitting.

**F. Explore Additional Molecular Features**

- **Utilize Computational Descriptors:**
  - **Incorporate quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) descriptors** to capture nuanced molecular properties.
  - **Leverage machine learning** to identify patterns not evident through manual rule creation.

**G. Iterative Refinement with Expert Feedback**

- **Engage Subject Matter Experts:**
  - **Consult chemists or catalysis experts** to validate the scientific rationale behind the rules.
  - **Adjust rules based on expert insights** to improve both theoretical soundness and empirical performance.

**H. Simplify and Prioritize Rules**

- **Reduce Redundancy:**
  - **Identify and merge overlapping rules**, focusing on the most impactful features.
  - **Prioritize rules with higher support and sufficient confidence** to maximize practical utility.

---

**5. Conclusion**

- **Current Rule Performance:**
  - The **current rules have improved in confidence and lift** compared to the reference metrics, indicating better predictive accuracy.
  - **Lower support** suggests that while the rules are more precise, they apply to fewer cases, potentially limiting their effectiveness.

- **Path Forward:**
  - **Aim to increase support** without significantly compromising confidence and lift.
  - **Balance specificity and generality** to create rules that are both accurate and widely applicable.
  - **Incorporate feedback loops** involving validation on test data and expert consultation to refine the rules further.

- **Local Minimum Consideration:**
  - Given the metrics have plateaued and support has diminished, it is likely that a **local minimum has been reached**.
  - **Shifting focus** from merely optimizing metrics to enhancing rule applicability and robustness may yield better overall outcomes.

---

By implementing these suggestions, the current set of rules can be refined to improve their predictive power while also increasing their applicability to a larger portion of the dataset, ultimately enhancing the effectiveness of the catalytic prediction model.

ML Commenter Message:
**Performance Analysis of Current Rules**

**1. Effectiveness of Current Rules**

Based on the latest training results, the performance of the current rules has declined compared to previous iterations. The key observations are:

- **Current Validation Accuracy**: The 5-fold validation accuracy in the latest iteration is **0.5429**, approximately **54.29%**.
- **Reference Validation Accuracies**: Previously, validation accuracies were consistently around **0.76** (76%).
- **Current Model Performance**: The current accuracy is significantly lower than the reference accuracies, indicating a decline in model performance.

This decline suggests that the current set of rules is less effective in accurately predicting the catalyst loading compared to previous iterations.

**2. Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment**

The reduction in validation accuracy implies potential issues with model fitting:

- **Underfitting**: The model may be underfitting, meaning it's too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data. This could result from oversimplified or overly restrictive rules that fail to account for important molecular features.
- **Overfitting**: Alternatively, if the rules have become too specific due to iterative refinements, the model might be overfitting to noise in the training data, reducing its generalizability to new data.

Given the significant drop in validation accuracy, underfitting is the more likely issue, as the model is not capturing enough of the relevant information to make accurate predictions.

**3. Analysis of Discrepancies Using SHAP Values**

To understand which rules are contributing to incorrect predictions, we examine the molecules where the predicted loading does not match the experimental value and analyze the SHAP values for each rule.

**Cases where Predicted Loading is Low but Experimental Value is High:**

1. **Molecule**: `C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O`

   - **Predicted Loading**: Low
   - **Experimental Value**: High
   - **SHAP Values**:
     - Rule 1: **-0.0246**
     - Rule 3: **-0.0202**
     - Rule 5: **0.0**
     - Rule 6: **-0.0204**

2. **Molecule**: `C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)N`

   - **Predicted Loading**: Low
   - **Experimental Value**: High
   - **SHAP Values**:
     - Rule 1: **-0.0246**
     - Rule 3: **-0.0202**
     - Rule 5: **0.0**
     - Rule 6: **-0.0204**

3. **Molecule**: `C([C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](C(=O)O)O)O)O)O)O`

   - **Predicted Loading**: Low
   - **Experimental Value**: High
   - **SHAP Values**:
     - Rule 1: **-0.0246**
     - Rule 3: **-0.0202**
     - Rule 5: **0.0**
     - Rule 6: **-0.0204**

**Analysis:**

- **Negative SHAP Values**: For these molecules, **Rule 1**, **Rule 3**, and **Rule 6** have significant negative SHAP values, indicating they are contributing to the underestimation of loading.
- **Rule 5**: Has a SHAP value of zero, suggesting it's not influencing the prediction for these molecules.

**Cases where Predicted Loading is High but Experimental Value is Low:**

1. **Molecule**: `CC(=O)NCCCC[C@@H](C(=O)O)N`

   - **Predicted Loading**: High
   - **Experimental Value**: Low
   - **SHAP Values**:
     - Rule 1: **0.5195** (high positive value)
     - Rule 3: **0.0**
     - Rule 5: **-0.0097**
     - Rule 6: **-0.0098**

**Analysis:**

- **Positive SHAP Value**: **Rule 1** has a high positive SHAP value, contributing significantly to the overestimation of loading.
- **Negative SHAP Values**: Rules 5 and 6 have small negative SHAP values but are overshadowed by Rule 1's influence.

**4. Interpretation of Accuracy Decline**

- **Decrease in Accuracy**: The decline from the reference validation accuracy of ~76% to the current 54.29% indicates that the changes made to the rules in the latest iteration may have adversely affected the model's ability to generalize.
- **Potential Causes**:
  - **Overly Restrictive Rules**: Some rules may be excluding molecules that should predict high loading, leading to underfitting.
  - **Overemphasis on Certain Features**: High positive SHAP values for incorrect predictions suggest that some rules may be overemphasizing certain features, leading to overestimation.

**5. Insights from SHAP Analysis**

- **Rule 1**:
  - High negative SHAP values in underpredicted molecules (e.g., `C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O`) suggest that **Rule 1** is contributing to underestimation.
  - High positive SHAP values in overpredicted molecules (e.g., `CC(=O)NCCCC[C@@H](C(=O)O)N`) indicate that **Rule 1** is causing overestimation.

- **Rule 3** and **Rule 6**:
  - Consistently negative SHAP values in underpredicted molecules suggest these rules might be too restrictive or incorrectly penalizing certain features.

- **Rule 5**:
  - Minimal SHAP values across molecules imply it's not significantly contributing to predictions and may require reevaluation.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

**1. Refine Rule 1**

- **Issue**: Rule 1 is causing both underestimations and overestimations due to high magnitude SHAP values in both directions.
- **Action**:
  - **Broaden Scope**: Consider expanding Rule 1 to include molecules that have similar coordination potential but do not strictly meet the definition of α-amino acids.
  - **Add Exceptions**: Identify and include exceptions where molecules structurally resemble α-amino acids but are currently excluded.
  - **Review Criteria**: Reevaluate the requirement that the amino and carboxyl groups must be attached to the same carbon. Some effective modifiers might have these groups separated by one carbon.

**2. Adjust Rule 3**

- **Issue**: Negative SHAP values in underpredicted molecules indicate Rule 3 may be too restrictive.
- **Action**:
  - **Relax Steric Hindrance Condition**: Reassess the emphasis on minimal steric hindrance. Some molecules with slight steric hindrance may still be effective.
  - **Expand Heterocycles**: Include other heteroaromatic rings with nitrogen or other heteroatoms that can participate in coordination.
  - **Incorporate Additional Functional Groups**: Consider heteroaromatic acids with additional coordinating groups like hydroxyl or amino groups.

**3. Reevaluate Rule 5**

- **Issue**: Rule 5 has minimal impact on predictions, as indicated by near-zero SHAP values.
- **Action**:
  - **Increase Applicability**: Modify Rule 5 to cover a broader range of molecules by including hydroxyl groups not strictly adjacent to the carboxyl group but still capable of coordination.
  - **Integrate with Other Rules**: Combine Rule 5 with other rules to capture synergistic effects of multiple functional groups.

**4. Modify Rule 6**

- **Issue**: Negative SHAP values in underpredicted molecules suggest that Rule 6 might be excluding effective modifiers.
- **Action**:
  - **Reassess Aromatic Thiols**: Reconsider the exclusion of thiol groups in aromatic rings. Some aromatic thiols may still effectively coordinate with metal centers.
  - **Include Exception Cases**: Identify aromatic thiols that have demonstrated high experimental loading and adjust the rule to include them.

**5. Address Underfitting**

- **Issue**: The model may be underfitting due to overly narrow rules.
- **Action**:
  - **Add New Rules**: Introduce additional rules to capture molecular features not currently considered.
  - **Incorporate Machine Learning Insights**: Use data-driven approaches to identify patterns and introduce rules based on observed correlations.

**6. Utilize SHAP Analysis Iteratively**

- **Focus on Misclassifications**: For molecules where predictions do not match experimental values:
  - **Underpredicted Molecules**:
    - Identify rules with high negative SHAP values.
    - Adjust these rules to reduce their negative impact.
  - **Overpredicted Molecules**:
    - Identify rules with high positive SHAP values.
    - Refine these rules to prevent overestimation.

**7. Improve Generalization**

- **Action**:
  - **Balance Rule Specificity**: Ensure rules are neither too broad (leading to overfitting) nor too narrow (leading to underfitting).
  - **Cross-Validation**: Use cross-validation techniques to assess the generalizability of the rules.
  - **Regularization**: Implement regularization methods to prevent over-reliance on any single rule.

**8. Validate and Iterate**

- **Retrain and Reevaluate**: After making adjustments, retrain the model and examine the validation accuracy and SHAP values.
- **Monitor Metrics**: Ensure that changes lead to improvements in both accuracy and the logical consistency of SHAP values.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Repeat the process, making incremental adjustments based on the latest performance until satisfactory accuracy is achieved.

**Conclusion**

By refining the rules based on the SHAP analysis and addressing the identified issues, it's possible to improve the model's predictive performance. The goal is to develop a set of rules that accurately capture the relevant molecular features influencing catalyst loading while maintaining generalizability across different molecules.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

---

**1. Summary of Discussions:**

The current set of rules aims to predict the yield of a radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction based on the structure of molecular modifiers. The discussions have identified several key points:

- **Performance Metrics Decline:** The latest iteration shows a decrease in validation accuracy to approximately 54.29%, down from previous accuracies around 76%. This suggests that recent changes to the rules may have adversely affected predictive performance.

- **SHAP Analysis Insights:** The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis indicates that certain rules are contributing negatively to the model's predictions. For example, Rule 1 shows large negative SHAP values for molecules where the model underpredicts yield and large positive values where it overpredicts, implying inconsistency and potential misclassification.

- **Rule Specificity and Overfitting Risks:** Some rules appear too restrictive or overly specific, leading to underfitting (failing to capture underlying patterns) and low support (applicability to only a small portion of the dataset).

- **Suggestions for Improvement:** The discussions include several suggestions to refine the SMARTS (SMiles ARbitrary Target Specification) patterns used in the rules, enhance generality, and balance specificity to improve model performance without overfitting.

---

**2. Directions to Optimize Current Rules and Suggestions for Improvement:**

To enhance the predictive accuracy of the rules without overfitting, the following recommendations are proposed:

**A. Refine SMARTS Patterns for Specificity and Coverage**

- **Rule 2 (Para-Substituted Aromatic Carboxylic Acids):**
  - **Issue:** Current patterns may not accurately capture the positional relationship of substituents.
  - **Suggestion:** Revise the SMARTS patterns to explicitly specify para substitutions with electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups.
    - *For Electron-Withdrawing Groups (High Yield):*
      ```python
      para_ewg = '[cH]1cc([cH])cc(c1)C(=O)O'
      ```
      - Add conditions for electron-withdrawing groups at the para position.
    - *For Electron-Donating Groups (Low Yield):*
      ```python
      para_edg = '[cH]1cc([cH])cc(c1)C(=O)O'
      ```
      - Add conditions for electron-donating groups at the para position.

- **Rule 3 (Heteroaromatic Carboxylic Acids with Pyridine Nitrogen Atoms):**
  - **Issue:** The current pattern may miss relevant molecules due to excessive specificity.
  - **Suggestion:** Use a more general SMARTS pattern that captures pyridine-containing carboxylic acids without being overly restrictive.
    - ```python
      pyridine_carboxylic_acid = 'n1ccc(C(=O)O)cc1'
      ```

**B. Adjust Rule Conditions for Broader Applicability**

- **Rule 1 (α-Amino Acids):**
  - **Issue:** Rule may be too narrow, excluding effective modifiers that don't strictly fit the α-amino acid definition.
  - **Suggestion:** Broaden the rule to include amino acids where amino and carboxyl groups are separated by one carbon (β-amino acids) or have additional functional groups enabling coordination.

- **Rule 5 (Hydroxyl Groups Adjacent to Carboxyl Group):**
  - **Issue:** Rule may not capture molecules with effective coordination but non-adjacent hydroxyl groups.
  - **Suggestion:** Modify the rule to include modifiers with hydroxyl groups within a certain distance from the carboxyl group, such as within two or three bonds, to increase coverage.

**C. Incorporate Steric Hindrance Considerations Wisely**

- **Issue:** Some rules may be overly penalizing steric hindrance, excluding modifiers that could be effective.
- **Suggestion:** Reevaluate the emphasis on steric hindrance in Rules 3 and 11. Allow flexibility for molecules where steric bulk does not significantly impede coordination.

**D. Enhance Rule Generality to Improve Support**

- **Issue:** Current rules may have low support due to specificity.
- **Suggestion:** Combine similar rules or expand them to include broader categories of functional groups. For example, merge rules focusing on chelating groups or coordination-enhancing substituents to cover more molecules.

**E. Refine Rules Based on SHAP Analysis**

- **Issue:** SHAP values indicate which rules are contributing negatively.
- **Suggestion:** For rules with high negative SHAP values in misclassified molecules:
  - **Rule 1:** Modify to reduce overemphasis on specific structural requirements.
  - **Rule 6:** Adjust to include aromatic thiols when they can effectively coordinate.

**F. Use Additional Molecular Descriptors**

- **Suggestion:** Incorporate computational descriptors such as electron density, partial charges, or molecular orbitals to capture nuanced factors influencing coordination and yield.

**G. Validate Rules with Known Examples and Counterexamples**

- **Issue:** Ensuring that rules correctly classify known high-yield and low-yield modifiers is crucial.
- **Suggestion:** After refining, test each rule against the provided examples and counterexamples to confirm accuracy.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids** (having both an amino group and a carboxyl group attached to the same carbon) predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: The α-amino and carboxyl groups can act as bidentate ligands, chelating metal centers and enhancing catalyst performance through strong coordination bonds.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid* (L-Aspartic acid)
    - *(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid* (L-Glutamic acid)
    - *(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid* (L-Tryptophan)
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyl-L-Lysine; acylation reduces amino group availability for coordination)

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-withdrawing groups at the para position** predict a **high yield**; those with **electron-donating groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and hinder coordination.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *4-nitrobenzoic acid* (nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing)
    - *4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid* (bromomethyl group withdraws electrons)
    - *4-aminobenzoic acid* (amino group acts as an additional coordination site)
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-methylbenzoic acid* (methyl group is electron-donating)
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (hydroxy group is electron-donating and too distant for effective coordination)

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids** containing **pyridine nitrogen atoms** predict a **high yield**, provided steric hindrance is minimal.
  - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles serve as additional coordination sites, strengthening interactions with metal centers.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
    - *1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid* (Chelidamic acid)
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (bulky structure introduces steric hindrance, impeding coordination)

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **long hydrocarbon chains (six or more carbons)** and **no polar substituents** predict a **high yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Hydrophobic chains enhance substrate access to active sites through favorable van der Waals interactions within the catalyst's environment.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *Octanoic acid*
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid* (terminal amino group may interfere with catalyst interactions)
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that have **hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**; those with hydroxyl groups distant from the carboxyl group predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Adjacent hydroxyl groups can participate in chelation with metal centers, enhancing coordination. Distant hydroxyl groups are less effective.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
    - *2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid* (hydroxyl group is too distant to assist in coordination)

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that have **thiol groups within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**; those where the thiol group is part of an aromatic ring predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Proximal thiol groups enhance metal coordination through sulfur atoms. Aromatic thiols may have reduced availability due to resonance stabilization.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *3-sulfanylpropanoic acid* (3-Mercaptopropionic acid)
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *4-sulfanylbenzoic acid* (thiol group is less available due to aromaticity)

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing **perfluoroalkyl groups** attached to the carboxyl group predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Strong electron-withdrawing perfluoroalkyl groups reduce electron density on coordinating atoms, weakening metal-ligand interactions.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid*

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the aromatic ring** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Adjacent carbonyl groups can interfere with metal coordination or engage in side reactions, reducing catalyst effectiveness.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *4-formylbenzoic acid*
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that have **amide bonds involving the carboxyl group** or are **N-acetylated amino acids** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Amide formation reduces the availability of free carboxyl and amino groups necessary for effective metal coordination.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid* (N-Acetyl-L-Lysine)
    - *2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid*

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **ether linkages** and **terminal polar groups** predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Ether linkages increase molecular flexibility and distance between functional groups, reducing effective coordination with metal centers.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
    - *3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **bulky substituents near coordinating sites** predict a **low yield** due to steric hindrance.
  - *Rationale*: Bulky groups impede effective alignment and interaction with the metal center.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (biphenyl structure causes steric hindrance)
  - *High Yield Counterexample*:
    - *4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid* (additional methylene units alleviate steric effects)

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids** where **polar functional groups** are located more than **four carbons away** from the carboxyl group predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Distant polar groups are less effective in metal coordination and may disrupt favorable interactions within the catalytic system.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *7-aminoheptanoic acid*
    - *8-aminooctanoic acid*
    - *7-hydroxyheptanoic acid*

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **ortho-hydroxyl groups** predict a **high yield** due to the potential for chelation.
  - *Rationale*: Ortho-hydroxyl groups can form stable chelates with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - *5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid* (although containing an aldehyde, the ortho-hydroxyl can chelate)
  - *Low Yield Counterexample*:
    - *3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (hydroxyl group is not ortho to the carboxyl group)

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with **functional groups capable of intramolecular interactions** (e.g., hydrogen bonding) that **reduce availability** of coordinating sites predict a **low yield**.
  - *Rationale*: Intramolecular interactions sequester functional groups, limiting their ability to coordinate with metal centers.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - *2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid* (complex intramolecular interactions)
    - *4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid*

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers containing **chelating groups** such as **adjacent carbonyl and hydroxyl groups** predict a **high yield** due to enhanced coordination.
  - *Rationale*: Chelating groups form strong, multidentate interactions with metal centers, stabilizing the catalyst.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - *1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid*
    - *2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid* (Chelidamic acid)

**End of Rules**

---

These rules combine multiple functional groups and consider underlying physicochemical properties such as coordination abilities, electron-withdrawing or -donating effects, steric hindrance, and potential for chelation. Each rule is designed to predict whether a modifier will result in a high or low yield based on its structural features, aiming to cover a broad range of the dataset. By balancing simple rules with higher coverage and more complex rules with specific conditions, these guidelines can effectively assist in selecting molecular modifiers to optimize the reaction yield.---------------------------------------------------------------
