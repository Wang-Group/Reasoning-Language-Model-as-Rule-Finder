**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with side-chain carboxyl groups**, such as **L-aspartic acid** (`(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid`) and **L-glutamic acid** (`(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid`), lead to **high yield**. The presence of both **amino** and multiple **carboxyl groups** allows for effective **multidentate chelation** with metal ions, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity through the formation of stable chelate complexes.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **ω-amino acids** with a carbon chain length of **five carbons or fewer**, like **5-aminopentanoic acid**, result in **high yield**. The proximity of the **amino** and **carboxyl** groups enables efficient **bidentate coordination** with metal ions, forming stable chelate rings that enhance catalyst activity. Conversely, longer-chain ω-amino acids (six carbons or more), such as **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**, lead to **low yield** due to decreased coordination efficiency caused by increased chain flexibility and distance between functional groups.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-withdrawing substituents** at the **para position**, such as **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**, lead to **high yield**. Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, improving its ability to coordinate with metal ions and form stable catalytic complexes through stronger **metal-ligand interactions**.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-donating substituents** at the **para position**, such as **4-methylbenzoic acid** and **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**, result in **low yield**. Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, weakening metal coordination interactions and reducing catalyst effectiveness due to less favorable **metal-ligand bonding**.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing **amino groups** capable of coordinating with metal ions, such as **4-aminobenzoic acid** and **5-aminopentanoic acid**, lead to **high yield** even if they possess electron-donating substituents. The additional **coordination site** provided by the amino group enhances **chelation**, strengthening the metal-modifier complex and improving catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing **nitrogen heterocycles** that can coordinate with metal ions, such as **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**, and **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**, result in **high yield**. Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles serve as effective **coordination sites**, enhancing **metal-ligand interactions** and promoting catalyst reactivity.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** without additional functional groups, such as **octanoic acid**, lead to **high yield**. The unbranched aliphatic chains may facilitate favorable **hydrophobic interactions** with the catalyst surface, potentially enhancing catalyst-modifier binding and activity through increased **proximity** and optimal **orientation**.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **multiple hydroxyl groups** near the carboxyl group, such as **gluconic acid** (`(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid`), lead to **high yield**. The multiple hydroxyl groups provide **multidentate coordination sites**, increasing catalyst stability and reactivity through stronger and more numerous **metal-ligand bonds**.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **aldehyde groups** adjacent to aromatic rings or carboxyl groups, such as **4-formylbenzoic acid** and **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**, result in **low yield**. Aldehyde groups can interfere with metal coordination by forming competing complexes or undergoing side reactions, diminishing catalyst performance due to **unfavorable interactions**.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing **sulfhydryl (-SH) groups** in an **aliphatic chain**, such as **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**, lead to **high yield**. Thiol groups have a strong affinity for metal ions, forming stable complexes through effective **sulfur-metal coordination**. However, when the sulfhydryl group is on an **aromatic ring**, as in **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**, the yield is **low**, possibly due to steric hindrance or decreased sulfur reactivity in the aromatic system affecting **coordination efficiency**.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with **blocked or sterically hindered coordination sites**, such as **N-acetylated amino acids** like **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**, result in **low yield**. Blocking groups prevent amino functionalities from coordinating with metal ions, limiting **chelation** and decreasing catalyst effectiveness due to reduced **metal-ligand interactions**.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **hydrophilic polyether carboxylic acids**, such as **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, lead to **low yield**. The presence of long **ether chains** may reduce the ability of the carboxyl group to coordinate with metal ions because of **solvation effects** and increased **steric hindrance**, weakening the **metal-ligand bonding** necessary for effective catalysis.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aromatic amino acids** with **electron-rich side chains**, such as **L-phenylalanine** (`(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid`), result in **low yield**. The electron-rich aromatic side chain can compete with the carboxyl group for coordination with metal ions or decrease the overall acidity, reducing catalyst effectiveness due to **competitive binding** or **weakened metal coordination**.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **pyridine-substituted aliphatic acids**, such as **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**, lead to **high yield**. The **pyridine nitrogen** offers an additional **coordination site**, enhancing **metal-ligand interactions** and improving catalyst reactivity through strengthened **chelation**.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with **long-chain hydroxy acids**, such as **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, result in **low yield**. The increased chain length and hydrophilicity may impede effective coordination with metal ions and interfere with catalyst-modifier interactions due to **steric factors** and reduced **binding affinity**, leading to less efficient catalysis.
