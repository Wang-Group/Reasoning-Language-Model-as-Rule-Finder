**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **alpha-amino dicarboxylic acids**—specifically, **alpha-amino acids with an additional carboxyl group (-COOH) on the side chain**—result in a **high yield**. The presence of multiple coordination sites enhances binding to the metal center.

  - **High Yield Examples**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

  - **Low Yield Contrast**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine) lacks the additional carboxyl group, leading to a **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-donating groups** such as **amino (-NH₂)** or **hydroxyl (-OH)** in the **para position** of the aromatic ring result in a **high yield**. These groups increase electron density, enhancing interaction with metal centers.

  - **High Yield Examples**:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**

  - **Low Yield Examples**:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid** has a weakly donating methyl group but results in a **low yield**, possibly due to insufficient electron donation.
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** has the hydroxyl group further from the carboxyl group, leading to a **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **functional groups** (**amino**, **hydroxyl**, or **thiol**) within **three carbons** of the **carboxyl group** result in a **high yield**. Close proximity of these groups facilitates effective chelation with metal centers.

  - **High Yield Examples**:
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (amino group three carbons away)
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (thiol group adjacent to the carboxyl group)
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

  - **Low Yield Examples**:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid** have amino groups too far from the carboxyl group (more than three carbons away), resulting in a **low yield**.
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** has a hydroxyl group distant from the carboxyl group, leading to a **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids** containing **nitrogenous heterocycles** directly attached to the **carboxyl group** result in a **high yield**. Nitrogen atoms in the ring enhance coordination with metal centers.

  - **High Yield Examples**:
    - **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

  - **Low Yield Example**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** has the heterocycle connected via another ring, reducing nitrogen accessibility, resulting in a **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **electron-withdrawing groups** such as **formyl (-CHO)** or **trifluoromethyl (-CF₃)** attached to the ring result in a **low yield**. Electron withdrawal decreases coordination ability with metal ions.

  - **Low Yield Examples**:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

  - **High Yield Exception**:
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** results in a **high yield**, possibly due to the nitro group's unique ability to participate in coordination or influence metal oxidation states favorably.

---

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with **amide bonds (-CONH-)** adjacent to the **carboxyl group** result in a **low yield**. Amide resonance stabilization reduces the availability of lone pairs on nitrogen for metal coordination.

  - **Low Yield Examples**:
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
    - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**

---

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing **ether linkages (-O-)** in the side chain near the **carboxyl group** result in a **low yield**. Ether oxygen atoms can create steric hindrance and reduce effective coordination with metal centers.

  - **Low Yield Examples**:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with **multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH)** in close proximity to the **carboxyl group** result in a **high yield**. Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance chelation with metal ions.

  - **High Yield Examples**:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**

---

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **thiol groups (-SH)** in close proximity to the **carboxyl group** result in a **high yield**. Thiol groups form strong bonds with metal centers due to their soft Lewis base character.

  - **High Yield Example**:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

  - **Low Yield Example**:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** has the thiol group attached to an aromatic ring, which may hinder its ability to coordinate effectively, resulting in a **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **alpha-amino acids** with **bulky hydrophobic side chains** and **no additional coordinating groups** result in a **low yield**. Steric hindrance interferes with effective metal coordination.

  - **Low Yield Example**:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

  - **High Yield Exception**:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan) contains an indole ring with a nitrogen atom that can participate in coordination, resulting in a **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers containing **ketone groups (-C=O)** in the carbon chain near the **carboxyl group** can result in a **low yield**. The ketone oxygen may compete with the carboxylate for metal coordination, disrupting the desired interaction.

  - **Low Yield Example**:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

  - **High Yield Example**:
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** results in a **high yield**, possibly due to the presence of methoxy groups enhancing overall coordination despite the ketone.

---

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **multiple coordinating functional groups** (e.g., **amino** and **carboxyl**, **hydroxyl** and **carboxyl**) in close proximity result in a **high yield**. Chelation enhances binding strength to metal centers.

  - **High Yield Examples**:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length carbon chains** (six to eight carbons) and **no additional polar functional groups** can result in a **high yield**. The hydrophobic chains may enhance interaction with the catalyst framework or solvent.

  - **High Yield Example**:
    - **octanoic acid**

  - **Low Yield Example**:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** has a hydroxyl group disrupting the hydrophobic character, leading to a **low yield**.

---

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers containing **biaryl structures**—aromatic rings connected via a **single bond**—without additional coordinating groups result in a **low yield**. Reduced flexibility and steric hindrance limit effective coordination.

  - **Low Yield Example**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

  - **High Yield Contrast**:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** has a methylene spacer increasing flexibility, resulting in a **high yield**.

---

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with **electron-donating methoxy groups (-OCH₃)** on the aromatic ring can result in a **high yield** by increasing electron density and facilitating coordination with metal centers.

  - **High Yield Example**:
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**
