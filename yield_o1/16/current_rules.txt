**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are **dicarboxylic amino acids** (α-amino acids with two carboxylate groups) result in a **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: The presence of two carboxylate groups and an amino group at the α-position allows for strong chelation with the Fe ion, enhancing catalyst stability and activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(2S)-2-Aminobutanedioic acid* (Aspartic acid)
      - *(2S)-2-Aminopentanedioic acid* (Glutamic acid)
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *(2S)-2-Amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine; only one carboxylate group)

---

- **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with a **para-substituted amino or nitro group** result in a **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Amino and nitro groups at the para-position can enhance metal coordination through lone pair electrons and influence electronic properties favorably.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *4-Aminobenzoic acid*
      - *4-Nitrobenzoic acid*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Methylbenzoic acid* (methyl group does not facilitate coordination)
      - *4-Formylbenzoic acid* (aldehyde group may not coordinate effectively)

---

- **Rule 3**: *Modifiers that are **linear aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **chain lengths of six to eight carbons** and **no additional polar substituents** result in a **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Medium-chain aliphatic acids can interact favorably with the catalyst surface without steric hindrance from polar groups, promoting efficient catalysis.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *Octanoic acid*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *7-Aminoheptanoic acid* (terminal amino group alters interaction)
      - *8-Aminooctanoic acid* (presence of polar amino group)

---

- **Rule 4**: *Modifiers that are **hydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group** result in a **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxylate can form additional coordination sites with the Fe ion, enhancing catalyst-modifier interactions.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-Pentahydroxyhexanoic acid* (Gluconic acid)
      - *2-[[1,3-Dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *7-Hydroxyheptanoic acid* (hydroxyl group too distant from the carboxyl group)

---

- **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with a **para-substituted bromomethyl group** result in a **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: The bromomethyl group can participate in interactions with the metal center or influence electronic properties, promoting catalytic activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *4-(Bromomethyl)benzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 6**: *Modifiers that are **heterocyclic carboxylic acids** where the **heterocycle contains nitrogen atoms** and the **carboxyl group is directly attached** result in a **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Nitrogen heterocycles can coordinate with Fe ions, and direct attachment of the carboxyl group facilitates chelation, enhancing catalyst performance.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid* (Nicotinic acid)
      - *1H-Pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (heterocycle not directly linked to carboxyl group)

---

- **Rule 7**: *Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with a **terminal thiol group** result in a **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Thiol groups can form strong coordination bonds with Fe ions, stabilizing the catalyst-modifier complex.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *3-Sulfanylpropanoic acid*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Sulfanylbenzoic acid* (thiol attached to aromatic ring may hinder coordination)

---

- **Rule 8**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with a **para-formyl (aldehyde) group** result in a **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups are electron-withdrawing and can reduce the ability of the carboxylate to coordinate with the Fe ion, diminishing catalyst efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Formylbenzoic acid*
      - *5-Formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 9**: *Modifiers that are **fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids** result in a **low yield** due to strong electron-withdrawing effects of fluorine atoms.*

  - **Explanation**: Fluorine's high electronegativity withdraws electron density, weakening coordination with the metal ion and reducing catalytic activity.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-Nonafluoropentanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 10**: *Modifiers containing **ether linkages** near the carboxyl group result in a **low yield** due to decreased coordination ability and increased flexibility.*

  - **Explanation**: Ether linkages can reduce the electron density available for coordination and introduce conformational flexibility that hinders effective binding to the Fe ion.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *2-[2-(2-Methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid*
      - *3-[2-(2-Aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 11**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with a **para-methyl group** result in a **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Methyl groups do not enhance coordination with the metal ion and may not significantly influence the electron density of the carboxylate group.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Methylbenzoic acid*

---

- **Rule 12**: *Modifiers that are **amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains** (e.g., aromatic rings or long aliphatic chains) result in a **low yield** due to steric hindrance.*

  - **Explanation**: Bulky side chains can obstruct effective coordination between the modifier and the Fe ion, decreasing catalyst performance.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *(2S)-2-Amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid* (Phenylalanine)
      - *(2S)-6-Acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 13**: *Modifiers that are **linear aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **terminal amino groups located six or more carbons away** from the carboxyl group result in a **low yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: The distant amino group is less effective in forming chelates with the metal ion, reducing coordination efficiency.

  - **Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *7-Aminoheptanoic acid*
      - *8-Aminooctanoic acid*

---

- **Rule 14**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** connected via an **aliphatic spacer (four carbons or more)** to a **heterocyclic ring** result in a **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: The aliphatic spacer provides flexibility, allowing both the aromatic and heterocyclic moieties to coordinate effectively with the Fe ion.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *4-Pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *4-Pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid* (no aliphatic spacer)

---

- **Rule 15**: *Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with a **para-hydroxy group directly attached** to the ring result in a **low yield**, whereas those with the hydroxy group attached via an **aliphatic linker** result in a **high yield**.*

  - **Explanation**: Direct attachment may hinder coordination due to hydrogen bonding or steric effects, while an aliphatic linker provides flexibility for effective coordination.

  - **Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - *5-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid* (hydroxyphenyl group linked via an aliphatic chain)
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *3-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid* (hydroxy group directly attached to aromatic ring)

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been developed by analyzing the provided dataset and identifying patterns between functional groups in the molecular modifiers and their corresponding yields in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. The rules combine multiple sub-structures and consider underlying physicochemical properties such as coordination ability, electronic effects, steric hindrance, and the spatial arrangement of functional groups.

- **Coverage and Balance**:
  - The rules cover a broad range of modifiers in the dataset, with a balance between simple rules with higher coverage (e.g., **Rule 2** on para-substituted amino or nitro groups) and more specific rules with lower coverage (e.g., **Rule 9** on fluorinated acids).
  - By prioritizing rules that encompass multiple structural features, the set provides comprehensive insights into how different modifiers affect the reaction yield.

- **Physicochemical Considerations**:
  - **Coordination Ability**: Functional groups capable of donating lone pair electrons (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, thiol, nitrogen in heterocycles) enhance coordination with the Fe ion, improving catalyst activity.
  - **Electronic Effects**: Electron-donating groups increase electron density on coordinating atoms, while electron-withdrawing groups decrease it, affecting coordination strength.
  - **Steric Hindrance**: Bulky substituents or inappropriate positioning of functional groups can obstruct effective interaction with the metal center.
  - **Chain Length and Flexibility**: Optimal distances between functional groups enable effective chelation and coordination with the metal ion.

By applying these rules, chemists can predict whether a given molecular modifier is likely to result in a high or low yield, aiding in the rational design and optimization of the catalyst system for improved reaction outcomes.
