- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with non-aromatic side chains** predict **high yield**. These molecules have an amino group attached to the α-carbon adjacent to the carboxylic acid, and their side chains are small, polar, or non-aromatic. The absence of bulky or aromatic side chains allows better interaction with the catalyst’s active sites. Examples include **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** and **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid**.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with aromatic side chains** predict **low yield**, except when the side chain contains an **indole ring**, which predicts **high yield**. Aromatic side chains can introduce steric hindrance, reducing catalyst access. However, indole groups may facilitate π-π stacking or coordination with the catalyst, enhancing yield. Examples: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** predicts **low yield**; **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** predicts **high yield**.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **ω-amino acids with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer** predict **high yield**, while those with longer chains predict **low yield**. Shorter chains allow the amino group to interact effectively with the catalyst, enhancing reactivity. Examples: **5-aminopentanoic acid** predicts **high yield**; **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid** predict **low yield** due to increased chain flexibility and reduced effective concentration at the active site.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position** predict **high yield**, except when the substituent is a **formyl group**, which predicts **low yield**. EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, improving coordination with the metal center. Examples: **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** predict **high yield**; **4-formylbenzoic acid** predicts **low yield** possibly due to chelation via the aldehyde, deactivating the catalyst.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **benzoic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position** predict **variable yields**. **Para-amino-substituted benzoic acids** predict **high yield** due to enhanced coordination through the amino group. Other EDGs like methyl or hydroxy groups may reduce acidity and hinder catalyst interaction, predicting **low yield**. Examples: **4-aminobenzoic acid** predicts **high yield**; **4-methylbenzoic acid** and **4-hydroxybenzoic acid** predict **low yield**.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups** predict **high yield**. The hydrophobic chains can interact favorably with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst, improving substrate alignment. Example: **octanoic acid** predicts **high yield**.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal hydroxyl or amino groups** predict **low yield**. Additional polar groups may lead to unwanted side interactions or interfere with catalyst binding. Examples: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** and **7-aminoheptanoic acid** predict **low yield**.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with **perfluorinated alkyl chains** predict **low yield**. The high electronegativity and steric bulk of fluorine atoms can hinder effective interaction with the catalyst’s active sites. Example: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** predicts **low yield**.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **pyridine carboxylic acids**—where the carboxyl group is directly attached to the pyridine ring—predict **high yield**.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers where a **pyridine ring is connected to a carboxylic acid via an alkyl chain** predict **high yield**, as the flexible linker allows simultaneous interactions with the catalyst. In contrast, modifiers where the pyridine ring is connected via a phenyl ring predict **low yield** due to rigidity and steric hindrance. Examples: **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** predicts **high yield**; **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** predicts **low yield**.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with **long hydrophilic chains or ether linkages**, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) units, predict **low yield**. These groups increase steric bulk and solubility in the solvent over binding affinity to the catalyst, reducing effectiveness. Examples: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** predict **low yield**.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **thiol groups attached to aliphatic chains** predict **high yield**. Aliphatic thiols can form favorable interactions with the catalyst without deactivating it. In contrast, **thiol groups attached to aromatic rings** predict **low yield** because they may bind too strongly to the metal center, inhibiting catalytic activity. Examples: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** predicts **high yield**; **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** predicts **low yield**.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **phenylalkanoic acids with aliphatic chains longer than three carbons**, especially when substituted with **electron-donating groups (EDGs)**, predict **high yield**. The longer linker allows optimal positioning of the aromatic ring, and EDGs can enhance interactions with the catalyst. Modifiers with shorter chains predict **low yield** due to suboptimal positioning. Examples: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** and **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** predict **high yield**; **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** predicts **low yield**.

These molecules have an amino group attached to the α-carbon adjacent to the carboxylic acid and side chains that are small, polar, or hydrophilic. Examples include **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid). The small side chains facilitate efficient coordination with the catalyst's active site, enhancing reactivity.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains** predict **low yield**. Bulky aromatic groups introduce steric hindrance, reducing the ability of the amino acid to coordinate effectively with the catalyst. An example is **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine), where the phenyl ring impedes optimal interaction with the catalytic center.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains (e.g., indole ring)** predict **high yield**. The presence of a heteroaromatic ring like indole can form favorable interactions with the catalyst, possibly through π-π stacking or coordination with metal centers. An example is **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan), which enhances the reaction yield due to these interactions.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **ω-amino acids with carbon chain lengths of five or fewer** predict **high yield**, whereas those with longer chains predict **low yield**. Short-chain ω-amino acids like **5-aminopentanoic acid** have an amino group at the terminal position of a short aliphatic chain, allowing for effective interaction with the catalyst. In contrast, longer chains like **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid** are more flexible and decrease the local concentration of functional groups near the catalyst, leading to lower yields.

**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: *Rule 1* is clear and unambiguous, allowing for precise predictions of high yield when modifiers are α-amino acids with small or polar side chains. This is supported by data points 0 and 2—**(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** and **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid**—both yielding high results. The rule provides adequate physical-chemical insight by explaining how small side chains enhance coordination with the catalyst's active site. It considers combinations of sub-structures, specifically the α-amino acid backbone and side chain properties. With at least two supporting data points, it has sufficient coverage and balances complexity with applicability effectively.

- **Comment 2**: *Rule 2* offers clear guidance, predicting low yield for α-amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains. The rule is exemplified by **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (data point 13), which indeed shows a low yield. The property insight is solid, attributing low reactivity to steric hindrance from bulky side chains. While the rule considers structural combinations, its coverage is limited to a single data point, reducing its robustness. A broader dataset would strengthen the rule's applicability.

- **Comment 3**: *Rule 3* is clear in predicting high yield for α-amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains, such as the indole ring in **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (data point 15). The property insight is adequate, suggesting favorable interactions like π-π stacking enhance reactivity. However, the rule's coverage is limited to one data point, which undermines its generalizability. Including more examples would improve the rule's strength and balance between specificity and coverage.

- **Comment 4**: *Rule 4* clearly differentiates between high and low yields based on the chain length of ω-amino acids. High yield is predicted for chain lengths of five or fewer carbons, as seen with **5-aminopentanoic acid** (data point 3), while longer chains like **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid** (data points 31 and 34) yield low results. The rule offers sound property insight by explaining how chain length affects functional group proximity to the catalyst. It effectively considers combinations of sub-structures and has good coverage with multiple data points, achieving a commendable balance between complexity and applicability.

- **Comment 5**: *Rule 5* attempts to correlate the electronic nature of para-substituents on benzoic acids with yield outcomes. While it is clear in concept, the rule has inconsistencies. For instance, **4-aminobenzoic acid** (data point 4) is predicted to yield high results due to an EWG, but the amino group is typically an electron-donating group (EDG). Conversely, **4-formylbenzoic acid** (data point 19), which contains an EWG, shows a low yield, contradicting the rule. These discrepancies indicate inadequate property insight and compromise clarity. Although the rule considers specific functional group combinations and has multiple data points, the inconsistencies reduce its effectiveness and balance.

- **Comment 6**: *Rule 6* provides clear and accurate predictions for high yield with pyridine carboxylic acids directly attached to the pyridine ring, supported by **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** and **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (data points 21 and 8). The property insight is well-founded, highlighting the role of the pyridine nitrogen in coordinating with metal ions. The rule appropriately considers combinations of sub-structures and maintains a good balance between complexity and coverage with sufficient supporting data.

- **Comment 7**: *Rule 7* is clear in predicting high yield for modifiers where a pyridine ring is linked to a carboxylic acid via a flexible aliphatic chain, exemplified by **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** (data point 24). The rule provides adequate property insight but is limited by coverage, relying on a single data point. To strengthen the rule's applicability and balance, additional supporting data would be beneficial.

- **Comment 8**: *Rule 8* clearly predicts low yield for modifiers with a pyridine ring connected through a rigid aromatic linker, as seen with **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (data point 12). The rule offers solid property insight into how rigidity and steric hindrance impede effective catalyst interaction. However, like the previous rule, it suffers from limited coverage with only one supporting data point, affecting its balance and general applicability.

- **Comment 9**: *Rule 9* predicts high yield for medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups, with **octanoic acid** (data point 5) serving as an example. The rule is clear and provides reasonable property insight into hydrophobic interactions facilitating the reaction. Nonetheless, its coverage is minimal, supported by a single data point, which diminishes its robustness. Including more data points would improve the rule's balance between simplicity and coverage.

- **Comment 10**: *Rule 10* effectively predicts low yield for aliphatic carboxylic acids with additional terminal polar groups, supported by **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** and **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (data points 29 and 31). The rule is clear, with adequate property insight explaining how polar groups can disrupt the catalyst's hydrophobic environment. It considers specific structural features and has sufficient coverage, achieving a satisfactory balance between complexity and applicability.

These modifiers have an amino group attached to the α-carbon adjacent to the carboxylic acid and side chains that are small, polar, or hydrophilic. Examples include **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid). Their structures facilitate effective coordination with the catalyst through multiple coordination sites, enhancing reactivity.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains** predict a **low yield**. The presence of bulky aromatic groups like phenyl rings introduces steric hindrance, reducing the ability of the amino acid to coordinate effectively with the catalyst. An example is **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine), where the phenyl group impedes optimal interaction with the catalytic center.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains**, such as the indole ring, predict a **high yield**. The heteroaromatic side chains can form favorable interactions with the catalyst, possibly through π-π stacking or coordination with metal centers via heteroatoms. An example is **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan).

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **ω-amino acids with carbon chain lengths of five carbons or fewer** predict a **high yield**, while those with longer chains predict a **low yield**. Short-chain ω-amino acids like **5-aminopentanoic acid** have an amino group that remains in proximity to the carboxylic acid, allowing effective bidentate coordination with the catalyst. Longer chains like **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid** are more flexible, which can reduce effective coordination.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **benzoic acids substituted at the para position with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)**, such as **nitro** or **bromomethyl**, predict a **high yield**. EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid and can enhance metal coordination. Examples include **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**. Conversely, modifiers substituted with electron-donating groups (EDGs) like **methyl** or **hydroxy** at the para position predict a **low yield**, as seen with **4-methylbenzoic acid** and **4-hydroxybenzoic acid** derivatives.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **benzoic acids substituted at the para position with amino groups** predict a **high yield**. Despite amino groups being EDGs, the lone pair on the nitrogen can participate in additional coordination with the catalyst. An example is **4-aminobenzoic acid**.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **pyridine carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the pyridine ring** predict a **high yield**. The nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring can act as a coordination site, enhancing interaction with the catalyst. Examples include **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid) and **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers where a **pyridine ring is connected to a carboxylic acid via a flexible aliphatic chain** predict a **high yield**. The flexible linker allows both the pyridine nitrogen and the carboxylate group to interact simultaneously with the catalyst. An example is **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers where a **pyridine ring is connected to a carboxylic acid through a rigid aromatic linker** predict a **low yield**. The rigidity and steric hindrance prevent optimal alignment of functional groups for effective catalyst interaction. An example is **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups**, such as **octanoic acid**, predict a **high yield**. The hydrophobic chain may enhance interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or substrate, facilitating the reaction.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with additional terminal polar groups** (e.g., **hydroxy** or **amino** groups) and chain lengths longer than five carbons predict a **low yield**. The presence of polar groups at the termini of long flexible chains can lead to unfavorable interactions or reduce effective coordination due to increased conformational freedom. Examples include **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** and **7-aminoheptanoic acid**.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that contain **multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group**, such as **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid), predict a **high yield**. The multiple hydroxyl groups can form additional hydrogen bonds or coordinate with the catalyst, enhancing reactivity.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with perfluorinated aliphatic chains** predict a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms and the hydrophobic nature of perfluorinated chains can reduce interaction with the catalyst. An example is **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with ether linkages and terminal amino groups** predict a **low yield**. The ether linkages increase chain flexibility, and the terminal amino group may be sterically hindered from effective coordination. An example is **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids linked to polar aromatic groups via flexible chains** predict a **high yield**. The flexible linker allows simultaneous interaction of the aromatic ring and the carboxyl group with the catalyst. An example is **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.

The physicochemical insight about chain flexibility impacting coordination is well-founded. The rule considers combinations of features (chain length and ω-amino group) and is supported by multiple data points for both high and low yields, satisfying all criteria.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 provides a clear distinction between modifiers with EWGs and EDGs at the para position of benzoic acids, predicting high and low yields respectively. The physicochemical reasoning about acidity and metal coordination is solid. The rule considers combined substructures and is well-supported by multiple data points, fulfilling all criteria admirably.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear in its prediction of high yield for benzoic acids substituted with amino groups at the para position. The additional coordination through the amino group offers good physicochemical insight. However, the rule's coverage is limited to a single data point (4-aminobenzoic acid), indicating a need for more examples.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear and effectively links high yield to pyridine carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group attached directly to the ring. The insight about nitrogen coordination is pertinent. The rule considers combined structural features and is supported by at least two data points (pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid), meeting all criteria.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 clearly predicts high yield for modifiers where a pyridine ring is connected to a carboxylic acid via a flexible chain. The physicochemical rationale is sound. While the rule is structurally insightful, coverage is limited to one data point (4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid), necessitating more supporting data.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear in associating low yield with rigid aromatic linkers between pyridine rings and carboxylic acids. The physicochemical reasoning regarding steric hindrance is appropriate. However, coverage is limited to a single data point (4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid), indicating the need for additional examples.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear, predicting high yield for medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without polar groups. The insight into hydrophobic interactions is logical. The rule's complexity is adequate, but coverage is limited to one data point (octanoic acid). Expanding the dataset would enhance the rule's validity.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear and provides good insight into how terminal polar groups in long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids lead to low yield due to reduced coordination. The rule considers combined structural features and is supported by multiple data points (7-hydroxyheptanoic acid and 7-aminoheptanoic acid), satisfying all criteria well.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 clearly predicts high yield for modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group. The physicochemical insight regarding enhanced coordination is solid. The rule considers combined features and, with data points like gluconic acid and similar compounds, has acceptable coverage.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear in predicting low yield for perfluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids. The reasoning about electron-withdrawing effects and hydrophobicity is sound. However, coverage is limited to a single data point (nonafluoropentanoic acid), indicating a need for more data.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 clearly associates low yield with carboxylic acids containing ether linkages and terminal amino groups. The physicochemical rationale is appropriate. Coverage is limited to one data point (3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid), suggesting the rule would benefit from additional supporting examples.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 is clear and effectively predicts high yield for aliphatic carboxylic acids linked to polar aromatic groups via flexible chains. The physicochemical insight is strong, considering simultaneous interactions facilitated by the flexible linker. The rule is supported by multiple data points (e.g., 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid and 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), fulfilling all criteria.

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with small, polar, non-aromatic side chains** predict a **high yield**. These amino acids have side chains that do not introduce significant steric hindrance and can effectively coordinate with the catalyst. Examples include **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid). Their structures allow for strong interactions with the metal centers through the amino and carboxylate groups.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains** predict a **low yield**. The presence of large aromatic groups like phenyl rings increases steric hindrance, which can impede effective coordination with the catalyst. An example is **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine), where the bulky phenyl group reduces interaction efficiency with the catalytic sites.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **ω-amino acids with a carbon chain length of five carbons or fewer** predict a **high yield**, whereas those with longer chains predict a **low yield**. Short-chain ω-amino acids like **5-aminopentanoic acid** can form stable chelating interactions due to the proximity of amino and carboxylate groups, enhancing coordination with the catalyst. Longer chains, such as **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**, have increased flexibility, which can reduce effective coordination and lead to lower yields.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **linear aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups**, such as **octanoic acid**, predict a **high yield**. The hydrophobic nature and lack of interfering groups allow these modifiers to interact favorably with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or substrate, potentially stabilizing transition states and facilitating the reaction.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **benzoic acids substituted at the para position with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)** predict a **high yield**. EWGs like **nitro** or **bromomethyl** increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. Examples include **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**. These groups can also participate in additional non-covalent interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **benzoic acids substituted at the para position with electron-donating groups (EDGs)** predict a **low yield**. EDGs such as **methyl** or **hydroxy** decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid and can hinder effective coordination with the catalyst. Examples include **4-methylbenzoic acid** and **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**. The reduced ability to interact with metal centers results in lower catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **pyridine carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the pyridine ring** predict a **high yield**. The nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring can act as an additional coordination site, enhancing interaction with the catalyst. Examples include **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid) and **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**. These modifiers can chelate the metal center effectively, improving catalytic activity.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers where a **pyridine ring is connected to a carboxylic acid via a flexible aliphatic chain** predict a **high yield**. The flexible linker allows both the pyridine nitrogen and the carboxylate group to coordinate simultaneously with the catalyst. An example is **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**, where the butanoic acid chain provides the necessary flexibility for optimal interaction with the catalytic sites.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that have **perfluorinated alkyl chains** predict a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms and the hydrophobic nature of perfluorinated chains can reduce the ability of the carboxylate group to coordinate effectively with the catalyst. An example is **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**, where the perfluorinated chain diminishes interaction with metal centers.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**. Multiple hydroxyl groups can form additional hydrogen bonds or coordinate with the catalyst, enhancing reactivity. An example is **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid), where the dense array of hydroxyl groups facilitates strong interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with ether linkages and terminal amino groups** predict a **low yield**. The ether linkages increase chain flexibility, and the terminal amino group may be too distant from the carboxyl group for effective bidentate coordination. An example is **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**, where the flexible ether chains reduce the overall coordination efficiency with the catalyst.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-donating groups ortho to additional functional groups**, such as **hydroxy** groups adjacent to **formyl** groups, predict a **low yield**. Steric hindrance and intramolecular hydrogen bonding can interfere with coordination to the catalyst. Examples include **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**, where the proximity of the hydroxy and formyl groups may reduce the availability of the carboxylate oxygen for coordination.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **bulky substituents connected via rigid aromatic linkers** predict a **low yield**. The rigidity and steric bulk prevent optimal alignment of functional groups for effective catalyst interaction. An example is **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**, where the direct connection between two aromatic rings limits rotational flexibility and hinders simultaneous coordination of both functional groups with the catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal hydroxy or amino groups and chain lengths longer than five carbons** predict a **low yield**. Increased chain length and flexibility can reduce the effective coordination between the functional groups and the catalyst. Examples include **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** and **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, where the terminal functional groups are too distant to contribute effectively to catalyst coordination.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers containing **heteroaromatic rings capable of coordinating to metal centers**, such as **indole** rings, predict a **high yield**. The heteroaromatic system can enhance interactions with the catalyst through additional coordination sites or π-π stacking interactions. An example is **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan), where the indole ring and amino acid functionality work synergistically to improve catalytic activity.

- **Physicochemical Properties**: Underlying factors such as acidity, electron-withdrawing/donating effects, steric hindrance, and ability to coordinate with metal centers were considered for each rule.

- **Coverage Balance**: The rules are balanced between covering a wide range of modifiers (e.g., Rules 1, 2, 7, 8) and targeting specific features for precision (e.g., Rules 11, 12).

- **Rule Adjustments**:
  - **Rule 2** was modified to include amino acids with coordinating side chains, accommodating compounds like **tryptophan** and **4-aminobenzoic acid**, which showed high yields despite having bulky side chains.
  - **Rule 5** and **Rule 6** were refined to focus on the effects of electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups on para-substituted benzoic acids, aligning with observed yields.
  - **Rule 11** now specifically addresses perfluorinated chains due to their unique electronic effects, rather than generalizing all sulfur-containing compounds.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **ω-amino acids with carbon chain lengths of 3 to 5 carbons** predict a **high yield**. The optimal chain length allows the amino and carboxyl groups to effectively chelate the metal center in the catalyst. Examples include **5-aminopentanoic acid** and **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **pyridine carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the pyridine ring** predict a **high yield**. The pyridine nitrogen and carboxylate oxygen can coordinate simultaneously with the metal center, enhancing catalyst stability. Examples include **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid) and **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **para-substituted benzoic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)** predict a **high yield**. EWGs like **nitro** or **bromomethyl** groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. Examples are **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **linear saturated aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 6 to 8 carbons and without additional polar functional groups** predict a **high yield**. Their hydrophobic nature and optimal chain length allow effective interaction with the catalyst. An example is **octanoic acid**.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains capable of coordination through functional groups like indole rings** predict a **high yield**. These additional coordination sites enhance binding affinity to the metal center. An example is **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan).

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **ω-amino acids with carbon chain lengths greater than 6 carbons** predict a **low yield**. Increased chain length introduces flexibility, reducing effective chelation of metal centers. Examples are **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with ortho-substituents capable of intramolecular hydrogen bonding** (such as **hydroxyl** or **formyl** groups) predict a **low yield**. Intramolecular interactions can interfere with metal coordination. Examples include **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **benzoic acids para-substituted with electron-donating groups (EDGs) lacking coordination ability** predict a **low yield**. EDGs like **methyl** or **methoxy** groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, hindering effective metal coordination. Examples include **4-methylbenzoic acid** and **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing **flexible ether linkages with terminal polar groups** predict a **low yield**. The flexibility of ether linkages reduces the rigidity needed for effective coordination with the catalyst. Examples include **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with **perfluorinated alkyl chains** predict a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms decreases electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, reducing its coordinating ability. An example is **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with hydrophobic side chains lacking coordinating functional groups** predict a **low yield**. The absence of additional coordination sites reduces interaction with the catalyst. An example is **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine).

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **benzoic acids substituted with groups capable of coordination** (such as **amino** or **pyridyl** groups) predict a **high yield**. These groups enhance binding to the metal center. Examples include **4-aminobenzoic acid** and **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups at the ω-position** predict a **low yield**. Terminal hydroxyl groups increase polarity and flexibility, hindering effective coordination. An example is **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aromatic acids with fused ring systems capable of additional π-π interactions** predict a **high yield**. The extended conjugation can enhance interaction with the catalyst. An example is **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**.

- **Adjustments and Improvements**:
  - **Refinement of Rules**: Rules have been refined to account for exceptions and improve accuracy. For instance, Rule 9 distinguishes between electron-donating groups that cannot coordinate and those that can, explaining why **4-aminobenzoic acid** (which can coordinate) predicts a high yield.
  - **Elimination of Redundancies**: Overlapping or redundant rules have been consolidated to streamline the rule set without compromising coverage.
  - **Balance Between Coverage and Specificity**: The rules strike a balance between covering more compounds in the dataset and providing specific guidelines based on functional group combinations and physicochemical properties.

These rules provide a comprehensive guide for predicting whether a molecular modifier will result in a high or low yield in the δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and well-defined, allowing for straightforward identification of modifiers fitting its criteria. It provides solid physicochemical insight by linking the presence of both amino and multiple carboxylate groups to effective bidentate coordination with the metal center. The rule considers combinations of functional groups, enhancing its complexity. It is supported by at least two data points—**(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid**—meeting the coverage criterion. Overall, Rule 1 is strong and well-balanced.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear but has limited coverage, being supported by only one data point (**5-aminopentanoic acid**). While it offers good physicochemical insight into how optimal chain length enables effective chelation through amino and carboxylate groups, additional supporting data points are needed to strengthen its predictive power. Increasing coverage would improve the rule's reliability.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear and provides sound physicochemical reasoning by emphasizing the role of side chains containing coordinating heterocycles in α-amino acids. However, it is supported by only one data point (**(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid**), resulting in low coverage. Identifying additional modifiers that fit this rule would enhance its robustness and applicability.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear and backed by strong physicochemical insight, linking strong EWGs at the para-position to increased acidity and metal coordination. It considers combinations of structural features, adding complexity. The rule is supported by at least two data points—**4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**—fulfilling the coverage criterion. Rule 4 effectively balances complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5, while clear and logically reasoning that para-substituted groups capable of coordination enhance yield, is contradicted by the dataset. **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**, which matches the rule's criteria, predicts a **low yield** in the dataset. This contradiction suggests that the rule may not accurately capture the relationship between such modifiers and the reaction yield. Refinement is needed to resolve this discrepancy, possibly by considering the influence of additional structural factors.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear and provides logical physicochemical insight by associating optimal chain length and lack of additional functional groups with favorable interactions. However, it is supported by only one data point (**octanoic acid**), indicating low coverage. Expanding the dataset with more examples fitting this rule would improve its validity and predictive accuracy.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear and supported by at least two data points—**7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**—both predicting **low yield**, thus meeting the coverage criterion. It provides sound physicochemical reasoning by linking increased chain length and flexibility to reduced effective chelation. The rule considers combinations of structural features and maintains a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear and backed by physicochemical insight, explaining how flexible ether linkages reduce coordination efficacy. It is supported by two data points—**2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**—both predicting **low yield**, satisfying the coverage criterion. Rule 8 effectively balances complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear and logically associates the absence of coordinating functional groups in hydrophobic side chains with diminished metal interaction and low yield. However, it is supported by only one data point—**(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid**—resulting in low coverage. Identifying additional data points would strengthen the rule's predictive capacity.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear and provides solid physicochemical reasoning by highlighting how EDGs decrease carboxylate acidity and hinder coordination. It is supported by at least two data points—**4-methylbenzoic acid** and **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**—both predicting **low yield**, fulfilling the coverage criterion. The rule considers combinations of substructures and maintains a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear and offers logical physicochemical insight into how intramolecular hydrogen bonding from ortho-substituents can interfere with metal coordination. It is supported by data points such as **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** and **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**, both predicting **low yield**, thereby satisfying the coverage requirement. The rule effectively balances complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is clear but has low coverage, being supported by only one data point—**2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**—predicting **low yield**. While it provides good physicochemical insight into the electron-withdrawing effects of perfluorinated chains, adding more examples would enhance its reliability and applicability.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear and provides sound reasoning by associating fused ring systems with carbonyl groups capable of bidentate coordination to high yield. However, it is only supported by one data point—**1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**—resulting in low coverage. Increasing the number of supporting examples would improve the rule's robustness.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 lacks some clarity due to the ambiguous definition of "near the carboxylate," which may lead to inconsistent application. While **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** predicts a **high yield**, supporting the rule, **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** predicts a **low yield**, potentially contradicting it. This inconsistency suggests a need to refine the rule to specify the spatial requirements for the sulfhydryl group more precisely.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 is clear and provides solid physicochemical insight into how multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxylate enhance coordination through hydrogen bonding and chelation. It is supported by at least two data points—**(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** and **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**—both predicting **high yield**, thus satisfying the coverage criterion. The rule maintains a good balance between complexity and coverage.

**Start of Comments**
- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 effectively predicts high yields for modifiers that are α-amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxylic acid groups, such as aspartic and glutamic acid. The rule is clear, provides solid physicochemical insight into enhanced metal coordination due to extra carboxylate groups, combines structural features, and is supported by multiple data points.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 suggests that short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (chains of five carbons or fewer), optionally with terminal amino or thiol groups, predict high yield, while longer chains predict low yield. However, octanoic acid, an eight-carbon chain modifier, yields a high result, contradicting the rule. This inconsistency indicates that the rule lacks clarity and may not accurately account for all relevant modifiers, necessitating refinement to improve its predictive ability.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 addresses aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted groups capable of metal coordination, predicting high yield, and those with non-coordinating electron-donating groups predicting low yield. While this holds for some modifiers like 4-aminobenzoic acid, it fails for 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid, which, despite having a thiol group capable of coordination, results in a low yield. This inconsistency suggests that the rule requires refinement to more accurately predict outcomes based on specific substituents.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 predicts low yields for aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with additional keto groups due to potential chelation or side reactions interfering with catalyst activity. While the rule is clear and provides good physicochemical reasoning, it is based on a single data point, which does not satisfy the coverage criterion, limiting its robustness.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 addresses modifiers capable of intramolecular hydrogen bonding, predicting low yields due to reduced availability of the carboxylate group for metal coordination. The rule is clear and insightful but is supported by only one data point, which may not satisfy the coverage requirement, suggesting a need for additional supporting data.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 predicts low yields for amino acids or peptides containing additional amide groups in the side chain due to potential metal ion sequestration or intramolecular interactions hindering coordination.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 suggests that modifiers with aromatic carboxylic acids meta-substituted with nitrogen-containing heterocycles predict high yields due to favorable interactions without significant steric hindrance. While the rule is clear and offers good insight, it is supported by only one data point, which falls short of the coverage criterion, indicating that more data is needed to validate the rule fully.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 predicts low yields for modifiers with trifluoroacetyl groups attached to aliphatic chains with carboxylic acid functionalities due to electron-withdrawing effects reducing nucleophilicity. The rule is clear and provides reasonable insight but is based on a single data point, not meeting the coverage criterion and limiting its robustness.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 effectively predicts low yields for modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal hydroxyl or amino groups beyond five carbons, due to increased hydrophobicity and steric bulk impeding metal coordination.

**Explanation and Analysis:**

In developing these rules, the following considerations were made:

- **Combination of Substructures**: Each rule combines multiple functional groups to explain their collective impact on yield. For example, Rule 1 focuses on α-amino acids with two carboxylic groups, considering both amino and carboxylate functionalities.

- **Underlying Physicochemical Properties**:
  - **Coordination Ability**: High-yield modifiers often contain functional groups (amino, hydroxyl, thiol, nitrogen heterocycles) capable of coordinating with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity.
  - **Electron Density**: Electron-donating groups (e.g., amino, methoxy) increase electron density on coordinating atoms, facilitating metal coordination.
  - **Steric Effects**: Bulky groups or long chains can hinder coordination due to steric hindrance, leading to lower yields.
  - **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., fluorinated chains) decrease electron density, impeding coordination.
  - **Flexibility and Solubility**: Highly flexible molecules or those with hydrophobic characteristics may have reduced effective coordination with metal centers.
  - **Intramolecular Interactions**: Functional groups that participate in intramolecular hydrogen bonding reduce the availability of coordination sites.

- **Clarity in Prediction**: Each rule clearly states whether the yield is predicted to be high or low based on the structural features described.

- **Coverage and Balance**:
  - **Broader Coverage**: Rules like 1–5 and 7–9 cover multiple compounds, capturing general trends in the dataset.
  - **Specificity**: Rules like 12 and 14 address specific substructures that have notable effects on yield.
  - **Balance Between Simplicity and Complexity**: The rules range from simple (e.g., Rule 2 on para-substituted groups) to more complex combinations of functional groups (e.g., Rule 15 on methoxy groups with flexible linkers).

These rules emphasize that **effective metal coordination is crucial for high yield** in the reaction. Modifiers that enhance coordination through electron-donating groups and additional coordination sites tend to improve yield. Conversely, modifiers that hinder coordination due to steric bulk, electron-withdrawing effects, or intramolecular interactions tend to result in lower yields.

They are clear in their structural descriptions and yield predictions, offer solid physicochemical insights (such as the impact of carbonyl groups, polyether chains, amide functionalities, and intramolecular hydrogen bonding on metal coordination), consider complex combinations of substructures, and are supported by at least two data points each. The balance between their specificity and the number of compounds they cover is appropriate.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 14** provides clear guidance on modifiers with ortho-substituted hydroxyl and formyl groups capable of intramolecular hydrogen bonding predicting low yield. While it offers good property insight and complexity, its coverage is limited to a single example (**5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**). To enhance the rule's validity, additional data points featuring similar structural characteristics should be included.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 15** is comprehensive and meets all the criteria. It clearly describes the effect of electron-donating methoxy groups on aromatic rings with flexible linkers, providing high yield predictions. The rule combines structural features thoughtfully (complexity), offers solid property insights into how methoxy groups enhance metal coordination, and is backed by multiple data points (**4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** showing high yield and **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** showing low yield), ensuring good coverage and balance.

**Explanation and Analysis:**

In developing these rules, the following considerations were made:

- **Combination of Substructures**: Each rule combines multiple functional groups to explain their collective impact on yield. For example, Rule 2 considers both the aromatic ring and para-substituted amino or nitro groups.

- **Underlying Physicochemical Properties**:
  - **Coordination Ability**: High-yield modifiers often contain functional groups (amino, hydroxyl, thiol, nitrogen heterocycles) capable of coordinating with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity.
  - **Electron Density**: Electron-donating groups (e.g., amino, methoxy) increase electron density on coordinating atoms, facilitating metal coordination.
  - **Steric Effects**: Bulky groups or long chains can hinder coordination due to steric hindrance, leading to lower yields.
  - **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., fluorinated chains) decrease electron density, impeding coordination.
  - **Flexibility and Solubility**: Highly flexible molecules or those with hydrophobic characteristics may have reduced effective coordination with metal centers.
  - **Intramolecular Interactions**: Functional groups that participate in intramolecular hydrogen bonding reduce the availability of coordination sites.

- **Clarity in Prediction**: Each rule clearly states whether the yield is predicted to be high or low based on the structural features described.

- **Coverage and Balance**:
  - **Broader Coverage**: Rules like 1–5 and 7–9 cover multiple compounds, capturing general trends in the dataset.
  - **Specificity**: Rules like 13 and 15 address specific substructures that have notable effects on yield.
  - **Balance Between Simplicity and Complexity**: The rules range from simple (e.g., Rule 4 on chain length and amino groups) to more complex combinations of functional groups (e.g., Rule 12 on methoxy groups with flexible linkers).

These rules emphasize that **effective metal coordination is crucial for high yield** in the reaction. Modifiers that enhance coordination through electron-donating groups and additional coordination sites tend to improve yield. Conversely, modifiers that hinder coordination due to steric bulk, electron-withdrawing effects, or intramolecular interactions tend to result in lower yields.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and easily applicable, as it specifically describes α-amino acids with two carboxylic acid groups (dicarboxylic amino acids), which directly maps to the dataset examples. The physicochemical insight is solid, highlighting the enhanced coordination ability due to the presence of both amino and carboxylate groups. The rule considers a combination of substructures (amino and carboxylic groups), demonstrating appropriate complexity. It is supported by at least two data points—(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid and (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid—which both exhibit high yield, showing good coverage. Overall, the rule is well-balanced between specificity and applicability.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clearly defined, specifying that aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted amino or nitro groups predict high yield, while those with para-methyl groups predict low yield. This clarity allows for straightforward application. The rule provides physicochemical insight by explaining that amino and nitro groups enhance metal coordination due to additional coordination sites, whereas methyl groups do not contribute to coordination. It combines substructures (aromatic ring, carboxylic acid, specific para-substituents), satisfying the complexity criterion. It is supported by multiple data points: 4-aminobenzoic acid and 4-nitrobenzoic acid (high yield), and 4-methylbenzoic acid (low yield), indicating adequate coverage. The rule is balanced, capturing key differences in substituents' effects on yield.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear and allows us to determine whether a modifier will predict high or low yield based on the presence of a pyridine ring attached to a carboxylic acid and considerations of steric hindrance. The physicochemical insight is sound, explaining that the pyridine nitrogen acts as an additional coordination site, enhancing metal ion binding, while steric hindrance reduces this effect. The rule considers combinations of substructures and steric factors, adding complexity. It is supported by at least two high-yield data points—pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid—and one low-yield point—4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid—showing good coverage. The rule is balanced, capturing the impact of structural features and steric effects.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear in its description of short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal amino groups predicting high yield, and longer chains or lack of amino groups predicting low yield. The physicochemical rationale is logical, highlighting the role of amino groups in metal coordination and the impact of steric hindrance from longer chains. However, the rule does not align with all data points: octanoic acid (a long-chain acid without an amino group) shows high yield in the dataset, which contradicts the rule's prediction. This suggests that the rule may lack sufficient coverage or may need refinement to account for exceptions. While the rule considers combinations of substructures (chain length and amino groups), the mismatch with the data indicates that the rule may not be fully accurate, affecting its balance.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clearly defined, specifying that thiol groups attached to aliphatic chains predict high yield, while attachment to aromatic rings predicts low yield. The physicochemical insight is appropriate, noting the strong metal coordination by thiol groups and the potential steric or reactivity issues when attached to aromatic rings. The rule involves combinations of substructures, considering both the functional group (thiol) and its context (aliphatic vs. aromatic attachment). It is supported by at least one high-yield data point (3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) and one low-yield point (4-sulfanylbenzoic acid), providing adequate coverage. Overall, the rule is balanced and aligns with the dataset.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear, distinguishing between α-amino acids with side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms and those without. The physicochemical insight is accurate, recognizing that heteroatoms like nitrogen in the indole ring can coordinate with metals, enhancing yield, while aromatic side chains lacking such heteroatoms do not contribute to coordination. The rule incorporates combinations of substructures (amino acid backbone and side chain properties), satisfying the complexity criterion. It is supported by data points—tryptophan (high yield) and phenylalanine (low yield)—demonstrating coverage. The rule is balanced and aligns well with the dataset.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 clearly states that polyhydroxy acids predict high yield due to multiple hydroxyl groups providing coordination sites. The physicochemical insight is appropriate, as additional hydroxyl groups can coordinate with metal centers. The rule combines substructures (carboxylic acid with multiple proximal hydroxyl groups), satisfying the complexity criterion. It is supported by at least two high-yield data points—(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid and 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid—indicating good coverage. The rule is balanced between specificity and applicability.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear, indicating that aromatic carboxylic acids with ortho or para carbonyl-containing substituents predict low yield. The physicochemical insight is logical, suggesting that such substituents might interfere with metal coordination or lead to side reactions. The rule involves combinations of substructures (aromatic ring, carboxylic acid, specific carbonyl substituents at certain positions), providing complexity. It is supported by at least two low-yield data points—4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid—showing good coverage. The rule is well-balanced and aligns with the dataset.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 states that modifiers with long aliphatic chains (>6 carbons) without additional coordinating groups predict low yield due to hindered coordination. While this is a reasonable physicochemical rationale, the rule does not align with all data points. Specifically, octanoic acid (an eight-carbon chain without additional coordinating groups) shows high yield in the dataset, contradicting the rule's prediction. However, other examples like 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid and 8-aminooctanoic acid do have low yields, supporting the rule partially. The rule is clear and considers combinations of chain length and presence of coordinating groups, but inconsistency with the data affects its coverage and balance.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 clearly states that modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups like fluoroalkyl chains predict low yield due to reduced electron density for coordination. The physicochemical insight is valid. However, the rule is supported by only one data point in the dataset (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), limiting its coverage. It considers the combination of substructures, specifically electron-withdrawing groups, but the lack of multiple supporting examples affects the rule's robustness and balance.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 presents a clear prediction that polyether carboxylic acids or modifiers with long ethylene glycol chains predict low yield due to reduced effective metal coordination from increased flexibility and solvation. The physicochemical insight is appropriate. The rule considers combinations of substructures (polyether chains and carboxylic acid groups), adding complexity. It is supported by at least two low-yield data points—2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid and 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid—demonstrating good coverage. The rule is balanced and aligns with the dataset.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is somewhat complex but clearly explains that methoxy groups on aromatic rings connected via flexible linkers predict high yield, while methoxy groups directly attached to rigid structures predict low yield. The physicochemical insight accounts for electron donation of methoxy groups and the influence of linker flexibility on coordination. The rule considers combinations of substructures and linker properties, adding complexity. It is supported by one high-yield data point (4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid) and one low-yield data point (3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid), providing limited coverage. While the rule captures nuanced structural effects, its applicability may be constrained due to the small number of supporting examples.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear in stating that aromatic lactones or fused ring systems with carboxylic acid groups predict high yield due to rigid structures facilitating metal binding. The physicochemical insight is reasonable. However, the rule is supported by only one data point in the dataset (1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid), limiting its coverage. The rule considers specific complex substructures, adding complexity, but the lack of multiple supporting examples reduces its robustness and balance.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 clearly indicates that amino acids or peptides with additional amide or acetamido groups in the side chain predict low yield due to altered metal chelation. The physicochemical insight is appropriate. The rule considers combinations of substructures (amino acids with specific side-chain functionalities), providing complexity. It is supported by at least two low-yield data points—(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid and 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid—indicating good coverage. The rule is balanced and consistent with the dataset.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 is clear, stating that modifiers with heteroatoms in both backbone and side chain predict high yield due to multiple coordination sites enhancing metal binding. The physicochemical insight is valid. The rule considers combinations of substructures with coordinating heteroatoms, adding complexity. However, it is supported by only one data point in the dataset (2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid), limiting coverage. While the rule is theoretically sound, the lack of multiple supporting examples affects its applicability and balance.

  - **Steric Effects**: Bulky substituents or extended chains can cause steric hindrance, reducing the effectiveness of metal coordination and leading to lower yields.
  - **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., fluorinated chains, aldehydes) decrease electron density, impeding coordination.
  - **Flexibility and Solvation**: Highly flexible molecules or those with hydrophobic characteristics may have reduced ability to effectively coordinate with metal centers.
  - **Intramolecular Interactions**: Functional groups that can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds may reduce the availability of coordination sites.

- **Clarity in Prediction**: Each rule explicitly states whether the structural features predict a high or low yield, allowing for clear application to new modifiers.

- **Coverage and Balance**:
  - **Broader Coverage**: Rules like 1–5 address common structural motifs in the dataset, covering multiple compounds and capturing general trends.
  - **Specificity**: More detailed rules (e.g., Rule 11 on methoxy groups with flexible linkers) address specific compounds with notable effects on yield.
  - **Balance Between Simplicity and Complexity**: The rules range from general guidelines to more nuanced observations, aligning with the requirement to balance coverage and complexity.

The structural description of **α-amino acids with side-chain carboxylic acid groups** is clear, allowing for unambiguous identification of matching modifiers. The rule provides strong physical-chemical insight by explaining how the presence of both amino and additional carboxyl groups enhances coordination with metal centers, thus improving catalyst activity. It combines multiple substructures—specifically, the α-amino acid backbone and side-chain carboxylic acid—meeting the complexity criterion. The rule is supported by at least two data points from the dataset: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid**, both predicting high yield, demonstrating good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 2** meets all criteria effectively. It clearly defines modifiers as **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted amino or nitro groups**, predicting high yield, and provides contrasting examples with non-coordinating groups predicting low yield. The physical-chemical insight is adequate, highlighting how amino and nitro groups enhance metal binding through additional coordination sites. The rule incorporates a combination of substructures (aromatic ring, carboxylic acid, specific para-substituents), satisfying the complexity requirement. It is well-supported by multiple data points: **4-aminobenzoic acid** and **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (high yield), and **4-methylbenzoic acid** (low yield), indicating strong coverage and a balanced approach.

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 3** is clear and provides solid physical-chemical reasoning by emphasizing the role of the pyridine nitrogen in metal coordination. It accounts for complexity by combining the presence of a pyridine ring directly attached to a carboxylic acid group. The rule is supported by multiple data points: **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** and **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** (high yield), and **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (low yield due to steric hindrance), ensuring good coverage. The rule balances complexity and coverage effectively.

- **Comment 4**: **Rule 4** is clearly defined, distinguishing between short-chain (≤5 carbons) aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal amino groups (predicting high yield) and longer chains (≥6 carbons) predicting low yield. The rule provides adequate physical-chemical insight by relating chain length to steric hindrance and amino groups to metal coordination enhancement. It combines chain length and functional groups, meeting the complexity criterion. The rule is supported by data points such as **5-aminopentanoic acid** (high yield), and **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid** (low yield), demonstrating good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** is clear and provides strong physical-chemical insight into how thiol groups coordinate with metal centers. The rule combines the presence of thiol groups with the type of carbon chain (aliphatic vs. aromatic), satisfying the complexity criterion. It is supported by data points: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (high yield) and **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (low yield), ensuring adequate coverage. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** clearly specifies that amino acids with aromatic side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms predict high yield, while those lacking heteroatoms predict low yield. The physical-chemical insight is strong, explaining the importance of heteroatoms in metal coordination. The rule combines amino acid structure with specific side-chain characteristics, meeting the complexity criterion. Data points supporting the rule include **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (high yield) and **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (low yield), demonstrating good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** effectively defines modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxylic acid as predicting high yield, providing clear structural criteria. The physical-chemical insight relates to hydroxyl groups offering additional coordination sites. The rule considers both the number and position of hydroxyl groups, satisfying the complexity criterion. It is supported by data points: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (high yield) and **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (low yield), ensuring adequate coverage and balance.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** is clear in describing modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with ortho or para carbonyl-containing substituents predicting low yield. The physical-chemical insight is sound, as these groups may interfere with metal coordination. The rule combines the aromatic ring, carboxylic acid, and specific substituents, meeting the complexity criterion. It is supported by data points: **4-formylbenzoic acid** and **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (both low yield), demonstrating sufficient coverage and balance.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** is clear in its definition but has limited coverage, as it is based on a single data point: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (low yield). While the physical-chemical insight regarding electron-withdrawing effects of fluorinated chains is valid, the rule lacks sufficient data points to robustly support it. This low coverage reduces its reliability and balance.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** provides a clear structural description and offers adequate physical-chemical insight into how high flexibility and solvation can reduce metal coordination effectiveness. It combines polyether chains with carboxylic acids, satisfying the complexity criterion. The rule is supported by at least two data points: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (both predicting low yield), ensuring good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** is somewhat complex but clear in specifying the combination of methoxy groups on aromatic rings connected via flexible linkers to carboxylic acids predicting high yield. The physical-chemical insight is sound, relating methoxy groups to enhanced metal coordination through electron donation. The rule considers multiple substructures, meeting the complexity criterion. It is supported by data points: **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (high yield) and **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (low yield), demonstrating adequate coverage and balance.

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** lacks sufficient coverage, as it is based on a single data point: **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (high yield). While the physical-chemical insight about rigid fused ring systems facilitating metal binding is reasonable, the rule does not meet the coverage criterion of at least two data points. This limits the reliability and balance of the rule.

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13** is clear and provides good physical-chemical insight into how additional amide or acetamido groups in side chains may alter metal chelation. It combines amino acids or peptides with specific side-chain modifications, satisfying the complexity criterion. The rule is supported by data points: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** and **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (both predicting low yield), ensuring adequate coverage and balance.

- **Comment 14**: **Rule 14** clearly defines modifiers with long aliphatic chains (≥7 carbons) without additional coordinating groups predicting low yield, providing physical-chemical insight into how hydrophobicity and steric bulk hinder coordination. The rule considers chain length and the absence of functional groups, meeting the complexity criterion. It is supported by data points: **8-aminooctanoic acid** (low yield), but the exception of **octanoic acid** (high yield) suggests that other factors may modulate the effect, slightly affecting the balance and coverage.

- **Comment 15**: **Rule 15** is redundant with **Rule 3**, both addressing modifiers containing pyridine rings directly connected to carboxylic acids predicting high yield, and those with additional linkers predicting low yield due to steric hindrance. While the physical-chemical insight and complexity are acceptable, this duplication indicates a lack of balance in the set of rules. Moreover, combining these similar rules could improve coverage and reduce redundancy.

These rules have been carefully formulated to illustrate the relationship between the structural features of molecular modifiers and the resulting high or low yield in the reaction. Each rule combines multiple sub-structures (functional groups), such as amino groups, aromatic rings, and chain length, to predict the outcome based on underlying physicochemical properties like metal coordination ability, steric effects, and electronic factors.

By applying these rules, one can predict the expected yield for any given molecular modifier based on its structural characteristics. These rules prioritize broader coverage of the dataset while maintaining a balance between simplicity and complexity, as some rules address common features with higher coverage, and others focus on specific structural motifs with lower coverage.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** clearly identifies that **aromatic carboxylic acids with para nitro groups** predict a **high yield** (Criterion 1). The property insight is acceptable (Criterion 2), relating increased acidity to better metal coordination. Complexity is moderate (Criterion 3). Coverage is limited to **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Criterion 4). The balance is lacking due to insufficient data points (Criterion 5).

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** states that **flexible polyether chains** predict a **low yield** (Criterion 1). The property insight is reasonable (Criterion 2), considering that flexibility and solvation reduce coordination effectiveness. Complexity is moderate (Criterion 3). Coverage is minimal with only **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (low yield) (Criterion 4). The rule lacks balance due to limited data (Criterion 5).

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** mentions that **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups** predict a **variable yield**, which reduces clarity and predictability (Criterion 1). The property insight is limited (Criterion 2), and the rule lacks specificity and complexity (Criterion 3). Coverage is not sufficient (Criterion 4); while **octanoic acid** shows a high yield, the rule admits exceptions, making it less useful. The balance is poor (Criterion 5).

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13** clearly differentiates between modifiers with **hydroxyl groups connected via an aliphatic linker** (high yield) and those with hydroxyl groups **directly attached** (low yield) (Criterion 1). The property insight is good (Criterion 2), acknowledging the role of flexibility in coordination. Complexity is higher (Criterion 3), involving both functional groups and their connectivity. Coverage is adequate (Criterion 4) with **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (high yield) and **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (low yield). The balance is well maintained (Criterion 5).

- **Comment 14**: **Rule 14** suggests that **lactone rings with carboxylic acid groups** predict a **high yield** (Criterion 1). The property insight is limited (Criterion 2); while rigidity may aid coordination, more explanation is needed. Complexity is moderate (Criterion 3). Coverage is limited to **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** (Criterion 4). The balance could be improved with additional data points (Criterion 5).

- **Comment 15**: **Rule 15** specifies that **amino acids or peptides with additional amide or acetamido groups in the side chain** predict a **low yield** (Criterion 1). The property insight is acceptable (Criterion 2), as amide groups may compete for metal binding. Complexity is higher due to the involvement of side-chain functionalities (Criterion 3). Coverage includes **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** and **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (both low yield) (Criterion 4). The balance is satisfactory (Criterion 5).

   - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
   - *High Yield Examples*: Aromatic acids without such electron-withdrawing groups, or with substituents that facilitate coordination, predict a **high yield**.

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **thiol groups within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**. Thiol groups are strong ligands that form stable complexes with metal centers.

    - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**, where the thiol is less accessible due to aromatic resonance, predicts a **low yield**.

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted bromomethyl groups** predict a **high yield**. The bromomethyl group can participate in metal coordination or activate the aromatic ring for binding.

    - *High Yield Example*: **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Examples*: Aromatic acids without coordinating substituents or with deactivating groups predict a **low yield**.

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **long aliphatic chains containing hydroxyl or amino groups distant from the carboxyl group (beyond the fifth carbon)** predict a **low yield**. Increased chain length diminishes chelation efficiency due to flexibility.

    - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**.
    - *High Yield Examples*: Shorter-chain analogs with functional groups closer to the carboxyl group predict a **high yield**.

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **bulky substituents near coordinating sites or side chains lacking coordinating functionality** predict a **low yield**. Steric hindrance impedes metal access, reducing catalyst effectiveness.

    - *Low Yield Examples*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (N-acetyl-lysine), where acetamido groups hinder coordination.
    - *High Yield Examples*: Amino acids with side chains that facilitate metal binding, like **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan), predict a **high yield**.

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy-substituted aromatic rings** predict a **high yield**. Methoxy groups can donate electron density, enhancing metal coordination.

    - *High Yield Example*: **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Examples*: Aromatic acids lacking electron-donating groups or with steric hindrance predict a **low yield**.

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers with **coordinating groups properly positioned for chelation**, such as adjacent amino and carboxyl groups or multiple hydroxyl groups, predict a **high yield**. Effective spatial arrangement enhances metal binding.

    - *High Yield Examples*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan), **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Examples*: Compounds where coordinating groups are too distant or obstructed predict a **low yield**.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is strong and well-supported. The criteria are clear, allowing one to easily determine if a modifier fits. The property insight regarding chelation through adjacent amino and two carboxyl groups is well-explained. The rule considers combinations of functional groups, and it is supported by at least three data points—entries 0, 2 (high yield), and 13 (low yield when not meeting criteria).

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is robust with clear criteria about chain length and functional group positioning. The property insight on how proximity of amino groups to carboxyl groups enhances chelation is sound. It accounts for the complexity of molecular structure and is supported by at least three data points—entries 3 (high yield), 31, and 34 (low yields due to longer chains).

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is acceptable but has limited coverage with only two data points—entry 9 (high yield) and entry 29 (low yield). The criteria are clear, and the property insight about multiple hydroxyl groups enhancing coordination is valid. Additional data points would strengthen this rule.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is well-formulated with clear criteria involving aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted amino or nitro groups. The property insight is solid, explaining how these substituents enhance metal coordination. It effectively combines structural features and is supported by at least three data points—entries 4, 20 (high yields), and 22 (low yield when not matching criteria).

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 requires refinement for clarity. While it has property insight about nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings aiding coordination, inconsistencies in the data—such as entry 24 (high yield)—suggest the rule doesn't fully capture all relevant factors. Adjusting the criteria to account for exceptions or further specifying the structural requirements would improve the rule.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is acceptable but would benefit from additional data. The criteria are clear regarding fluorinated alkyl chains leading to low yield due to electron-withdrawing effects. It is supported by two data points—entries 14 and 28—but more examples would enhance coverage.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 lacks sufficient coverage and may be too general. It is mainly supported by entry 5 (high yield with octanoic acid). The rule's clarity is acceptable, but conflicting data or lack of additional supporting examples suggest it needs refinement or more data points to validate its effectiveness.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is sound with clear criteria about polyether chains hindering coordination due to steric effects. The property insight is logical, and the rule is supported by at least two data points predicting low yield—entries 11 and 32. Complexity is appropriate as it considers the impact of bulky groups.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is well-established with clear criteria relating to aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde or formyl groups predicting low yield. The property insight about reduced availability of coordinating atoms is valid. It is supported by two data points—entries 18 and 19—providing adequate coverage.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is strong and supported by two data points—entry 17 (high yield) and entry 10 (low yield when the thiol group is less accessible). The criteria are clear, and the property insight on thiol groups enhancing metal complex stability is well-articulated.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 currently lacks sufficient coverage, with only one supporting data point—entry 1. While the criteria are clear and the property insight is reasonable, additional data points are necessary to validate this rule fully.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is robust, with clear criteria about long-chain aliphatic acids with distant hydroxyl or amino groups predicting low yield. The property insight is solid, focusing on reduced chelation efficiency due to flexibility. It is well-supported by at least three data points—entries 29, 31, and 34.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 could be improved for clarity. The description of "bulky substituents near coordinating sites" is somewhat vague. More precise criteria or examples would enhance understanding. It is supported by entries 33 (low yield) and 15 (high yield when criteria are met), but refining the rule would strengthen its application.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 has limited coverage with only one supporting data point—entry 25. While the criteria regarding methoxy-substituted aromatic rings are clear, adding more examples would improve the rule's robustness. The property insight is acceptable, focusing on electron-donating effects enhancing coordination.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 is broad and could be made more precise for greater clarity. It is supported by entries 15 and 7 (high yields when coordinating groups are properly positioned). The property insight is logical, but specifying the positional requirements more clearly would improve the rule. Additional data points would enhance coverage.
