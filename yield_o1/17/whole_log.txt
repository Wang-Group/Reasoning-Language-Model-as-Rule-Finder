- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are benzoic acids with an amino group at the para position predict **high yield**. The amino group enhances electron donation to the aromatic ring, facilitating better interaction with the catalyst. Example: **4-aminobenzoic acid**.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are benzoic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position predict **high yield**. Electron-withdrawing groups like nitro or bromo increase the acidity and reactivity of the carboxylic acid. Examples include **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups predict **high yield**. The hydrophobic tail may enhance interactions with hydrophobic sites on the catalyst. Example: **octanoic acid**.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Combine Rules 1 and 12** to improve coverage and coherence. Both rules involve modifiers that are α-amino acids or acetic acid derivatives with multiple hydroxyl or carboxyl groups predicting high yield. Merging these rules acknowledges that multiple hydroxyl and carboxyl groups enhance solubility and interaction with the catalyst, as seen in examples like **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid**, **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid**, and **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**.

- **Advice 2**: **Adjust Rule 5** to account for chain length in ω-amino acids. While long-chain ω-amino acids like **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid** predict low yield, shorter-chain ω-amino acids such as **5-aminopentanoic acid** predict high yield. Refining the rule to specify that ω-amino acids with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer predict high yield improves accuracy and coverage.

- **Advice 3**: **Expand Rule 4** to include aliphatic carboxylic acids with additional functional groups that do not hinder catalyst interaction. Examples like **5-aminopentanoic acid** and **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** suggest that certain functional groups on aliphatic chains can still result in high yield. Modifying the rule to include these exceptions enhances coverage.

- **Advice 4**: **Consolidate Rules with Limited Coverage** to reduce complexity. Rules like 6, 8, 13, and 14 each have support from only one data point. Combining them into a broader rule about modifiers that introduce steric hindrance or strong electron-withdrawing effects predicting low yield can improve coverage and simplify the rule set.

- **Advice 5**: **Revise Rule 11** to account for exceptions. While **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** predicts low yield due to its hydrophobic aromatic side chain, **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** predicts high yield despite having an aromatic side chain. Adjust the rule to specify that certain aromatic side chains, possibly those capable of additional interactions like hydrogen bonding, may not hinder catalyst alignment and can result in high yield.

- **Advice 6**: **Introduce a New Rule** for modifiers containing extended conjugation or specific aromatic systems that predict high yield. Compounds like **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** and **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** are not adequately covered by existing rules. A new rule acknowledging that certain aromatic systems enhance catalyst interaction will increase coverage.

- **Advice 7**: **Refine Rule 3** to consider the overall electronic effects of substituents on benzoic acids. While strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position generally predict high yield, modifiers like **4-methylbenzoic acid** (electron-donating group) predict low yield, and **4-aminobenzoic acid** (electron-donating group) predicts high yield. Incorporate the role of resonance and the ability of substituents to stabilize reaction intermediates to make the rule more nuanced.

- **Advice 8**: **Reevaluate Rule 2** to include ortho and meta substitutions if data supports it. Currently, Rule 2 focuses on para-amino benzoic acids. If modifiers with amino groups at other positions also predict high yield, expanding the rule will enhance coverage.

- **Advice 9**: **Address Modifiers with Multiple Functional Groups** by creating a rule that considers synergistic or antagonistic effects of combined functionalities. Modifiers like **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** predict low yield, possibly due to competing effects of hydroxyl and amide groups. A rule acknowledging the impact of multiple functional groups on yield can provide better guidance.

- **Advice 10**: **Simplify the Rule Set** by removing or merging rules that are too narrow or lack sufficient data support. This includes possibly merging Rules 10 and 13 into a broader rule about terminal functional groups that negatively affect yield, streamlining the rule set for better usability.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with aromatic side chains** predict **low yield**, unless the side chain contains an **indole group**, which predicts **high yield**. The bulkiness of aromatic side chains may hinder proper alignment with the catalyst. Examples: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** predicts **low yield**, whereas **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** predicts **high yield** due to favorable interactions of the indole ring.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **ω-amino acids with chain lengths of five or fewer carbons** predict **high yield**, while those with longer chains predict **low yield**.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **pyridine rings attached to a benzoic acid group** predict **low yield**. The separation between the pyridine nitrogen and the carboxyl group may reduce effective coordination with the catalyst. Example: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** predicts **low yield**.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with **ether linkages or bulky polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains** predict **low yield**. These chains increase steric hindrance and reduce catalyst accessibility. Examples: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** predict **low yield**.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **thiol groups attached to aliphatic chains** predict **high yield**. Aliphatic thiols can act as mild directing groups without deactivating the catalyst. Example: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** predicts **high yield**.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **thiol groups attached to aromatic rings** predict **low yield**. Aromatic thiols may bind irreversibly to metal centers, deactivating the catalyst. Example: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** predicts **low yield**.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **phenylalkanoic acids with more than three carbons between the carboxyl group and the phenyl ring**, particularly when substituted with **electron-donating groups**, predict **high yield**. The longer aliphatic linker may promote better alignment with the catalyst. Examples: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** and **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** predict **high yield**.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **phenylalkanoic acids with three or fewer carbons between the carboxyl group and the phenyl ring** predict **low yield**, especially if substituted with electron-donating groups. The shorter linker may not position the phenyl ring optimally for catalyst interaction. Example: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** predicts **low yield**.

** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Translate Qualitative Descriptors into Quantifiable Features**  
  Replace qualitative terms in the current rules with quantifiable molecular descriptors that can be calculated from SMILES strings. For example, instead of "electron-withdrawing groups at the para position," define features like "Number of electron-withdrawing substituents on aromatic rings" or "Hammett sigma constants," which can be numerically quantified.

- **Advice 2**: **Develop a Standardized Set of Molecular Descriptors**  
  Create a comprehensive list of molecular descriptors for each modifier, including:
  - **Structural Features**: Counts of specific functional groups (e.g., amino, carboxyl, hydroxyl, thiol), number of aromatic rings, ring sizes.
  - **Topological Descriptors**: Number of rotatable bonds, topological polar surface area (TPSA), molecular connectivity indices.
  - **Electronic Descriptors**: Partial charges, dipole moments, HOMO-LUMO gaps, calculated using computational chemistry methods.
  - **Steric Descriptors**: Molar refractivity, van der Waals volume, solvent-accessible surface area.

- **Advice 3**: **Quantify Chain Length and Branching**  
  Include features that represent chain length and branching, such as:
  - **Aliphatic Chain Length**: Number of carbon atoms in the longest aliphatic chain.
  - **Branching Index**: Number of side chains or branching points in the molecule.
  - **Distance Between Functional Groups**: Number of bonds between key functional groups (e.g., carboxyl group and aromatic ring).

  - **Hammett Sigma Constants**: Quantify electron-withdrawing or electron-donating effects of substituents.
  - **Taft Steric Parameters**: Estimate steric hindrance caused by substituents.

- **Advice 6**: **Automate Descriptor Calculation Using Software Tools**  
  Utilize cheminformatics software (e.g., RDKit, Mordred) to automate the extraction of descriptors from SMILES strings. This ensures consistency and scalability in generating the numerical feature matrix.

- **Advice 7**: **Reformulate Rules Using Numerical Thresholds**  
  Redefine the rules to use numerical thresholds for descriptors. For example:
  - Modifiers with **TPSA > X Å²** predict **high yield**.
  - Modifiers with **Hammett Sigma Constant > Y** at the para position predict **low yield**.

- **Advice 8**: **Use Machine Learning Models to Identify Key Features**  
  Apply statistical methods and machine learning algorithms to the dataset to identify which descriptors most strongly correlate with high or low yield. This data-driven approach can refine the rules based on quantitative evidence.

- **Advice 9**: **Simplify and Consolidate Rules**  
  Combine overlapping rules and eliminate redundancies by focusing on the most impactful descriptors. Simplification aids in model interpretability and reduces complexity in the feature matrix.

- **Advice 10**: **Validate and Iterate on the New Rules**  
  Test the revised rules against the existing dataset to ensure they accurately predict yields. Use cross-validation techniques and update the rules iteratively based on the performance metrics.

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with non-aromatic side chains** predict **high yield**. These molecules have an amino group attached to the α-carbon adjacent to the carboxylic acid, and their side chains are small, polar, or non-aromatic. The absence of bulky or aromatic side chains allows better interaction with the catalyst’s active sites. Examples include **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** and **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid**.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with aromatic side chains** predict **low yield**, except when the side chain contains an **indole ring**, which predicts **high yield**. Aromatic side chains can introduce steric hindrance, reducing catalyst access. However, indole groups may facilitate π-π stacking or coordination with the catalyst, enhancing yield. Examples: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** predicts **low yield**; **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** predicts **high yield**.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **ω-amino acids with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer** predict **high yield**, while those with longer chains predict **low yield**. Shorter chains allow the amino group to interact effectively with the catalyst, enhancing reactivity. Examples: **5-aminopentanoic acid** predicts **high yield**; **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid** predict **low yield** due to increased chain flexibility and reduced effective concentration at the active site.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position** predict **high yield**, except when the substituent is a **formyl group**, which predicts **low yield**. EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, improving coordination with the metal center. Examples: **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** predict **high yield**; **4-formylbenzoic acid** predicts **low yield** possibly due to chelation via the aldehyde, deactivating the catalyst.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **benzoic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position** predict **variable yields**. **Para-amino-substituted benzoic acids** predict **high yield** due to enhanced coordination through the amino group. Other EDGs like methyl or hydroxy groups may reduce acidity and hinder catalyst interaction, predicting **low yield**. Examples: **4-aminobenzoic acid** predicts **high yield**; **4-methylbenzoic acid** and **4-hydroxybenzoic acid** predict **low yield**.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups** predict **high yield**. The hydrophobic chains can interact favorably with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst, improving substrate alignment. Example: **octanoic acid** predicts **high yield**.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal hydroxyl or amino groups** predict **low yield**. Additional polar groups may lead to unwanted side interactions or interfere with catalyst binding. Examples: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** and **7-aminoheptanoic acid** predict **low yield**.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with **perfluorinated alkyl chains** predict **low yield**. The high electronegativity and steric bulk of fluorine atoms can hinder effective interaction with the catalyst’s active sites. Example: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** predicts **low yield**.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **pyridine carboxylic acids**—where the carboxyl group is directly attached to the pyridine ring—predict **high yield**. The lone pair on the nitrogen can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst reactivity. Examples: **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** and **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** predict **high yield**.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers where a **pyridine ring is connected to a carboxylic acid via an alkyl chain** predict **high yield**, as the flexible linker allows simultaneous interactions with the catalyst. In contrast, modifiers where the pyridine ring is connected via a phenyl ring predict **low yield** due to rigidity and steric hindrance. Examples: **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** predicts **high yield**; **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** predicts **low yield**.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with **long hydrophilic chains or ether linkages**, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) units, predict **low yield**. These groups increase steric bulk and solubility in the solvent over binding affinity to the catalyst, reducing effectiveness. Examples: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** predict **low yield**.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **thiol groups attached to aliphatic chains** predict **high yield**. Aliphatic thiols can form favorable interactions with the catalyst without deactivating it. In contrast, **thiol groups attached to aromatic rings** predict **low yield** because they may bind too strongly to the metal center, inhibiting catalytic activity. Examples: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** predicts **high yield**; **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** predicts **low yield**.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **phenylalkanoic acids with aliphatic chains longer than three carbons**, especially when substituted with **electron-donating groups (EDGs)**, predict **high yield**. The longer linker allows optimal positioning of the aromatic ring, and EDGs can enhance interactions with the catalyst. Modifiers with shorter chains predict **low yield** due to suboptimal positioning. Examples: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** and **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** predict **high yield**; **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** predicts **low yield**.

It considers specific structural features and is supported by at least two data points (Modifiers 8 and 21), satisfying the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 distinguishes modifiers based on the linkage to the pyridine ring and predicts yields accordingly. It is clear, provides insightful explanations about flexibility and steric hindrance, and is supported by at least two data points (Modifiers 12 and 24), meeting the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear in predicting **low yield** for modifiers with **long hydrophilic chains or ether linkages**. It provides adequate physical-chemical insight regarding steric bulk and solubility affecting binding affinity. The rule is supported by at least two data points (Modifiers 11 and 32), fulfilling the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 clearly differentiates modifiers with **thiol groups** based on attachment to aliphatic or aromatic chains, with corresponding yield predictions. It provides insightful explanations about interactions with the catalyst and is supported by at least two data points (Modifiers 10 and 17), meeting the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear and considers both **chain length** and **substitution with electron-donating groups**, providing insightful physical-chemical reasoning. It is supported by at least two data points (Modifiers 7 and 30), satisfying the coverage criterion.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with non-aromatic side chains** predict **high yield**. These molecules have an amino group attached to the α-carbon adjacent to the carboxylic acid, and their side chains are small, polar, or non-aromatic. The absence of bulky or aromatic side chains allows better interaction with the catalyst’s active sites. Examples include **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** and **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid**.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with aromatic side chains** predict **low yield**, except when the side chain contains an **indole ring**, which predicts **high yield**. Aromatic side chains can introduce steric hindrance, reducing catalyst access. However, indole groups may facilitate π-π stacking or coordination with the catalyst, enhancing yield. Examples: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** predicts **low yield**; **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** predicts **high yield**.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **ω-amino acids with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer** predict **high yield**, while those with longer chains predict **low yield**. Shorter chains allow the amino group to interact effectively with the catalyst, enhancing reactivity. Examples: **5-aminopentanoic acid** predicts **high yield**; **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid** predict **low yield** due to increased chain flexibility and reduced effective concentration at the active site.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position** predict **high yield**, except when the substituent is a **formyl group**, which predicts **low yield**. EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, improving coordination with the metal center. Examples: **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** predict **high yield**; **4-formylbenzoic acid** predicts **low yield** possibly due to chelation via the aldehyde, deactivating the catalyst.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **benzoic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position** predict **variable yields**. **Para-amino-substituted benzoic acids** predict **high yield** due to enhanced coordination through the amino group. Other EDGs like methyl or hydroxy groups may reduce acidity and hinder catalyst interaction, predicting **low yield**. Examples: **4-aminobenzoic acid** predicts **high yield**; **4-methylbenzoic acid** and **4-hydroxybenzoic acid** predict **low yield**.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups** predict **high yield**. The hydrophobic chains can interact favorably with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst, improving substrate alignment. Example: **octanoic acid** predicts **high yield**.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal hydroxyl or amino groups** predict **low yield**. Additional polar groups may lead to unwanted side interactions or interfere with catalyst binding. Examples: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** and **7-aminoheptanoic acid** predict **low yield**.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with **perfluorinated alkyl chains** predict **low yield**. The high electronegativity and steric bulk of fluorine atoms can hinder effective interaction with the catalyst’s active sites. Example: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** predicts **low yield**.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **pyridine carboxylic acids**—where the carboxyl group is directly attached to the pyridine ring—predict **high yield**. The lone pair on the nitrogen can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst reactivity. Examples: **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** and **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** predict **high yield**.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers where a **pyridine ring is connected to a carboxylic acid via an alkyl chain** predict **high yield**, as the flexible linker allows simultaneous interactions with the catalyst. In contrast, modifiers where the pyridine ring is connected via a phenyl ring predict **low yield** due to rigidity and steric hindrance. Examples: **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** predicts **high yield**; **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** predicts **low yield**.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with **long hydrophilic chains or ether linkages**, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) units, predict **low yield**. These groups increase steric bulk and solubility in the solvent over binding affinity to the catalyst, reducing effectiveness. Examples: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** predict **low yield**.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **thiol groups attached to aliphatic chains** predict **high yield**. Aliphatic thiols can form favorable interactions with the catalyst without deactivating it. In contrast, **thiol groups attached to aromatic rings** predict **low yield** because they may bind too strongly to the metal center, inhibiting catalytic activity. Examples: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** predicts **high yield**; **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** predicts **low yield**.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **phenylalkanoic acids with aliphatic chains longer than three carbons**, especially when substituted with **electron-donating groups (EDGs)**, predict **high yield**. The longer linker allows optimal positioning of the aromatic ring, and EDGs can enhance interactions with the catalyst. Modifiers with shorter chains predict **low yield** due to suboptimal positioning. Examples: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** and **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** predict **high yield**; **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** predicts **low yield**.

** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: **Adjust the SMARTS pattern for Rule 4 (EWG at para position).** The current SMARTS pattern for detecting electron-withdrawing groups at the para position in benzoic acids may not correctly match halogen substituents. The pattern `'c1cc([CX3](=O)[OX2H1])cc([F,Cl,Br,I,N+](=O)[O-])c1'` might be too restrictive. It would be better to separate the halogen atoms and the nitro group into distinct patterns or use proper grouping to ensure they are recognized individually. Adjust the pattern to `'c1cc([CX3](=O)[OX2H1])cc([F,Cl,Br,I,N+](=O)[O-])c1'` or consider using two separate patterns for halogens and nitro groups:
  - For halogens: `'c1cc([CX3](=O)[OX2H1])cc([F,Cl,Br,I])c1'`
  - For nitro group: `'c1cc([CX3](=O)[OX2H1])cc([N+](=O)[O-])c1'`

- ** Suggestion 2 **: **Broaden the SMARTS pattern for Rule 9 to include other ring variations.** The current pattern for pyridine carboxylic acids `'n1cccc([CX3](=O)[OX2H1])c1'` only matches pyridine rings. If the rule should include analogs like pyridazine or pyrimidine carboxylic acids, adjust the SMARTS to include rings with varying numbers and positions of nitrogen atoms. Consider using aromatic heterocycles with the carboxylic acid attached: `'[n]1[c,n][c,n][c,n][c,n][c,n]1[C](=O)[O]'`.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: **Improve chain length flexibility in Rule 3 SMARTS patterns.** Instead of hardcoding specific chain lengths in the patterns for ω-amino acids, use SMARTS repetition operators to define variable chain lengths. For example:
  - For chain lengths ≤5 (high yield):
    - `'[NX3H2]-[CH2]{2,5}-[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'`
  - For chain lengths >5 (low yield):
    - `'[NX3H2]-[CH2]{6,}-[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'`

- ** Suggestion 4 **: **Ensure exclude patterns are correctly applied.** In some cases, molecules that should match a rule are being missed due to the improper application of exclude patterns. Verify that the code correctly checks for exclude patterns only after a positive match is found and that exclude patterns are properly structured.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: **Correct the SMARTS syntax where necessary.** Review all SMARTS patterns for syntactical accuracy, especially the use of brackets, atoms, and bonds. For instance, in the pattern for multiple ether linkages in Rule 11, the syntax `'[OX2][CX4]' * 3 + '[OX2H]'` is incorrect in SMARTS language. Instead, use repetition operators or proper concatenation:
  - `'([OX2][CX4]){3}[OX2H]'`

- ** Suggestion 6 **: **Test SMARTS patterns individually with known molecules.** Before applying the patterns to the full dataset, test each SMARTS pattern against molecules known to match or not match the rule. This will help identify any mismatches or oversights in the pattern definitions.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: **Use RDKit's built-in functions for pattern matching more effectively.** Utilize RDKit's capabilities, such as `Chem.MolFromSmarts()` and substructure search functions, ensuring that molecule sanitization and valence considerations are appropriately handled.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: **Include stereochemistry where relevant.** For rules involving chiral centers or specific stereochemistry (e.g., α-amino acids), ensure that the SMARTS patterns account for stereochemistry if it affects the prediction.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: **Clarify and standardize definitions of functional groups and substituents.** Ensure that terms like "electron-withdrawing groups" and "electron-donating groups" are clearly defined in the code, possibly by creating separate lists of SMARTS patterns representing each group type.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: **Enhance code readability and maintainability.** Refactor the code to improve readability, such as by defining helper functions for common tasks (e.g., matching patterns with excludes), adding comments, and organizing SMARTS patterns and rules in a structured manner.

Metric Commenter Message:
After analyzing the current rules and their associated metrics in comparison to the previous metrics, several observations can be made regarding their performance, particularly focusing on **confidence** and **lift**. Here's a detailed analysis along with suggestions for improving the current rules.

---

### **Comparison of Current Metrics with Previous Metrics**

#### **1. Support**

- **Current Train Support:** 0.0114 (1.14%)
- **Previous Train Support:** 0.1667 (16.67%) and 0.1845 (18.45%)

**Observation:**
The current rules have significantly lower support compared to the previous rules. This means that the conditions specified by the current rules apply to a much smaller portion of the training data.

#### **2. Confidence**

- **Current Train Confidence:** 0.63 (63%)
- **Previous Train Confidence:** 0.6352 (63.52%) and 0.5396 (53.96%)

**Observation:**
The confidence level of the current rules is comparable to the previous rules, indicating that when the rule conditions are met, the predictions are correct approximately 63% of the time.

#### **3. Lift**

- **Current Train Lift:** 1.2650
- **Previous Train Lift:** 1.2048 and 1.0559

**Observation:**
The current rules have a higher lift compared to the previous rules. A lift greater than 1 indicates that the rule is effective at increasing the probability of the prediction compared to random chance. The higher lift suggests a stronger association between the rule conditions and the prediction.

#### **4. Leverage**

- **Current Train Leverage:** 0.0044
- **Previous Train Leverage:** 0.0289 and -0.0041

**Observation:**
While the leverage of the current rules is positive, indicating a positive association, it is lower than the positive leverage of one of the previous rules and higher than the negative leverage of the other. This suggests that the current rules provide a modest increase in predictive power over random chance.

---

### **Analysis of Current Rules Performance**

#### **Strengths**

- **High Confidence:** With a confidence level of 63%, the current rules reliably predict outcomes when their conditions are met.
- **Higher Lift:** A lift of 1.2650 indicates that the current rules are more effective at predicting the desired outcome compared to the previous rules.

#### **Weaknesses**

- **Low Support:** The very low support of 1.14% implies that the rules apply to a minimal portion of the dataset. This limits the overall impact and utility of the rules.
- **Limited Generalizability:** The low support suggests that the rules may be too specific or tailored to niche cases, reducing their applicability to new data.

---

### **Determining if a Local Minimum Has Been Reached**

The current metrics imply that the rules have reached a point where improvements in confidence and lift are accompanied by a decrease in support. This trade-off suggests that further iterations may lead to increasingly specific rules that do not generalize well.

- **Local Minimum Indicators:**
  - **High Confidence and Lift with Low Support:** Indicates overfitting to the training data.
  - **Marginal Gains:** The increase in lift is relatively small compared to the significant decrease in support.
  
Given these indicators, it's plausible that a local minimum has been reached. Continuing to refine the rules without addressing the low support may not yield substantial improvements.

---

### **Recommendations for Improving the Current Rules**

#### **1. Increase Rule Support**

- **Broaden Rule Conditions:** Modify the rules to encompass a wider range of cases without sacrificing too much confidence.
- **Identify Commonalities:** Look for shared features among multiple high-yield modifiers to create more general rules.
- **Example:** Combine rules with similar functional groups or structural characteristics to cover more data instances.

#### **2. Balance Specificity and Generality**

- **Avoid Over-Specification:** Ensure that the rules are not overly specific to certain compounds or conditions.
- **Generalize Patterns:** Focus on underlying chemical principles that apply to broader categories of modifiers.
- **Example:** Instead of specifying exact chain lengths, consider ranges or the presence of functional groups.

#### **3. Enhance Feature Representation**

- **Feature Engineering:** Introduce new features that capture relevant chemical properties, such as electronic effects, steric hindrance, or solubility.
- **Quantitative Descriptors:** Use quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) to better represent the modifiers.
- **Example:** Include descriptors like molecular weight, polar surface area, or logP values.

#### **4. Simplify and Consolidate Rules**

- **Eliminate Redundancies:** Merge overlapping rules to simplify the rule set.
- **Focus on Key Predictors:** Identify the most influential features and prioritize them in the rules.
- **Example:** If multiple rules predict high yield based on electron-withdrawing groups, consolidate them into a single, more general rule.

#### **5. Validate with Test Data**

- **Assess Generalizability:** Evaluate the rules using test data to ensure they perform well on unseen compounds.
- **Iterative Testing:** Incorporate feedback from test results to refine the rules further.
- **Example:** Monitor test confidence and lift alongside training metrics to detect overfitting.

#### **6. Incorporate Domain Knowledge**

- **Leverage Chemical Insights:** Use established chemical principles to guide rule formulation.
- **Consult Experts:** Collaborate with chemists to validate the plausibility of the rules.
- **Example:** Re-evaluate rules that contradict known reactivity patterns or mechanistic pathways.

---

### **Conclusion**

While the current rules exhibit **high confidence** and **increased lift**, the **low support** indicates that they are not widely applicable across the dataset. To improve the performance of the rules:

- **Aim to increase support** by generalizing the rules without substantially compromising confidence and lift.
- **Strike a balance** between specificity and generality to avoid overfitting while maintaining predictive power.
- **Enhance the feature set** and utilize domain knowledge to create more robust and broadly applicable rules.

By implementing these recommendations, the rules can be refined to achieve better overall performance, ensuring they are both reliable and applicable to a larger portion of the dataset.

Traditional Commenter Message:
**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

**Comments on Accuracies:**

The current model's validation accuracy is **0.514**, which is significantly lower than the previous validation accuracies listed for reference, which ranged from **0.68** to **0.76**. The previous test accuracies were **0.75** and **0.625**, whereas the current test accuracy is not provided but can be inferred to be lower due to decreased validation performance. This decline indicates that the model's predictive capability has diminished in the current iteration.

**Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting:**

The substantial drop in validation accuracy suggests that the model may be **underfitting**. This occurs when the model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data. It could be due to the current rules not effectively representing the important features influencing the loading of modifiers on the catalyst. Alternatively, if the training accuracy is significantly higher than the validation accuracy (not provided here), it could point to **overfitting**, but with the available information, underfitting seems more likely.

**SHAP Analysis Feedback:**

The SHAP analysis reveals that for numerous molecules, the model predicts a **low loading**, while the experimental value is **high**. Specifically, **Rule17** consistently exhibits a **negative SHAP value** for high loading across these molecules:

- **Rule17 SHAP value for high loading:** Approximately **-0.0185** to **-0.0198**

This negative SHAP value indicates that Rule17 is contributing to the model's prediction of low loading in cases where the actual experimental loading is high. According to the guidance, when the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, the rule with the most negative SHAP value is likely problematic.

**Effectiveness of Current Rules:**

Given the decreased validation accuracy and the SHAP analysis, it appears that the **current rules are not effective enough**. Rule17, in particular, may be adversely affecting the model's performance by incorrectly influencing the predictions toward low loading in cases where high loading is observed experimentally.

**Interpretation of Accuracy Improvements:**

The current accuracy metrics suggest that the probability of improvement in the model's performance using the current rules is low. The decrease in validation accuracy implies that the model is not learning the patterns necessary to make accurate predictions. This could mean that the model has reached a local minimum and that further iterations using the same rules may not yield better results without significant changes.

---

**Recommendations for Improvement**

**1. Refine Rule17:**

- **Issue Identified:** Rule17 consistently contributes negative SHAP values in cases where the experimental loading is high.
- **Action Recommended:** Re-examine Rule17 to understand its conditions and how it may be adversely affecting predictions. Consider whether the rule is too restrictive or misclassifying features that correlate with high loading.
- **Improvement Strategy:**
  - **Adjust thresholds or conditions** within Rule17 to reduce its negative impact.
  - **Incorporate exceptions** or additional criteria that allow for cases where high loading is experimentally observed.

**2. Add New Rules to Capture Missing Features:**

- **Issue Identified:** The current rules may not account for all structural features influencing high loading.
- **Action Recommended:** Analyze molecules with high experimental loading but low predicted loading to identify common features not covered by existing rules.
- **Improvement Strategy:**
  - **Identify new functional groups** or **structural motifs** present in misclassified molecules.
  - **Develop new rules** that specifically address these features, enhancing the model's ability to predict high loading.

**3. Adjust Existing Rules for Better Generalization:**

- **Issue Identified:** Existing rules may be too general or overly narrow, leading to incorrect predictions.
- **Action Recommended:** Review and fine-tune the existing rules to improve their general applicability.
- **Improvement Strategy:**
  - **Broaden overly specific rules** to include a wider range of relevant molecules.
  - **Narrow down overly general rules** to exclude irrelevant or misleading features.
  - **Balance specificity and generality** to enhance rule effectiveness.

**Conclusion**

The current model suffers from decreased validation accuracy and appears to be underfitting, indicating that the existing rules, particularly **Rule17**, may not be effectively capturing the key features influencing the loading of modifiers on the catalyst. By refining problematic rules, introducing new rules to cover missing features, and adjusting existing rules for better generalization, the model's performance can be improved. Leveraging insights from SHAP analysis, though not directly altering rules based on SHAP values alone, provides valuable guidance for focusing refinement efforts. An iterative approach, coupled with careful evaluation at each step, will enhance the rules' effectiveness and lead to more accurate predictions.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

The analysis of the current rules for predicting the yield of the remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction reveals several critical insights:

1. **Performance Metrics Indicate Issues**:
   - **Low Support**: The current rules apply to only **1.14%** of the training data, a significant decrease from the previous support levels of around **16-18%**. This implies that the rules are too specific and do not generalize well across the dataset.
   - **Validation Accuracy Decrease**: The validation accuracy has dropped to **51.43%**, significantly lower than previous accuracies ranging from **68% to 76%**. This suggests that the model's predictive capability has diminished.
   - **SHAP Analysis Highlights Problematic Rule**: **Rule17** consistently contributes negative SHAP values in cases where the experimental loading is high but the model predicts low loading. This indicates that Rule17 may be adversely affecting the model's performance.

2. **Possible Underfitting and Overfitting**:
   - The substantial drop in validation accuracy without a corresponding increase in training accuracy suggests **underfitting**, where the model fails to capture the underlying patterns in the data.
   - The low support and high lift of the current rules may also indicate **overfitting** to a small subset of the data, making the model less generalizable.

3. **Suggestions for Improvement**:
   - **Adjust SMARTS Patterns**: Modify the SMARTS patterns in the rules to correctly capture the intended chemical structures.
     - **Rule 4 (Electron-Withdrawing Groups)**: Correct the SMARTS pattern to accurately recognize halogens and nitro groups at the para position of benzoic acids.
     - **Rule 9 (Pyridine Carboxylic Acids)**: Broaden the pattern to include other aromatic heterocycles with carboxylic acid groups.
   - **Broaden Rule Conditions**: Increase the support by generalizing overly specific rules without significantly compromising confidence and lift.
     - **Rule 3 (ω-Amino Acids)**: Use variable chain lengths in the SMARTS patterns to include more molecules with similar characteristics.
   - **Correct Syntax Errors**: Ensure that all SMARTS patterns are syntactically correct and accurately represent the intended chemical features.
     - **Rule 11 (Ether Linkages)**: Correct the syntax for multiple ether linkages to properly match the intended molecules.
   - **Refine Problematic Rules**: Re-examine and adjust rules that negatively impact model performance.
     - **Rule17**: Analyze the conditions of Rule17 to identify why it contributes to incorrect predictions and modify it accordingly.

4. **Enhance Feature Representation**:
   - **Incorporate Additional Descriptors**: Utilize quantitative descriptors such as molecular weight, polar surface area, and logP to capture relevant chemical properties influencing the yield.
   - **Leverage Domain Knowledge**: Apply established chemical principles to guide rule formulation, ensuring that rules align with known reactivity patterns and mechanistic insights.

5. **Improve Generalization**:
   - **Balance Specificity and Generality**: Adjust rules to avoid being overly specific to certain compounds, thus preventing overfitting.
   - **Simplify and Consolidate Rules**: Merge overlapping rules and focus on key predictors that have the most significant impact on yield.

6. **Iterative Testing and Validation**:
   - **Test SMARTS Patterns Individually**: Validate each SMARTS pattern against known molecules to ensure they match correctly.
   - **Cross-Validation**: Use robust evaluation methods to assess the model's performance after each refinement, preventing overfitting.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

Yes, there is significant potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting:

- **Increase Support Without Sacrificing Confidence**: By generalizing rules and correctly adjusting SMARTS patterns, we can increase the support while maintaining or improving confidence and lift.
- **Correct Known Issues**: Addressing the specific problems identified with rules like Rule17 can enhance model performance and accuracy.
- **Leverage SHAP Analysis for Targeted Improvements**: Use insights from SHAP values to identify and refine rules that are negatively impacting predictions.

**Conclusion**

To enhance the model's predictive performance and ensure it generalizes well to new data, it is necessary to optimize the current rules. This involves adjusting SMARTS patterns, broadening rule conditions, refining problematic rules, and incorporating additional chemical descriptors.

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with non-aromatic side chains** predict **high yield**. These molecules have an amino group attached to the α-carbon adjacent to the carboxylic acid, and their side chains are small, polar, or non-aromatic. The absence of bulky or aromatic side chains allows better interaction with the catalyst’s active sites. Examples include **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** and **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid**.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with aromatic side chains** predict **low yield**, except when the side chain contains an **indole ring**, which predicts **high yield**. Aromatic side chains can introduce steric hindrance, reducing catalyst access. However, indole groups may facilitate π-π stacking or coordination with the catalyst, enhancing yield. Examples: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** predicts **low yield**; **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** predicts **high yield**.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **ω-amino acids with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer** predict **high yield**, while those with longer chains predict **low yield**. Shorter chains allow the amino group to interact effectively with the catalyst, enhancing reactivity. Examples: **5-aminopentanoic acid** predicts **high yield**; **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid** predict **low yield** due to increased chain flexibility and reduced effective concentration at the active site.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position** predict **high yield**, except when the substituent is a **formyl group**, which predicts **low yield**. EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, improving coordination with the metal center. Examples: **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** predict **high yield**; **4-formylbenzoic acid** predicts **low yield** possibly due to chelation via the aldehyde, deactivating the catalyst.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **benzoic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position** predict **variable yields**. **Para-amino-substituted benzoic acids** predict **high yield** due to enhanced coordination through the amino group. Other EDGs like methyl or hydroxy groups may reduce acidity and hinder catalyst interaction, predicting **low yield**. Examples: **4-aminobenzoic acid** predicts **high yield**; **4-methylbenzoic acid** and **4-hydroxybenzoic acid** predict **low yield**.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups** predict **high yield**. The hydrophobic chains can interact favorably with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst, improving substrate alignment. Example: **octanoic acid** predicts **high yield**.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal hydroxyl or amino groups** predict **low yield**. Additional polar groups may lead to unwanted side interactions or interfere with catalyst binding. Examples: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** and **7-aminoheptanoic acid** predict **low yield**.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with **perfluorinated alkyl chains** predict **low yield**. The high electronegativity and steric bulk of fluorine atoms can hinder effective interaction with the catalyst’s active sites. Example: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** predicts **low yield**.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **pyridine carboxylic acids**—where the carboxyl group is directly attached to the pyridine ring—predict **high yield**. The lone pair on the nitrogen can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst reactivity. Examples: **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** and **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** predict **high yield**.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers where a **pyridine ring is connected to a carboxylic acid via an alkyl chain** predict **high yield**, as the flexible linker allows simultaneous interactions with the catalyst. In contrast, modifiers where the pyridine ring is connected via a phenyl ring predict **low yield** due to rigidity and steric hindrance. Examples: **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** predicts **high yield**; **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** predicts **low yield**.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with **long hydrophilic chains or ether linkages**, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) units, predict **low yield**. These groups increase steric bulk and solubility in the solvent over binding affinity to the catalyst, reducing effectiveness. Examples: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** predict **low yield**.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **thiol groups attached to aliphatic chains** predict **high yield**. Aliphatic thiols can form favorable interactions with the catalyst without deactivating it. In contrast, **thiol groups attached to aromatic rings** predict **low yield** because they may bind too strongly to the metal center, inhibiting catalytic activity. Examples: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** predicts **high yield**; **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** predicts **low yield**.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **phenylalkanoic acids with aliphatic chains longer than three carbons**, especially when substituted with **electron-donating groups (EDGs)**, predict **high yield**. The longer linker allows optimal positioning of the aromatic ring, and EDGs can enhance interactions with the catalyst. Modifiers with shorter chains predict **low yield** due to suboptimal positioning. Examples: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** and **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** predict **high yield**; **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** predicts **low yield**.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Adjust the SMARTS Patterns for Rule 4**  
  Modify Rule 4's SMARTS pattern to accurately identify **benzoic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position**, excluding the formyl group. Ensure the pattern captures common EWGs such as nitro (`[N+](=O)[O-]`), halogens (`F`, `Cl`, `Br`), cyano (`C#N`), trifluoromethyl (`CF3`), and others when attached at the para position of the benzene ring. For example, the SMARTS pattern can be:
  ```
  OC(=O)c1ccc(cc1)[$(F),$(Cl),$(Br),$(N(=O)=O),$(C#N),$(C(F)(F)F)]
  ```
  This adjustment will increase the rule's support and accuracy.

- **Advice 2**: **Incorporate the Exception for Formyl Group in Rule 4**  
  Specifically exclude benzoic acids with a para-formyl group from Rule 4 by adding a negative lookahead in the SMARTS pattern. For instance:
  ```
  OC(=O)c1ccc(C=O)cc1
  ```
  Use this pattern to predict **low yield** for modifiers like **4-formylbenzoic acid**, ensuring the exception is correctly applied.

- **Advice 3**: **Broaden Rule 9 to Include Similar Aromatic Heterocycles**  
  Expand Rule 9 to encompass modifiers that are **aromatic heterocycles with a carboxylic acid group**, not just pyridine carboxylic acids. Modify the SMARTS pattern to include rings such as pyrimidine, pyrazine, and others. Example SMARTS pattern:
  ```
  [nH]1cccc1C(=O)O
  ```
  or a more general pattern:
  ```
  [nX2][cX3][cX3][cX3][cX3][cX3]C(=O)O
  ```
  This change will cover a broader range of effective modifiers, potentially increasing high-yield predictions.

- **Advice 4**: **Generalize Chain Lengths in Rule 3**  
  Adjust Rule 3's SMARTS pattern to include **ω-amino acids with variable chain lengths of five carbons or fewer**. Use recursive SMARTS to define a variable aliphatic chain length:
  ```
  NCCCC(=O)O
  ```
  or more generally:
  ```
  NCCCC{1,5}C(=O)O
  ```
  This will include a wider range of ω-amino acids, increasing the rule's support while maintaining specificity.

- **Advice 5**: **Correct Syntax Errors in SMARTS Patterns**  
  Review and correct all SMARTS patterns for syntax errors. For Rule 11 (modifiers with ether linkages), ensure the pattern accurately reflects multiple ether groups. Correct pattern:
  ```
  OC(=O)C(OCCOCCOC)*
  ```
  or use a pattern that matches polyethylene glycol (PEG) units:
  ```
  OC(=O)CO(CCO)*H
  ```
  This ensures that modifiers with long hydrophilic chains or ether linkages are correctly identified.

- **Advice 6**: **Refine Problematic Rule 17**  
  Analyze Rule 17 to determine why it contributes negative SHAP values. If Rule 17 involves conditions that erroneously predict low Fe_loading for cases with high experimental loading, adjust the rule's conditions or thresholds. Ensure that the rule aligns with the data trends, possibly by:

  - Re-evaluating the molecular features used.
  - Adjusting numerical thresholds or categories.
  - Removing or modifying the rule if it cannot be corrected.

- **Advice 7**: **Validate SMARTS Patterns Individually**  
  Test each SMARTS pattern against a variety of known molecules to confirm correct matches. Use validation tools or software to:

  - Check for false positives and negatives.
  - Ensure that the patterns only match intended structures.
  - Refine patterns based on testing outcomes.

- **Advice 8**: **Incorporate Additional Molecular Descriptors**  
  Enhance the rules by adding relevant descriptors such as:

  - **Molecular Weight**: Exclude excessively large or small molecules that may not be effective modifiers.
  - **LogP (Octanol-Water Partition Coefficient)**: Account for hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity impacting catalyst interactions.
  - **Topological Polar Surface Area (TPSA)**: Reflect the molecule's ability to participate in hydrogen bonding.

  Use these descriptors to create more nuanced rules that can better predict yields.

- **Advice 9**: **Simplify and Consolidate Overlapping Rules**  
  Review the rules for overlap and redundancy. For example:

  - Combine Rules 6 and 7 if appropriate, distinguishing between aliphatic carboxylic acids with and without polar terminal groups.
  - Merge similar rules predicting low yield due to steric hindrance or electronic effects.

  This simplification will make the rule set more manageable and may improve model performance.

- **Advice 10**: **Align Rules with Chemical Knowledge**  
  Ensure all rules are grounded in established chemical principles:

  - Re-assess rules in light of mechanistic insights into the reaction.
  - Consider the electronic and steric effects of substituents on catalyst interaction.
  - Consult literature to support rule conditions and exceptions.

  This alignment will enhance the credibility and effectiveness of the rules.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with small or non-aromatic side chains** predict **high yield**. These molecules have an amino group attached to the α-carbon adjacent to the carboxylic acid, and their side chains are small or acidic. Examples include **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid) and **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid). The absence of bulky or hydrophobic side chains allows better interaction with the catalyst’s active sites.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with aromatic side chains other than indole** predict **low yield**. Aromatic side chains like phenyl can introduce steric hindrance and reduce catalyst accessibility. Example: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine) predicts **low yield**.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with an indole side chain** predict **high yield**. The indole ring can facilitate favorable π-π interactions or coordinate with the catalyst, enhancing reactivity. Example: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan) predicts **high yield**.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **ω-amino acids with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer** predict **high yield**. Short-chain ω-amino acids like **5-aminopentanoic acid** interact effectively with the catalyst. Those with longer chains predict **low yield** due to increased flexibility and reduced effective concentration at the active site. Examples: **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid** predict **low yield**.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **benzoic acids substituted at the para position with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)** predict **high yield**, except when the substituent is a **formyl group**, which predicts **low yield**. EWGs like nitro and bromomethyl enhance the acidity of the carboxylic acid, improving coordination with the metal center. Examples: **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** predict **high yield**; **4-formylbenzoic acid** predicts **low yield** due to potential chelation through the aldehyde group.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **benzoic acids substituted at the para position with an amino group** predict **high yield**. The amino group can form additional coordination bonds with the catalyst, enhancing reactivity. Example: **4-aminobenzoic acid** predicts **high yield**.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **benzoic acids substituted at the para position with electron-donating groups (EDGs)** other than amino groups predict **low yield**. EDGs like methyl or hydroxy decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, hindering effective catalyst coordination. Examples: **4-methylbenzoic acid** and **4-hydroxybenzoic acid** derivatives predict **low yield**.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **pyridine carboxylic acids**, where the carboxyl group is directly attached to the pyridine ring, predict **high yield**. The nitrogen atom can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity. Examples: **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid) and **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** predict **high yield**.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers where a **pyridine ring is linked to a carboxylic acid via an aliphatic chain** predict **high yield**. The flexible linker allows simultaneous interactions of the pyridine nitrogen and carboxylate with the catalyst. Example: **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** predicts **high yield**.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers where a **pyridine ring is connected to a carboxylic acid through a rigid aromatic linker** predict **low yield** due to steric hindrance and reduced flexibility. Example: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** predicts **low yield**.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups** predict **high yield**. The hydrophobic chains may align the substrate effectively with the catalyst. Example: **octanoic acid** predicts **high yield**.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal polar groups (e.g., hydroxy or amino)** predict **low yield**. Additional polar groups may interfere with catalyst binding or lead to unfavorable interactions. Examples: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid** predict **low yield**.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **thiol groups on aliphatic chains** predict **high yield**. Aliphatic thiols can interact favorably with the catalyst without deactivating it. Example: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** predicts **high yield**. In contrast, **thiol groups on aromatic rings** predict **low yield** due to stronger, potentially inhibiting interactions with the metal center. Example: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** predicts **low yield**.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers containing **long hydrophilic chains or polyether groups** (e.g., polyethylene glycol units) predict **low yield**. These bulky, flexible groups may prevent effective coordination with the catalyst's active site. Example: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** predicts **low yield**.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with **perfluorinated alkyl chains** predict **low yield**. The high electronegativity and steric hindrance of fluorine atoms can inhibit interaction with the catalyst. Example: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** predicts **low yield**.

Supported by 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid (high yield), coverage is acceptable but could be broader.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 clearly predicts low yield for modifiers with a pyridine ring connected to a carboxylic acid through a rigid aromatic linker due to steric hindrance. It provides property insight and adds complexity by considering rigidity and linker type. Supported by 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid (low yield), coverage is sufficient.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 clearly predicts high yield for straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups. It offers property insight into hydrophobic interactions aiding alignment. The rule is simple yet effective. Supported by octanoic acid (high yield), coverage may be limited, indicating a need for more data points.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 clearly predicts low yield for aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal polar groups. It provides property insight into interference with catalyst binding. The rule adds complexity by combining structural features and is supported by 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid and 8-aminooctanoic acid (low yield), satisfying coverage.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 clearly distinguishes between thiol groups on aliphatic chains (high yield) and aromatic rings (low yield). It provides property insight into how thiol placement affects catalyst interaction.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 clearly predicts low yield for modifiers with long hydrophilic chains or polyether groups. It provides property insight into steric hindrance preventing coordination. While specific, it adds necessary complexity. Supported by 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid (low yield), coverage may be limited but acceptable for the rule's specificity.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 clearly predicts low yield for modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains due to steric hindrance and electronegativity. It provides property insight and adds complexity. Supported by 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid (low yield), coverage is acceptable for the specificity of the rule.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **
- **Advice 1**: **Develop rules based on quantifiable molecular descriptors.** Utilize numerical molecular properties such as molecular weight, LogP (octanol-water partition coefficient), topological polar surface area (TPSA), number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, and pKa values. These descriptors can be easily calculated from SMILES strings and used to create a numeric feature matrix.

- **Advice 2**: **Simplify and generalize the rules to reduce categorical distinctions.** Instead of specific categories (e.g., "α-amino acids with aromatic side chains other than indole"), consider continuous properties like aromaticity count, ring count, and flexibility (number of rotatable bonds) that can be quantified.

- **Advice 3**: **Incorporate electronic properties into the rules.** Use calculated parameters such as electron density, partial charges, and Hammett sigma constants to account for electron-donating and electron-withdrawing effects. This quantifies the influence of substituents on the carboxylic acid group.

- **Advice 4**: **Use structural fragment counts derived from SMILES.** Count specific functional groups or substructures (e.g., number of carboxylic acid groups, amino groups, hydroxyl groups, aromatic rings) to create numerical features that can be correlated with yield.

- **Advice 5**: **Quantify steric hindrance through molecular size or bulkiness parameters.** Parameters like molar refractivity or van der Waals volume can represent steric effects and be included in the feature matrix.

- **Advice 6**: **Apply chemoinformatics tools to generate descriptors directly from SMILES.** Utilize software packages (e.g., RDKit, PaDEL-Descriptor) to compute a wide range of molecular descriptors automatically, facilitating the creation of a comprehensive numeric feature matrix.

- **Advice 7**: **Revise rules to focus on modifier properties affecting Fe coordination.** Quantify ligand's binding affinity to Fe by calculating binding energies or using proxy descriptors like donor atom count and types (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen donors).

- **Advice 8**: **Integrate hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity balance into the rules.** Use LogP values to represent the modifiers' hydrophobic character, which can influence their interaction with the catalyst and reaction medium.

- **Advice 9**: **Account for the flexibility of modifiers through calculation of rotatable bonds.** Modifiers with a higher number of rotatable bonds may have reduced effective concentration at the active site due to increased flexibility.

- **Advice 10**: **Consider the overall charge and ionization state of modifiers at reaction pH.** Predict the ionization state using pKa calculations, as it can affect the interaction with the catalyst's metal center.

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with small, non-aromatic side chains** predict **high yield**. These molecules have an amino group attached to the α-carbon adjacent to the carboxylic acid and side chains that are small or polar but not bulky or aromatic. Examples include **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid) and **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid). The absence of bulky groups facilitates efficient coordination with the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with aromatic side chains other than indole** predict **low yield**. Aromatic side chains like phenyl groups can introduce steric hindrance and reduce catalyst accessibility. Example: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine).

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with an indole side chain** predict **high yield**. The indole ring in **tryptophan** can form favorable π-π interactions and coordinate with the catalyst, enhancing reactivity. Example: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan).

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **ω-amino acids with carbon chain lengths of five or fewer** predict **high yield**. Short-chain ω-amino acids like **5-aminopentanoic acid** efficiently interact with the catalyst. Those with longer chains (more than five carbons) predict **low yield** due to increased flexibility and reduced effective concentration at the active site. Examples of low-yield modifiers include **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **benzoic acids substituted at the para position with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)** predict **high yield**. EWGs like **nitro**, **bromomethyl**, and **amino** groups enhance the acidity of the carboxylic acid, improving coordination with the metal center of the catalyst. Examples: **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**, and **4-aminobenzoic acid**.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **benzoic acids substituted at the para position with electron-donating groups (EDGs)** predict **low yield**. EDGs like **methyl**, **hydroxy**, and **formyl** groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, hindering effective catalyst coordination. Examples: **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**, and **4-formylbenzoic acid**.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **pyridine carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the pyridine ring** predict **high yield**. The nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity. Examples: **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid) and **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers where a **pyridine ring is linked to a carboxylic acid via a flexible aliphatic chain** predict **high yield**. The flexible linker allows simultaneous interactions of the pyridine nitrogen and carboxylate with the catalyst. Example: **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers where a **pyridine ring is connected to a carboxylic acid through a rigid aromatic linker** predict **low yield**. The rigidity and steric hindrance reduce the ability of functional groups to coordinate effectively with the catalyst. Example: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups** predict **high yield**. These hydrophobic chains may enhance substrate alignment with the catalyst. Example: **octanoic acid**.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal polar groups** (e.g., **hydroxy** or **amino** groups) predict **low yield**. Additional polar groups can interfere with catalyst binding or lead to unfavorable interactions. Examples: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** and **7-aminoheptanoic acid**.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic thiol carboxylic acids** predict **high yield**. Aliphatic thiols can interact favorably with the catalyst without deactivating it. Example: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aromatic thiol carboxylic acids** predict **low yield**. Aromatic thiols may bind too strongly to the metal center, potentially acting as catalyst poisons. Example: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers containing **perfluorinated alkyl chains** predict **low yield**. The high electronegativity and steric hindrance of fluorine atoms can inhibit interaction with the catalyst. Example: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with **long hydrophilic chains or polyether groups** (e.g., **polyethylene glycol units**) predict **low yield**. These bulky, flexible groups may prevent effective coordination with the catalyst's active site. Example: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with small, non-aromatic side chains** predict **high yield**. These molecules have an amino group attached to the α-carbon adjacent to the carboxylic acid and side chains that are small or polar but not bulky or aromatic. Examples include **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid) and **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid). The absence of bulky groups facilitates efficient coordination with the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with aromatic side chains other than indole** predict **low yield**. Aromatic side chains like phenyl groups can introduce steric hindrance and reduce catalyst accessibility. Example: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine).

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with an indole side chain** predict **high yield**. The indole ring in **tryptophan** can form favorable π-π interactions and coordinate with the catalyst, enhancing reactivity. Example: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan).

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **ω-amino acids with carbon chain lengths of five or fewer** predict **high yield**. Short-chain ω-amino acids like **5-aminopentanoic acid** efficiently interact with the catalyst. Those with longer chains (more than five carbons) predict **low yield** due to increased flexibility and reduced effective concentration at the active site. Examples of low-yield modifiers include **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **benzoic acids substituted at the para position with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)** predict **high yield**. EWGs like **nitro**, **bromomethyl**, and **amino** groups enhance the acidity of the carboxylic acid, improving coordination with the metal center of the catalyst. Examples: **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**, and **4-aminobenzoic acid**.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **benzoic acids substituted at the para position with electron-donating groups (EDGs)** predict **low yield**. EDGs like **methyl**, **hydroxy**, and **formyl** groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, hindering effective catalyst coordination. Examples: **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**, and **4-formylbenzoic acid**.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **pyridine carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the pyridine ring** predict **high yield**. The nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity. Examples: **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid) and **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers where a **pyridine ring is linked to a carboxylic acid via a flexible aliphatic chain** predict **high yield**. The flexible linker allows simultaneous interactions of the pyridine nitrogen and carboxylate with the catalyst. Example: **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers where a **pyridine ring is connected to a carboxylic acid through a rigid aromatic linker** predict **low yield**. The rigidity and steric hindrance reduce the ability of functional groups to coordinate effectively with the catalyst. Example: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups** predict **high yield**. These hydrophobic chains may enhance substrate alignment with the catalyst. Example: **octanoic acid**.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal polar groups** (e.g., **hydroxy** or **amino** groups) predict **low yield**. Additional polar groups can interfere with catalyst binding or lead to unfavorable interactions. Examples: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** and **7-aminoheptanoic acid**.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic thiol carboxylic acids** predict **high yield**. Aliphatic thiols can interact favorably with the catalyst without deactivating it. Example: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aromatic thiol carboxylic acids** predict **low yield**. Aromatic thiols may bind too strongly to the metal center, potentially acting as catalyst poisons. Example: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers containing **perfluorinated alkyl chains** predict **low yield**. The high electronegativity and steric hindrance of fluorine atoms can inhibit interaction with the catalyst. Example: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with **long hydrophilic chains or polyether groups** (e.g., **polyethylene glycol units**) predict **low yield**. These bulky, flexible groups may prevent effective coordination with the catalyst's active site. Example: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.

Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: **Revise the SMARTS pattern for Rule 1** to accurately identify α-amino acids with small, non-aromatic side chains. The current pattern `'[NX3][CX4H]([C,H,N,O])(C(=O)[OX1H])'` may not effectively capture α-amino acids. Consider specifying that the α-carbon is connected to a small aliphatic side chain, such as methyl or ethyl groups. A revised pattern could be `'[NX3][CH]([CH3,CH2][!c])[C](=O)[OH]'`, ensuring the side chain is non-aromatic and small.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Improve the exclusion pattern in Rule 1** to more effectively exclude aromatic side chains. The current exclusion pattern `'[NX3][CX4H](c)(C(=O)[OX1H])'` only excludes cases where the side chain is directly attached to an aromatic carbon. To exclude any side chain containing an aromatic ring, use a recursive SMARTS pattern like `'[NX3][CX4H]([#6][#6]*a)[C](=O)[OX1H]'`, where `*a` matches any atom connected to an aromatic system.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Adjust the SMARTS pattern for Rule 2** to ensure it matches α-amino acids with aromatic side chains other than indole. The current pattern `'[NX3][CX4H](c)(C(=O)[OX1H])'` may not capture all relevant structures. Refine it to `'[NX3][CH](c[!n])[C](=O)[OH]'` to match aromatic side chains excluding indole. Additionally, explicitly exclude indole-containing side chains by adding an exclusion pattern for indole rings.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Correct the exclusion of indole in Rule 2**. The current exclusion pattern `'[#6]-1:[#6]:[#7]:[#6]:[#6]:[#6]:1'` may not correctly identify indole rings in side chains. Use a more precise pattern like `'[#6]-1:[#6]:[nH]:[#6]:[#6]:[#6]:1'` to match indole. Implement this exclusion in the code to prevent indole-containing amino acids from being incorrectly classified under Rule 2.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Refine the SMARTS pattern for Rule 3** to accurately match α-amino acids with an indole side chain (tryptophan). The current pattern `'[NX3][CX4H]([#6]-[#6]-1:[#6]:[#7]:[#6]:[#6]:[#6]:1)(C(=O)[OX1H])'` may be too specific or incorrectly formatted. Use a pattern like `'[NX3][CH](Cc1c[nH]c2ccccc12)[C](=O)[OH]'` to specifically match tryptophan's side chain.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Differentiate Rule 4 into two separate rules** with unique identifiers. The code currently assigns both the high-yield (short-chain) and low-yield (long-chain) ω-amino acids to `'rule': 4`, which leads to duplicated columns in the feature matrix. Assign them as `'rule': 4a` for short chains predicting high yield and `'rule': 4b` for long chains predicting low yield to avoid confusion.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Adjust the SMARTS pattern for Rule 4 (low yield)** to correctly match ω-amino acids with carbon chain lengths of more than five. The current pattern `'[NX3][CH2]{5,}[C](=O)[OX1H]'` includes chains of five carbons, which should predict high yield according to the rule. Modify the pattern to `'[NX3][CH2]{6,}[C](=O)[OX1H]'` to match chains longer than five carbons.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Refine the SMARTS pattern for Rule 5** to ensure it matches benzoic acids substituted at the para position with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs). The current pattern `'O=C([OH])c1ccc([N,O,S,F,Cl,Br,I])cc1'` may match substitutions at any position. Use a pattern that specifies the para position, such as `'O=C([OH])c1cc([H])cc([N,O,S,F,Cl,Br,I])c1'`, to target substitutions specifically at the para position.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Improve the SMARTS pattern for Rule 6** to accurately capture benzoic acids substituted at the para position with electron-donating groups (EDGs). The current pattern `'O=C([OH])c1ccc([C,N,O,S][C,H])cc1'` might not precisely identify EDGs or their para position. Refine it to `'O=C([OH])c1cc([H])cc([C,N,O,S][C,H])c1'` to specify para substitution and correctly identify EDGs.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Verify and adjust the SMARTS patterns for Rules 7, 8, and 9** to ensure they distinguish between pyridine carboxylic acids with different linkers. Explicitly define the positions and types of linkers in the patterns. For example, for Rule 7, use `'O=C([OH])c1ccncc1'` to match carboxylic acids directly attached to the pyridine ring.

- **Suggestion 11**: **Reexamine the SMARTS pattern for Rule 10** to ensure it excludes polar functional groups. The current exclusion of polar groups using `'[NX3,OX2,SX2]'` may not be effective. Instead, use `'[!$([CH2][NX3,OX2,SX2])]'` to exclude any aliphatic chain containing these polar groups.

- **Suggestion 12**: **Enhance the SMARTS pattern for Rule 11** to accurately identify aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal polar groups. The current pattern `'O=C([OH])[CH2]{1,4}[NX3,OX2,SX2H]'` may need refinement. Specify that the terminal polar group is at the end of the chain, such as `'O=C([OH])[CH2]{1,4}[NX3H2,OX2H,SX2H]'`.

- **Suggestion 13**: **Clarify the SMARTS patterns for Rules 12 and 13** to distinguish between aliphatic and aromatic thiol carboxylic acids. Ensure Rule 12's pattern matches aliphatic thiols like `'O=C([OH])[CH2]{1,3}[SH]'`, and Rule 13's pattern matches aromatic thiols like `'O=C([OH])c1ccc([SH])cc1'`.

- **Suggestion 14**: **Correct the SMARTS pattern for Rule 14** to effectively identify modifiers containing perfluorinated alkyl chains. The current pattern `'[CX4]([CF3])([CF3])[CX4]'` is simplified and may not capture all relevant structures. Use a more comprehensive pattern like `'C(F)(F)C(F)(F)C(F)(F)C(=O)[OH]'` to match perfluorinated chains connected to a carboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 15**: **Generalize the SMARTS pattern for Rule 15** to match modifiers with long hydrophilic chains or polyether groups. The current pattern `'OCCOCCOCC(=O)[OH]'` is too specific. Use a pattern like `'OCC(OCC)*C(=O)[OH]'` to match molecules with multiple ethylene glycol units terminating with a carboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 16**: **Validate SMARTS patterns using known examples**. For each rule, test the SMARTS patterns against known molecules that should match and should not match. Adjust the patterns based on these validations to improve accuracy.

- **Suggestion 17**: **Include comprehensive exclusion patterns where necessary**. For cases where specific structures should be excluded (e.g., indole in Rule 2), ensure that the exclusion patterns are comprehensive and correctly implemented in the code.

- **Suggestion 18**: **Add comments and documentation in the code** to explain the purpose of each SMARTS pattern and any complex logic involved. This will aid in future debugging and code maintenance.

- **Suggestion 19**: **Implement error handling and logging** to capture cases where a molecule fails to parse or a pattern fails to compile. This information can be invaluable for debugging issues with specific SMILES strings or SMARTS patterns.

- **Suggestion 20**: **Review and update the molecule parsing method** to ensure all valid SMILES strings are correctly converted to RDKit molecule objects. Handle cases where the molecule might not parse due to stereochemistry or valence issues.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

Upon examining the current rule metrics in comparison to the reference metrics, several observations can be made, particularly focusing on **confidence** and **lift**, as requested.

---

**Current Metrics:**

- **Train Support:** 0.0125
- **Train Confidence:** 0.6667
- **Train Lift:** 1.3327
- **Train Leverage:** 0.0054

**Previous Iteration Metrics:**

- **Train Support:** 0.0114
- **Train Confidence:** 0.63
- **Train Lift:** 1.2650
- **Train Leverage:** 0.0044

**Reference Metrics (Averages of Previous Rule Matrices):**

- **Train Support:** [0.1667, 0.1845]
- **Train Confidence:** [0.6352, 0.5396]
- **Train Lift:** [1.2048, 1.0559]
- **Train Leverage:** [0.0289, -0.0041]

---

### **Positive Observations:**

1. **Improved Confidence:**
   - The **current train confidence** is **66.67%**, which is higher than both the **previous iteration (63%)** and the **reference metrics** (average of **63.52%** and **53.96%**).
   - This indicates that, given the rule conditions are met, the likelihood of the rule prediction being true has increased.

2. **Enhanced Lift:**
   - The **current train lift** is **1.3327**, surpassing both the **previous iteration (1.2650)** and the **reference metrics** (averages of **1.2048** and **1.0559**).
   - A lift greater than 1 suggests that the rule is better at predicting positive outcomes than random chance. The increase indicates stronger predictive power.

3. **Positive Leverage:**
   - The **current train leverage** is **0.0054**, slightly higher than the **previous iteration (0.0044)**.
   - Positive leverage signifies that the rule predicts combinations that occur more frequently than would be expected by chance, albeit the increase is marginal.

### **Areas of Concern:**

1. **Low Support:**
   - The **current train support** is **0.0125**, which is significantly lower than the **reference metrics** (averages of **0.1667** and **0.1845**).
   - This means that the rules apply to only **1.25%** of the training data, compared to approximately **16.67%** to **18.45%** previously.
   - Low support indicates that while the rules may be accurate when applicable, they cover a very small portion of the dataset, limiting their overall impact.

2. **Marginal Increase in Leverage:**
   - Although leverage has increased, the absolute value remains low (**0.0054**), especially when compared to the higher reference leverage (**0.0289**).
   - This suggests that the additional predictive power over random chance is minimal.

### **Assessment of Iteration and Local Minimum:**

- **Local Minimum Indication:**
  - The increase in **confidence** and **lift** comes at the expense of **support**.
  - The rules have become more precise but less generalizable, covering fewer instances.
  - This trade-off suggests that we may be approaching a **local minimum**, where further iterations may yield diminishing returns or exacerbate the issue.

- **Iteration Sufficiency:**
  - Given the metrics, it appears that the current rules have been fine-tuned to optimize confidence and lift for a small subset of data.
  - Additional iterations without a change in strategy are unlikely to significantly improve performance and may risk overfitting.

### **Recommendations for Improving Current Rules:**

1. **Balance Between Support and Confidence:**
   - **Re-evaluate the Rules:** Adjust the rules to find a balance where both **support** and **confidence** are acceptable.
   - **Broaden Rule Conditions:** Incorporate broader conditions that apply to a larger portion of the dataset without significantly compromising confidence.

2. **Merge Similar Rules:**
   - **Combine Overlapping Rules:** Identify rules that predict the same outcome and have overlapping conditions to increase support.
   - **Simplify Rule Sets:** Reducing complexity may enhance generalizability and applicability.

3. **Incorporate Additional Features:**
   - **Feature Engineering:** Introduce new relevant features or descriptors that could improve the predictive power without narrowing the applicability.
   - **Domain Knowledge Integration:** Utilize chemical knowledge to identify key functional groups or molecular properties that influence catalytic activity.

4. **Analyze Misclassified Instances:**
   - **Error Analysis:** Investigate the instances where the rules fail to predict accurately to identify patterns or exceptions.
   - **Adjust for Exceptions:** Modify rules to account for outliers or unique cases that could improve overall performance.

5. **Cross-Validation:**
   - **Evaluate on Test Data:** Assess the rules using cross-validation to ensure that improvements are not due to overfitting.
   - **Monitor Overfitting Risk:** Ensure that high confidence and lift are not just artifacts of the training data.

6. **Incremental Rule Modification:**
   - **Iterative Refinement:** Make small adjustments to the rules and monitor the impact on all metrics, not just confidence and lift.
   - **Metric Thresholds:** Set acceptable thresholds for support, confidence, and lift to guide rule modifications.

### **Conclusion:**

While the current rules exhibit higher confidence and lift, the significantly low support indicates that they are applicable to a very limited subset of data. This limits their utility in practical scenarios. It is essential to revisit the rules to achieve a better balance between **precision** (confidence and lift) and **coverage** (support).

Further iterations should focus on **broadening the applicability** of the rules while **maintaining acceptable levels of confidence and lift**. By doing so, we can enhance the overall performance and practical usefulness of the rules in predicting catalytic activity.

---

**Next Steps:**

- **Re-express Rules for Broader Applicability:** Adjust the specificity of the current rules to cover more instances.
- **Collaborative Review:** Engage with fellow agents to incorporate diverse insights and validate proposed changes.
- **Set Metric Goals:** Define quantifiable targets for support, confidence, and lift to guide further rule development.

Traditional Commenter Message:
**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

Based on the latest training results, the classification model achieved a validation accuracy of approximately **54.29%**. This is a significant decrease compared to the previous validation accuracies, which consistently hovered around **76%**. The prior test accuracies were **75%** and **62.5%**, indicating that the model previously generalized reasonably well to unseen data.

The substantial drop in validation accuracy suggests that the current set of rules may not be effectively capturing the underlying patterns necessary to predict the modifier loading on the catalyst. The model's predictive performance has diminished, indicating that the current iteration of rules may not be as effective as previous versions.

**Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting**

The decrease in both training and validation accuracy implies that the model is likely **underfitting**. Underfitting occurs when the model is too simple to learn the underlying structure of the data. In this context, the current rules may not be capturing essential features or relationships within the chemical structures that influence catalyst loading.

**Analysis of Discrepancies via SHAP Values**

The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis provides insights into how each rule contributes to the model's predictions. For molecules where the predicted loading is **low** but the experimental value is **high**, the rules with the most **negative SHAP values** for high loading are likely problematic. Conversely, for molecules where the predicted loading is **high** but the experimental value is **low**, the rules with the most **positive SHAP values** for high loading may be contributing to overestimations.

From the SHAP analysis:

- **Rule 6** frequently appears with significant negative SHAP values in cases where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high.
- **Rules 8, 9, 10, 14, and 16** also appear in the SHAP analysis but with smaller contributions compared to Rule 6.
- In some cases, **Rule 6** has high positive SHAP values when the predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low.

This indicates that **Rule 6** is influential in both underestimations and overestimations, suggesting it may not be accurately representing its intended chemical intuition.

**Interpretation of Accuracy Metrics**

The validation accuracy decrease from approximately 76% to 54% suggests that the modifications made to the rules have negatively impacted the model's ability to generalize. The current accuracy metrics indicate that the model's performance has not improved; instead, it has deteriorated. This suggests that the current set of rules may not have reached a local minimum in terms of optimization, and further refinement is necessary.

**Deriving Insights from SHAP Analysis**

The SHAP analysis highlights that **Rule 6** has a substantial impact on the model's predictions. Its significant negative SHAP values in underestimation cases and positive SHAP values in overestimation cases suggest that the rule may be too broadly defined or mischaracterized. Given that Rule 6 is intended to predict low yield for modifiers that are benzoic acids substituted at the para position with electron-donating groups, its current formulation may not be adequately capturing the nuances of chemical behavior.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

Based on the analysis above, the following recommendations are proposed to improve the current rules:

1. **Refine Rule 6**

   - **Issue Identified**: Rule 6 is contributing significantly to both underestimations and overestimations of catalyst loading.
   - **Suggested Improvement**:
     - **Re-evaluate the Scope**: Assess whether all electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position uniformly lead to low yields. It may be that certain EDGs do not hinder catalyst coordination as previously thought.
     - **Subdivide Rule 6**: Consider partitioning Rule 6 into sub-rules that differentiate between types of EDGs. For example:
       - **Rule 6a**: Modifiers with strong EDGs (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) predict low yield.
       - **Rule 6b**: Modifiers with weak EDGs (e.g., methyl) may not significantly affect yield.
     - **Incorporate Positional Variability**: Include the impact of substitutions at ortho and meta positions, as steric and electronic effects can vary with position.

2. **Adjust Rules with High Negative SHAP Values**

   - **Identify Problematic Rules**: Review rules that consistently have high negative SHAP values in cases of underestimation.
   - **Example Adjustments**:
     - **Rule 8 and Rule 9**: Evaluate the definitions of modifiers with pyridine rings. Perhaps their influence on catalyst loading is more nuanced and requires further specificity.
     - **Rule 10**: Reassess the assumption that straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups predict high yield. There may be chain length or branching effects not currently accounted for.

3. **Improve Generalization to Address Underfitting**

   - **Enhance Rule Complexity**: Introduce additional molecular descriptors or parameters to the rules to capture more subtle patterns.
   - **Utilize Machine Learning Techniques**: Complement rule-based approaches with data-driven methods to identify patterns not easily captured by heuristic rules.
   - **Expand the Dataset**: If possible, include more diverse examples in the training set to help the model learn a broader range of chemical behaviors.

4. **Use Insights from SHAP Analysis to Iteratively Refine Rules**

   - **Focus on High-impact Rules**: Prioritize refining rules that the SHAP analysis indicates have the most substantial contribution to mispredictions (e.g., Rule 6).
   - **Iteratively Test Adjustments**: After modifying a rule, retrain the model and assess the impact on validation accuracy and SHAP values to see if the changes yield improvements.

5. **Incorporate Exceptions and Conditional Logic**

   - **Identify Exceptions**: Determine if there are specific cases where the current rules do not apply and adjust the rules to include exceptions.
   - **Add Conditional Statements**: For example, modify Rule 6 to account for situations where the presence of additional functional groups overrides the effect of an EDG at the para position.

6. **Consider Interactions Between Functional Groups**

   - **Account for Synergistic Effects**: Some modifiers may have multiple functional groups that interact synergistically to affect catalyst loading.
   - **Develop Combination Rules**: Create new rules that consider combinations of structural features rather than single features in isolation.

7. **Enhance Rule Specificity**

   - **Include Stereochemistry**: If stereochemistry plays a role in catalyst loading, incorporate it into the rules.
   - **Recognize Subtler Electronic Effects**: Consider the impact of resonance, inductive effects, and hyperconjugation in determining electron-donating or -withdrawing properties.

**Conclusion**

The current rules are not performing adequately, as evidenced by the decreased validation accuracy and insights from the SHAP analysis. The key issues appear to stem from Rule 6, which influences predictions heavily and may be inaccurately defined. By refining Rule 6, adjusting other problematic rules, and enhancing the model's complexity to capture more nuanced chemical behaviors, we can aim to improve the model's predictive performance.

**Next Steps**

- **Implement Rule Adjustments**: Begin by refining Rule 6 according to the recommendations, and adjust other rules as identified.
- **Retrain and Validate**: After each set of adjustments, retrain the model and assess performance metrics and SHAP values.
- **Iterative Refinement**: Continue the cycle of analysis and adjustment until the model's performance reaches an acceptable level or no longer shows significant improvement.
- **Document Changes**: Keep detailed records of rule modifications and their impacts to facilitate understanding and future adjustments.

By systematically addressing the identified issues and iteratively refining the rules, we can enhance the model's ability to predict catalyst loading accurately.

**Summary and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

The current rules for predicting the yield of the remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction have shown limitations, as evidenced by recent performance metrics and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis. The main issues identified are:

1. **Low Support and Coverage**: The current rules apply to only **1.25%** of the training data, significantly lower than previous iterations (up to **18.45%** support). While the confidence and lift have increased, the low support limits the rules' overall impact.

2. **Decreased Accuracy and Underfitting**: The validation accuracy has dropped from around **76%** to approximately **54.29%**, indicating that the model is underfitting and not capturing the underlying patterns effectively.

3. **Problematic Rules Identified**: SHAP analysis highlights that **Rule 6** significantly contributes to both underestimations and overestimations of the catalyst loading, suggesting it may be inaccurately defined or too broadly applied.

**Directions to Optimize the Current Rules**

To address these issues, the following suggestions can be implemented to optimize and improve the current rules:

1. **Refine SMARTS Patterns for Specific Rules**:

   - **Rule 1 (α-Amino Acids with Small, Non-Aromatic Side Chains)**:
     - **Improve Specificity**: Adjust the SMARTS pattern to accurately identify α-amino acids with small, non-aromatic side chains. For example, use `'[NX3][CH]([CH3,CH2][!c])[C](=O)[OH]'` to ensure side chains are non-aromatic and small.
     - **Exclude Aromatic Side Chains**: Incorporate exclusion patterns that prevent aromatic side chains from matching.

   - **Rule 2 (α-Amino Acids with Aromatic Side Chains Other Than Indole)**:
     - **Refine Pattern**: Modify the SMARTS pattern to match α-amino acids with aromatic side chains while explicitly excluding indole rings. For instance, `'[NX3][CH](c[!n])[C](=O)[OH]'`.

   - **Rule 3 (α-Amino Acids with an Indole Side Chain)**:
     - **Correct Pattern Formatting**: Use a precise SMARTS pattern like `'[NX3][CH](Cc1c[nH]c2ccccc12)[C](=O)[OH]'` to match tryptophan's side chain accurately.

   - **Rule 4 (ω-Amino Acids with Chain Length Variations)**:
     - **Differentiate High and Low Yield Variants**: Assign unique identifiers (e.g., Rule 4a and Rule 4b) to distinguish between short-chain (high yield) and long-chain (low yield) ω-amino acids.
     - **Adjust Chain Length Criteria**: Modify the pattern to `'[NX3][CH2]{6,}[C](=O)[OX1H]'` to match chains longer than five carbons for the low-yield prediction.

   - **Rule 5 and Rule 6 (Benzoic Acids with Substituents)**:
     - **Specify Para Substitution**: Use patterns like `'O=C([OH])c1cc([H])cc([EWG])c1'` for Rule 5 and `'O=C([OH])c1cc([H])cc([EDG])c1'` for Rule 6 to target substitutions specifically at the para position.
     - **Refine EWG and EDG Definitions**: Clearly define which groups are considered strong EWGs or EDGs and adjust patterns accordingly.

   - **Rule 7, 8, and 9 (Pyridine Carboxylic Acids)**:
     - **Clarify Linker Types**: Explicitly define the linkers (e.g., aliphatic chain vs. aromatic linker) in the SMARTS patterns to distinguish between different pyridine carboxylic acids.

   - **Rule 10 and 11 (Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids)**:
     - **Exclude Polar Functional Groups Accurately**: Modify exclusion patterns to effectively prevent molecules with polar groups along the chain from matching Rule 10.
     - **Specify Terminal Polar Groups**: Ensure that Rule 11's pattern matches only those acids with terminal polar groups.

   - **Rule 12 and 13 (Thiol Carboxylic Acids)**:
     - **Distinguish Between Aliphatic and Aromatic Thiols**: Adjust patterns to accurately identify aliphatic thiol carboxylic acids (Rule 12) and aromatic thiol carboxylic acids (Rule 13).

   - **Rule 14 (Perfluorinated Alkyl Chains)**:
     - **Refine Pattern for Perfluorinated Chains**: Use comprehensive patterns like `'C(F)(F)C(F)(F)C(F)(F)C(=O)[OH]'` to capture modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains effectively.

   - **Rule 15 (Long Hydrophilic Chains or Polyether Groups)**:
     - **Generalize Pattern**: Use patterns such as `'OCC(OCC)*C(=O)[OH]'` to match modifiers with multiple ethylene glycol units terminating with a carboxylic acid.

2. **Balance Rule Specificity and Coverage**:

   - **Broaden Rule Scope Where Appropriate**: Adjust overly specific patterns to cover more molecules without significantly reducing confidence.
   - **Combine Overlapping Rules**: Merge similar rules to increase support and simplify the model.

3. **Incorporate Additional Molecular Features**:

   - **Feature Engineering**: Introduce new descriptors such as steric hindrance, electronic effects, and molecular flexibility.
   - **Consider Functional Group Interactions**: Account for synergistic or antagonistic interactions between functional groups.

4. **Iterative Refinement Using SHAP Analysis**:

   - **Focus on Problematic Rules**: Prioritize refining rules like **Rule 6**, which significantly contribute to mispredictions.
   - **Test Adjustments Iteratively**: After each rule modification, reassess model performance and SHAP values to determine the impact.

5. **Enhance Model Complexity to Reduce Underfitting**:

   - **Increase Rule Depth**: Add more conditions to rules to capture complex patterns.
   - **Hybrid Approaches**: Combine rule-based methods with machine learning techniques to leverage both expert knowledge and data-driven insights.

6. **Validate SMARTS Patterns with Known Examples**:

   - **Test Against Training Set**: Ensure that SMARTS patterns match all intended molecules in the training set.
   - **Adjust Based on Validation**: Refine patterns if intended matches are missed or unintended molecules are matched.

7. **Improve Documentation and Error Handling**:

   - **Add Comments**: Document the purpose and logic behind each SMARTS pattern.
   - **Implement Error Handling**: Capture and log parsing or pattern compilation errors for troubleshooting.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

There is significant potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. The decrease in validation accuracy and underfitting suggests that the model is too simplistic and not effectively capturing the complexity of the data. By refining the SMARTS patterns, balancing rule specificity with coverage, and incorporating additional molecular features, the model's predictive power can be enhanced while avoiding overfitting.

    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with small, non-aromatic side chains** predict **high yield**. These molecules have an amino group attached to the α-carbon adjacent to the carboxylic acid and side chains that are small or polar but not bulky or aromatic. Examples include **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid) and **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid). The absence of bulky groups facilitates efficient coordination with the catalyst.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with aromatic side chains other than indole** predict **low yield**. Aromatic side chains like phenyl groups can introduce steric hindrance and reduce catalyst accessibility. Example: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine).

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with an indole side chain** predict **high yield**. The indole ring in **tryptophan** can form favorable π-π interactions and coordinate with the catalyst, enhancing reactivity. Example: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan).

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **ω-amino acids with carbon chain lengths of five or fewer** predict **high yield**. Short-chain ω-amino acids like **5-aminopentanoic acid** efficiently interact with the catalyst. Those with longer chains (more than five carbons) predict **low yield** due to increased flexibility and reduced effective concentration at the active site. Examples of low-yield modifiers include **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **benzoic acids substituted at the para position with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)** predict **high yield**. EWGs like **nitro**, **bromomethyl**, and **amino** groups enhance the acidity of the carboxylic acid, improving coordination with the metal center of the catalyst. Examples: **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**, and **4-aminobenzoic acid**.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **benzoic acids substituted at the para position with electron-donating groups (EDGs)** predict **low yield**. EDGs like **methyl**, **hydroxy**, and **formyl** groups decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, hindering effective catalyst coordination. Examples: **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**, and **4-formylbenzoic acid**.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **pyridine carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the pyridine ring** predict **high yield**. The nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity. Examples: **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid) and **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers where a **pyridine ring is linked to a carboxylic acid via a flexible aliphatic chain** predict **high yield**. The flexible linker allows simultaneous interactions of the pyridine nitrogen and carboxylate with the catalyst. Example: **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers where a **pyridine ring is connected to a carboxylic acid through a rigid aromatic linker** predict **low yield**. The rigidity and steric hindrance reduce the ability of functional groups to coordinate effectively with the catalyst. Example: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups** predict **high yield**. These hydrophobic chains may enhance substrate alignment with the catalyst. Example: **octanoic acid**.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal polar groups** (e.g., **hydroxy** or **amino** groups) predict **low yield**. Additional polar groups can interfere with catalyst binding or lead to unfavorable interactions. Examples: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** and **7-aminoheptanoic acid**.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic thiol carboxylic acids** predict **high yield**. Aliphatic thiols can interact favorably with the catalyst without deactivating it. Example: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aromatic thiol carboxylic acids** predict **low yield**. Aromatic thiols may bind too strongly to the metal center, potentially acting as catalyst poisons. Example: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers containing **perfluorinated alkyl chains** predict **low yield**. The high electronegativity and steric hindrance of fluorine atoms can inhibit interaction with the catalyst. Example: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with **long hydrophilic chains or polyether groups** (e.g., **polyethylene glycol units**) predict **low yield**. These bulky, flexible groups may prevent effective coordination with the catalyst's active site. Example: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.

  *Suggested SMARTS Pattern*:  
  ```  
  [NX3;H2][CH;X4](Cc1c[nH]c2c1cccc2)[C](=O)[O;H]  
  ```  
  This pattern accurately identifies tryptophan by its indole ring.

- **Advice 4**: **Split Rule 4 into High and Low Yield Variants**  
  Divide Rule 4 into two sub-rules to differentiate chain lengths:  
  - **Rule 4a** (High Yield): **ω-amino acids with carbon chain lengths of five or fewer**.  
    *SMARTS Pattern*:  
    ```  
    [NX3;H2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][C](=O)[O;H]  
    ```  
  - **Rule 4b** (Low Yield): **ω-amino acids with carbon chain lengths greater than five**.  
    *SMARTS Pattern*:  
    ```  
    [NX3;H2][CH2]{5,}[C](=O)[O;H]  
    ```  
    This distinction accounts for the effect of chain length on yield.

- **Advice 5**: **Refine Rules 5 and 6 for Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids**

  - **Rule 6 (Low Yield)**: **Benzoic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position**.  
    *SMARTS Pattern*:  
    ```  
    O=C([O;H])c1cc([EDG])ccc1  
    ```  
    Define `[EDG]` as methyl (`C`), hydroxy (`O[H]`), or formyl (`C=O`).

- **Advice 6**: **Differentiate Pyridine Carboxylic Acid Rules**  
  Clarify linkers in Rules 7, 8, and 9:  
  - **Rule 7 (High Yield)**: **Pyridine carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached**.  
    *SMARTS Pattern*:  
    ```  
    O=C([O;H])c1ccncc1  
    ```  
  - **Rule 8 (High Yield)**: **Pyridine ring linked via a flexible aliphatic chain**.

    ```  
  - **Rule 9 (Low Yield)**: **Pyridine ring linked through a rigid aromatic linker**.  
    *SMARTS Pattern*:  
    ```  
    O=C([O;H])c1ccc(cc1)c2ccncc2  
    ```

- **Advice 7**: **Adjust Rules 10 and 11 for Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids**  
  - **Rule 10 (High Yield)**: **Straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without polar groups**.  
    *SMARTS Pattern*:  
    ```  
    [CH3][CH2]{5,}[C](=O)[O;H]  
    ```

    *SMARTS Pattern*:  
    ```  
    [CH3][CH2]{4,}[X][C](=O)[O;H]  
    ```  
    Where `[X]` is a polar group like `[OH]` or `[NH2]`.

- **Advice 8**: **Distinguish Between Aliphatic and Aromatic Thiol Carboxylic Acids**  
  - **Rule 12 (High Yield)**: **Aliphatic thiol carboxylic acids**.  
    *SMARTS Pattern*:  
    ```  
    [SH][CH2][CH2][C](=O)[O;H]  
    ```  
  - **Rule 13 (Low Yield)**: **Aromatic thiol carboxylic acids**.  
    *SMARTS Pattern*:  
    ```  
    [SH]c1ccccc1C(=O)[O;H]  
    ```

- **Advice 9**: **Refine Rule 14 for Perfluorinated Alkyl Chains**  
  Create a SMARTS pattern to match perfluorinated chains:  
  ```  
  [CX4](F)(F)[CX4](F)(F)[CX4](F)(F)C(=O)[O;H]  
  ```  
  This captures modifiers like nonafluoropentanoic acid.

- **Advice 10**: **Adjust Rule 15 for Polyether Groups**  
  Generalize the SMARTS pattern to match long hydrophilic chains or polyether groups:  
  ```  
  O[C,H][C,O](O[C,H][C,H])*C(=O)[O;H]  
  ```  
  This pattern matches molecules with multiple ethylene glycol units.

- **Advice 11**: **Balance Rule Specificity and Coverage**

---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with small or polar side chains (non-bulky, non-aromatic)** predict **high yield**. These molecules have an amino group attached to the α-carbon adjacent to the carboxylic acid and side chains that are small, polar, or hydrophilic. Examples include **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid). The small side chains facilitate efficient coordination with the catalyst's active site, enhancing reactivity.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains** predict **low yield**. Bulky aromatic groups introduce steric hindrance, reducing the ability of the amino acid to coordinate effectively with the catalyst. An example is **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine), where the phenyl ring impedes optimal interaction with the catalytic center.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains (e.g., indole ring)** predict **high yield**. The presence of a heteroaromatic ring like indole can form favorable interactions with the catalyst, possibly through π-π stacking or coordination with metal centers. An example is **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan), which enhances the reaction yield due to these interactions.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **ω-amino acids with carbon chain lengths of five or fewer** predict **high yield**, whereas those with longer chains predict **low yield**. Short-chain ω-amino acids like **5-aminopentanoic acid** have an amino group at the terminal position of a short aliphatic chain, allowing for effective interaction with the catalyst. In contrast, longer chains like **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid** are more flexible and decrease the local concentration of functional groups near the catalyst, leading to lower yields.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **benzoic acids substituted at the para position with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)** predict **high yield**, while those with electron-donating groups (EDGs) predict **low yield**. EWGs such as **nitro**, **bromomethyl**, and **amino** groups increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers in the catalyst. Examples include **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**, and **4-aminobenzoic acid** (high yield). Conversely, EDGs like **methyl**, **hydroxy**, and **formyl** decrease acidity, reducing coordination efficacy, as seen in **4-methylbenzoic acid** and **4-formylbenzoic acid** (low yield).

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **pyridine carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the pyridine ring** predict **high yield**. The nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring can coordinate with metal ions in the catalyst, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid) and **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers where a **pyridine ring is linked to a carboxylic acid via a flexible aliphatic chain** predict **high yield**. The flexible linker allows the pyridine nitrogen and the carboxylate group to simultaneously interact with the catalyst, promoting effective coordination. An example is **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers where a **pyridine ring is connected to a carboxylic acid through a rigid aromatic linker** predict **low yield**. The rigidity and steric hindrance of the aromatic linker hinder the alignment of functional groups necessary for effective catalyst interaction. An example is **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups**, particularly medium-chain acids, predict **high yield**. These modifiers can enhance hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst or substrate, facilitating the reaction. An example is **octanoic acid**.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with additional terminal polar groups** (e.g., **hydroxy** or **amino** groups) predict **low yield**. The presence of additional polar groups can lead to unfavorable interactions or disrupt the hydrophobic environment around the catalyst. Examples include **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** and **7-aminoheptanoic acid**.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: *Rule 1* is clear and unambiguous, allowing for precise predictions of high yield when modifiers are α-amino acids with small or polar side chains. This is supported by data points 0 and 2—**(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** and **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid**—both yielding high results. The rule provides adequate physical-chemical insight by explaining how small side chains enhance coordination with the catalyst's active site. It considers combinations of sub-structures, specifically the α-amino acid backbone and side chain properties. With at least two supporting data points, it has sufficient coverage and balances complexity with applicability effectively.

- **Comment 2**: *Rule 2* offers clear guidance, predicting low yield for α-amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains. The rule is exemplified by **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (data point 13), which indeed shows a low yield. The property insight is solid, attributing low reactivity to steric hindrance from bulky side chains. While the rule considers structural combinations, its coverage is limited to a single data point, reducing its robustness. A broader dataset would strengthen the rule's applicability.

- **Comment 3**: *Rule 3* is clear in predicting high yield for α-amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains, such as the indole ring in **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (data point 15). The property insight is adequate, suggesting favorable interactions like π-π stacking enhance reactivity. However, the rule's coverage is limited to one data point, which undermines its generalizability. Including more examples would improve the rule's strength and balance between specificity and coverage.

- **Comment 4**: *Rule 4* clearly differentiates between high and low yields based on the chain length of ω-amino acids. High yield is predicted for chain lengths of five or fewer carbons, as seen with **5-aminopentanoic acid** (data point 3), while longer chains like **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid** (data points 31 and 34) yield low results. The rule offers sound property insight by explaining how chain length affects functional group proximity to the catalyst. It effectively considers combinations of sub-structures and has good coverage with multiple data points, achieving a commendable balance between complexity and applicability.

- **Comment 5**: *Rule 5* attempts to correlate the electronic nature of para-substituents on benzoic acids with yield outcomes. While it is clear in concept, the rule has inconsistencies. For instance, **4-aminobenzoic acid** (data point 4) is predicted to yield high results due to an EWG, but the amino group is typically an electron-donating group (EDG). Conversely, **4-formylbenzoic acid** (data point 19), which contains an EWG, shows a low yield, contradicting the rule. These discrepancies indicate inadequate property insight and compromise clarity. Although the rule considers specific functional group combinations and has multiple data points, the inconsistencies reduce its effectiveness and balance.

- **Comment 6**: *Rule 6* provides clear and accurate predictions for high yield with pyridine carboxylic acids directly attached to the pyridine ring, supported by **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** and **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (data points 21 and 8). The property insight is well-founded, highlighting the role of the pyridine nitrogen in coordinating with metal ions. The rule appropriately considers combinations of sub-structures and maintains a good balance between complexity and coverage with sufficient supporting data.

- **Comment 7**: *Rule 7* is clear in predicting high yield for modifiers where a pyridine ring is linked to a carboxylic acid via a flexible aliphatic chain, exemplified by **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** (data point 24). The rule provides adequate property insight but is limited by coverage, relying on a single data point. To strengthen the rule's applicability and balance, additional supporting data would be beneficial.

- **Comment 8**: *Rule 8* clearly predicts low yield for modifiers with a pyridine ring connected through a rigid aromatic linker, as seen with **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (data point 12). The rule offers solid property insight into how rigidity and steric hindrance impede effective catalyst interaction. However, like the previous rule, it suffers from limited coverage with only one supporting data point, affecting its balance and general applicability.

- **Comment 9**: *Rule 9* predicts high yield for medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups, with **octanoic acid** (data point 5) serving as an example. The rule is clear and provides reasonable property insight into hydrophobic interactions facilitating the reaction. Nonetheless, its coverage is minimal, supported by a single data point, which diminishes its robustness. Including more data points would improve the rule's balance between simplicity and coverage.

- **Comment 10**: *Rule 10* effectively predicts low yield for aliphatic carboxylic acids with additional terminal polar groups, supported by **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** and **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (data points 29 and 31). The rule is clear, with adequate property insight explaining how polar groups can disrupt the catalyst's hydrophobic environment. It considers specific structural features and has sufficient coverage, achieving a satisfactory balance between complexity and applicability.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Enhance Rule Coverage**: For rules currently supported by only one or two data points, such as Rules 2, 3, 6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, and 15, consider either finding additional supporting data or combining these rules with similar ones. This will improve the robustness and general applicability of the rules.

- **Advice 2**: **Clarify EWG and EDG Effects**: Re-evaluate and clarify the definitions of electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) and electron-donating groups (EDGs) in Rules 5 and 6. Ensure consistent predictions of yield based on the substituents on benzoic acids. For example, correctly classify amino groups as EDGs and reconcile any contradictions in how they affect yield.

- **Advice 3**: **Use Precise SMILES Patterns**: Incorporate specific SMILES substructures to define functional groups and motifs within the rules. This will enable precise identification of compounds that fit each rule and reduce ambiguity. For instance, define aromatic rings, side chains, and substituents using SMILES notations.

- **Advice 4**: **Simplify and Consolidate Rules**: Combine similar rules to reduce redundancy. For example, merge rules that deal with chain length effects on ω-amino acids and aliphatic carboxylic acids. Clearly state any exceptions within consolidated rules to maintain clarity.

- **Advice 5**: **Provide Additional Examples**: Augment each rule with more examples and counter-examples from the dataset. This will strengthen the rules by demonstrating their applicability across a broader range of compounds and assist in identifying any anomalies.

- **Advice 6**: **Specify Chain Length Ranges**: In rules concerning chain lengths (e.g., Rule 4), specify exact numerical ranges for carbon chain lengths and clarify how variations within these ranges affect the yield. Define terms like "short-chain" and "long-chain" with precise carbon counts.

- **Advice 7**: **Standardize Terminology**: Ensure consistent use of chemical terminology across all rules. Clearly define terms such as "bulky," "small," "polar," "hydrophilic," "hydrophobic," "electron-withdrawing," and "electron-donating." This will improve understanding and reduce misclassification.

- **Advice 8**: **Elaborate on Catalytic Interactions**: Provide detailed explanations in the rules about how specific functional groups interact with the catalyst. Incorporate known principles of coordination chemistry to explain the effects of modifiers on the catalytic activity and yield outcomes.

- **Advice 9**: **Validate Rules with Statistical Analysis**: Use statistical methods to assess the significance of each rule. Analyze the correlation between structural features and yield outcomes to ensure that rules are based on statistically significant trends rather than isolated observations.

- **Advice 10**: **Prioritize High-Impact Rules**: Focus on refining rules that have the greatest effect on yield according to the data. Allocate more effort to improving the accuracy and specificity of these rules, as they will provide the most practical benefit in predicting and optimizing reaction yields.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **ω-amino acids with carbon chain lengths of five carbons or fewer** predict a **high yield**, while those with longer chains predict a **low yield**. Short-chain ω-amino acids like **5-aminopentanoic acid** have an amino group that remains in proximity to the carboxylic acid, allowing effective bidentate coordination with the catalyst. Longer chains like **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid** are more flexible, which can reduce effective coordination.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **benzoic acids substituted at the para position with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)**, such as **nitro** or **bromomethyl**, predict a **high yield**. EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid and can enhance metal coordination. Examples include **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**. Conversely, modifiers substituted with electron-donating groups (EDGs) like **methyl** or **hydroxy** at the para position predict a **low yield**, as seen with **4-methylbenzoic acid** and **4-hydroxybenzoic acid** derivatives.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **benzoic acids substituted at the para position with amino groups** predict a **high yield**. Despite amino groups being EDGs, the lone pair on the nitrogen can participate in additional coordination with the catalyst. An example is **4-aminobenzoic acid**.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **pyridine carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the pyridine ring** predict a **high yield**. The nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring can act as a coordination site, enhancing interaction with the catalyst. Examples include **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid) and **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers where a **pyridine ring is connected to a carboxylic acid via a flexible aliphatic chain** predict a **high yield**. The flexible linker allows both the pyridine nitrogen and the carboxylate group to interact simultaneously with the catalyst. An example is **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers where a **pyridine ring is connected to a carboxylic acid through a rigid aromatic linker** predict a **low yield**. The rigidity and steric hindrance prevent optimal alignment of functional groups for effective catalyst interaction. An example is **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups**, such as **octanoic acid**, predict a **high yield**. The hydrophobic chain may enhance interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or substrate, facilitating the reaction.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with additional terminal polar groups** (e.g., **hydroxy** or **amino** groups) and chain lengths longer than five carbons predict a **low yield**. The presence of polar groups at the termini of long flexible chains can lead to unfavorable interactions or reduce effective coordination due to increased conformational freedom. Examples include **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** and **7-aminoheptanoic acid**.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that contain **multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group**, such as **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid), predict a **high yield**. The multiple hydroxyl groups can form additional hydrogen bonds or coordinate with the catalyst, enhancing reactivity.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with perfluorinated aliphatic chains** predict a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms and the hydrophobic nature of perfluorinated chains can reduce interaction with the catalyst. An example is **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with ether linkages and terminal amino groups** predict a **low yield**. The ether linkages increase chain flexibility, and the terminal amino group may be sterically hindered from effective coordination. An example is **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids linked to polar aromatic groups via flexible chains** predict a **high yield**. The flexible linker allows simultaneous interaction of the aromatic ring and the carboxyl group with the catalyst. An example is **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows for easy determination of high yield when modifiers are α-amino acids with small, non-aromatic side chains. The physicochemical insight is strong, highlighting effective coordination due to the amino group and small side chains. The rule considers combined substructures (α-amino acids with specific side chains) and is supported by at least two data points (aspartic acid and glutamic acid), thus meeting all criteria effectively.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear in identifying low yield modifiers as α-amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains. The physicochemical rationale regarding steric hindrance is sound. However, the coverage is limited, with only one data point (phenylalanine) supporting the rule. Increasing the number of supporting examples would strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 clearly associates high yield with α-amino acids possessing heteroaromatic side chains like indole. The insight into favorable interactions via π-π stacking and coordination is valuable. The rule considers combined structural features, but coverage is limited to a single data point (tryptophan), suggesting a need for additional supporting data.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear and effectively predicts yields based on the chain length of ω-amino acids. The physicochemical insight about chain flexibility impacting coordination is well-founded. The rule considers combinations of features (chain length and ω-amino group) and is supported by multiple data points for both high and low yields, satisfying all criteria.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 provides a clear distinction between modifiers with EWGs and EDGs at the para position of benzoic acids, predicting high and low yields respectively. The physicochemical reasoning about acidity and metal coordination is solid. The rule considers combined substructures and is well-supported by multiple data points, fulfilling all criteria admirably.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear in its prediction of high yield for benzoic acids substituted with amino groups at the para position. The additional coordination through the amino group offers good physicochemical insight. However, the rule's coverage is limited to a single data point (4-aminobenzoic acid), indicating a need for more examples.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear and effectively links high yield to pyridine carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group attached directly to the ring. The insight about nitrogen coordination is pertinent. The rule considers combined structural features and is supported by at least two data points (pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid), meeting all criteria.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 clearly predicts high yield for modifiers where a pyridine ring is connected to a carboxylic acid via a flexible chain. The physicochemical rationale is sound. While the rule is structurally insightful, coverage is limited to one data point (4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid), necessitating more supporting data.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear in associating low yield with rigid aromatic linkers between pyridine rings and carboxylic acids. The physicochemical reasoning regarding steric hindrance is appropriate. However, coverage is limited to a single data point (4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid), indicating the need for additional examples.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear, predicting high yield for medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without polar groups. The insight into hydrophobic interactions is logical. The rule's complexity is adequate, but coverage is limited to one data point (octanoic acid). Expanding the dataset would enhance the rule's validity.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear and provides good insight into how terminal polar groups in long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids lead to low yield due to reduced coordination. The rule considers combined structural features and is supported by multiple data points (7-hydroxyheptanoic acid and 7-aminoheptanoic acid), satisfying all criteria well.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 clearly predicts high yield for modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group. The physicochemical insight regarding enhanced coordination is solid. The rule considers combined features and, with data points like gluconic acid and similar compounds, has acceptable coverage.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear in predicting low yield for perfluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids. The reasoning about electron-withdrawing effects and hydrophobicity is sound. However, coverage is limited to a single data point (nonafluoropentanoic acid), indicating a need for more data.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 clearly associates low yield with carboxylic acids containing ether linkages and terminal amino groups. The physicochemical rationale is appropriate. Coverage is limited to one data point (3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid), suggesting the rule would benefit from additional supporting examples.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 is clear and effectively predicts high yield for aliphatic carboxylic acids linked to polar aromatic groups via flexible chains. The physicochemical insight is strong, considering simultaneous interactions facilitated by the flexible linker. The rule is supported by multiple data points (e.g., 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid and 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), fulfilling all criteria.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with small, non-aromatic side chains** predict a **high yield**. These modifiers have an amino group attached to the α-carbon adjacent to the carboxylic acid and side chains that are small, polar, or hydrophilic. Examples include **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid). Their structures facilitate effective coordination with the catalyst through multiple coordination sites, enhancing reactivity.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains** predict a **low yield**. The presence of bulky aromatic groups like phenyl rings introduces steric hindrance, reducing the ability of the amino acid to coordinate effectively with the catalyst. An example is **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine), where the phenyl group impedes optimal interaction with the catalytic center.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains**, such as the indole ring, predict a **high yield**. The heteroaromatic side chains can form favorable interactions with the catalyst, possibly through π-π stacking or coordination with metal centers via heteroatoms. An example is **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan).

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **ω-amino acids with carbon chain lengths of five carbons or fewer** predict a **high yield**, while those with longer chains predict a **low yield**. Short-chain ω-amino acids like **5-aminopentanoic acid** have an amino group that remains in proximity to the carboxylic acid, allowing effective bidentate coordination with the catalyst. Longer chains like **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid** are more flexible, which can reduce effective coordination.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **benzoic acids substituted at the para position with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)**, such as **nitro** or **bromomethyl**, predict a **high yield**. EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid and can enhance metal coordination. Examples include **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**. Conversely, modifiers substituted with electron-donating groups (EDGs) like **methyl** or **hydroxy** at the para position predict a **low yield**, as seen with **4-methylbenzoic acid** and **4-hydroxybenzoic acid** derivatives.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **benzoic acids substituted at the para position with amino groups** predict a **high yield**. Despite amino groups being EDGs, the lone pair on the nitrogen can participate in additional coordination with the catalyst. An example is **4-aminobenzoic acid**.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **pyridine carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the pyridine ring** predict a **high yield**. The nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring can act as a coordination site, enhancing interaction with the catalyst. Examples include **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid) and **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers where a **pyridine ring is connected to a carboxylic acid via a flexible aliphatic chain** predict a **high yield**. The flexible linker allows both the pyridine nitrogen and the carboxylate group to interact simultaneously with the catalyst. An example is **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers where a **pyridine ring is connected to a carboxylic acid through a rigid aromatic linker** predict a **low yield**. The rigidity and steric hindrance prevent optimal alignment of functional groups for effective catalyst interaction. An example is **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups**, such as **octanoic acid**, predict a **high yield**. The hydrophobic chain may enhance interactions with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or substrate, facilitating the reaction.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with additional terminal polar groups** (e.g., **hydroxy** or **amino** groups) and chain lengths longer than five carbons predict a **low yield**. The presence of polar groups at the termini of long flexible chains can lead to unfavorable interactions or reduce effective coordination due to increased conformational freedom. Examples include **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** and **7-aminoheptanoic acid**.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that contain **multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group**, such as **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid), predict a **high yield**. The multiple hydroxyl groups can form additional hydrogen bonds or coordinate with the catalyst, enhancing reactivity.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with perfluorinated aliphatic chains** predict a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms and the hydrophobic nature of perfluorinated chains can reduce interaction with the catalyst. An example is **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with ether linkages and terminal amino groups** predict a **low yield**. The ether linkages increase chain flexibility, and the terminal amino group may be sterically hindered from effective coordination. An example is **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids linked to polar aromatic groups via flexible chains** predict a **high yield**. The flexible linker allows simultaneous interaction of the aromatic ring and the carboxyl group with the catalyst. An example is **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- **Suggestion 1**: For the rules involving substituents at the para position of benzoic acid (Rules 5 and 6), expand the SMARTS patterns to capture a broader range of electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) and electron-donating groups (EDGs). Instead of specifying specific groups like nitro or hydroxy, use generic patterns that can recognize common EWGs and EDGs at the para position.

- **Suggestion 2**: For Rule 4 (ω-amino acids), ensure that the chain length calculation is accurate. The current patterns only match specific chain lengths (exactly four or six carbons). Modify the SMARTS patterns to match chains of length ≤5 and >5 more generally.

- **Suggestion 3**: For Rule 1 and Rule 2 (α-amino acids with small non-aromatic or bulky aromatic side chains), refine the SMARTS patterns to correctly differentiate between small and bulky side chains. Consider defining 'small' as side chains with fewer than a certain number of atoms and 'bulky aromatic' as side chains containing aromatic rings.

- **Suggestion 4**: For Rule 3, expand the SMARTS pattern to detect α-amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains more generally, rather than only specific heteroaromatic rings.

- **Suggestion 5**: In general, for all rules, review the SMARTS patterns to ensure they match the chemical features described in the rules without being overly specific. Use variable patterns or lists of groups to capture the essence of the rules more broadly.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Translate Qualitative Rules into Quantitative Descriptors**
  
  Convert the existing qualitative rules into quantitative descriptors that can be directly computed from SMILES strings. For example, instead of "modifiers with small, non-aromatic side chains," define a descriptor like "side chain length (number of carbon atoms) ≤ 2" and "aromatic ring count = 0." This approach allows for numeric feature generation essential for modeling.

- **Advice 2**: **Utilize SMARTS Patterns for Functional Group Identification**
  
  Implement SMARTS (SMILES Arbitrary Target Specification) patterns to identify specific functional groups and substructures within the modifiers. By defining rules using SMARTS patterns, you can programmatically detect features such as amino groups, carboxylic acids, aromatic rings, and heterocycles, facilitating automatic feature extraction.

- **Advice 3**: **Incorporate Computable Molecular Descriptors**
  
  Introduce molecular descriptors that can be calculated using cheminformatics software (e.g., RDKit). Descriptors such as molecular weight, topological polar surface area (TPSA), LogP (octanol-water partition coefficient), number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, and rotatable bond count can provide quantitative data for each modifier.

- **Advice 4**: **Define Numerical Thresholds for Key Properties**
  
  Establish numerical thresholds for properties influencing the yield. For instance, set specific ranges for properties like TPSA, LogP, or the number of hydrogen bond donors/acceptors that correlate with high or low yields. This specificity enhances the rules' applicability and facilitates numeric matrix generation.

- **Advice 5**: **Create a Structured Feature Matrix Template**
  
  Develop a standardized template for the feature matrix that includes all relevant descriptors extracted from the SMILES strings. Ensure that each rule corresponds to specific columns in the matrix, representing features such as functional group counts or calculated molecular properties.

- **Advice 6**: **Generalize Rules Based on Descriptor Ranges**

  Modify the rules to generalize across ranges of descriptor values rather than specific compounds. For example, instead of focusing on "α-amino acids with heteroaromatic side chains," define a rule like "modifiers with aromatic ring count ≥ 1 and heteroatom count ≥ 1 predict high yield."

- **Advice 7**: **Use Machine Learning-Friendly Features**

  Select descriptors known to be effective in machine learning models. Features like Morgan fingerprints, MACCS keys, or custom bit vectors representing the presence or absence of specific substructures enhance the model's predictive power and facilitate feature matrix creation.

- **Advice 8**: **Prioritize Key Influential Descriptors**

  From the existing dataset, perform statistical analysis to identify descriptors that significantly impact the yield. Focus the rules on these key descriptors to streamline the feature set and improve model efficiency.

- **Advice 9**: **Incorporate Stereochemistry Explicitly**

  Ensure that stereochemical information is included in the SMILES strings and consider its effect in the rules. Stereochemistry can influence coordination with the catalyst and, consequently, the reaction yield.

- **Advice 10**: **Standardize Modifier Structures Before Analysis**

  Prior to feature extraction, standardize the modifiers' SMILES structures (e.g., tautomer standardization, charge neutralization). Consistency in representation ensures accurate calculation of descriptors and adherence to the rules.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with small, polar, non-aromatic side chains** predict a **high yield**. These amino acids have side chains that do not introduce significant steric hindrance and can effectively coordinate with the catalyst. Examples include **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid). Their structures allow for strong interactions with the metal centers through the amino and carboxylate groups.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains** predict a **low yield**. The presence of large aromatic groups like phenyl rings increases steric hindrance, which can impede effective coordination with the catalyst. An example is **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine), where the bulky phenyl group reduces interaction efficiency with the catalytic sites.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **ω-amino acids with a carbon chain length of five carbons or fewer** predict a **high yield**, whereas those with longer chains predict a **low yield**. Short-chain ω-amino acids like **5-aminopentanoic acid** can form stable chelating interactions due to the proximity of amino and carboxylate groups, enhancing coordination with the catalyst. Longer chains, such as **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**, have increased flexibility, which can reduce effective coordination and lead to lower yields.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **linear aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups**, such as **octanoic acid**, predict a **high yield**. The hydrophobic nature and lack of interfering groups allow these modifiers to interact favorably with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or substrate, potentially stabilizing transition states and facilitating the reaction.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **benzoic acids substituted at the para position with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)** predict a **high yield**. EWGs like **nitro** or **bromomethyl** increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. Examples include **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**. These groups can also participate in additional non-covalent interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **benzoic acids substituted at the para position with electron-donating groups (EDGs)** predict a **low yield**. EDGs such as **methyl** or **hydroxy** decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid and can hinder effective coordination with the catalyst. Examples include **4-methylbenzoic acid** and **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**. The reduced ability to interact with metal centers results in lower catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **pyridine carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the pyridine ring** predict a **high yield**. The nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring can act as an additional coordination site, enhancing interaction with the catalyst. Examples include **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid) and **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**. These modifiers can chelate the metal center effectively, improving catalytic activity.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers where a **pyridine ring is connected to a carboxylic acid via a flexible aliphatic chain** predict a **high yield**. The flexible linker allows both the pyridine nitrogen and the carboxylate group to coordinate simultaneously with the catalyst. An example is **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**, where the butanoic acid chain provides the necessary flexibility for optimal interaction with the catalytic sites.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that have **perfluorinated alkyl chains** predict a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms and the hydrophobic nature of perfluorinated chains can reduce the ability of the carboxylate group to coordinate effectively with the catalyst. An example is **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**, where the perfluorinated chain diminishes interaction with metal centers.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**. Multiple hydroxyl groups can form additional hydrogen bonds or coordinate with the catalyst, enhancing reactivity. An example is **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid), where the dense array of hydroxyl groups facilitates strong interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with ether linkages and terminal amino groups** predict a **low yield**. The ether linkages increase chain flexibility, and the terminal amino group may be too distant from the carboxyl group for effective bidentate coordination. An example is **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**, where the flexible ether chains reduce the overall coordination efficiency with the catalyst.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-donating groups ortho to additional functional groups**, such as **hydroxy** groups adjacent to **formyl** groups, predict a **low yield**. Steric hindrance and intramolecular hydrogen bonding can interfere with coordination to the catalyst. Examples include **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**, where the proximity of the hydroxy and formyl groups may reduce the availability of the carboxylate oxygen for coordination.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **bulky substituents connected via rigid aromatic linkers** predict a **low yield**. The rigidity and steric bulk prevent optimal alignment of functional groups for effective catalyst interaction. An example is **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**, where the direct connection between two aromatic rings limits rotational flexibility and hinders simultaneous coordination of both functional groups with the catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal hydroxy or amino groups and chain lengths longer than five carbons** predict a **low yield**. Increased chain length and flexibility can reduce the effective coordination between the functional groups and the catalyst. Examples include **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** and **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, where the terminal functional groups are too distant to contribute effectively to catalyst coordination.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers containing **heteroaromatic rings capable of coordinating to metal centers**, such as **indole** rings, predict a **high yield**. The heteroaromatic system can enhance interactions with the catalyst through additional coordination sites or π-π stacking interactions. An example is **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan), where the indole ring and amino acid functionality work synergistically to improve catalytic activity.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with small, polar, non-aromatic side chains** predict a **high yield**. These amino acids have side chains that do not introduce significant steric hindrance and can effectively coordinate with the catalyst. Examples include **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid). Their structures allow for strong interactions with the metal centers through the amino and carboxylate groups.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains** predict a **low yield**. The presence of large aromatic groups like phenyl rings increases steric hindrance, which can impede effective coordination with the catalyst. An example is **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine), where the bulky phenyl group reduces interaction efficiency with the catalytic sites.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **ω-amino acids with a carbon chain length of five carbons or fewer** predict a **high yield**, whereas those with longer chains predict a **low yield**. Short-chain ω-amino acids like **5-aminopentanoic acid** can form stable chelating interactions due to the proximity of amino and carboxylate groups, enhancing coordination with the catalyst. Longer chains, such as **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**, have increased flexibility, which can reduce effective coordination and lead to lower yields.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **linear aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups**, such as **octanoic acid**, predict a **high yield**. The hydrophobic nature and lack of interfering groups allow these modifiers to interact favorably with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or substrate, potentially stabilizing transition states and facilitating the reaction.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **benzoic acids substituted at the para position with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)** predict a **high yield**. EWGs like **nitro** or **bromomethyl** increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. Examples include **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**. These groups can also participate in additional non-covalent interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **benzoic acids substituted at the para position with electron-donating groups (EDGs)** predict a **low yield**. EDGs such as **methyl** or **hydroxy** decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid and can hinder effective coordination with the catalyst. Examples include **4-methylbenzoic acid** and **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**. The reduced ability to interact with metal centers results in lower catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **pyridine carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the pyridine ring** predict a **high yield**. The nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring can act as an additional coordination site, enhancing interaction with the catalyst. Examples include **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid) and **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**. These modifiers can chelate the metal center effectively, improving catalytic activity.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers where a **pyridine ring is connected to a carboxylic acid via a flexible aliphatic chain** predict a **high yield**. The flexible linker allows both the pyridine nitrogen and the carboxylate group to coordinate simultaneously with the catalyst. An example is **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**, where the butanoic acid chain provides the necessary flexibility for optimal interaction with the catalytic sites.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that have **perfluorinated alkyl chains** predict a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms and the hydrophobic nature of perfluorinated chains can reduce the ability of the carboxylate group to coordinate effectively with the catalyst. An example is **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**, where the perfluorinated chain diminishes interaction with metal centers.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**. Multiple hydroxyl groups can form additional hydrogen bonds or coordinate with the catalyst, enhancing reactivity. An example is **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid), where the dense array of hydroxyl groups facilitates strong interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with ether linkages and terminal amino groups** predict a **low yield**. The ether linkages increase chain flexibility, and the terminal amino group may be too distant from the carboxyl group for effective bidentate coordination. An example is **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**, where the flexible ether chains reduce the overall coordination efficiency with the catalyst.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-donating groups ortho to additional functional groups**, such as **hydroxy** groups adjacent to **formyl** groups, predict a **low yield**. Steric hindrance and intramolecular hydrogen bonding can interfere with coordination to the catalyst. Examples include **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**, where the proximity of the hydroxy and formyl groups may reduce the availability of the carboxylate oxygen for coordination.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **bulky substituents connected via rigid aromatic linkers** predict a **low yield**. The rigidity and steric bulk prevent optimal alignment of functional groups for effective catalyst interaction. An example is **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**, where the direct connection between two aromatic rings limits rotational flexibility and hinders simultaneous coordination of both functional groups with the catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal hydroxy or amino groups and chain lengths longer than five carbons** predict a **low yield**. Increased chain length and flexibility can reduce the effective coordination between the functional groups and the catalyst. Examples include **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** and **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, where the terminal functional groups are too distant to contribute effectively to catalyst coordination.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers containing **heteroaromatic rings capable of coordinating to metal centers**, such as **indole** rings, predict a **high yield**. The heteroaromatic system can enhance interactions with the catalyst through additional coordination sites or π-π stacking interactions. An example is **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan), where the indole ring and amino acid functionality work synergistically to improve catalytic activity.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: **Rule 1**: Adjust the SMARTS pattern to correctly identify α-amino acids with small, polar, non-aromatic side chains. The current `bulky_side_chain` pattern `'[CX4H]([*!#1]{3,})'` may incorrectly exclude amino acids like aspartic acid and glutamic acid. Instead, consider counting the number of heavy atoms in the side chain more precisely. For example, modify the pattern to exclude side chains with a chain length greater than a certain number, or specifically exclude known bulky substituents.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: **Rule 2**: Ensure that the pattern for aromatic side chains in α-amino acids accurately captures amino acids like phenylalanine. The current pattern `alpha_amino_acid_aromatic = '[NX3][CX4H]([a])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'` might not match phenylalanine due to the side chain's structure. Modify the pattern to include side chains attached to an aromatic ring, possibly using recursive SMARTS or more specific substructure matching.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: **Rule 4**: The code currently does not match linear aliphatic carboxylic acids like octanoic acid. Update the `include` pattern to match aliphatic chains of varying lengths, such as `aliphatic_carboxylic_acid = 'C[CX4]*[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'`. Ensure that the `exclude` patterns do not inadvertently exclude non-polar aliphatic chains by refining the patterns for polar groups.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: **Rule 15**: The SMARTS pattern for indole-containing carboxylic acids may be too specific. Expand the pattern to match indole derivatives like tryptophan. For example, use `indole_pattern = '[#6]1:c:c2:c(:c1):[nH]:c:c2'` to identify indole rings and ensure the carboxylic acid is connected appropriately.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: **Rules 5 and 6**: Implement positional specificity in the SMARTS patterns to accurately match substituents at the para position of benzoic acids. Use SMARTS patterns that define the para position explicitly, such as using atom mapping or specifying the relative positions on the ring.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: **General Improvement**: For all rules, test each SMARTS pattern individually against example molecules to validate their accuracy. Consider using more descriptive variable names and adding comments to clarify the purpose of each pattern. If possible, use RDKit's substructure search capabilities to account for tautomers and resonance structures.

   - **Train Confidence:** 0.6285 (62.85%)
   - **Train Lift:** 1.2554
   - **Train Leverage:** 0.0060

---

**Performance Evaluation:**

**1. Confidence:**

- **Improvement Over Previous Metrics:**
  - The average train confidence has increased from **58.74%** in the previous iterations to **62.85%** in the current iteration.
  - This indicates that, when the rule conditions are met, the likelihood of correctly predicting the outcome has improved.

- **Trend Analysis:**
  - The confidence peaked at **66.67%** in the second iteration but slightly decreased to **62.85%** after applying all current rules.
  - The slight decrease may suggest overfitting or the addition of rules that do not contribute significantly to predictive accuracy.

**2. Lift:**

- **Improvement Over Previous Metrics:**
  - The average train lift has increased from **1.1304** to **1.2554**.
  - A lift greater than 1 indicates that the rule is better at predicting the outcome than random chance. An increase in lift suggests stronger association between the rule conditions and the prediction.

- **Trend Analysis:**
  - The lift peaked at **1.3327** in the second iteration but decreased to **1.2554** in the current metrics.
  - The decrease in lift may be due to the introduction of additional rules that cover less significant patterns.

**3. Support:**

- **Decrease from Previous Metrics:**
  - The train support has significantly decreased from an average of **17.56%** previously to **1.96%** currently.
  - This means the rules now apply to a much smaller portion of the dataset.

**4. Leverage:**

- **Decrease from Previous Metrics:**
  - The train leverage decreased from an average of **0.0124** to **0.0060**.
  - Although leverage is positive, indicating a stronger association than expected by chance, the decrease suggests that the additional support contributed by the rules has lessened.

**Interpretation:**

- **Trade-off Between Confidence and Support:**
  - The increase in confidence and lift signifies that the rules are more accurate for the instances they cover.
  - However, the substantial decrease in support indicates that these rules are applicable to a smaller subset of the data.
  - High confidence with low support may suggest overfitting, where the rules are too specific and may not generalize well.

- **Plateau in Performance:**
  - The peak in confidence and lift during the second iteration followed by a slight decrease suggests diminishing returns from adding or modifying rules.
  - This pattern indicates that a local maximum in performance may have been reached.

---

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules:**

**1. Balance Specificity and Coverage:**

- **Generalize Overly Specific Rules:**
  - Review rules with very low support to determine if they can be broadened to cover more instances without significantly reducing confidence.
  - Example: Combine rules that predict similar outcomes based on related conditions.

- **Eliminate Redundant or Ineffective Rules:**
  - Remove rules that contribute little to overall performance, especially if they have low support and confidence.
  - Focus on rules that provide meaningful insights and have higher leverage.

**2. Enhance Rule Quality:**

- **Prioritize High Lift and Confidence:**
  - Retain rules that exhibit both high confidence and high lift as they are the most valuable for prediction.
  - Ensure that these rules also have acceptable levels of support.

- **Refine Conditions for Key Rules:**
  - Examine the conditions of high-performing rules to identify opportunities for refinement.
  - Simplify complex conditions to avoid overfitting and improve generalization.

**3. Increase Data Representation:**

- **Expand the Dataset:**
  - Incorporate additional data to increase the diversity and representation within the dataset.
  - More data may help in identifying broader patterns and improve support for the rules.

- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Create new features or transformations that may capture underlying patterns not previously detected.
  - Consider domain knowledge to guide the creation of meaningful features.

**4. Evaluate Overfitting Risks:**

- **Cross-Validation:**
  - Use cross-validation techniques to assess how well the rules generalize to unseen data.
  - This will help determine if high confidence is due to overfitting to the training data.

- **Adjust Rule Induction Parameters:**
  - Relax thresholds for rule creation (e.g., minimum support and confidence levels) to allow for more general rules.
  - Experiment with different parameters to find an optimal balance.

**5. Incorporate Negative Evidence:**

- **Identify and Use Negative Associations:**
  - Analyze instances where the rules predict incorrectly to understand the limitations.
  - Develop rules that account for exceptions or contradictory patterns.

**6. Continuous Monitoring and Iteration:**

- **Monitor Performance Metrics:**
  - Keep track of changes in key metrics with each iteration to identify trends.
  - Use statistical tests to determine if changes are significant.

- **Set Stopping Criteria:**
  - Define clear criteria for when to stop iterating, such as minimal improvements over several iterations.
  - This will prevent unnecessary computational effort once a plateau is reached.

---

**Conclusion:**

The current rules have improved in terms of confidence and lift compared to previous iterations, indicating stronger predictive power for the cases they cover. However, the significant decrease in support suggests that the rules are becoming too specific and are applicable to a smaller portion of the data.

To enhance the performance of the rules:

- **Aim for a balance** between confidence and support to ensure that the rules are both accurate and widely applicable.
- **Refine and generalize** the rules to cover more instances without sacrificing too much predictive accuracy.
- **Be vigilant** against overfitting by validating the rules on separate datasets and simplifying overly complex conditions.
- **Iterate thoughtfully**, making incremental adjustments based on performance trends, and knowing when to stop based on predefined criteria.

By implementing these recommendations, the rules can be improved to provide reliable and generalizable predictions for the catalytic problem being studied.

Traditional Commenter Message:
**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

Based on the latest training results and comparing them with the reference metrics, we can make the following observations about the performance of the current rules:

1. **Accuracy Comparison:**
   - **Reference Accuracies:**
     - Validation Accuracy consistently around **0.76**.
     - Test Accuracy ranging from **0.625** to **0.75**.
   - **Current Iteration Accuracies:**
     - First Iteration Validation Accuracy: **0.5143**.
     - Second Iteration Validation Accuracy: **0.5429**.
     - Latest Iteration Validation Accuracy: **0.5714**.

2. **Analysis of Accuracy Trends:**
   - The validation accuracy in the current iterations is significantly lower than the reference accuracies.
   - While there is a slight improvement across the iterations from **0.5143** to **0.5714**, the overall accuracy remains below the reference baseline of **0.76**.
   - This suggests that the current set of rules may not be as effective in capturing the patterns in the data as the previous rules.

3. **Overfitting and Underfitting Assessment:**
   - **Underfitting Indicators:**
     - The low validation accuracies indicate that the model is not capturing the underlying patterns in the data effectively.
     - Consistently low accuracies across different folds suggest that the model may be underfitting.
   - **Overfitting Indicators:**
     - Given that both validation and test accuracies are low, overfitting is less likely. However, the slight increase in validation accuracy without a substantial increase suggests the model is not overfitting to the training data.

4. **SHAP Analysis Insights:**
   - The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values provide insights into the contribution of each rule to the model's predictions.
   - **Discrepancies Identified:**
     - There are several molecules where the predicted loading does not match the experimental value.
     - For molecules where the **predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high**, rules with **high negative SHAP values** are contributing to the underestimation.
     - For molecules where the **predicted loading is high but the experimental value is low**, rules with **high positive SHAP values** are contributing to the overestimation.
   - **Key Problematic Rules:**
     - **Rule 6**: Frequently shows significant negative SHAP values for molecules where the experimental loading is high but predicted as low.
     - **Rule 7** and **Rule 10**: Show high positive SHAP values in cases where the loading is overestimated.

5. **Interpretation of Accuracy Improvements:**
   - The slight increase in validation accuracy over iterations indicates incremental improvements.
   - However, the improvements are not substantial enough to reach or surpass the baseline reference accuracy.
   - This suggests that the current rules may need significant refinement to improve model performance.

6. **Insights from SHAP Analysis for Rule Improvement:**
   - **Rule 6 (Modifiers that are benzoic acids substituted at the para position with electron-donating groups (EDGs) predict a low yield):**
     - Consistently contributing negative SHAP values in underestimation cases.
     - May be too general or incorrectly penalizing certain compounds.
   - **Rule 7 (Modifiers that are pyridine carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the pyridine ring predict a high yield):**
     - Contributing high positive SHAP values in overestimation cases.
     - Might be overestimating the effect of pyridine carboxylic acids.
   - **Rule 10 (Modifiers that are carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group predict a high yield):**
     - Also contributing to overestimation in some cases.
     - The role of multiple hydroxyl groups may need to be re-evaluated.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

Based on the analysis above, the following recommendations can be made to improve the current rules:

1. **Refine Rule 6:**
   - **Issue Identified:**
     - Rule 6 is contributing to underestimating the loading for molecules that actually have high experimental loadings.
     - The rule might be too broadly categorizing modifiers with electron-donating groups as low yield, without considering other functional groups or molecular contexts.
   - **Recommendation:**
     - Re-evaluate the scope of Rule 6 to account for modifiers where electron-donating groups do not significantly reduce yield.
     - Consider introducing exceptions or additional conditions to Rule 6 based on the presence of other functional groups that may enhance coordination with the catalyst.
     - Analyze specific cases where Rule 6 is leading to underestimation and adjust the rule to accommodate those molecules.

2. **Adjust Rule 7:**
   - **Issue Identified:**
     - Rule 7 is causing overestimation of loading in molecules where the experimental loading is low.
     - The positive SHAP values suggest that Rule 7 is overly favoring certain modifiers.
   - **Recommendation:**
     - Introduce additional criteria to Rule 7 to differentiate between pyridine carboxylic acids that truly lead to high yields and those that do not.
     - Consider the position of substituents on the pyridine ring and their electronic effects.
     - Evaluate whether steric hindrance or other factors might reduce the effectiveness of these modifiers despite the presence of the pyridine carboxyl group.

3. **Reassess Rule 10:**
   - **Issue Identified:**
     - Rule 10 is contributing to overestimation in some cases where the experimental loading is low.
     - The assumption that multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group always predict a high yield may not hold in all contexts.
   - **Recommendation:**
     - Investigate the specific structural features of modifiers where Rule 10 fails.
     - Determine if factors like steric hindrance from bulky hydroxyl groups or intramolecular hydrogen bonding reduce their coordination efficiency.
     - Modify Rule 10 to include considerations for chain length, hydroxyl group positioning, and overall molecular flexibility.

4. **Improve Generalization to Address Underfitting:**
   - **Issue Identified:**
     - The model appears to be underfitting, indicating that the current rules are not capturing the complexity of the data.
   - **Recommendation:**
     - Introduce new rules or refine existing ones to capture additional patterns in the data.
     - Consider integrating physicochemical properties such as pKa, molecular weight, and solubility into the rules.
     - Employ data-driven approaches to identify patterns that may not be immediately apparent.

5. **Incorporate Additional Functional Group Considerations:**
   - **Recommendation:**
     - Analyze molecules that are mispredicted to identify common functional groups or structural motifs not adequately covered by current rules.
     - Add rules that account for these overlooked features.
     - For example, consider the impact of amino groups in different positions, heteroatoms in the carbon chain, or specific ring structures.

6. **Balance Rule Contributions:**
   - **Recommendation:**
     - Adjust the weighting of rules in the model to prevent any single rule from disproportionately influencing the prediction.
     - Use the magnitudes of the SHAP values to calibrate the influence of each rule.
     - Ensure that the combined effect of the rules provides a more nuanced prediction.

7. **Iterative Refinement and Evaluation:**
   - **Recommendation:**
     - Continue the iterative process of refining rules based on SHAP analysis and evaluating their performance.
     - After making adjustments, retrain the model and assess whether the validation accuracy improves.
     - Keep track of changes to understand which modifications lead to performance gains.

8. **Consider Rule Interactions:**
   - **Recommendation:**
     - Evaluate if there are interactions between rules that could be influencing the predictions.
     - Modify the model to account for possible synergistic or antagonistic effects between rules.
     - For instance, a modifier might have both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups, and the net effect should be considered.

**Conclusion**

The current rules require refinement to improve the model’s performance. By focusing on adjusting the rules that contribute most to prediction errors, as indicated by the SHAP analysis, we can enhance the model's accuracy. It is essential to ensure that the rules are neither too general nor too specific, allowing the model to generalize effectively without underfitting or overfitting. Incorporating additional molecular features and considering the interplay between different functional groups will likely lead to better predictive performance.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimization:**

The current set of rules developed to predict the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction have been evaluated through performance metrics, validation accuracies, and SHAP analysis. The key findings from the discussions are as follows:

1. **Performance Metrics Analysis:**

   - **Improved Confidence and Lift:** The latest rules show an increase in train confidence (from approximately 58.74% to 62.85%) and lift (from 1.1304 to 1.2554). This indicates that when the rules apply, they are more accurate in predicting the high yield than previous iterations.
   - **Decreased Support:** There is a significant decrease in train support (from about 17.56% to 1.96%), meaning the rules now cover a much smaller portion of the dataset. This suggests that the rules have become too specific.
   - **Interpretation:** While individual predictions may be more accurate, the decreased support implies that the rules do not generalize well across the dataset, limiting their practical utility.

2. **Validation Accuracy and Underfitting:**

   - **Lower Validation Accuracies:** Current validation accuracies range from 51.43% to 57.14%, which are lower than previous reference accuracies of approximately 76%.
   - **Underfitting Indication:** Consistently low validation accuracies suggest that the model is underfitting, failing to capture the underlying patterns in the data effectively.

3. **SHAP Analysis Insights:**

   - **Problematic Rules Identified:** The SHAP analysis highlighted that certain rules (particularly **Rule 6**, **Rule 7**, and **Rule 10**) are contributing to incorrect predictions.
     - **Rule 6:** Frequently contributes negative SHAP values in cases where the experimental yield is high but predicted as low, indicating over-penalization of certain modifiers.
     - **Rule 7 and Rule 10:** Often contribute to overestimation of yield in cases where the experimental yield is low, suggesting these rules may be too broadly applied.

4. **Recommendations from Previous Suggestions:**

   - **Refinement of SMARTS Patterns:** Suggestions were made to adjust the SMARTS patterns to improve the specificity and accuracy of the rules.
   - **Testing Against Examples:** Emphasis on validating each SMARTS pattern with example molecules to ensure they match intended structures.
   - **Balancing Specificity and Coverage:** Recognizing the need to make rules general enough to cover more data while maintaining high confidence.

**Directions to Optimize the Current Rules:**

Based on the findings, the following directions are recommended to optimize the current rules:

1. **Refine Overly Specific Rules to Increase Support:**

   - **Generalize Certain Patterns:** Adjust the rules to cover a broader range of modifiers by relaxing overly strict SMARTS patterns.
   - **Merge Similar Rules:** Combine rules that predict similar outcomes to increase their applicability across more molecules.

2. **Adjust and Improve Problematic Rules:**

   - **Rule 6 (Benzoic acids with EDGs predicting low yield):**
     - **Issue Identified:** The rule may be too broadly penalizing modifiers with electron-donating groups (EDGs) without considering their position and overall molecular context.
     - **Optimization Direction:**
       - **Modify SMARTS Pattern:** Adjust the pattern to specify the position of EDGs (e.g., para position) and consider the presence of additional coordinating groups.
       - **Consider Exceptions:** Identify modifiers where EDGs do not negatively impact yield and adjust the rule accordingly.

   - **Rule 7 (Pyridine carboxylic acids predicting high yield):**
     - **Issue Identified:** Overestimation of yield for some pyridine carboxylic acids.
     - **Optimization Direction:**
       - **Incorporate Substituent Effects:** Modify the rule to account for the influence of substituents on the pyridine ring that may hinder coordination.
       - **Differentiate Isomers:** Consider the impact of carboxyl group position on coordination ability (e.g., comparing pyridine-2-carboxylic acid vs. pyridine-4-carboxylic acid).

   - **Rule 10 (Carboxylic acids with adjacent hydroxyl groups predicting high yield):**
     - **Issue Identified:** Overestimation of yield where steric hindrance from hydroxyl groups may actually reduce coordination efficiency.
     - **Optimization Direction:**
       - **Evaluate Steric Effects:** Update the rule to consider the size and positioning of hydroxyl groups that may impede interaction with the catalyst.
       - **Modify Pattern Specificity:** Refine the SMARTS pattern to target only those structures where hydroxyl groups enhance, rather than hinder, coordination.

3. **Enhance Rule Coverage While Maintaining Confidence:**

   - **Balance Specificity and Generalization:** Ensure that rules are neither too narrow (low support) nor too broad (low confidence). Strive for rules that accurately predict outcomes across a larger portion of the dataset.
   - **Iterative Testing and Validation:** Continuously test the adjusted rules against both training and validation sets to monitor their performance and avoid overfitting.

4. **Incorporate Additional Molecular Features:**

   - **Physicochemical Properties:** Integrate features such as pKa values, hydrophobicity (logP), and molecular size, which may influence the modifier's interaction with the catalyst.
   - **Functional Group Interactions:** Consider how different functional groups within a molecule may interact synergistically or antagonistically, affecting the yield.

5. **Use Advanced Pattern Recognition Techniques:**

   - **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Employ algorithms capable of capturing complex patterns that may not be easily defined by simple rules.
   - **Feature Engineering:** Generate new features that capture essential chemical information, such as molecular descriptors and fingerprints.

6. **Improve SMARTS Patterns Accuracy:**

   - **Testing and Validation:** For each SMARTS pattern, ensure it correctly identifies all intended structures and excludes unintended ones by testing against a diverse set of molecules.
   - **Descriptive Variable Names and Comments:** Enhance code readability and maintainability by using clear variable names and adding comments to explain the purpose and structure of each pattern.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting:**

There is a strong possibility for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. The current low validation accuracies and underfitting suggest that the rules are not yet capturing all relevant patterns in the data. By refining the problematic rules, increasing their coverage, and incorporating additional molecular features, we can enhance the model's predictive power while avoiding overfitting.

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with small, polar, non-aromatic side chains** predict a **high yield**. These amino acids have side chains that do not introduce significant steric hindrance and can effectively coordinate with the catalyst. Examples include **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid). Their structures allow for strong interactions with the metal centers through the amino and carboxylate groups.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with bulky aromatic side chains** predict a **low yield**. The presence of large aromatic groups like phenyl rings increases steric hindrance, which can impede effective coordination with the catalyst. An example is **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine), where the bulky phenyl group reduces interaction efficiency with the catalytic sites.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **ω-amino acids with a carbon chain length of five carbons or fewer** predict a **high yield**, whereas those with longer chains predict a **low yield**. Short-chain ω-amino acids like **5-aminopentanoic acid** can form stable chelating interactions due to the proximity of amino and carboxylate groups, enhancing coordination with the catalyst. Longer chains, such as **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**, have increased flexibility, which can reduce effective coordination and lead to lower yields.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **linear aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups**, such as **octanoic acid**, predict a **high yield**. The hydrophobic nature and lack of interfering groups allow these modifiers to interact favorably with hydrophobic regions of the catalyst or substrate, potentially stabilizing transition states and facilitating the reaction.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **benzoic acids substituted at the para position with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)** predict a **high yield**. EWGs like **nitro** or **bromomethyl** increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. Examples include **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**. These groups can also participate in additional non-covalent interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **benzoic acids substituted at the para position with electron-donating groups (EDGs)** predict a **low yield**. EDGs such as **methyl** or **hydroxy** decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid and can hinder effective coordination with the catalyst. Examples include **4-methylbenzoic acid** and **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**. The reduced ability to interact with metal centers results in lower catalytic efficiency.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **pyridine carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the pyridine ring** predict a **high yield**. The nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring can act as an additional coordination site, enhancing interaction with the catalyst. Examples include **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid) and **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**. These modifiers can chelate the metal center effectively, improving catalytic activity.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers where a **pyridine ring is connected to a carboxylic acid via a flexible aliphatic chain** predict a **high yield**. The flexible linker allows both the pyridine nitrogen and the carboxylate group to coordinate simultaneously with the catalyst. An example is **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**, where the butanoic acid chain provides the necessary flexibility for optimal interaction with the catalytic sites.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that have **perfluorinated alkyl chains** predict a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms and the hydrophobic nature of perfluorinated chains can reduce the ability of the carboxylate group to coordinate effectively with the catalyst. An example is **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**, where the perfluorinated chain diminishes interaction with metal centers.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**. Multiple hydroxyl groups can form additional hydrogen bonds or coordinate with the catalyst, enhancing reactivity. An example is **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid), where the dense array of hydroxyl groups facilitates strong interactions with the catalyst.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with ether linkages and terminal amino groups** predict a **low yield**. The ether linkages increase chain flexibility, and the terminal amino group may be too distant from the carboxyl group for effective bidentate coordination. An example is **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**, where the flexible ether chains reduce the overall coordination efficiency with the catalyst.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-donating groups ortho to additional functional groups**, such as **hydroxy** groups adjacent to **formyl** groups, predict a **low yield**. Steric hindrance and intramolecular hydrogen bonding can interfere with coordination to the catalyst. Examples include **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**, where the proximity of the hydroxy and formyl groups may reduce the availability of the carboxylate oxygen for coordination.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **bulky substituents connected via rigid aromatic linkers** predict a **low yield**. The rigidity and steric bulk prevent optimal alignment of functional groups for effective catalyst interaction. An example is **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**, where the direct connection between two aromatic rings limits rotational flexibility and hinders simultaneous coordination of both functional groups with the catalyst.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal hydroxy or amino groups and chain lengths longer than five carbons** predict a **low yield**. Increased chain length and flexibility can reduce the effective coordination between the functional groups and the catalyst. Examples include **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** and **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, where the terminal functional groups are too distant to contribute effectively to catalyst coordination.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers containing **heteroaromatic rings capable of coordinating to metal centers**, such as **indole** rings, predict a **high yield**. The heteroaromatic system can enhance interactions with the catalyst through additional coordination sites or π-π stacking interactions. An example is **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan), where the indole ring and amino acid functionality work synergistically to improve catalytic activity.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Refine Rule 6 by Specifying EDG Positions and Considering Molecular Context**

  - **Issue**: Rule 6 may over-penalize modifiers with electron-donating groups (EDGs) without considering their positions and the overall molecular context, leading to incorrect low-yield predictions for some modifiers.
  
  - **Practical Steps**:
    - **Modify the SMARTS Pattern**: Adjust the SMARTS pattern for Rule 6 to specifically target benzoic acids with EDGs at positions that negatively impact coordination with the catalyst. For example, focus on para-substituted EDGs that interfere with metal coordination.
    - **Consider EDG Strength and Steric Effects**: Differentiate between strong and weak EDGs and assess their steric impact on the molecule's ability to interact with the catalyst.
    - **Incorporate Additional Coordinating Groups**: Revise the rule to account for the presence of other functional groups that may enhance coordination despite the presence of EDGs.
    - **Test and Validate**: Apply the revised rule to modifiers like **4-methylbenzoic acid** and **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** to ensure accurate predictions and adjust as necessary.

- **Advice 2**: **Refine Rule 7 by Accounting for Substituents and Position of Carboxyl Groups on Pyridine Rings**

  - **Issue**: Rule 7 overestimates the yield for some pyridine carboxylic acids because it does not consider substituents that may hinder coordination or the positional isomerism of the carboxyl group.
  
  - **Practical Steps**:
    - **Differentiate Positional Isomers**: Modify the rule to specify which pyridine carboxylic acid isomers (e.g., 2-, 3-, or 4-carboxypyridine) predict high yield based on their coordination ability.
    - **Assess Substituent Effects**: Update the rule to consider additional substituents on the pyridine ring that may sterically hinder or electronically affect metal coordination.
    - **Adjust the SMARTS Pattern**: Refine the SMARTS pattern to include these considerations, ensuring it matches only the modifiers likely to result in high yields.
    - **Validation**: Test the adjusted rule with compounds like **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** and **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**, analyzing their experimental yields to verify rule accuracy.

- **Advice 3**: **Refine Rule 10 by Evaluating Steric Hindrance from Multiple Hydroxyl Groups**

  - **Issue**: Rule 10 may overpredict high yields for modifiers with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups, not accounting for steric hindrance that can reduce effective coordination.
  
  - **Practical Steps**:
    - **Assess Steric Impact**: Evaluate the size and spatial arrangement of hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group to determine their effect on catalyst coordination.
    - **Revise the SMARTS Pattern**: Modify the SMARTS pattern to include only those structures where hydroxyl groups aid coordination without causing significant steric hindrance.
    - **Consider Intramolecular Interactions**: Account for potential intramolecular hydrogen bonding that may reduce the availability of hydroxyl groups for catalyst interaction.
    - **Test Examples**: Apply the revised rule to modifiers like **gluconic acid** to confirm it predicts high yield appropriately and adjust for cases where steric hindrance is detrimental.

- **Advice 4**: **Increase Rule Support by Generalizing Overly Specific Rules**

  - **Issue**: The current rules have low support due to overly specific SMARTS patterns, limiting their applicability.
  
  - **Practical Steps**:
    - **Relax Strict Constraints**: Broaden the SMARTS patterns by relaxing certain specifications that unnecessarily limit the scope, without sacrificing confidence significantly.
    - **Merge Similar Rules**: Combine rules that share similar structural features and predict the same outcome to increase coverage.
    - **Optimize Balance Between Specificity and Coverage**: Aim for rules that are accurate yet general enough to apply to a wider range of modifiers, enhancing support.

- **Advice 5**: **Incorporate Additional Molecular Features into Rules**

  - **Issue**: The current rules may miss important molecular features influencing yield, such as physicochemical properties and functional group interactions.
  
  - **Practical Steps**:
    - **Add Physicochemical Parameters**: Integrate descriptors like pKa, log P, molecular weight, and steric parameters into the rule criteria.
    - **Functional Group Synergy**: Consider how combinations of functional groups within a modifier may affect coordination and reactivity.
    - **Quantitative Thresholds**: Define numerical thresholds (e.g., chain lengths, steric hindrance parameters) based on data trends to refine rules.

- **Advice 6**: **Validate and Refine SMARTS Patterns Using Molecular Examples**

  - **Issue**: Inaccuracies in SMARTS patterns can lead to misclassification of modifiers, affecting rule performance.
  
  - **Practical Steps**:
    - **Test Patterns with Diverse Molecules**: Verify each SMARTS pattern against a variety of structures to ensure correct matching and exclusion.
    - **Iteratively Refine Patterns**: Based on test results, adjust patterns to eliminate false positives and negatives.
    - **Improve Code Readability**: Use descriptive variable names and add comments to clarify the purpose of each SMARTS pattern, facilitating future adjustments.

- **Advice 7**: **Enhance Rule Validation through Iterative Testing**

  - **Issue**: Adjusted rules need thorough validation to ensure they improve predictive performance without overfitting.
  
  - **Practical Steps**:
    - **Perform Cross-Validation**: Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to test rules on different data subsets.
    - **Monitor Key Metrics**: Track support, confidence, lift, and validation accuracy after each rule modification to assess impact.
    - **Avoid Overfitting by Generalization**: Ensure rules maintain performance on validation sets, not just the training data.

- **Advice 8**: **Consider Integrating Machine Learning Models**

  - **Issue**: Certain complex patterns influencing yield may not be captured by rule-based methods alone.
  
  - **Practical Steps**:
    - **Employ Machine Learning Algorithms**: Use models like decision trees or random forests to identify and learn complex relationships in the data.
    - **Feature Engineering**: Generate comprehensive molecular descriptors and fingerprints as inputs for machine learning models.
    - **Combine Approaches**: Merge insights from machine learning with refined rules to create a hybrid model that leverages the strengths of both methods.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with acidic side chains**, such as additional **carboxyl groups**, predict a **high yield**.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers where a **pyridine ring is connected via an aliphatic linker to the carboxylic acid** predict a **high yield**. The flexible linker allows simultaneous coordination of the nitrogen and carboxyl groups. An example is **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **perfluorinated alkyl chains** predict a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine reduces the coordinating ability of the carboxylate group. An example is **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**. These hydroxyl groups enhance coordination through additional hydrogen bonding or direct metal interaction. An example is **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid).

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with **flexible ether linkages and terminal amino groups** predict a **low yield**. Excessive flexibility reduces effective coordination with the catalyst. An example is **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with ortho-hydroxy and formyl groups** predict a **low yield**. Steric hindrance and intramolecular interactions interfere with catalyst coordination. Examples include **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **long-chain hydroxy or amino acids (longer than five carbons)** predict a **low yield**. The distance between functional groups diminishes coordination efficiency. Examples are **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** and **7-aminoheptanoic acid**.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers containing **heteroaromatic rings capable of metal coordination**, such as **indole** or **benzofuran** rings, predict a **high yield**. These rings provide additional coordination sites or π-π stacking interactions. Examples include **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan) and **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **benzoic acids linked to pyridine rings via rigid aromatic linkers** predict a **low yield**. Rigid structures limit flexibility, hindering effective coordination. An example is **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.

**End of Rules**

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**
- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear in specifying that α-amino acids with acidic side chains (additional carboxyl groups) predict high yield. The physico-chemical insight is appropriate, as additional carboxyl groups enhance coordination with metal centers. The rule considers combinations of functional groups (α-amino acid backbone and acidic side chains), providing necessary complexity. The dataset includes at least two supporting examples—(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid and (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid—both showing high yield, satisfying the coverage criterion. Overall, the rule balances complexity and coverage effectively.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 clearly states that α-amino acids with bulky hydrophobic or aromatic side chains predict low yield due to steric hindrance interfering with coordination. The property insight is sound. The rule combines structural features, adding complexity. However, the dataset only provides one supporting example—(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid—showing low yield. With limited coverage, the rule may need more supporting data to be robust.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear in differentiating ω-amino acids based on carbon chain length, predicting high yield for chains of five carbons or fewer and low yield for longer chains. The physico-chemical rationale is solid, relating chain length to effective chelation. The rule includes considerations of chain length and functional groups, adding complexity. The dataset supports this rule with at least two examples—5-aminopentanoic acid (high yield) and 7-aminoheptanoic acid (low yield)—fulfilling the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 clearly states that linear aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups predict high yield due to favorable hydrophobic interactions. While the rule is simple, it lacks complexity. The dataset provides only one supporting example—octanoic acid—with high yield, which is insufficient for strong coverage. Additional data points are needed to strengthen this rule's validity.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 specifies that para-substituted benzoic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups predict high yield by enhancing metal coordination through increased acidity. The rule combines substitution patterns and electronic effects, adding complexity. The dataset includes at least two supporting examples—4-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid—both with high yield, satisfying coverage. However, conflicting data like 4-formylbenzoic acid (low yield) suggest that the strength of the EWG may affect outcomes, indicating room for refinement.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear in predicting that para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-donating groups lead to low yield due to decreased acidity hindering coordination.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 predicts that aromatic carboxylic acids with ortho-hydroxy and formyl groups lead to low yield due to steric hindrance. The rule is complex, involving specific substituents at precise positions. However, the dataset offers only one supporting example—5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid—with low yield, indicating limited coverage. Additional data points are necessary to strengthen this rule.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 clearly states that long-chain hydroxy or amino acids (longer than five carbons) predict low yield due to diminished coordination efficiency from increased distance between functional groups. The rule includes chain length considerations and functional groups, adding complexity. The dataset supports this rule with two examples—7-hydroxyheptanoic acid and 7-aminoheptanoic acid—both with low yield, satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 predicts that modifiers containing heteroaromatic rings capable of metal coordination, like indole or benzofuran, result in high yield due to additional coordination sites. The rule is complex, involving specific ring systems. The dataset supports this rule with at least two examples—(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid and 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid—both exhibiting high yield, fulfilling the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 states that benzoic acids linked to pyridine rings via rigid aromatic linkers predict low yield due to limited flexibility hindering coordination.

**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Refine Rule 2 to Address Contradictions with Bulky Aromatic Side Chains**  
  Rule 2 currently states that modifiers which are α-amino acids with bulky hydrophobic or aromatic side chains predict a low yield. However, this rule contradicts data point 15 (**(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** or tryptophan), which yields a high result despite having a bulky aromatic indole ring. To resolve this, split Rule 2 into two separate rules:

  - **Rule 2a**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with bulky non-heteroaromatic aromatic side chains** (e.g., phenyl groups) predict a **low yield** due to steric hindrance impeding coordination. Example: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine).

  - **Rule 2b**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with bulky heteroaromatic side chains capable of additional coordination** (e.g., indole rings) predict a **high yield** because the heteroatoms can enhance interactions with the catalyst through π-π stacking or direct coordination. Example: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan).

- **Advice 2**: **Expand Coverage for Rules with Limited Data Points**  
  Several rules, such as Rule 4 (linear aliphatic carboxylic acids without polar groups predicting high yield) and Rule 8 (pyridine rings connected via an aliphatic linker predicting high yield), are supported by only one data point each. To strengthen these rules:

  - **Collect Additional Data**: Seek out more examples within the dataset or from literature that fit these criteria to confirm the trends.
  
  - **Adjust Rules if Necessary**: If additional data do not support the original rule, modify the rule to reflect the new insights or consider merging it with other related rules.

- **Advice 3**: **Clarify Rules Regarding Electronic Effects on Benzoic Acids (Rules 5 and 6)**  
  Rules 5 and 6 address the impact of electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) and electron-donating groups (EDGs) on the yield but exhibit inconsistencies:

  - **4-Aminobenzoic acid** (data point 4) is predicted to yield high results despite the amino group typically being an EDG.
  
  - **4-Formylbenzoic acid** (data point 19) shows a low yield, contradicting Rule 5, as the formyl group is an EWG.

  **Recommendations**:

  - **Reevaluate Substituent Effects**: Consider both inductive and resonance effects of substituents. For example, the amino group is an EDG by resonance but can act as an EWG by induction due to its electronegativity.

  - **Revise the Rules**: Modify Rules 5 and 6 to reflect the nuanced effects of substituents:

    - **Revised Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **para-substituted benzoic acids with strongly electron-withdrawing or resonance-stabilizing groups** predict a **high yield**. Examples include nitro and bromomethyl groups.

    - **Revised Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-donating groups that hinder coordination** predict a **low yield**. Emphasize that steric factors and specific electronic effects impacting coordination should be considered.

- **Advice 4**: **Provide Specificity in Chain Length for ω-Amino Acids (Rule 3)**  
  Rule 3 distinguishes yields based on chain length but could benefit from increased specificity:

  - **Define Optimal Chain Length**: Specify that ω-amino acids with exactly five carbons predict a high yield, as coordination efficiency diminishes beyond this length.

  - **Address Exceptions**: Investigate any anomalies where longer or shorter chain lengths do not fit the trend and adjust the rule accordingly.

- **Advice 5**: **Integrate Overlapping Rules to Avoid Redundancy and Contradictions**  
  Some rules may overlap or contradict each other, such as Rules 2 and 14 regarding aromatic side chains. To improve clarity:

  - **Merge Similar Rules**: Combine rules that address similar structural features and rephrase them to accommodate all relevant data points.

  - **Create Hierarchical Rules**: Establish primary rules with secondary conditions to cover exceptions, ensuring modifiers are evaluated comprehensively.

- **Advice 6**: **Incorporate Structural Motifs and Functional Group Positions in Rules**  
  Enhance the specificity and applicability of the rules by:

  - **Detailing Substituent Positions**: Specify whether substituents are in ortho, meta, or para positions, as their location can significantly impact electronic effects and steric hindrance.

  - **Highlighting Functional Group Interactions**: Identify how certain functional groups interact with the catalyst, improving the predictive power of the rules.

- **Advice 7**: **Use Chemical Structures or SMILES Notation for Clarity**  
  To assist in the practical application of the rules:

  - **Include Structures**: Provide chemical structures or SMILES strings for each example modifier in the rules, aiding visualization.

  - **Visual Aids**: Utilize diagrams to illustrate how modifiers interact with the catalyst, emphasizing key coordination sites.

- **Advice 8**: **Validate Rules with Additional Experimental Data**  
  Strengthen the reliability of the rules by:

  - **Conducting Experiments**: Test modifiers that fit underrepresented categories within the rules to gather more data points.

  - **Cross-Referencing Literature**: Compare findings with existing studies to confirm trends and refine rules accordingly.

- **Advice 9**: **Simplify Overly Complex Rules for Better Usability**  
  Rules with high complexity, such as Rule 12, may be difficult to apply:

  - **Simplify Criteria**: Focus on the most influential structural features that impact yield.

  - **Provide Examples and Counterexamples**: Clearly illustrate the rule with supporting data points and highlight exceptions.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify Rules Using Structural Features Extractable from SMILES**  
  Refine the rules to focus on specific structural features that can be directly identified in SMILES strings. For example, instead of using terms like "α-amino acids with acidic side chains," specify the presence of both an **amino group (-NH2) attached to the alpha carbon** and an additional **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)** in the side chain. This allows for straightforward pattern recognition in SMILES parsing.

- **Advice 2**: **Quantify Electronic Effects with Descriptors**  
  Replace qualitative descriptions of electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups with quantifiable electronic descriptors such as **Hammett sigma constants** or **Taft parameters**. Incorporate these values into the rules to enable numerical feature extraction from SMILES based on the substituents present.

- **Advice 3**: **Use Binary Indicators for Functional Groups**  
  Create rules that utilize binary variables indicating the **presence (1) or absence (0) of specific functional groups** or substructures (e.g., hydroxyl groups, pyridine rings, carboxylic acids). These can be easily identified and encoded from SMILES strings using substructure search algorithms.

- **Advice 4**: **Incorporate Molecular Descriptors and Topological Indices**  
  Utilize molecular descriptors such as **logP (hydrophobicity), molecular weight, polar surface area,** and **topological indices** like **rotatable bond count** or **chain length**. Modify the rules to relate these descriptors to the yield, facilitating the creation of a numeric feature matrix directly from SMILES.

- **Advice 5**: **Define Rules Based on Specific Substructures Using SMARTS Patterns**  
  Use **SMARTS patterns** to define rules based on specific substructures. For example, define a rule that predicts high yield when the modifier contains a **pyridine carboxylic acid moiety** with the carboxyl group directly attached to the ring (SMARTS pattern: `c1ccncc1C(=O)O`). This makes it practical to programmatically extract features.

- **Advice 6**: **Quantify Steric Hindrance Numerically**  
  Instead of qualitative statements about steric hindrance, calculate **steric parameters** or use **molecular volume** and **surface area** descriptors. These values can be derived from the 3D structure inferred from SMILES and provide numeric features correlating with steric effects on yield.

- **Advice 7**: **Group Modifiers by Functional Group Classes**  
  Categorize modifiers into classes based on functional groups (e.g., **aliphatic carboxylic acids, aromatic acids, amino acids**) and assign class labels. Modify the rules to predict yields based on these classes, which simplifies feature extraction and modeling.

- **Advice 8**: **Implement Quantitative Structure-Property Relationships (QSPR)**  
  Develop new rules based on QSPR models that correlate specific structural properties calculated from SMILES (e.g., **electronegativity, dipole moment, HOMO-LUMO gap**) with the yield. This approach transforms qualitative rules into quantitative predictions.

- **Advice 9**: **Prioritize Extractable Physicochemical Properties**  
  Focus on properties that can be directly calculated from SMILES, such as **acid dissociation constant (pKa), hydrogen bond donors and acceptors,** and **number of aromatic rings**. Adjust the rules to incorporate thresholds or ranges of these properties that predict high or low yields.

- **Advice 10**: **Simplify and Consolidate Overlapping Rules**  
  Review the current rules for overlap and redundancy. Consolidate similar rules to reduce complexity. For example, combine rules related to **electron-withdrawing groups** enhancing yield (Rules 3 and 4) into a single rule that states: "Modifiers with **strong electron-withdrawing substituents on aromatic rings** predict a high yield."

- **Advice 11**: **Express Chain Length Numerically for ω-Amino Acids**  
  Replace qualitative descriptions of chain length (e.g., "carbon chain lengths of five carbons or fewer") with the **exact number of carbon atoms** in the chain. Create a rule that uses the **chain length as a numerical feature**, allowing for more precise modeling of its effect on yield.

- **Advice 12**: **Utilize Machine Learning to Derive New Rules**  
  Consider applying machine learning algorithms to the existing dataset to identify patterns and relationships not captured by the current rules. Use feature importance rankings to inform new rules based on the most predictive molecular features extracted from SMILES.

- **Advice 13**: **Develop Rules Based on Coordination Sites Count**  
  Quantify the number of potential **coordination sites** (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen donors) in each modifier. Adjust the rules to predict higher yields with modifiers having a greater number of coordination sites, facilitating numerical representation.

- **Advice 14**: **Account for Flexibility with Torsional Descriptors**  
  For rules dealing with molecular flexibility (e.g., ether linkages leading to low yield), include **torsional angle strain** or **flexibility indices** as numerical descriptors derived from SMILES. This quantifies flexibility's impact on yield.

- **Advice 15**: **Implement Descriptor-Based Thresholds**  
  Establish numerical thresholds for descriptors within the rules. For example, set a rule that predicts high yield when the **Hammett sigma constant** of the substituent is greater than a certain value. This provides clear, quantifiable criteria for prediction.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **ω-amino acids with carbon chain lengths greater than five carbons** predict a **low yield**. Increased chain length introduces flexibility and reduces the effective chelation of metal centers. Examples are **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids containing multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**. The additional **hydroxyl groups** provide extra coordination sites, strengthening interactions with the metal centers. An example is **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid).

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **flexible ether linkages** and **terminal amino or hydroxyl groups** predict a **low yield**. The flexibility of ether linkages and terminal groups reduces the rigidity needed for effective coordination with the catalyst. Examples include **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** and **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers containing **perfluorinated alkyl chains** predict a **low yield**.

An example is **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **ortho-substituted benzoic acids with formyl or hydroxyl groups** predict a **low yield**. **Steric hindrance** and potential **intramolecular hydrogen bonding** can interfere with effective metal coordination. Examples include **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** and **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **aromatic rings capable of additional coordination** or **π-π interactions**, such as **indole** or **benzofuran** rings, predict a **high yield**. These structures can enhance binding through additional interactions with the catalyst.

  - **Rule 2** was modified to include amino acids with coordinating side chains, accommodating compounds like **tryptophan** and **4-aminobenzoic acid**, which showed high yields despite having bulky side chains.
  - **Rule 5** and **Rule 6** were refined to focus on the effects of electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups on para-substituted benzoic acids, aligning with observed yields.
  - **Rule 11** now specifically addresses perfluorinated chains due to their unique electronic effects, rather than generalizing all sulfur-containing compounds.

- **Abandoned or Modified Rules**: Some previous rules were adjusted or abandoned due to inconsistencies with the dataset or a lack of supporting evidence. For example, rules that generalized all sulfur-containing modifiers as low-yielding were revised to reflect the actual data.

These rules can be used to predict the expected yield (high or low) for any given molecular modifier based on its structural features, facilitating the optimization of the δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**
- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows for unambiguous identification of modifiers matching the structural description. It provides strong physical-chemical insight by explaining how additional carboxyl groups enhance coordination with metal centers. The complexity is appropriate, considering combinations of sub-structures (α-amino acids with additional carboxyl groups in side chains). Coverage is supported by two data points, ensuring reliability. The balance between complexity and coverage is effective.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 lacks clarity due to potential misclassification of modifiers. For instance, 4-aminobenzoic acid is not an α-amino acid but is included as an example, causing confusion. This inconsistency makes it difficult to apply the rule accurately. While the physical-chemical insight is valid, the ambiguity in defining the structural criteria reduces the rule's effectiveness. Coverage includes at least two data points, but the lack of clarity undermines its utility.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear and specific, facilitating straightforward identification of matching modifiers. The physical-chemical insight is sound, explaining how the absence of coordinating groups and steric hindrance reduce catalyst interaction. However, coverage is limited to a single data point (phenylalanine), which weakens the rule's reliability. Additional supporting data points are needed to strengthen this rule.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear and provides strong physical-chemical insight into how pyridine carboxylic acids enhance catalyst stability through chelation. The rule effectively combines sub-structures and is supported by at least two data points, ensuring reliability. The balance between complexity and coverage is well maintained.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clearly defined and makes it easy to identify matching modifiers. The physical-chemical insight is well-explained, detailing how strong electron-withdrawing groups increase carboxyl acidity and coordination ability. Coverage is supported by two data points, ensuring reliability. The balance between complexity and coverage is effective.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear and provides logical physical-chemical reasoning. However, the rule lacks accuracy due to contradictions in the dataset. For example, 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid, which contains electron-donating methoxy groups, shows a high yield, contradicting the rule's prediction. This inconsistency reduces the rule's reliability, and it may need refinement.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear and provides sound physical-chemical insight about the importance of proximity between amino and carboxyl groups for chelation. The rule effectively combines sub-structures and is supported by at least two data points. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clearly defined, with logical reasoning about the effect of chain length on chelation efficiency. The rule combines sub-structures effectively and is supported by at least two data points, ensuring reliability. The balance between complexity and coverage is adequate.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear and provides valid physical-chemical insight about the role of multiple hydroxyl groups in enhancing coordination. However, coverage is limited to a single data point (gluconic acid), reducing the rule's reliability. Additional supporting data points are necessary.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear and provides logical reasoning about how flexibility reduces effective coordination. The rule effectively combines sub-structures and is supported by at least two data points, ensuring reliable coverage. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear and offers valid physical-chemical insight regarding the impact of perfluorination on coordination ability. However, coverage is limited to a single data point, reducing the rule's reliability. Additional data points are needed to strengthen this rule.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is clear and provides logical reasoning about how steric hindrance and intramolecular hydrogen bonding interfere with coordination. The rule effectively combines sub-structures and is supported by at least two data points, ensuring reliable coverage. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clearly defined and provides sound physical-chemical insight into how aromatic rings capable of coordination enhance binding. The rule combines sub-structures effectively and is supported by at least two data points. The balance between complexity and coverage is good.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 is clear and provides physical-chemical insight about the straightforward coordination due to the simplicity of modifiers. However, coverage is limited to a single data point (octanoic acid), reducing the rule's reliability. Additional data points are necessary to support this rule.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 is clear and offers valid physical-chemical insight regarding the effect of rigidity on simultaneous coordination. However, coverage is limited to a single data point, reducing the rule's reliability. Additional supporting data points are needed to strengthen this rule.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with additional carboxyl groups in their side chains** predict a **high yield**. The extra carboxylate enhances coordination with the metal centers in the catalyst, leading to improved catalytic activity. Examples include **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid).

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains capable of additional coordination**, such as **amino**, **hydroxyl**, or **indole** groups, predict a **high yield**. These functional groups can form additional coordination bonds with the catalyst, enhancing binding affinity. Examples include **4-aminobenzoic acid** and **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan).

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with hydrophobic or bulky side chains lacking coordinating functional groups** predict a **low yield**. The absence of additional coordination sites and increased steric hindrance reduce interaction with the catalyst. An example is **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine).

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **pyridine carboxylic acids**, where the **carboxyl group is directly attached to the pyridine ring**, predict a **high yield**. The **pyridine nitrogen** and **carboxylate oxygen** can chelate the metal center, enhancing catalyst stability. Examples include **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid) and **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **para-substituted benzoic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)** predict a **high yield**. EWGs like **nitro** or **bromomethyl** groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. Examples are **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs)** predict a **low yield**. EDGs such as **methyl** or **methoxy** groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, hindering effective metal coordination. Examples include **4-methylbenzoic acid** and **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **ω-amino acids with carbon chain lengths of five carbons or fewer** predict a **high yield**. The closer proximity of the **amino** and **carboxyl** groups allows for chelation with the metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance. Examples include **5-aminopentanoic acid** and **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **ω-amino acids with carbon chain lengths greater than five carbons** predict a **low yield**. Increased chain length introduces flexibility and reduces the effective chelation of metal centers. Examples are **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids containing multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**. The additional **hydroxyl groups** provide extra coordination sites, strengthening interactions with the metal centers. An example is **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid).

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **flexible ether linkages** and **terminal amino or hydroxyl groups** predict a **low yield**. The flexibility of ether linkages and terminal groups reduces the rigidity needed for effective coordination with the catalyst. Examples include **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** and **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers containing **perfluorinated alkyl chains** predict a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms decreases the electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, reducing its coordinating ability. An example is **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **ortho-substituted benzoic acids with formyl or hydroxyl groups** predict a **low yield**. **Steric hindrance** and potential **intramolecular hydrogen bonding** can interfere with effective metal coordination. Examples include **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** and **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **aromatic rings capable of additional coordination** or **π-π interactions**, such as **indole** or **benzofuran** rings, predict a **high yield**. These structures can enhance binding through additional interactions with the catalyst. Examples include **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** and **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **linear aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups** predict a **high yield**. Their simplicity allows straightforward coordination with the metal centers. An example is **octanoic acid**.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **benzoic acids linked to pyridine rings via rigid aromatic linkers** predict a **low yield**. The rigidity hinders the ability of both functional groups to simultaneously coordinate with the catalyst. An example is **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been generated by analyzing the provided dataset and considering the underlying physicochemical properties of the molecular modifiers. The focus was on identifying functional groups and structural features that influence the yield by affecting the coordination interactions with the catalyst. The rules aim to be comprehensive yet precise, covering a broad range of the dataset while maintaining clarity and predictive power.

**Justification and Considerations:**

- **Combining Functional Groups**: The rules often combine multiple functional groups or structural features to increase specificity and predictive accuracy, as required.

- **Physicochemical Properties**: Underlying factors such as acidity, electron-withdrawing/donating effects, steric hindrance, and ability to coordinate with metal centers were considered for each rule.

- **Coverage Balance**: The rules are balanced between covering a wide range of modifiers (e.g., Rules 1, 2, 7, 8) and targeting specific features for precision (e.g., Rules 11, 12).

- **Rule Adjustments**:
  - **Rule 2** was modified to include amino acids with coordinating side chains, accommodating compounds like **tryptophan** and **4-aminobenzoic acid**, which showed high yields despite having bulky side chains.
  - **Rule 5** and **Rule 6** were refined to focus on the effects of electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups on para-substituted benzoic acids, aligning with observed yields.
  - **Rule 11** now specifically addresses perfluorinated chains due to their unique electronic effects, rather than generalizing all sulfur-containing compounds.

- **Abandoned or Modified Rules**: Some previous rules were adjusted or abandoned due to inconsistencies with the dataset or a lack of supporting evidence. For example, rules that generalized all sulfur-containing modifiers as low-yielding were revised to reflect the actual data.

These rules can be used to predict the expected yield (high or low) for any given molecular modifier based on its structural features, facilitating the optimization of the δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Rule 5** and **Rule 6** need more specific SMARTS patterns for para-substituted benzoic acids. The current pattern `'c1ccc(cc1)C(=O)O'` matches any benzoic acid and doesn't ensure substitution at the para position. Update the pattern to include a substituent at the para position relative to the carboxyl group. For example:
  - **Modified pattern for para-substituted benzoic acid**:
    ```python
    'c1ccc(cc1C(=O)O)[#6]'
    ```
    This pattern ensures there is a substituent at the para position of the benzoic acid.

- **Suggestion 2**: For **Rules 5 and 6**, ensure that the electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) or electron-donating groups (EDGs) are specifically attached at the para position. Modify the code to check for EWGs or EDGs at the para position relative to the carboxyl group. You can define separate patterns for para-EWG and para-EDG substitutions. For example:
  - **Pattern for para-substituted benzoic acid with EWG**:
    ```python
    'c1cc([C](=O)O)ccc1[EWG]'
    ```
  - **Pattern for para-substituted benzoic acid with EDG**:
    ```python
    'c1cc([C](=O)O)ccc1[EDG]'
    ```
  - Update the code to replace `[EWG]` and `[EDG]` with the specific patterns for these groups.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Rule 4**'s pattern for `'pyridine_carboxylic_acid'` (`'n1ccccc1C(=O)[O]'`) may only match carboxylic acids attached at the 2-position of pyridine. To match carboxyl groups directly attached at any position on the pyridine ring, update the pattern to:
  ```python
  '[n][c]-c(-c)-c([n])-c([C](=O)O)'
  ```
  Or use a more general pattern:
  ```python
  'n1ccccc1C(=O)O'
  ```
  This ensures that the carboxyl group is directly attached to any position on the pyridine ring.

- **Suggestion 4**: In **Rule 7** and **Rule 8**, the SMARTS patterns `[NX3H2][CH2]{2,4}[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` and `[NX3H2][CH2]{5,}[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` may not account for all ω-amino acids, especially those with branching or unsaturation. Consider using a more general pattern that captures any linear alkyl chain between the amino and carboxyl groups:
  ```python
  '[NX3H2]C{2,5}C(=O)O'
  ```
  Adjust the range `{2,5}` for Rule 7 (five carbons or fewer) and `{6,}` for Rule 8 (greater than five carbons).

- **Suggestion 5**: For **Rule 9**, ensure that the hydroxyl groups are near the carboxyl group. The current code counts all hydroxyl groups but doesn't ensure proximity to the carboxyl group. Update the pattern to check for hydroxyl groups on carbons adjacent to the carboxyl group:
  ```python
  '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CX4][OX2H1]'
  ```
  This pattern matches a carboxylic acid with a hydroxyl group on the adjacent carbon.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Rule 10** requires both flexible ether linkages and terminal amino or hydroxyl groups. The current code may match molecules with these features anywhere in the structure. Update the code to ensure that the ether linkage is part of a chain terminating with an amino or hydroxyl group. For example:
  ```python
  '[#6][OX2][#6][OX2][#6][OX2][#6][NX3H2,OX2H]'
  ```
  This pattern matches a chain with ether linkages ending with an amino or hydroxyl group.

- **Suggestion 7**: In **Rule 11**, the pattern for perfluorinated alkyl chains (`'[CX4]([F])([F])[F]'`) may not capture longer perfluorinated chains. Update the pattern to:
  ```python
  '[CX4]([F])([F])[F][CX4]([F])([F])[F]'
  ```
  Or use a recursive pattern to match perfluorinated chains of variable lengths:
  ```python
  '[CX4]([F])([F])[F][CX4]([F])([F])[F]{0,}'
  ```
  This will match molecules with longer perfluorinated chains.

- **Suggestion 8**: For **Rule 13**, verify the SMARTS patterns for the indole and benzofuran rings. Ensure they are accurately defined to match the intended structures:
  - **Indole pattern**:
    ```python
    'c1(cocc1)[nH]'
    ```
  - **Benzofuran pattern**:
    ```python
    'c1cc2ccoc2cc1'
    ```
  Review and refine these patterns to improve accuracy.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Rule 14**'s pattern for linear aliphatic carboxylic acids is too specific and only matches octanoic acid. Generalize the pattern to include linear aliphatic chains of varying lengths without additional functional groups:
  ```python
  '[CH3][CH2]{3,}[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
  ```
  This pattern matches linear alkyl chains of at least four carbons ending with a carboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 10**: Add explicit error handling and logging in the code to catch and report parsing errors or issues during substructure matching. This will help identify molecules that couldn't be processed and the reasons why.

- **Suggestion 11**: Incorporate unit tests for each rule using known examples (both positive and negative matches) to ensure the code functions as expected. This helps validate that the SMARTS patterns and matching logic correctly implement the natural language rules.

**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

---

**1. Comparison with Reference Metrics**

**a. Train Support**

- **Current Train Support:** 0.0419
- **Reference Train Support:** 0.1667 to 0.1845

*Observation:* The current train support (4.19%) is significantly lower than the reference values (16.67% to 18.45%). This indicates that the proportion of training records where both the rule conditions and predictions are true has decreased. In other words, the current set of rules applies to a smaller subset of the dataset compared to previous iterations.

**b. Train Confidence**

- **Current Train Confidence:** 0.6437
- **Reference Train Confidence:** 0.5396 to 0.6352

*Observation:* The current train confidence (64.37%) is slightly higher than the upper bound of the reference values (63.52%). This suggests that when the rule conditions are met, the likelihood of the prediction being correct has improved. The rules are more accurate for the instances they cover.

**c. Train Lift**

- **Current Train Lift:** 1.2940
- **Reference Train Lift:** 1.0559 to 1.2048

*Observation:* The current train lift (1.2940) is higher than the reference values. Lift greater than 1 indicates that the rule is effective in increasing the probability of the prediction compared to the overall dataset. An increase in lift suggests that the rules are better at identifying associations that lead to high yields.

**d. Train Leverage**

- **Current Train Leverage:** 0.0077
- **Reference Train Leverage:** -0.0041 to 0.0289

*Observation:* The current train leverage (0.0077) is positive but lower than the maximum reference value (0.0289). Positive leverage values indicate a stronger association than expected by chance, but the low value also suggests that the overall impact on the dataset is modest due to low support.

---

**2. Interpretation of Metrics**

**a. Improvement in Confidence and Lift**

- The increase in both confidence and lift demonstrates that the current rules are more precise. They are better at correctly predicting high yields when the conditions are met.
- Higher confidence means that the rules are more reliable for the covered instances.
- Increased lift indicates that the rules provide more significant insights over random chance.

**b. Decrease in Support**

- The reduction in support implies that the rules are applicable to fewer cases in the dataset.
- While the rules are more accurate for specific cases, they may not generalize well or cover all relevant instances.
- Low support may also affect the statistical significance of the rules.

**c. Balance Between Metrics**

- There is a trade-off between support and confidence/lift. Increasing one often leads to a decrease in the others.
- The goal is to find a balance where the rules have sufficient support to be useful while maintaining high confidence and lift.

---

**3. Assessment of Local Minimum and Iterations**

**a. Potential Local Minimum**

- Given the improvements in confidence and lift but the decrease in support, it's possible that the current rules have reached a local minimum in terms of optimization.
- Focusing too much on improving confidence and lift may have led to overfitting, where the rules are too tailored to specific instances.
- The current set of rules might have maximized confidence and lift given their specificity, but at the cost of applicability.

**b. Adequacy of Iterations**

- The iterative process has led to improvements in certain metrics while others have declined.
- This suggests that more iterations are needed to find a better balance.
- Exploring alternative rule structures or additional data may help in further optimizing the metrics.

---

**4. Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

**a. Increase Rule Support**

- **Broaden Rule Conditions:**
  - Review rules that are highly specific and consider generalizing conditions to cover more instances.
  - Example: Adjust chain length parameters in Rules 7 and 8 to include more amino acids.

- **Combine Similar Rules:**
  - Merge rules with overlapping features to create more comprehensive rules.
  - Example: Combine Rules 1 and 2 to cover amino acids with additional coordinating groups.

**b. Maintain High Confidence and Lift**

- **Retain Key Predictive Features:**
  - Identify the functional groups and structural features that contribute most to high confidence and lift.
  - Ensure that when broadening rules, these key features are retained.

- **Use Weighted Features:**
  - Assign weights to different functional groups based on their impact on yield.
  - This can help in prioritizing more influential features in rule formation.

**c. Address Low Support**

- **Include Additional Data:**
  - Incorporate more data points to increase the overall support.
  - This may involve expanding the dataset with similar reactions or modifiers.

- **Adjust Thresholds:**
  - Re-evaluate the thresholds used to categorize yields as 'high' or 'low'.
  - A slight adjustment might increase the number of instances that fit the rule conditions.

**d. Evaluate Rule Redundancy**

- **Eliminate Overlapping Rules:**
  - Remove rules that do not significantly contribute to improving the metrics.
  - Focus on rules that provide unique insights.

- **Simplify Complex Rules:**
  - Simplify rules with multiple conditions that may be too restrictive.
  - This can help in increasing support without heavily impacting confidence.

**e. Reassess Rule Justifications**

- **Physicochemical Considerations:**
  - Re-examine the underlying chemical principles of each rule.
  - Ensure that the rules are chemically sound and not just statistically derived.

- **Incorporate Additional Properties:**
  - Consider other properties such as solubility, steric factors, and electronic effects that may influence yield.
  - Including these may help in capturing more instances.

**f. Cross-Validation and Testing**

- **Validate Rules on Test Data:**
  - Apply the rules to unseen test data to assess their generalizability.
  - This can help in identifying overfitting and adjusting rules accordingly.

- **Statistical Significance Testing:**
  - Perform statistical tests to confirm that the observed associations are significant.
  - This will provide confidence in the reliability of the rules.

---

**5. Specific Rule Improvement Suggestions**

**a. Reevaluate Rule Specificity**

- **Rule 11 (Perfluorinated Chains):**
  - Consider whether perfluorination alone is the determining factor for low yield or if other factors are involved.
  - Expand the rule to include other strong electron-withdrawing groups if applicable.

- **Rule 15 (Rigid Linkers):**
  - Investigate if exceptions exist where rigidity does not lead to low yield.
  - Modify the rule to account for such cases or include additional conditions.

**b. Address Contradictory Cases**

- **Rule Overlaps:**
  - Identify modifiers that may fit multiple rules with conflicting predictions.
  - Clarify the dominant factors that determine the yield outcome.

- **Exceptions and Outliers:**
  - Analyze instances where the rules do not correctly predict the yield.
  - Understand the reasons behind these exceptions and adjust the rules accordingly.

**c. Enhance Rule Justifications**

- **Chemical Rationale:**
  - Strengthen the chemical explanations provided for each rule.
  - Ensure that the rules are not only statistically valid but also chemically plausible.

- **Empirical Evidence:**
  - If possible, support the rules with empirical data or literature references.
  - This adds credibility and may reveal additional insights.

---

**Conclusion**

The current iteration of rules shows an improvement in the precision of predictions, as evidenced by higher confidence and lift values. However, the decrease in support indicates that the rules apply to a smaller subset of the dataset, potentially limiting their practical utility.

To enhance the performance of the rules:

- **Aim to Increase Support:** Broaden the applicability of the rules to cover more data instances without significantly compromising confidence and lift.
- **Balance Metrics:** Seek a balance between support, confidence, and lift to create robust and generalizable rules.
- **Iterate Further:** Continue refining the rules, considering both statistical metrics and chemical plausibility.
- **Evaluate Generalizability:** Test the rules on new data to ensure they perform well beyond the initial dataset.

By addressing these areas, the rules can be improved to better predict catalytic yields and provide more valuable insights for the research program.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Traditional Commenter Message:
**Performance Analysis of Current Rules**

**1. Evaluation of Effectiveness**

The latest 5-fold cross-validation accuracy is **60%**, which is a decrease from the previous validation accuracies, which hovered around **76%** with test accuracies of **62.5% to 75%**. This decline suggests that the current set of rules may not be as effective in predicting the catalyst's performance as previous iterations.

**2. Comparison with Reference Metrics**

- **Previous Accuracy**: Validation accuracies were consistently around **76%**, indicating a relatively strong predictive capacity.
- **Current Accuracy**: The accuracy has dropped to **60%**, a significant decrease of **16 percentage points** from the previous benchmarks.

This comparison indicates that the current rules may not be capturing the key features necessary for accurate predictions or may have introduced inconsistencies leading to reduced performance.

**3. Overfitting and Underfitting Assessment**

- **Underfitting**: The decrease in accuracy suggests that the model might be underfitting. The rules may be too generalized, failing to capture the complexities of the data.
- **Overfitting**: There is no immediate evidence of overfitting since the validation accuracy is low; overfitting typically manifests as high training accuracy and low validation accuracy. However, without the training set accuracy, a definitive conclusion cannot be made.

**4. SHAP Analysis and Discrepancy Identification**

Analyzing the SHAP values reveals specific rules contributing to incorrect predictions:

- **Underestimated Loadings** (Predicted Low, Experimental High):

  - **Rule 6**: Frequently has high negative SHAP values in molecules where the actual loading is high but predicted as low.
    - Example: *C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O* shows a **Rule 6 SHAP value of -0.1415**, indicating that Rule 6 strongly influences the prediction towards a low loading, contrary to experimental results.
  - **Rule 9**: Occasionally contributes negative SHAP values in underestimated cases.
  - **Rule 13**: Contributes negative SHAP values in some instances.

- **Overestimated Loadings** (Predicted High, Experimental Low):

  - **Rule 1**: Has high positive SHAP values contributing to overestimations.
    - Example: *C(CCCC(=O)O)CCCN* shows a **Rule 1 SHAP value of -0.0117**, but overall contributes to high loading predictions when not applicable.
  - **Rule 2**: Positive SHAP values in overestimated instances.
  - **Rule 7**: Positive SHAP values leading to overestimations in certain cases.

**5. Interpretation of Accuracy Metrics**

The decrease in accuracy suggests that the current rules may not have the desired predictive power and might require refinement. The lower accuracy indicates room for improvement and suggests that some rules may be misclassifying specific types of modifiers.

**6. Insights from SHAP Analysis**

- **Rule Impact**:
  - **Rule 6**: Often negatively impacts predictions when the experimental loading is high, suggesting that the rule may be too broadly penalizing certain molecules.
  - **Rule 1 and Rule 2**: May be overemphasizing certain features, leading to overprediction of high loading.

- **Molecule-Specific Analysis**:
  - Molecules with **aromatic carboxylic acids** and **halogen substituents** are being misclassified, potentially due to **Rule 6** misapplication.
  - Molecules with **multiple coordinating groups** are not being correctly predicted due to potential overlaps or conflicts between **Rule 1**, **Rule 2**, and **Rule 6**.

---

**Recommendations for Improvement**

**1. Refinement of Problematic Rules**

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs)** predict a **low yield**.

  **Issues Identified**:
  - The rule is too general and may capture molecules where EDGs do not significantly hinder catalyst performance.
  - High negative SHAP values in cases where experimental loading is high suggest over-penalization.

  **Suggested Refinements**:
  - **Specify the Type of EDGs**: Limit the rule to strong EDGs like **methoxy** and **alkyl amino** groups.
  - **Consider Steric Effects**: Incorporate steric hindrance into the rule, focusing on bulky substituents.
  - **Exclude Weak EDGs**: Weak EDGs like **methyl** groups might not significantly affect coordination; consider removing them from this rule.

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with additional carboxyl groups in their side chains** predict a **high yield**.

  **Issues Identified**:
  - High positive SHAP values in overestimated loadings indicate that the rule may be too broadly applied.
  - Molecules without the necessary spatial arrangement might be incorrectly predicted as high yield.

  **Suggested Refinements**:
  - **Emphasize Spatial Arrangement**: Modify the rule to require that the additional carboxyl groups are in positions that facilitate chelation.
  - **Include Steric Considerations**: Exclude α-amino acids with bulky side chains that could hinder coordination.
  - **Add Exceptions**: Specify exceptions for amino acids that have been experimentally shown to produce low yields despite meeting the criteria.

**2. Adjustments to Underestimated Rules**

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids containing multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**.

  **Issues Identified**:
  - Negative SHAP values in underestimated cases suggest that the rule may not be adequately capturing the positive effects of multiple hydroxyl groups.

  **Suggested Refinements**:
  - **Clarify Proximity**: Define "near" more precisely, perhaps specifying diols or triols adjacent to the carboxyl group.
  - **Incorporate Hydrogen Bonding**: Consider the potential for intramolecular hydrogen bonding to affect coordination.
  - **Adjust for Steric Hindrance**: Recognize that too many hydroxyl groups may introduce steric hindrance, reducing effectiveness.

**3. Improving Generalization**

- **Avoid Overlapping Rules**: Ensure that rules do not conflict. For instance, a molecule might fall under both Rule 6 and Rule 9, leading to contradictory predictions.

- **Balance Specificity and Generality**:
  - **Increase Specificity**: Refine rules to be more precise, reducing misclassifications due to overgeneralization.
  - **Enhance Generality**: For rules that are too narrow, consider broadening them to include more relevant molecules.

**4. Utilizing SHAP Insights**

- **Rule Prioritization**: Assign weights to rules based on their SHAP values and observed accuracies to prioritize their influence appropriately.

- **Iterative Testing**: After refining rules, perform iterative testing to evaluate the impact on accuracy and SHAP value distributions.

- **Case-by-Case Analysis**: Examine molecules with high discrepancies individually to understand specific failures and adjust rules accordingly.

**5. Additional Rule Refinements**

- **Rule 2 Adjustments**:

  **Issues Identified**:
  - May contribute to overestimations due to broad inclusion of modifiers with coordinating side chains.

  **Suggestions**:
  - **Specify Side Chains**: Limit to side chains that have proven coordination benefits without steric hindrance.
  - **Exclude Bulky Groups**: Remove bulky side chains that may prevent effective coordination.

- **Rule 7 and Rule 8**:

  **Issues Identified**:
  - The chain length cutoff may not accurately predict yield in all cases.

  **Suggestions**:
  - **Reevaluate Chain Length Impact**: Consider a gradual impact of chain length rather than a strict cutoff.
  - **Include Functional Group Density**: Adjust rules to account for the density of coordinating groups along the chain.

**6. Incorporate Additional Considerations**

- **Electronic Effects**: Besides steric factors, consider the electronic effects of substituents on coordination ability.

- **Intramolecular Interactions**: Address potential intramolecular interactions that may affect the availability of coordinating groups.

---

**Conclusion**

By refining the current rules based on the insights from the SHAP analysis and performance metrics, we can improve the predictive accuracy of the model. Emphasis should be placed on adjusting rules that contribute to misclassifications, ensuring that each rule accurately reflects the underlying chemistry influencing catalyst performance. Iterative refinement and validation will be essential to achieve a set of rules that generalize well across the dataset.

- **Train Confidence**: 64.37% (0.6437)
- **Train Lift**: 1.2940
- **Validation Accuracy**: 60%

Compared to previous iterations, the current rules show higher confidence and lift but significantly lower support and validation accuracy. The validation accuracy decreased from around 76% to 60%, indicating reduced predictive performance.

**2. Key Issues Identified**

- **Low Support and Accuracy**: Decreased support and validation accuracy suggest that the rules are too specific and do not generalize well across the dataset.

- **SHAP Analysis Findings**:
  - **Rule 6**: Contributes negatively in cases where experimental yield is high, indicating potential over-penalization.
  - **Rule 1 and Rule 2**: Sometimes overestimate yield due to broad application.

- **Potential Overfitting**: The increase in confidence and lift with decreased support may indicate that the rules are over-specialized to specific instances, leading to overfitting.

**3. Suggestions to Improve Current Rules**

**a. Refine SMARTS Patterns for Specificity**

- **Rule 5 and Rule 6 (Para-Substituted Benzoic Acids)**:
  - Update the SMARTS patterns to ensure substitutions are at the para position relative to the carboxyl group.
  - **Suggested Pattern Modification**:
    - For para-substituted benzoic acid with EWG:
      ```python
      'c1cc(ccc1C(=O)O)[EWG]'
      ```
    - For para-substituted benzoic acid with EDG:
      ```python
      'c1cc(ccc1C(=O)O)[EDG]'
      ```
  - Define specific patterns for EWGs and EDGs to improve accuracy.

**b. Address Rule Overlaps and Conflicts**

- Ensure rules do not have conflicting predictions for the same modifier. For example, a molecule fitting both Rule 6 and Rule 9 should be carefully evaluated to determine the dominant effect.

**c. Adjust Rule Conditions for Better Coverage**

  - Incorporate steric hindrance considerations to exclude bulky side chains that may hinder coordination.
  - Emphasize the spatial arrangement conducive to chelation.

- **Rule 9 (Hydroxyl Groups Near Carboxyl Group)**:
  - Ensure the pattern captures hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group.
  - **Suggested Pattern**:
    ```python
    '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CX4][OX2H1]'
    ```

**e. Update Rules Based on SHAP Insights**

- **Rule 6 Adjustments**:
  - Limit to strong EDGs that significantly affect coordination.
  - Exclude modifiers where EDGs do not hinder catalytic performance.

- **Rule 9 Adjustments**:
  - Refine to account for the exact positions and number of hydroxyl groups.
  - Consider potential steric hindrance from excessive hydroxyl groups.

**f. Incorporate Additional Chemical Considerations**

- **Electronic Effects**: Include considerations of how substituents affect electron density and metal coordination ability.

- **Steric Factors**: Account for the size and shape of substituents that may impede effective coordination.

- **Rule 14 (Linear Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids)**:
  - Generalize the pattern to include carboxylic acids with varying chain lengths.
  - **Suggested Pattern**:
    ```python
    '[CH3][CH2]{3,}[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
    ```

**4. Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

There is significant potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. By refining the SMARTS patterns, addressing rule overlaps, and incorporating additional chemical considerations, the rules can be made more generalizable and accurate. Balancing specificity with coverage will enhance predictive performance while avoiding overfitting.

**Conclusion**

Given the identified issues and the potential improvements outlined, further optimization of the current rules is both possible and necessary to improve accuracy and applicability.

    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with additional carboxyl groups in their side chains** predict a **high yield**. The extra carboxylate enhances coordination with the metal centers in the catalyst, leading to improved catalytic activity. Examples include **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid).

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains capable of additional coordination**, such as **amino**, **hydroxyl**, or **indole** groups, predict a **high yield**. These functional groups can form additional coordination bonds with the catalyst, enhancing binding affinity. Examples include **4-aminobenzoic acid** and **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan).

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with hydrophobic or bulky side chains lacking coordinating functional groups** predict a **low yield**. The absence of additional coordination sites and increased steric hindrance reduce interaction with the catalyst. An example is **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine).

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **pyridine carboxylic acids**, where the **carboxyl group is directly attached to the pyridine ring**, predict a **high yield**. The **pyridine nitrogen** and **carboxylate oxygen** can chelate the metal center, enhancing catalyst stability. Examples include **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid) and **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **para-substituted benzoic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)** predict a **high yield**. EWGs like **nitro** or **bromomethyl** groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. Examples are **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs)** predict a **low yield**. EDGs such as **methyl** or **methoxy** groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, hindering effective metal coordination. Examples include **4-methylbenzoic acid** and **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **ω-amino acids with carbon chain lengths of five carbons or fewer** predict a **high yield**. The closer proximity of the **amino** and **carboxyl** groups allows for chelation with the metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance. Examples include **5-aminopentanoic acid** and **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **ω-amino acids with carbon chain lengths greater than five carbons** predict a **low yield**. Increased chain length introduces flexibility and reduces the effective chelation of metal centers. Examples are **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids containing multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**. The additional **hydroxyl groups** provide extra coordination sites, strengthening interactions with the metal centers. An example is **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid).

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **flexible ether linkages** and **terminal amino or hydroxyl groups** predict a **low yield**. The flexibility of ether linkages and terminal groups reduces the rigidity needed for effective coordination with the catalyst. Examples include **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** and **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers containing **perfluorinated alkyl chains** predict a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms decreases the electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, reducing its coordinating ability. An example is **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **ortho-substituted benzoic acids with formyl or hydroxyl groups** predict a **low yield**. **Steric hindrance** and potential **intramolecular hydrogen bonding** can interfere with effective metal coordination. Examples include **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** and **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **aromatic rings capable of additional coordination** or **π-π interactions**, such as **indole** or **benzofuran** rings, predict a **high yield**. These structures can enhance binding through additional interactions with the catalyst. Examples include **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** and **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **linear aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups** predict a **high yield**. Their simplicity allows straightforward coordination with the metal centers. An example is **octanoic acid**.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **benzoic acids linked to pyridine rings via rigid aromatic linkers** predict a **low yield**. The rigidity hinders the ability of both functional groups to simultaneously coordinate with the catalyst. An example is **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been generated by analyzing the provided dataset and considering the underlying physicochemical properties of the molecular modifiers. The focus was on identifying functional groups and structural features that influence the yield by affecting the coordination interactions with the catalyst. The rules aim to be comprehensive yet precise, covering a broad range of the dataset while maintaining clarity and predictive power.

**Justification and Considerations:**

- **Combining Functional Groups**: The rules often combine multiple functional groups or structural features to increase specificity and predictive accuracy, as required.

- **Physicochemical Properties**: Underlying factors such as acidity, electron-withdrawing/donating effects, steric hindrance, and ability to coordinate with metal centers were considered for each rule.

- **Coverage Balance**: The rules are balanced between covering a wide range of modifiers (e.g., Rules 1, 2, 7, 8) and targeting specific features for precision (e.g., Rules 11, 12).

- **Rule Adjustments**:
  - **Rule 2** was modified to include amino acids with coordinating side chains, accommodating compounds like **tryptophan** and **4-aminobenzoic acid**, which showed high yields despite having bulky side chains.
  - **Rule 5** and **Rule 6** were refined to focus on the effects of electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups on para-substituted benzoic acids, aligning with observed yields.
  - **Rule 11** now specifically addresses perfluorinated chains due to their unique electronic effects, rather than generalizing all sulfur-containing compounds.

- **Abandoned or Modified Rules**: Some previous rules were adjusted or abandoned due to inconsistencies with the dataset or a lack of supporting evidence. For example, rules that generalized all sulfur-containing modifiers as low-yielding were revised to reflect the actual data.

These rules can be used to predict the expected yield (high or low) for any given molecular modifier based on its structural features, facilitating the optimization of the δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Refine the SMARTS patterns for Rules 5 and 6 to ensure para substitutions are accurately captured.**

  Update the SMARTS patterns for para-substituted benzoic acids to explicitly specify the substitution at the para position relative to the carboxyl group. For example:

  - For **Rule 5** (predicting high yield with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)):

    ```smarts
    [cH]1[cH][cH][c]([cH][cH]1C(=O)O)[$(N(=O)=O),Cl,Br,I,F,C#N]
    ```

  - For **Rule 6** (predicting low yield with electron-donating groups (EDGs)):

    ```smarts
    [cH]1[cH][cH][c]([cH][cH]1C(=O)O)[$(OC),$(OCC),CH3,NH2]
    ```

  This ensures that only modifiers with substitutions at the para position are matched, improving specificity and accuracy.

- **Advice 2**: **Define specific lists of EWGs and EDGs for Rules 5 and 6 to enhance precision.**

  Compile comprehensive lists of common electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, cyano, halogens) and electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy, amino) and incorporate them into the SMARTS patterns. This will accurately categorize modifiers based on their electronic effects.

- **Advice 3**: **Modify Rules 1 and 2 to exclude bulky side chains and focus on coordinating groups.**

  Adjust the SMARTS patterns to incorporate steric considerations by excluding α-amino acids with bulky side chains that may hinder metal coordination. For example:

  - For **Rule 1** (α-amino acids with additional carboxyl groups predicting high yield):

    ```smarts
    [NX3][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[O])[CX4][CX3](=O)[O]
    ```

    Ensure side chains are limited to small carboxyl-containing groups.

  - For **Rule 2** (α-amino acids with side chains capable of coordination):

    ```smarts
    [NX3][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[O])[CX4][$(O),$(N),$(c1ccncc1),$(c1ccccc1)]
    ```

    Exclude bulky aromatic side chains unless they have specific coordinating capabilities.

- **Advice 4**: **Refine Rule 9 to specify the exact positions and number of hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group.**

  Update the SMARTS pattern to match carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl carbon:

  ```smarts
  [CX3](=O)[OX2H][CX4]([OX2H])[CX4]([OX2H])[CX4]([OX2H])[CX4]([OX2H])[OX2H]
  ```

  This captures modifiers like gluconic acid, ensuring precise matching.

- **Advice 5**: **Generalize the SMARTS pattern in Rule 4 to include carboxyl groups attached at any position on the pyridine ring.**

  Modify the pattern to:

  ```smarts
  c1ccncc1C(=O)O
  ```

  This ensures all pyridine carboxylic acids are included, regardless of the position of the carboxyl group.

- **Advice 6**: **Update Rules 7 and 8 to accommodate chain branching and unsaturation in ω-amino acids.**

  Expand the SMARTS patterns to include ω-amino acids with various chain lengths and structures:

  - For **Rule 7** (predicting high yield with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer):

    ```smarts
    [NX3][CX4]([CX3](=O)[O])[CH2]{1,3}[CH2][CX3](=O)[O]
    ```

  - For **Rule 8** (predicting low yield with chain lengths greater than five carbons):

    ```smarts
    [NX3][CX4]([CX3](=O)[O])[CH2]{4,}[CX3](=O)[O]
    ```

- **Advice 7**: **Address rule overlaps and conflicts by prioritizing rules and adding specificity.**

  Implement a hierarchy where rules are applied in a specific order of precedence. For example:

  1. Apply Rules 1 and 2 first for α-amino acids.
  2. Then apply Rules 5 and 6 for para-substituted benzoic acids.
  3. Resolve conflicts by specifying conditions within rules to exclude modifiers covered by higher-priority rules.

- **Advice 8**: **Incorporate electronic effects and steric factors into the rules for better accuracy.**

  Adjust rules to consider how substituents influence electron density on coordinating atoms. For example, enhance Rule 11 to specify that perfluorinated chains decrease yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects reducing coordination ability.

- **Advice 9**: **Expand Rule 14 to increase support by generalizing the pattern for linear aliphatic carboxylic acids.**

  Modify the pattern to include a range of chain lengths:

  ```smarts
  [CH3][CH2]{2,6}[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]
  ```

  This captures linear aliphatic acids from butanoic to octanoic acid.

- **Advice 10**: **Limit Rule 6 to strong EDGs based on SHAP analysis to prevent over-penalization.**

  Adjust Rule 6 to focus on modifiers with very strong electron-donating groups:

  ```smarts
  [cH]1[cH][cH][c]([cH][cH]1C(=O)O)[NH2,NHR,NR2]
  ```

  This reduces false predictions of low yield for modifiers with moderate EDGs.

- **Advice 11**: **Strengthen the chemical justifications for each rule to ensure they are grounded in sound principles.**

  Provide detailed explanations of how each structural feature affects the yield through coordination ability, electronic effects, and steric hindrance. This will improve the robustness and credibility of the rules.

** End of Advice **
---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Generator Message:
After analyzing the dataset and considering the underlying physicochemical properties of the molecular modifiers, I have generated a set of rules that describe the relationship between the modifiers' structural features and the relative high or low yield of the reaction. These rules combine multiple functional groups and structural features to enhance predictive accuracy.

---

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxyl groups** predict a **high yield**. The presence of multiple carboxyl groups enhances coordination with metal centers in the catalyst, improving catalytic activity. Examples include **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid).

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **ω-amino acids with carbon chain lengths of five carbons or fewer** predict a **high yield**. The proximity of the amino and carboxyl groups allows for effective chelation with the metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance. Examples include **5-aminopentanoic acid** and **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **pyridine carboxylic acids** with the **carboxyl group directly attached to the pyridine ring** predict a **high yield**. The pyridine nitrogen and carboxylate oxygen can coordinate simultaneously with the metal center, enhancing catalyst stability. Examples include **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid) and **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **para-substituted benzoic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)** predict a **high yield**. EWGs like **nitro** or **bromomethyl** groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. Examples are **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains capable of additional coordination through functional groups like **hydroxyl** or **indole** rings predict a **high yield**. These functional groups can form additional coordination bonds with the catalyst, enhancing binding affinity. Examples include **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan) and **(2S)-2-amino-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (tyrosine).

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **linear aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups** predict a **high yield**. Their simplicity allows straightforward coordination with the metal centers. An example is **octanoic acid**.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **para-substituted benzoic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs)** predict a **low yield**. EDGs such as **methyl** or **methoxy** groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, hindering effective metal coordination. Examples include **4-methylbenzoic acid** and **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **ω-amino acids with carbon chain lengths greater than five carbons** predict a **low yield**. Increased chain length introduces flexibility and reduces effective chelation of metal centers. Examples are **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **perfluorinated alkyl chains** predict a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms decreases the electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, reducing its coordinating ability. An example is **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **benzoic acids with ortho-substituents capable of intramolecular interactions** (such as **formyl** or **hydroxyl** groups) predict a **low yield**. Steric hindrance and potential intramolecular hydrogen bonding can interfere with effective metal coordination. Examples include **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** and **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with **flexible ether linkages** and **terminal amino or hydroxyl groups** predict a **low yield**. The flexibility of ether linkages reduces the rigidity needed for effective coordination with the catalyst. Examples include **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with hydrophobic or bulky side chains lacking coordinating functional groups** predict a **low yield**. The absence of additional coordination sites and increased steric hindrance reduce interaction with the catalyst. An example is **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine).

**End of Rules**

---

**Justification and Considerations:**

- **Combining Functional Groups and Structural Features**: The rules combine multiple functional groups, such as amino, carboxyl, hydroxyl, and indole rings, along with structural features like chain length and substitution patterns, to improve the specificity and predictive accuracy.

- **Physicochemical Properties**: Key factors considered include acidity, electron-withdrawing/donating effects, steric hindrance, chain length, flexibility, and the ability of functional groups to coordinate with metal centers.

- **Rule Adjustments and Simplifications**:
  - **Rule Consolidation**: Similar rules were combined to streamline the rule set without compromising coverage. For instance, rules concerning electron-withdrawing groups on benzoic acids were consolidated.
  - **Focus on Effective Coordination**: Emphasis was placed on modifiers that can effectively coordinate with the metal centers through chelation or additional coordination sites, as this interaction is critical for high yields.
  - **Elimination of Redundant Rules**: Redundant or overly specific rules were removed to maintain clarity and ensure a balanced set of rules with both broad coverage and necessary specificity.

- **Coverage Balance**: The revised rules aim to cover a broad range of the dataset while providing detailed predictions based on specific structural features. This balance ensures practical applicability for predicting the yield of other molecular modifiers not included in the dataset.

These rules can be utilized to predict whether a molecular modifier will result in a high or low yield in the δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction based on its structural characteristics. By understanding the relationship between functional groups and catalytic activity, these guidelines can assist in the design and selection of effective modifiers for optimizing reaction yields.

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify the Rules for Quantifiable Features**  
  Modify the existing rules to focus on single, quantifiable molecular features that can be directly extracted from SMILES strings. This includes counts of specific functional groups (e.g., number of carboxyl groups, amino groups), presence or absence of rings, chain lengths, and types of substituents. Simplifying the rules in this way will make it easier to generate a numeric feature matrix.

- **Advice 2**: **Develop Rules Based on Calculable Molecular Descriptors**  
  Incorporate molecular descriptors that can be calculated from SMILES strings using cheminformatics tools. Examples include molecular weight, LogP (octanol-water partition coefficient), topological polar surface area (TPSA), number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, and rotatable bond counts. By basing rules on these descriptors, you can create a numeric feature matrix suitable for statistical analysis or machine learning models.

- **Advice 3**: **Use SMARTS Patterns for Functional Group Identification**  
  Implement SMARTS (SMiles ARbitrary Target Specification) patterns to identify specific substructures within the SMILES strings. This allows for precise detection of functional groups and structural motifs, making the rules computationally accessible and facilitating automated feature extraction.

- **Advice 4**: **Create Binary Features for Key Functional Groups**  
  Generate a set of binary (0 or 1) features indicating the presence or absence of key functional groups or substructures identified in the dataset. Examples include indicators for carboxyl groups, amino groups, hydroxyl groups, pyridine rings, electron-withdrawing or donating substituents, and chain length categories. These features can be directly used in a numeric feature matrix.

- **Advice 5**: **Formulate New Simplified Rules Based on Data Analysis**  
  Analyze the dataset to identify the most significant features correlating with high or low yields and create new rules accordingly. For example:

  - **New Rule 1**: Modifiers with **two or more carboxyl groups** tend to result in **high yields**. This can be quantified by counting the number of carboxyl groups in the molecule.
  - **New Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with a total carbon chain length of five or fewer carbons** predict a **high yield**. The carbon chain length can be calculated from the SMILES string.
  - **New Rule 3**: Modifiers containing **strong electron-withdrawing groups** (e.g., nitro or halogens) on an aromatic ring predict a **high yield**. Detecting these substituents can be achieved using SMARTS patterns.
  - **New Rule 4**: Modifiers with **alkyl chain lengths greater than six carbons** without additional polar functional groups predict a **low yield**. Chain length and functional group presence can be quantified from the SMILES.
  - **New Rule 5**: Modifiers containing **perfluorinated alkyl chains** predict a **low yield**. The presence of perfluorinated chains can be identified using SMARTS patterns.

- **Advice 6**: **Quantify Steric and Electronic Effects Numerically**  
  Assign numerical values to steric hindrance and electronic effects based on substituent constants (e.g., Taft or Hammett constants) where applicable. This allows inclusion of these effects in the numeric feature matrix and improves the quantification of factors influencing yield.

- **Advice 7**: **Avoid Overly Complex Combinatorial Rules**  
  Reduce reliance on rules that combine multiple structural features in complex ways, as these are difficult to represent numerically. Instead, focus on individual features that have a significant impact on yield, making the rules easier to apply and the features easier to extract.

- **Advice 8**: **Incorporate Hydrogen Bonding Capacity**  
  Include descriptors for hydrogen bond donors and acceptors in the rules, as they can influence metal coordination and catalytic activity. These counts can be calculated from the SMILES strings and added to the feature matrix.

- **Advice 9**: **Categorize Modifiers Based on Structural Classes**  
  Group modifiers into structural classes (e.g., aliphatic acids, aromatic acids, amino acids) and create rules based on these categories. This classification can be represented numerically using dummy variables in the feature matrix.

- **Advice 10**: **Re-Analyze the Dataset with Statistical Methods**  
  Use statistical techniques, such as correlation analysis or feature importance from machine learning models, to determine which features are most predictive of yield. Refine the rules to focus on these key features, ensuring they are both practical and data-driven.

Rule Generator Message:
After carefully analyzing the dataset and considering the underlying physicochemical properties of the molecular modifiers, I have generated a set of rules that describe the relationship between the modifiers' structural features and the relative high or low yield of the reaction. These rules combine multiple functional groups and structural features to enhance predictive accuracy.

---

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino dicarboxylic acids** predict a **high yield**. The presence of two carboxyl groups allows for bidentate coordination with metal centers in the catalyst, enhancing catalytic activity. Examples include **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid).

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **ω-amino acids with carbon chain lengths of 3 to 5 carbons** predict a **high yield**. The optimal chain length allows the amino and carboxyl groups to effectively chelate the metal center in the catalyst. Examples include **5-aminopentanoic acid** and **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **pyridine carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the pyridine ring** predict a **high yield**. The pyridine nitrogen and carboxylate oxygen can coordinate simultaneously with the metal center, enhancing catalyst stability. Examples include **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid) and **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **para-substituted benzoic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)** predict a **high yield**. EWGs like **nitro** or **bromomethyl** groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. Examples are **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **linear saturated aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 6 to 8 carbons and without additional polar functional groups** predict a **high yield**. Their hydrophobic nature and optimal chain length allow effective interaction with the catalyst. An example is **octanoic acid**.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains capable of coordination through functional groups like indole rings** predict a **high yield**. These additional coordination sites enhance binding affinity to the metal center. An example is **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan).

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **ω-amino acids with carbon chain lengths greater than 6 carbons** predict a **low yield**. Increased chain length introduces flexibility, reducing effective chelation of metal centers. Examples are **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with ortho-substituents capable of intramolecular hydrogen bonding** (such as **hydroxyl** or **formyl** groups) predict a **low yield**. Intramolecular interactions can interfere with metal coordination. Examples include **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **benzoic acids para-substituted with electron-donating groups (EDGs) lacking coordination ability** predict a **low yield**. EDGs like **methyl** or **methoxy** groups decrease the acidity of the carboxyl group, hindering effective metal coordination. Examples include **4-methylbenzoic acid** and **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing **flexible ether linkages with terminal polar groups** predict a **low yield**. The flexibility of ether linkages reduces the rigidity needed for effective coordination with the catalyst. Examples include **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with **perfluorinated alkyl chains** predict a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms decreases electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, reducing its coordinating ability. An example is **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with hydrophobic side chains lacking coordinating functional groups** predict a **low yield**. The absence of additional coordination sites reduces interaction with the catalyst. An example is **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine).

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **benzoic acids substituted with groups capable of coordination** (such as **amino** or **pyridyl** groups) predict a **high yield**. These groups enhance binding to the metal center. Examples include **4-aminobenzoic acid** and **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups at the ω-position** predict a **low yield**. Terminal hydroxyl groups increase polarity and flexibility, hindering effective coordination. An example is **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aromatic acids with fused ring systems capable of additional π-π interactions** predict a **high yield**. The extended conjugation can enhance interaction with the catalyst. An example is **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**.

**End of Rules**

**Justification and Considerations:**

- **Combining Functional Groups and Structural Features**: Each rule integrates multiple functional groups (e.g., amino, carboxyl, indole rings, ether linkages) and structural features (e.g., chain length, substitution patterns) to improve specificity and predictive accuracy.

- **Physicochemical Properties**: The rules consider key properties such as coordination ability, electron-withdrawing/donating effects, steric hindrance, chain length, flexibility, and potential for intramolecular interactions, which influence the modifiers' effectiveness in the reaction.

- **Prediction Clarity**: Each rule clearly states whether modifiers fitting its description are predicted to result in a high or low yield, facilitating straightforward application to new structures.

- **Dataset Coverage**: The rules are designed to cover a broad range of the dataset, balancing between simple rules with high coverage (e.g., Rules 1 and 2) and more complex rules with lower coverage (e.g., Rules 14 and 15), as per the requirements.

- **Adjustments and Improvements**:
  - **Refinement of Rules**: Rules have been refined to account for exceptions and improve accuracy. For instance, Rule 9 distinguishes between electron-donating groups that cannot coordinate and those that can, explaining why **4-aminobenzoic acid** (which can coordinate) predicts a high yield.
  - **Elimination of Redundancies**: Overlapping or redundant rules have been consolidated to streamline the rule set without compromising coverage.
  - **Balance Between Coverage and Specificity**: The rules strike a balance between covering more compounds in the dataset and providing specific guidelines based on functional group combinations and physicochemical properties.

These rules provide a comprehensive guide for predicting whether a molecular modifier will result in a high or low yield in the δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By understanding the relationship between structural features and catalytic activity, these guidelines can assist in the design and selection of effective modifiers to optimize reaction yields.

  - **Adjustment**: Use this data to justify the predictions made by the rules and to refine them where discrepancies are found.

- **Advice 9**: **Incorporate Feedback from Experimental Results**

  Use inconsistencies between predicted and actual yields to refine the rules.

  - **Action**: Examine cases where the predicted yield does not match the experimental result to identify underlying reasons.
  - **Adjustment**: Modify the rules to include additional factors influencing yield, such as solubility, side reactions, or catalyst deactivation mechanisms.

- **Advice 10**: **Prioritize Rules Based on Impact and Reliability**

  Focus on rules that have the most significant impact on yield prediction and are supported by ample data.

  - **Action**: Rank the rules according to their coverage and reliability.
  - **Adjustment**: Emphasize high-priority rules in applications and consider revising or omitting low-priority rules with minimal impact or support.

** End of Advice **

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify and Standardize Functional Group Definitions**  
  Simplify the rules by defining functional groups using standard SMILES patterns or SMARTS queries that can be easily identified computationally. For example, instead of describing modifiers as "α-amino dicarboxylic acids," define them using specific substructure patterns that can be matched in SMILES strings. This will facilitate the automatic generation of binary features indicating the presence or absence of these groups.

- **Advice 2**: **Translate Rules into Quantifiable Molecular Descriptors**  
  Convert qualitative descriptions into quantifiable molecular descriptors that can be calculated directly from the SMILES. For instance, instead of general statements about "electron-withdrawing groups," use specific descriptors like Hammett sigma constants or partial charges. This numerical approach allows for the creation of a feature matrix suitable for machine learning models.

- **Advice 3**: **Incorporate Numerical Parameters for Chain Lengths and Substituent Positions**  
  Replace vague terms like "chain lengths of 3 to 5 carbons" with explicit numerical features such as "AliphaticChainLength" and assign integers based on the actual carbon count. This numerical representation can be directly included in the feature matrix and aids in quantitative analysis.

- **Advice 4**: **Use Binary Indicators for Specific Functionalities**  
  Create binary features for the presence of specific functional groups or structural motifs, such as "HasPyridineRing," "HasCarboxylicAcid," "HasAminoGroup," etc. This allows for straightforward feature extraction from SMILES and supports the generation of a numeric feature matrix.

- **Advice 5**: **Implement Topological and Electronic Descriptors**  
  Utilize molecular descriptors that capture topological (e.g., Molecular Weight, Topological Polar Surface Area) and electronic properties (e.g., HOMO-LUMO gap, Dipole Moment). These descriptors can be computed from the SMILES and provide a quantitative basis for the rules, improving predictive power.

- **Advice 6**: **Develop a Scoring System Based on Functional Group Contributions**  
  Assign scores or weights to different functional groups based on their contribution to the yield (positive or negative effects). For example, assign +1 for the presence of a coordinating amino group and -1 for bulky substituents that hinder coordination. Sum these scores to predict the overall effect on the yield.

- **Advice 7**: **Cluster Modifiers Based on Structural Similarity**  
  Group modifiers into clusters using similarity indices (e.g., Tanimoto coefficient based on molecular fingerprints). This allows for the identification of patterns and trends that can be translated into quantifiable features, facilitating the creation of improved rules.

- **Advice 8**: **Incorporate Steric Hindrance Parameters**  
  Include descriptors that quantify steric effects, such as Verloop parameters or molecular volume. These can explain why certain modifiers with bulky groups result in low yields and can be numerically represented in the feature matrix.

- **Advice 9**: **Utilize Machine Learning to Derive New Rules**  
  Apply machine learning algorithms to the dataset using the generated numeric features to discover underlying patterns and relationships that may not be apparent through manual rule generation. This data-driven approach can lead to more accurate and generalizable rules.

- **Advice 10**: **Update Rules to Reflect Exceptions and Outliers**  
  Re-express rules to account for exceptions by incorporating conditional statements or thresholds based on quantitative descriptors. For instance, modify rules to include specific ranges of electron density or coordination numbers that define high or low yields.

- **Advice 11**: **Standardize Nomenclature and Terminology**  
  Ensure that all chemical terms and names are consistently used and conform to IUPAC standards. This reduces ambiguity and aids in automated parsing of the rules for feature extraction.

- **Advice 12**: **Provide Examples with SMILES Notation**  
  Include SMILES strings for example compounds in each rule to illustrate the patterns and assist in computational identification. This makes it easier to validate the rules and generate corresponding features from new modifiers.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids substituted at the para-position with electron-donating groups (EDGs) that cannot coordinate** (e.g., methyl, methoxy groups) predict a **low yield**. EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxylate oxygen, hindering effective metal coordination.  
  *Example*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with ortho-substituents capable of intramolecular hydrogen bonding** (e.g., hydroxyl, formyl groups) predict a **low yield**. Intramolecular interactions can interfere with metal coordination by occupying coordination sites.  
  *Examples*: **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**, **5-hydroxybenzoic acid**.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **perfluorinated alkyl chains** predict a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms decreases electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, reducing its coordinating ability.  
  *Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aromatic acids with fused ring systems containing carbonyl groups capable of bidentate coordination** predict a **high yield**. The additional carbonyl oxygen provides an extra coordination site, enhancing binding to the metal center.  
  *Example*: **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers having **sulfhydryl (thiol) groups near the carboxylate** predict a **high yield**. Thiol groups can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity.  
  *Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers containing **multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxylate group** predict a **high yield**. These hydroxyl groups can participate in hydrogen bonding and chelation, improving coordination with the catalyst.  
  *Example*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid).

**Justification and Considerations:**

- **Combining Functional Groups and Structural Features**: Each rule integrates multiple functional groups (e.g., amino, carboxylate, indole rings, ether linkages, thiol groups) and structural features (e.g., chain length, substitution patterns, ring systems) to improve specificity and predictive accuracy.

- **Physicochemical Properties**:
  - **Coordination Ability**: Emphasis on functional groups that can effectively coordinate with the metal center, such as amino, carboxylate, thiol, pyridyl, and carbonyl groups.
  - **Electron-Withdrawing/Donating Effects**: Understanding how substituents affect the acidity of the carboxylate group and its ability to coordinate.
  - **Steric Factors**: Considering chain length and flexibility, where optimal lengths enhance coordination, while excessive flexibility hinders it.
  - **Intramolecular Interactions**: Recognizing that intramolecular hydrogen bonding can reduce the availability of functional groups for coordination.

- **Prediction Clarity**: Each rule clearly states whether modifiers fitting its description are predicted to result in a high or low yield, facilitating straightforward application to new structures.

- **Dataset Coverage**: The rules are designed to cover a broad range of the dataset, balancing between simple rules with high coverage (e.g., Rules 1-5) and more complex rules with lower coverage but greater specificity (e.g., Rules 13-15).

- **Adjustments and Improvements**:
  - **Corrected Inconsistencies**: Addressed discrepancies from the previous rules by ensuring that examples and predictions align with the dataset provided. For instance, recognizing that **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** actually predicts a **high yield**, contrary to prior misclassification.
  - **Refinement of Rules**: Rules have been refined to account for exceptions and improve accuracy. For example, distinguishing between electron-donating groups that can coordinate (e.g., amino groups) and those that cannot (e.g., methyl groups) in Rules 5 and 10.
  - **Elimination of Redundancies**: Overlapping or redundant rules have been consolidated to streamline the rule set without compromising coverage.

- **Balance Between Coverage and Specificity**: The rules strike a balance between covering more compounds in the dataset and providing specific guidelines based on functional group combinations and physicochemical properties, as per the requirements.

By understanding the relationship between structural features and catalytic activity, these rules provide systematic guidance for predicting whether a molecular modifier will result in a high or low yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. This knowledge can assist researchers in selecting or designing effective modifiers to optimize reaction yields.
---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and well-defined, allowing for straightforward identification of modifiers fitting its criteria. It provides solid physicochemical insight by linking the presence of both amino and multiple carboxylate groups to effective bidentate coordination with the metal center. The rule considers combinations of functional groups, enhancing its complexity. It is supported by at least two data points—**(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** and **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid**—meeting the coverage criterion. Overall, Rule 1 is strong and well-balanced.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear but has limited coverage, being supported by only one data point (**5-aminopentanoic acid**). While it offers good physicochemical insight into how optimal chain length enables effective chelation through amino and carboxylate groups, additional supporting data points are needed to strengthen its predictive power. Increasing coverage would improve the rule's reliability.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear and provides sound physicochemical reasoning by emphasizing the role of side chains containing coordinating heterocycles in α-amino acids. However, it is supported by only one data point (**(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid**), resulting in low coverage. Identifying additional modifiers that fit this rule would enhance its robustness and applicability.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear and backed by strong physicochemical insight, linking strong EWGs at the para-position to increased acidity and metal coordination. It considers combinations of structural features, adding complexity. The rule is supported by at least two data points—**4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**—fulfilling the coverage criterion. Rule 4 effectively balances complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5, while clear and logically reasoning that para-substituted groups capable of coordination enhance yield, is contradicted by the dataset. **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**, which matches the rule's criteria, predicts a **low yield** in the dataset. This contradiction suggests that the rule may not accurately capture the relationship between such modifiers and the reaction yield. Refinement is needed to resolve this discrepancy, possibly by considering the influence of additional structural factors.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear and provides logical physicochemical insight by associating optimal chain length and lack of additional functional groups with favorable interactions. However, it is supported by only one data point (**octanoic acid**), indicating low coverage. Expanding the dataset with more examples fitting this rule would improve its validity and predictive accuracy.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear and supported by at least two data points—**7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**—both predicting **low yield**, thus meeting the coverage criterion. It provides sound physicochemical reasoning by linking increased chain length and flexibility to reduced effective chelation. The rule considers combinations of structural features and maintains a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear and backed by physicochemical insight, explaining how flexible ether linkages reduce coordination efficacy. It is supported by two data points—**2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** and **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**—both predicting **low yield**, satisfying the coverage criterion. Rule 8 effectively balances complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear and logically associates the absence of coordinating functional groups in hydrophobic side chains with diminished metal interaction and low yield. However, it is supported by only one data point—**(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid**—resulting in low coverage. Identifying additional data points would strengthen the rule's predictive capacity.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear and provides solid physicochemical reasoning by highlighting how EDGs decrease carboxylate acidity and hinder coordination. It is supported by at least two data points—**4-methylbenzoic acid** and **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**—both predicting **low yield**, fulfilling the coverage criterion. The rule considers combinations of substructures and maintains a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear and offers logical physicochemical insight into how intramolecular hydrogen bonding from ortho-substituents can interfere with metal coordination. It is supported by data points such as **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** and **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**, both predicting **low yield**, thereby satisfying the coverage requirement. The rule effectively balances complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is clear but has low coverage, being supported by only one data point—**2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**—predicting **low yield**. While it provides good physicochemical insight into the electron-withdrawing effects of perfluorinated chains, adding more examples would enhance its reliability and applicability.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear and provides sound reasoning by associating fused ring systems with carbonyl groups capable of bidentate coordination to high yield. However, it is only supported by one data point—**1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**—resulting in low coverage. Increasing the number of supporting examples would improve the rule's robustness.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 lacks some clarity due to the ambiguous definition of "near the carboxylate," which may lead to inconsistent application. While **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** predicts a **high yield**, supporting the rule, **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** predicts a **low yield**, potentially contradicting it. This inconsistency suggests a need to refine the rule to specify the spatial requirements for the sulfhydryl group more precisely.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 is clear and provides solid physicochemical insight into how multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxylate enhance coordination through hydrogen bonding and chelation. It is supported by at least two data points—**(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** and **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**—both predicting **high yield**, thus satisfying the coverage criterion. The rule maintains a good balance between complexity and coverage.

Current rules:
After carefully analyzing the dataset and considering the underlying physicochemical properties of the molecular modifiers, I have generated a refined set of rules that describe the relationship between the modifiers' structural features and the relative high or low yield of the reaction. These rules combine multiple functional groups and structural features to enhance predictive accuracy and address inconsistencies in the previous set.

---

**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains containing carboxylate groups** (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) predict a **high yield**. The presence of both amino and multiple carboxylate groups allows for effective bidentate coordination with the metal center in the catalyst.  
  *Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid), **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid).

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **ω-amino acids with carbon chain lengths of 3 to 5 carbons** predict a **high yield**. The optimal chain length enables the amino and carboxylate groups to chelate the metal center effectively.  
  *Example*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains containing heterocycles capable of coordination** (e.g., indole rings) predict a **high yield**. These additional coordination sites enhance binding to the metal center.  
  *Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan).

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids substituted at the para-position with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)** predict a **high yield**. EWGs like **nitro** or **bromomethyl** groups increase the acidity of the carboxylate oxygen, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers.  
  *Examples*: **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids substituted at the para-position with groups capable of coordination** (e.g., amino, pyridyl groups) predict a **high yield**. These substituents provide additional coordination sites for the metal center.  
  *Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths up to 8 carbons and lacking additional functional groups** predict a **high yield**. The optimal chain length allows favorable hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst without hindering coordination.  
  *Example*: **octanoic acid**.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **ω-amino acids with carbon chain lengths greater than 6 carbons** predict a **low yield**. Increased chain length introduces flexibility, reducing effective chelation of metal centers.  
  *Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **flexible ether linkages with terminal carboxylate groups** predict a **low yield**. The flexibility of ether linkages reduces the rigidity needed for effective coordination with the catalyst.  
  *Example*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with hydrophobic side chains lacking coordinating functional groups** predict a **low yield**. The absence of additional coordination sites diminishes interaction with the metal center.  
  *Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine).

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids substituted at the para-position with electron-donating groups (EDGs) that cannot coordinate** (e.g., methyl, methoxy groups) predict a **low yield**. EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxylate oxygen, hindering effective metal coordination.  
  *Example*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with ortho-substituents capable of intramolecular hydrogen bonding** (e.g., hydroxyl, formyl groups) predict a **low yield**. Intramolecular interactions can interfere with metal coordination by occupying coordination sites.  
  *Examples*: **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**, **5-hydroxybenzoic acid**.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **perfluorinated alkyl chains** predict a **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms decreases electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, reducing its coordinating ability.  
  *Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aromatic acids with fused ring systems containing carbonyl groups capable of bidentate coordination** predict a **high yield**. The additional carbonyl oxygen provides an extra coordination site, enhancing binding to the metal center.  
  *Example*: **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers having **sulfhydryl (thiol) groups near the carboxylate** predict a **high yield**. Thiol groups can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity.  
  *Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers containing **multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxylate group** predict a **high yield**. These hydroxyl groups can participate in hydrogen bonding and chelation, improving coordination with the catalyst.  
  *Example*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid).

**Justification and Considerations:**

- **Combining Functional Groups and Structural Features**: Each rule integrates multiple functional groups (e.g., amino, carboxylate, indole rings, ether linkages, thiol groups) and structural features (e.g., chain length, substitution patterns, ring systems) to improve specificity and predictive accuracy.

- **Physicochemical Properties**:
  - **Coordination Ability**: Emphasis on functional groups that can effectively coordinate with the metal center, such as amino, carboxylate, thiol, pyridyl, and carbonyl groups.
  - **Electron-Withdrawing/Donating Effects**: Understanding how substituents affect the acidity of the carboxylate group and its ability to coordinate.
  - **Steric Factors**: Considering chain length and flexibility, where optimal lengths enhance coordination, while excessive flexibility hinders it.
  - **Intramolecular Interactions**: Recognizing that intramolecular hydrogen bonding can reduce the availability of functional groups for coordination.

- **Prediction Clarity**: Each rule clearly states whether modifiers fitting its description are predicted to result in a high or low yield, facilitating straightforward application to new structures.

- **Dataset Coverage**: The rules are designed to cover a broad range of the dataset, balancing between simple rules with high coverage (e.g., Rules 1-5) and more complex rules with lower coverage but greater specificity (e.g., Rules 13-15).

- **Adjustments and Improvements**:
  - **Corrected Inconsistencies**: Addressed discrepancies from the previous rules by ensuring that examples and predictions align with the dataset provided. For instance, recognizing that **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** actually predicts a **high yield**, contrary to prior misclassification.
  - **Refinement of Rules**: Rules have been refined to account for exceptions and improve accuracy. For example, distinguishing between electron-donating groups that can coordinate (e.g., amino groups) and those that cannot (e.g., methyl groups) in Rules 5 and 10.
  - **Elimination of Redundancies**: Overlapping or redundant rules have been consolidated to streamline the rule set without compromising coverage.

- **Balance Between Coverage and Specificity**: The rules strike a balance between covering more compounds in the dataset and providing specific guidelines based on functional group combinations and physicochemical properties, as per the requirements.

By understanding the relationship between structural features and catalytic activity, these rules provide systematic guidance for predicting whether a molecular modifier will result in a high or low yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. This knowledge can assist researchers in selecting or designing effective modifiers to optimize reaction yields.---------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: **Review and Correct the SMARTS Patterns for Rule 1**  
  The SMARTS pattern for Rule 1 is too specific and does not accurately capture α-amino acids with side chains containing carboxylate groups like aspartic acid and glutamic acid. The current pattern requires an exact sequence that may not be present in all relevant modifiers.  
  **Improvement**: Modify the SMARTS pattern to be more general:
  ```
  '[NX3;H2][CX4H](C(=O)[O;H1,H0-])[CX4][CH2]*[CX3](=O)[O;H1,H0-]'
  ```
  This pattern matches α-amino acids with a side chain containing a carboxylate group, regardless of the exact chain length between the α-carbon and the side-chain carboxylate.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Adjust Chain Length Specification in Rule 2**  
  The SMARTS pattern for Rule 2 uses `{2,4}` to specify the chain length, which may not correctly match ω-amino acids with carbon chain lengths of 3 to 5 carbons due to indexing starting at zero.  
  **Improvement**: Correct the chain length in the pattern:
  ```
  '[NX3;H2][CH2]{3,5}[CX3](=O)[O;H1,H0-]'
  ```
  This ensures that the pattern matches ω-amino acids with carbon chain lengths between 3 and 5.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Refine SMARTS Patterns for Heterocycles in Rule 3**  
  The current pattern for Rule 3 may not capture all heterocycles capable of coordination, such as indole rings.  
  **Improvement**: Broaden the pattern to include various heterocycles:
  ```
  '[NX3;H2][CX4H](C(=O)[O;H1,H0-])[CX4][c;n,o,s]'
  ```
  This pattern matches α-amino acids with side chains containing heterocycles like indole and pyridine rings.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Correct Substituent Position in Aromatic Rings for Rules 4, 5, 10, and 11**  
  The patterns for these rules do not explicitly ensure substitution at the para-position, leading to potential mismatches.
  **Improvement**: Specify the para-position substitution in the patterns:
  - For Rule 4:
    ```
    '[c][c]([c][c]C(=O)[O;H1,H0-])[c][c][EWG]'
    ```
    Replace `[EWG]` with appropriate SMARTS for electron-withdrawing groups.
  - For Rule 5:
    ```
    '[c]1[c][c][c]([C](=O)[O;H1,H0-])[c][c]1[Group]'
    ```
    Replace `[Group]` with SMARTS for groups capable of coordination.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Reevaluate Exclude Patterns in Rule 6**  
  The exclude patterns may unintentionally exclude valid aliphatic carboxylic acids by excluding all rings or heteroatoms, even when they comply with the rule.  
  **Improvement**: Modify exclude patterns to only exclude additional functional groups:
  ```
  Exclude patterns: ['[!#6;!#1]']  # Exclude atoms that are not carbon or hydrogen
  ```

- **Suggestion 6**: **Ensure Accurate Matching for Perfluorinated Chains in Rule 12**  
  The SMARTS pattern for Rule 12 may not accurately capture perfluorinated alkyl chains.  
  **Improvement**: Clarify and correct the pattern:
  ```
  '[CX4][CX4]([F])([F])[F]'
  ```
  This pattern matches carbon atoms fully substituted with fluorine atoms, indicative of perfluorinated chains.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Expand Patterns for Multiple Hydroxyl Groups in Rule 15**  
  The current pattern in Rule 15 may be too restrictive and miss molecules with relevant structures.  
  **Improvement**: Generalize the pattern:
  ```
  '[CX3](=O)[O;H1,H0-][CH](O)[CH](O)[CH2][OH]'
  ```
  This pattern allows for variations in the hydroxyl group positions adjacent to the carboxylate.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Add Error Handling for Molecule Parsing**  
  The code currently skips molecules that cannot be parsed but does not inform the user.  
  **Improvement**: Implement logging or print statements to alert when a molecule cannot be parsed:
  ```python
  if mol is None:
      print(f"Could not parse SMILES: {smi}")
      results.append([0]*len(rules))
      continue
  ```

- **Suggestion 9**: **Provide Descriptive Variable Names and Comments in Code**  
  Clear variable names and comments improve code readability and maintainability.
  **Improvement**: Rename variables like `pat` to `pattern` and add comments explaining each step.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Validate SMARTS Patterns Using RDKit Tools**  
  Before using SMARTS patterns, validate them using RDKit to ensure they are syntactically correct and match intended substructures.
  **Improvement**: Use RDKit's `MolFromSmarts` and `SmartsMolSupplier` for validation:
  ```python
  for smarts in pattern_list:
      mol = Chem.MolFromSmarts(smarts)
      if mol is None:
          print(f"Invalid SMARTS pattern: {smarts}")
          # Handle error or correct pattern
  ```

- **Suggestion 11**: **Include Hydrogen Count Specification Where Necessary**  
  Ensure that hydrogen counts are accurately specified in SMARTS patterns to match the expected protonation states.
  **Improvement**: In patterns, explicitly define hydrogen counts, e.g., `[NX3;H2]` for primary amines.

- **Suggestion 12**: **Test Each Rule Individually with Known Examples**  
  Use known compounds that should match and not match each rule to test the patterns.
  **Improvement**: Create a test suite with example molecules for each rule to verify the patterns.

- **Suggestion 13**: **Use Recursive SMARTS for Complex Substructures**  
  For rules involving complex ring systems or coordination sites, recursive SMARTS can accurately capture these features.
  **Improvement**: Implement recursive SMARTS in patterns where appropriate, e.g., for heterocycles in Rule 13.

- **Suggestion 14**: **Update the Feature Matrix Generation Logic**  
  Ensure that once a rule matches, it assigns the correct prediction value (1 or -1), and no further matching is necessary.
  **Improvement**: After assigning a prediction, break out of loops if appropriate to prevent overwriting values.

- **Suggestion 15**: **Clarify Rule Definitions and Ensure Consistency Across Code**  
  Ensure that the natural language descriptions, code comments, and SMARTS patterns are aligned and consistent.
  **Improvement**: Revisit each rule's description and compare it with the SMARTS patterns and code implementation for consistency.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Performance:**

After reviewing the current rule metrics in comparison with the previous metrics, several key observations can be made regarding the performance of the current set of rules, particularly focusing on **confidence** and **lift**.

1. **Confidence:**
   - **Current Train Confidence:** **0.533 (53.3%)**
   - **Previous Train Confidence:** **0.635 (63.5%)** and **0.540 (54.0%)**
   - **Analysis:** The current confidence level has decreased compared to both previous metrics. A lower confidence indicates that given the rule conditions are met, the likelihood of correctly predicting the outcome (high or low yield) has diminished. This suggests that the current rules are less reliable in making accurate predictions based on the conditions specified.

2. **Lift:**
   - **Current Train Lift:** **1.061**
   - **Previous Train Lift:** **1.205** and **1.056**
   - **Analysis:** The lift has also decreased in the current rules compared to previous iterations. Lift values close to 1 imply that the rule does not significantly improve the prediction over random chance. The decrease in lift suggests that the association between the rule conditions and the predicted outcome is weaker, reducing the rule's usefulness in distinguishing high-yield reactions from the baseline probability.

3. **Support:**
   - **Current Train Support:** **0.00381 (0.381%)**
   - **Previous Train Support:** **0.16667 (16.67%)** and **0.18452 (18.45%)**
   - **Analysis:** Support has significantly decreased, indicating that the current rules cover a much smaller portion of the dataset. Low support means that the rules are applicable to fewer instances, which limits their practical utility and may affect the statistical reliability of the confidence and lift metrics.

4. **Leverage:**
   - **Current Train Leverage:** **0.00087**
   - **Previous Train Leverage:** **0.02891** and **-0.00415**
   - **Analysis:** A lower leverage value indicates that the current rules provide minimal improvement over what would be expected by chance. Positive leverage close to zero signifies a weak association between the rule conditions and predictions.

**Implications and Observations:**

- **Decreased Predictive Power:** The reduction in both confidence and lift suggests that the current set of rules is not performing as well as previous iterations in predicting high or low yields.
- **Over-Specificity:** The significant drop in support implies that the rules may be too specific, capturing only a tiny fraction of the data. Overly specific rules fail to generalize and may not capture the broader patterns necessary for reliable predictions.
- **Marginal Benefit over Random Chance:** With lift values close to 1 and low leverage, the current rules offer minimal advantage over random guessing, which diminishes their practical value in guiding experimental design.

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules:**

1. **Increase Rule Generality:**
   - **Simplify Overly Specific Conditions:** Re-evaluate the rules that have very specific functional groups or structural features. Generalize conditions where possible to encompass a broader range of compounds.
   - **Example Improvement:** Instead of specifying modifiers with "α-amino acids with side chains containing carboxylate groups," consider "amino acids with side chains capable of bidentate coordination."

2. **Merge and Consolidate Similar Rules:**
   - **Combine Overlapping Rules:** Identify rules with similar predictive outcomes and conditions. Merging these can increase support and improve confidence and lift.
   - **Reduce Redundancies:** Eliminate redundant rules that do not contribute additional predictive power.

3. **Focus on High-Impact Features:**
   - **Prioritize Functional Groups with Strong Effects:** Emphasize structural features known to have a significant impact on yield, such as effective chelating groups.
   - **Conduct Statistical Analysis:** Use regression or feature importance techniques to identify features most strongly correlated with high yields.

4. **Re-express Rules Using Quantitative Descriptors:**
   - **Incorporate Physicochemical Parameters:** Use descriptors like pKa, hydrophobicity (logP), and steric hindrance to create rules based on quantifiable properties.
   - **Benefit:** Quantitative rules may capture trends that categorical rules miss, improving confidence and lift.

5. **Increase Dataset Coverage:**
   - **Expand Data Inclusion Criteria:** Adjust the rules to cover more data points without sacrificing too much specificity.
   - **Balance Between Specificity and Applicability:** Aim for rules that are specific enough to be meaningful but general enough to be widely applicable.

6. **Validate and Iterate:**
   - **Cross-Validation:** Test the revised rules on different subsets of data to ensure they perform consistently.
   - **Iterative Refinement:** Continuously refine the rules based on performance metrics, aiming to increase confidence and lift in each iteration.

7. **Address Potential Local Minima:**
   - **Re-Examine Rule Structure:** Ensure that the rules are not trapped in a local minimum of performance. Consider exploring alternative rule formulations that might lead to a better global optimum.
   - **Introduce New Perspectives:** Collaborate with domain experts to gain insights that may lead to novel rule development.

**Specific Suggestions Based on Current Rules:**

- **Broaden Chain Length Criteria:**
  - **Example:** Adjust rules that specify exact chain lengths (e.g., "ω-amino acids with carbon chain lengths greater than 6 carbons") to include a range of effective lengths.
- **Re-Evaluate Substituent Effects:**
  - **Electron-Withdrawing/Donating Groups:** Consider the overall electronic effects rather than specific substituents. Group substituents by their electronic properties instead of listing them individually.
- **Consider Steric and Electronic Factors Together:**
  - **Composite Rules:** Develop rules that combine steric hindrance and electronic effects to capture more complex interactions influencing yield.

**Conclusion:**

The current rules have become too narrow and specific, leading to decreased confidence, lift, and support. To enhance performance:

- **Generalize Rules:** Broaden the conditions to apply to more data points while still capturing the essential features that influence yield.
- **Simplify Rule Set:** Reduce complexity by combining similar rules and eliminating those with minimal impact.
- **Enhance Predictive Power:** Focus on increasing confidence and lift by ensuring that the rules provide meaningful predictions beyond random chance.

By implementing these recommendations, the rules can be refined to achieve better performance metrics, resulting in more reliable predictions for high and low reaction yields. This iterative process is essential to develop a robust model that effectively guides experimental decisions in the catalytic research program.
---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **
- **Advice 1**: **Broaden Rule Criteria to Increase Coverage**  
  Simplify overly specific rules to cover more compounds in the dataset. For instance, instead of specifying exact chain lengths or precise substituents, generalize rules to include ranges or groups of similar functional groups. For example, modify Rule 2 to include ω-amino acids with carbon chain lengths of **2 to 6 carbons** to increase the number of compounds it applies to.

- **Advice 2**: **Combine Similar Rules to Reduce Fragmentation**  
  Merge rules that have overlapping criteria to create more comprehensive rules. For example, combine Rules 1 and 3 by creating a rule for **α-amino acids with side chains containing functional groups capable of coordination (e.g., carboxylate, indole, or other heterocycles)** predicting a high yield.

- **Advice 3**: **Utilize SMARTS Patterns for SMILES Matching**  
  Convert the rules into SMARTS (SMILES Arbitrary Target Specification) patterns that can be directly applied to the SMILES strings in the dataset. This allows for automated and accurate identification of compounds that fit each rule, improving the Rule Matrix quality by reducing mismatches.

- **Advice 4**: **Revise Rules with High False Negatives or Positives**  
  Identify rules that incorrectly classify compounds (e.g., predicting low yield when the actual yield is high) and adjust them. For example, if **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** is predicted as low yield by Rule 12 but is actually high yield, modify the rule to account for pyridyl groups that enhance coordination despite being electron-deficient.

- **Advice 5**: **Incorporate Key Functional Groups Common in High-Yield Modifiers**  
  Analyze high-yield modifiers in the dataset to identify common functional groups or structural features. Create rules that focus on these features, such as modifiers containing **pyridine rings, multiple carboxylate groups, or hydroxyl groups adjacent to carboxylates**.

- **Advice 6**: **Eliminate Redundant or Low-Impact Rules**  
  Remove rules that apply to very few compounds or overlap significantly with other rules without adding value. This streamlines the rule set and focuses on the most impactful predictors of yield.

- **Advice 7**: **Adjust Rules Based on Electron Donating/Withdrawing Effects**  
  Refine rules that consider the electronic effects of substituents. For example, update Rule 10 to specify that only strong electron-donating groups (e.g., methoxy) at the para-position predict low yield, while weak donors like methyl may not significantly impact coordination.

- **Advice 8**: **Include Structural Flexibility Considerations**  
  Reassess rules related to chain length and flexibility (e.g., Rules 7 and 8). Determine if flexibility truly correlates with low yield or if exceptions exist. If longer-chain ω-amino acids sometimes yield high results, adjust the rule to reflect the threshold more accurately.

- **Advice 9**: **Provide Specific Examples for Each Rule from the Dataset**  
  Use compounds from the dataset as examples for each rule to ensure the rules are grounded in actual data. This helps validate the rules and makes them more practical for predicting yields of new compounds.

- **Advice 10**: **Validate and Iterate on the Revised Rules**  
  After revising the rules, apply them to the dataset to generate a new Rule Matrix. Assess the quality by checking the coverage and the balance of true positives and true negatives. Continue refining the rules based on this feedback to improve their predictive power.

- **Advice 11**: **Consider the Role of Intramolecular Interactions**  
  Re-express rules involving intramolecular hydrogen bonding (e.g., Rule 11) to clarify their impact on coordination. Specify which functional groups are involved and how they affect metal binding, ensuring the rule accurately predicts the yield based on these interactions.

- **Advice 12**: **Simplify Complex Rules into More General Principles**  
  Where possible, distill complex rules into broader principles. For example, create a general rule that modifiers capable of **bidentate or multidentate coordination** through functional groups like carboxylates, amines, or hydroxyls tend to predict high yield.

- **Advice 13**: **Adjust for Anomalies and Outliers**  
  Identify compounds that do not fit any current rules but have high or low yields. Analyze these cases to understand the underlying reasons and adjust the rules or create new ones to account for these anomalies.

** End of Advice **
---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Generator Message:
After analyzing the dataset and considering the underlying physicochemical properties of the molecular modifiers, I have generated a set of rules that describe the relationship between the modifiers' structural features and the relative high or low yield of the reaction. These rules combine multiple functional groups and structural features to enhance predictive accuracy and cover a broad range of the dataset.

---

**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxylate groups** (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) predict a **high yield**. The presence of both amino and multiple carboxylate groups enables effective chelation with the metal center, enhancing catalyst performance.
   - *Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid), **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid).

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) capable of enhancing metal coordination** predict a **high yield**. EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxylate oxygen, improving its ability to coordinate with metal centers.
   - *Examples*: **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**.

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **ω-amino acids with optimal chain lengths of 4 to 6 carbons** predict a **high yield**. The chain length allows the amino and carboxylate groups to effectively chelate the metal center.
   - *Examples*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**.

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with nitrogen-containing heterocycles capable of coordination** (e.g., pyridyl groups) predict a **high yield**. The heterocyclic nitrogen can act as an additional coordination site.
   - *Examples*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**, **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**.

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing **thiol (sulfhydryl) groups near the carboxylate group** predict a **high yield**. Thiol groups can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity.
   - *Examples*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**, **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers with **multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxylate group** predict a **high yield**. These hydroxyl groups can chelate the metal center and participate in hydrogen bonding, improving coordination.
   - *Examples*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid), **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]-2-oxoacetic acid**.

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains containing coordinating heterocycles** (e.g., indole rings) predict a **high yield**. The heterocycle provides additional coordination sites.
   - *Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan).

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aromatic acids with fused ring systems containing carbonyl groups capable of bidentate coordination** predict a **high yield**. The fused rings and carbonyl groups enhance metal binding.
   - *Example*: **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**.

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 6 to 8 carbons and lacking additional functional groups** predict a **high yield**. The hydrophobic chain can interact favorably with the catalyst environment.
   - *Example*: **octanoic acid**, **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**.

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with non-coordinating hydrophobic side chains** predict a **low yield**. Lack of additional coordination sites diminishes interaction with the metal center.
    - *Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine).

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-donating groups (EDGs) incapable of coordination** (e.g., methyl, methoxy groups) predict a **low yield**. EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxylate oxygen, reducing coordination ability.
    - *Example*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**.

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers containing **flexible ether linkages with terminal carboxylate groups** predict a **low yield**. The increased flexibility reduces effective coordination due to entropic factors.
    - *Example*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **perfluorinated alkyl chains** predict a **low yield**. Strong electron-withdrawing fluorines decrease electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, hindering coordination.
    - *Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with ortho-substituents capable of intramolecular hydrogen bonding** predict a **low yield**. Intramolecular interactions occupy coordination sites, reducing metal binding.
    - *Examples*: **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**.

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **dipeptides or contain multiple amide linkages** predict a **low yield**. The presence of amide bonds can hinder coordination due to resonance stabilization and reduced availability of lone pairs.
    - *Example*: **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**.

**End of Rules**

**Justifications and Considerations:**

- **Combination of Functional Groups and Structural Features**:

  - Each rule integrates multiple functional groups (e.g., amino, carboxylate, thiol, hydroxyl, heterocycles) and structural features (e.g., chain length, substitution patterns, ring systems) to improve specificity and predictive accuracy.
  - For example, Rules 1 and 7 focus on amino acids with additional coordinating groups, while Rules 2 and 4 emphasize aromatic acids with substituents that affect coordination.

- **Physicochemical Properties**:

  - **Coordination Ability**: Emphasis on functional groups that can effectively coordinate with the metal center, such as amino, carboxylate, thiol, hydroxyl, and heterocyclic nitrogen atoms.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Refine Rule 2 by specifying the types of electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)**. While Rule 2 predicts high yield for aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted EWGs, exceptions like **4-formylbenzoic acid** (low yield) indicate that not all EWGs enhance yield. Modify the rule to focus on specific EWGs (e.g., nitro, halogens) known to increase carboxylate acidity and enhance coordination. Exclude aldehyde groups (e.g., formyl) that may not have the same effect.

- **Advice 2**: **Adjust the chain length criteria in Rule 3**. Rule 3 currently predicts high yield for ω-amino acids with chain lengths of 4 to 6 carbons. However, **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (7 carbons) has a low yield, contradicting the rule. Revise the optimal chain length to 4 to 5 carbons to match the data, ensuring the rule accurately predicts high yield only within this specific range.

- **Advice 3**: **Clarify Rule 4 to account for steric and positional effects**. Rule 4 predicts high yield for aromatic carboxylic acids substituted with nitrogen-containing heterocycles but is contradicted by **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (low yield). Refine the rule to specify that the nitrogen-containing heterocycle should be directly attached to the carboxylic acid ring without additional linkers that may introduce steric hindrance or reduce conjugation, thereby affecting coordination.

- **Advice 4**: **Specify the structural context in Rule 5 regarding thiol groups**. Rule 5 predicts high yield for modifiers containing thiol groups near the carboxylate but is contradicted by **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (low yield). Refine the rule to indicate that thiol groups in **aliphatic chains** (e.g., **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**) enhance yield, whereas thiol groups on **aromatic rings** may not due to reduced availability of the thiol group's lone pair for coordination caused by resonance with the aromatic system.

- **Advice 5**: **Expand coverage for rules with limited data points by incorporating similar compounds**. For Rules 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, and 15, which have limited examples, consider identifying additional modifiers in the dataset or literature that fit these criteria. Alternatively, merge these rules with others that have similar physicochemical rationales to enhance coverage and robustness.

- **Advice 6**: **Emphasize the absence of additional functional groups in Rule 9**. Rule 9 may cause confusion because **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (with a hydroxyl group) yields low, while **octanoic acid** (without additional groups) yields high. Modify the rule to clearly state that only unfunctionalized aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 6 to 8 carbons predict a high yield, ensuring that the presence of functional groups like hydroxyls excludes a compound from this rule.

- **Advice 7**: **Refine Rule 14 to include both ortho and para-substituents capable of intramolecular interactions**. The low yield of **4-formylbenzoic acid** suggests that para-formyl groups may also hinder coordination, possibly due to resonance effects or intramolecular interactions affecting the carboxylate's ability to bind metal centers. Adjust the rule to encompass this by stating that **aromatic carboxylic acids with ortho or para-substituents capable of intramolecular hydrogen bonding or resonance stabilization** predict a low yield.

- **Advice 8**: **Combine Rules with similar themes to improve simplicity and coverage**. For example, merge Rules 6 and 15, which both involve modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups, as they share a common physicochemical rationale regarding enhanced coordination through chelation and hydrogen bonding. Similarly, combine Rules 12 and 8, focusing on how increased molecular flexibility or specific structural motifs affect coordination efficiency.

- **Advice 9**: **Provide specific examples of electron-donating groups (EDGs) in Rule 11 and clarify their impact on coordination**. Specify which EDGs (e.g., methyl, methoxy) reduce carboxylate acidity and hinder coordination. Additionally, clarify that EDGs like amino groups can act as coordinating sites and may not necessarily reduce yield, as seen with **4-aminobenzoic acid** (high yield). This helps to prevent contradictions and improves rule accuracy.

- **Advice 10**: **Incorporate considerations of steric hindrance and electronic effects into the rules**. For modifiers where steric bulk or electronic factors may impede coordination (e.g., bulky side chains, resonance-stabilized functional groups), adjust the rules to account for these effects. This could involve creating new rules or modifying existing ones to include steric and electronic descriptors that influence metal-ligand interactions.

- **Advice 11**: **Thoroughly validate each rule against all data points to ensure consistency**. Before finalizing the rules, systematically check each rule's predictions against the entire dataset. Identify any discrepancies or contradictions, and adjust the rules accordingly. This validation step is crucial to optimize the predictive power and reliability of the rules.

- **Advice 12**: **Consider the influence of chelating ability in modifiers with multiple coordination sites**. For modifiers with multiple potential coordination sites (e.g., amino acids with additional coordinating side chains), emphasize the importance of chelate ring size and flexibility. Adjust rules to account for whether these factors enhance or hinder effective metal binding, thus affecting yield.

- **Advice 13**: **Update Rule 3 to create a separate rule for ω-amino acids with longer chain lengths predicting low yield**. Since longer-chain ω-amino acids like **7-aminoheptanoic acid** yield low, introduce a new rule stating that **ω-amino acids with chain lengths greater than 5 carbons predict a low yield**. This accounts for the decreased chelation efficiency due to increased flexibility in longer chains.

- **Advice 14**: **Refine Rule 10 by specifying the types of non-coordinating hydrophobic side chains**. Clarify that bulky hydrophobic side chains like phenyl groups (e.g., in phenylalanine) reduce yield due to steric hindrance and lack of additional coordination sites. This prevents misclassification of modifiers and improves the rule's specificity.

- **Advice 15**: **Ensure consistent terminology and definitions across all rules**. Use precise chemical terminology to describe functional groups and structural features, reducing ambiguity. For example, clearly distinguish between aliphatic and aromatic compounds, specify positions of substituents (ortho, meta, para), and consistently define chain lengths. This enhances the clarity and applicability of the rules.

** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Increase Rule Coverage by Expanding Examples**  
  Many rules are supported by only one or two data points, limiting their reliability. Review the dataset to identify additional compounds that fit each rule, thereby strengthening their validation. For example, in Rule 3 (aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 6 to 8 carbons and lacking additional functional groups predict a high yield), only **octanoic acid** is cited. Including similar compounds like **hexanoic acid** or **heptanoic acid** (if data is available) would enhance coverage.

- **Advice 2**: **Refine Rules to Address Contradictions**  
  Some rules have contradictions within the dataset. For instance, Rule 2 predicts high yield for aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted EWGs, yet **4-formylbenzoic acid** (an EWG) yields low. Modify the rule to specify which EWGs are effective, perhaps excluding formyl groups due to their potential for intramolecular interactions that hinder coordination.

- **Advice 3**: **Clarify Structural Criteria in Rules**  
  Improve the specificity of rules by clearly defining structural features. In Rule 5, specify that **α-amino acids with hydrophobic side chains lacking coordinating functional groups and without branching** predict a low yield. This acknowledges that bulkier side chains may impede coordination, making the rule more precise.

- **Advice 4**: **Combine Similar Rules to Enhance Simplicity and Coverage**  
  Merge rules with overlapping criteria to streamline the rule set. For example, combine Rules 4 and 10, which both involve modifiers with amino groups enhancing coordination. A unified rule could state: "Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted amino groups or α-amino acids with side chains capable of coordination predict a high yield."

- **Advice 5**: **Incorporate SMILES Substructure Patterns into Rules**  
  Use specific SMILES patterns to define functional groups and structural motifs within rules. This enhances clarity and allows for computational implementation. For instance, specify that modifiers containing the SMILES pattern "[C@@H](N)C(=O)O" (α-amino acid backbone) with side chains containing additional carboxyl groups "[C(=O)O]" predict high yield.

- **Advice 6**: **Adjust Rules to Account for Electronic and Steric Effects**  
  Consider how additional functional groups affect coordination. Revise Rule 3 to state that only unbranched aliphatic carboxylic acids without steric hindrance predict high yield. This excludes compounds like **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, which may introduce steric or electronic factors reducing yield.

- **Advice 7**: **Validate and Update Rules Against the Entire Dataset**  
  Systematically apply each rule to all compounds in the dataset to identify inconsistencies. If a compound contradicts a rule, reassess either the rule or the classification of the compound. This ensures that rules are robust and accurately reflect the data.

- **Advice 8**: **Improve Rule Clarity with Precise Language**  
  Use unambiguous terms and define subjective descriptors. Replace terms like "large side chains" with specific criteria, such as "side chains containing more than six carbons" or "bulky aromatic rings." This precision reduces misinterpretation when applying the rules.

- **Advice 9**: **Develop New Rules for Unclassified Compounds**  
  Identify compounds not adequately predicted by existing rules and establish new rules to cover them. For example, if modifiers with specific heterocyclic rings consistently yield high, create a rule highlighting this feature.

- **Advice 10**: **Include Exception Clauses in Rules Where Necessary**  
  Where rules have known exceptions, explicitly state them. For example, modify Rule 2 to read: "Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted EWGs (excluding formyl groups) predict a high yield." This acknowledges and accounts for observed deviations.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify Rules Using Quantifiable Molecular Features**  
  Redefine the rules based on specific, quantifiable molecular features that can be directly calculated from SMILES strings. Focus on descriptors such as the number of carboxylic acid groups, amino groups, hydroxyl groups, chain length, presence of aromatic rings, and specific functional groups. This will facilitate the creation of a numeric feature matrix.

- **Advice 2**: **Translate Qualitative Descriptions into Quantitative Criteria**  
  Modify the rules to include numerical thresholds and counts. For example, instead of "long hydrocarbon chains (6 or more carbons)", specify "aliphatic chains with a carbon count ≥ 6". This precise criterion can be easily computed from the SMILES representation.

- **Advice 3**: **Utilize Computational Chemistry Tools for Descriptor Calculation**  
  Employ cheminformatics software (e.g., RDKit, ChemAxon) to calculate molecular descriptors and fingerprints from SMILES strings. Base the rules on these standardized descriptors, such as hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, molecular weight, topological polar surface area, and LogP values.

- **Advice 4**: **Develop Substructure-Based Rules Using SMARTS Patterns**  
  Define rules using SMARTS patterns to identify specific substructures within modifiers. For instance, create patterns for α-amino acids, pyridine rings, or carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups. This method allows for automated screening and feature extraction.

- **Advice 5**: **Consolidate and Generalize Similar Rules**  
  Merge rules with overlapping features to reduce complexity. For example, combine Rules 1 and 10 by focusing on modifiers with multiple coordination sites (e.g., amino acids with additional coordinating side chains). Generalized rules are easier to implement computationally.

- **Advice 6**: **Incorporate Electronic and Steric Descriptors Quantitatively**  
  Quantify electronic effects using parameters like Hammett constants for substituents on aromatic rings. Steric factors can be assessed using parameters like molecular volume or solvent-accessible surface area. Including these quantitative descriptors enhances the predictive power of the rules.

- **Advice 7**: **Create a Feature Matrix Template Based on Revised Rules**  
  Design a feature matrix where each column represents a specific descriptor derived from the rules, and each row corresponds to a modifier. Populate this matrix with numerical values extracted from the SMILES strings, facilitating statistical analysis and model building.

- **Advice 8**: **Integrate Machine Learning for Rule Refinement**  
  Use machine learning algorithms to analyze the numerical feature matrix and identify patterns correlated with high or low yield. This data-driven approach can uncover important features that may have been overlooked and help refine the rules further.

- **Advice 9**: **Validate Rules with Cross-Validation on the Dataset**  
  Apply the revised rules to the existing dataset and perform cross-validation to assess their predictive accuracy. Adjust the rules based on the validation results to improve their reliability and generalizability.

- **Advice 10**: **Document & Standardize Feature Extraction Procedures**  
  Clearly document the methods for calculating each descriptor, including any software or algorithms used. Standardization ensures consistency in feature extraction and makes the process reproducible for new modifiers.

**Conclusion:**

These rules provide a systematic framework for predicting whether a molecular modifier will result in a high or low yield in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization of aliphatic alcohols. By focusing on combinations of functional groups and considering underlying physicochemical properties, the rules offer clear guidance for designing or selecting modifiers to optimize reaction yield.

- **Balance Between Coverage and Specificity**:
  - The rules strike a balance between broad applicability and specificity, covering a wide range of the dataset while incorporating detailed chemical insights.
  - Simple rules with higher coverage (e.g., Rules 1–4) ensure general applicability, whereas complex rules with lower coverage (e.g., Rules 12–15) provide specificity for particular cases.

- **Practical Utility**:
  - Researchers can utilize these rules to predict the performance of new molecular modifiers or to design modifiers with desired properties, potentially improving catalyst performance and reaction efficiency.
  - Understanding the relationship between modifier structure and reaction yield aids in rational catalyst design.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Quantify Functional Groups**  
  Revise the rules to focus on counting specific functional groups within the modifiers. For example, instead of stating "modifiers that are α-amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxylic acid groups predict a high yield," specify that modifiers with **2 or more carboxylic acid groups and at least one amino group** predict a high yield. This allows for numerical representation (e.g., counting the number of carboxylate and amino groups) directly from the SMILES strings.

- **Advice 2**: **Use Computable Molecular Descriptors**  
  Incorporate molecular descriptors that can be calculated from SMILES strings using cheminformatics tools. Descriptors such as **molecular weight**, **LogP (partition coefficient)**, **topological polar surface area (TPSA)**, **hydrogen bond donors (HBD)**, **hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA)**, and **rotatable bond count** can be represented numerically and included in a feature matrix for modeling.

- **Advice 3**: **Define Clear Numerical Thresholds**  
  Establish specific numerical thresholds for chain lengths and ring sizes. For example, specify that **aliphatic chains with exactly 5 or fewer carbons predict a high yield**, and those with **7 or more carbons predict a low yield**. This eliminates ambiguity and allows for direct numerical encoding from the molecular structure.

- **Advice 4**: **Binary Encoding of Structural Features**  
  Convert qualitative descriptions into binary features that indicate the presence (1) or absence (0) of specific substructures or functional groups. For instance, create binary variables for features like **"has aromatic ring"**, **"contains electron-withdrawing group at para position"**, **"has thiol group attached to aliphatic chain"**, etc.

- **Advice 5**: **Utilize SMARTS Patterns for Substructure Search**  
  Develop a set of SMARTS patterns corresponding to the functional groups and structural motifs in the rules. Use these patterns to automatically scan the SMILES strings and generate numerical features based on the presence or count of these substructures.

- **Advice 6**: **Quantify Electronic Effects with Calculated Properties**  
  Instead of qualitatively describing electronic effects (e.g., electron-withdrawing or -donating groups), calculate electronic descriptors such as **Hammett sigma constants**, **atomic charges**, or **electronegativity indices**. These numerical values can capture the electronic influence of substituents on the carboxylate oxygen's ability to coordinate.

- **Advice 7**: **Break Down Complex Rules into Independent Features**  
  Decompose rules that combine multiple criteria into individual features. For example, separate "Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituents capable of coordinating to the metal center predict a high yield" into two features: **"aromatic carboxylic acid"** and **"para-substituent capable of metal coordination"**, each encoded numerically.

- **Advice 8**: **Include Steric Descriptors**  
  Quantify steric effects by calculating descriptors such as **molar refractivity**, **van der Waals volume**, or **Sterimol parameters**. These descriptors numerically represent the bulkiness of substituents and can be included in the feature matrix to account for steric hindrance.

- **Advice 9**: **Calculate Flexibility Indicators**  
  Represent molecular flexibility through descriptors like **number of rotatable bonds**, **torsion angles**, or **flexibility indices**. This directly quantifies the flexibility mentioned in rules related to chain length and ether linkages.

- **Advice 10**: **Prioritize Features Based on Impact**  
  Assign weights or prioritize features based on their known impact on yield. For instance, if the presence of an amino group has a greater influence on yield than chain length, reflect this in the numerical representation by assigning higher weights or creating interaction terms in the feature matrix.

- **Advice 11**: **Standardize Functional Group Definitions**  
  Clearly define the functional groups with precise chemical definitions to avoid ambiguity. For example, specify that "electron-withdrawing groups" refer to substituents with a Hammett sigma parameter greater than a certain value, which can be numerically assigned based on substituent type.

- **Advice 12**: **Automate Feature Extraction**  
  Use cheminformatics software or programming libraries (e.g., RDKit) to automate the extraction of numerical features from SMILES strings. Create scripts or workflows that consistently process the dataset and generate the feature matrix required for modeling.

- **Advice 13**: **Integrate Solvation and Hydrophobicity Descriptors**  
  Include descriptors that account for solvation effects and hydrophobic interactions, such as **octanol-water partition coefficient (LogP)** and **hydration energy**. These properties can affect the modifier's interaction with the catalyst environment and are computable from SMILES.

- **Advice 14**: **Consider Multivariate Interactions**  
  Explore potential interactions between features by including product terms or performing multivariate analysis. For example, the combined effect of chain length and presence of an amino group might be significant and can be captured numerically.

- **Advice 15**: **Validate and Refine Rules Using Statistical Methods**  
  Use statistical techniques such as **principal component analysis (PCA)** or **partial least squares regression (PLS)** to identify the most significant features influencing yield. This data-driven approach can help refine the rules and ensure they are grounded in quantifiable evidence.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Improve Coverage by Combining or Refining Rules with Limited Data Support**

  - **Action**: For rules supported by only one data point (e.g., Rules 4, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, and 15), combine them with similar rules or expand their criteria to encompass more data points from the dataset.
  
  - **Example**: Combine Rule 4 (aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths between 5 and 8 carbons) with Rule 6 (aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrocarbon chains) to create a broader rule covering all aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 5 or more carbons, predicting a **high yield**.

- **Advice 2**: **Refine Rules to Enhance Clarity and Specificity**

  - **Action**: For rules that lack clarity or are too broad (e.g., Rule 15), refine the definitions to be more precise, specifying exact structural features or functional groups that influence the yield.

  - **Example**: Redefine Rule 15 to specify which functional groups cause interference by stating: "Modifiers containing multiple bulky functional groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid, such as adjacent amide and sulfhydryl groups, predict a **low yield** due to steric hindrance."

- **Advice 3**: **Address Conflicting Data Points by Adjusting Rule Criteria**

  - **Action**: For rules that conflict with data in the dataset (e.g., Rule 12), re-examine and adjust the rule criteria or consider exceptions to account for discrepancies.

  - **Example**: Modify Rule 12 to acknowledge exceptions by stating: "Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with extended rigid structures generally predict a **low yield**, except when additional coordinating groups are present, such as ketone or hydroxyl groups, which can enhance coordination."

- **Advice 4**: **Enhance Physical-Chemical Insights in Rules**

  - **Action**: Provide deeper physicochemical explanations in rules lacking sufficient insight to strengthen their scientific basis and aid in rational modifier design.

  - **Example**: For Rule 6, elaborate by explaining: "Electron-donating groups decrease the acidity and increase the electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, reducing its ability to effectively coordinate with the metal center, thus predicting a **low yield**."

- **Advice 5**: **Increase Rule Complexity Where Appropriate to Capture Key Features**

  - **Action**: For simple rules with limited applicability, increase complexity by incorporating additional structural or electronic factors that influence yield.

  - **Example**: Expand Rule 10 to include not only perfluorinated alkyl chains but also highly electron-deficient systems: "Modifiers with strongly electron-withdrawing groups attached to the carboxylic acid, such as perfluorinated alkyl chains or multiple halogens, predict a **low yield** due to decreased basicity of the carboxylate oxygen."

- **Advice 6**: **Prioritize Project Manager's Feedback by Optimizing Existing Rules**

  - **Action**: Focus on improving current rules based on feedback rather than adding new ones, ensuring they meet clarity, coverage, and complexity requirements.

  - **Example**: Reassess all rules to ensure they are supported by at least two data points, provide clear definitions, and include significant physicochemical reasoning as per the Project Manager's priorities.

- **Advice 7**: **Merge Similar Rules to Simplify and Strengthen the Rule Set**

  - **Action**: Identify rules with overlapping criteria or similar chemical reasoning and merge them to improve coverage and reduce redundancy.

  - **Example**: Combine Rules 13 and 14, which both involve thiol-containing modifiers, into a single rule that differentiates based on the thiol's context: "Modifiers containing thiol groups predict varying yields depending on the linkage; aliphatic thiols (e.g., **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**) predict a **high yield**, while aromatic thiols (e.g., **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**) predict a **low yield** due to delocalization of the thiol electron pair."

- **Advice 8**: **Include Counterexamples to Highlight Rule Limitations**

  - **Action**: For each rule, provide counterexamples where applicable to illustrate the rule's boundaries and help users recognize exceptions.

  - **Example**: In Rule 3, after listing examples predicting a **high yield**, add a counterexample: "However, **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**, despite containing a pyridine ring, predicts a **low yield** due to increased rigidity preventing optimal coordination."

- **Advice 9**: **Standardize Rule Terminology and Format for Consistency**

  - **Action**: Ensure all rules use consistent chemical nomenclature and follow a uniform structure to facilitate understanding and application.

  - **Example**: Begin each rule with "Modifiers that are..." followed by the structural criteria, and consistently italicize or bold chemical terms for emphasis.

- **Advice 10**: **Validate and Update Rules Based on Additional Data Analysis**

  - **Action**: Perform a thorough analysis of the dataset to identify any overlooked patterns or inconsistencies, updating rules accordingly to improve predictive accuracy.

  - **Example**: Re-express or split rules if new patterns emerge, such as separating aromatic carboxylic acids with ortho-substituents into different rules based on the type of substituent and its impact on hydrogen bonding or steric hindrance.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains containing carboxylic acid groups** predict a **high yield**. The presence of multiple carboxylate groups enhances coordination with the metal center.
   - *Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid), **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid).

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)** predict a **high yield**. EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxylate, improving metal coordination.
   - *Examples*: **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic heterocyclic carboxylic acids with the carboxylate directly attached to a pyridine ring**, allowing for effective coordination, predict a **high yield**. The pyridine nitrogen acts as an additional coordination site.
   - *Examples*: **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**.

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths between 5 and 8 carbons and lacking additional coordinating groups** predict a **high yield**. The hydrophobic chain may favorably interact with the catalyst environment.
   - *Example*: **octanoic acid**.

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **ω-amino acids with chain lengths of 7 or more carbons** predict a **low yield**. Longer chains and amino groups may introduce steric hindrance and reduce effective coordination.
   - *Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-donating groups (EDGs) lacking additional coordination sites** predict a **low yield**. EDGs decrease carboxylate acidity, hindering metal coordination.
   - *Examples*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing **flexible polyether chains terminating with a carboxylic acid group** predict a **low yield**. The flexibility and solvation of ether linkages reduce effective coordination.
   - *Example*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with ortho-substituents capable of intramolecular hydrogen bonding or causing steric hindrance** predict a **low yield**. These effects limit the availability of the carboxylate for coordination.
   - *Examples*: **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**, **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**.

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with hydrophobic aromatic side chains lacking coordinating functionalities** predict a **low yield**. The absence of additional coordination sites reduces interaction with the metal center.
   - *Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine).

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **perfluorinated alkyl chains attached to carboxylic acid groups** predict a **low yield**. Strong electron-withdrawing effects decrease carboxylate basicity, hindering coordination.
    - *Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers with **bulky substituents or multiple functional groups causing steric hindrance and lacking additional coordinating groups** predict a **low yield**. Steric factors impede effective metal interaction.
    - *Examples*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**, **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**.

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids extended with additional aromatic rings leading to increased rigidity** predict a **low yield**. Structural rigidity can prevent optimal alignment for coordination.
    - *Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers containing **thiol groups attached to short aliphatic chains (three carbons or fewer) along with a carboxylic acid group** predict a **high yield**. Thiol groups act as additional coordination sites.
    - *Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers containing **thiol groups attached to aromatic rings with carboxylic acid groups** predict a **low yield**. Aromatic systems may delocalize the thiol electron pair, reducing coordination.
    - *Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids connected via aliphatic chains of five carbons or more to hydroxyphenyl groups** predict a **high yield**. The extended chain allows for better interaction with the metal center.
    - *Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Expand the Electron-Withdrawing Group (EWG) SMARTS patterns in Rule 2 to include additional substituents like halomethyl groups.**

  - **Issue**: In Rule 2, the current EWG patterns are:

    ```python
    ewg_patterns = ['[F,Cl,Br,I]', '[CX3](=[OX1])[NX3](=O)[OX1-]', '[CX4](F)(F)F']  # Halogens, nitro, trifluoromethyl
    ```

    These patterns do not capture substituents such as bromomethyl (`-CH₂Br`), which is an EWG in the context of the rule.

  - **Suggestion**: Add SMARTS patterns to include halomethyl groups and other relevant EWGs:

    ```python
    ewg_patterns = [
        '[F,Cl,Br,I]',  # Halogens
        '[CX3](=[OX1])[NX3](=O)[OX1-]',  # Nitro group
        '[CX4](F)(F)F',  # Trifluoromethyl
        '[CH2][F,Cl,Br,I]',  # Halomethyl groups
        '[CX3](=[OX1])[CX3](=[OX1])[OX2H0]',  # Carboxyl groups
        '[SX4](=O)(=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]',  # Sulfonyl groups
    ]
    ```

    This adjustment ensures that substituents like bromomethyl are recognized as EWGs, aligning the code with the natural language rule.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Modify Rule 2 to ensure that the EWG is in the para position relative to the carboxylic acid group.**

  - **Issue**: The code does not currently enforce the position of the EWG on the aromatic ring.

  - **Suggestion**: Adjust the SMARTS patterns to specify that the EWG is para to the carboxylic acid:

    ```python
    # Define a pattern for aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted EWGs
    para_ewg_aromatic_acid = 'c1cc([F,Cl,Br,I,$(N(=O)=O),$(C(F)(F)F)])ccc1[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'
    ```

    Replace the patterns in Rule 2 with this specific pattern to ensure accurate matching.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Refine the Electron-Donating Group (EDG) SMARTS patterns in Rule 6 to prevent false positives.**

  - **Issue**: The current EDG patterns may inadvertently match unintended functional groups, leading to incorrect classifications.

    ```python
    edg_patterns = ['[OX2H]', '[OX2][#6]', '[NX3;H2,H1][#6]']  # Hydroxyl, alkoxy, amino groups
    ```

  - **Suggestion**: Make the patterns more specific to EDGs in the para position:

    ```python
    # Define a pattern for aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted EDGs
    para_edg_aromatic_acid = 'c1cc([OX2H,$(OC),$(NC)])ccc1[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'
    ```

    Update Rule 6 to use this pattern, ensuring that only the intended molecules are matched.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Correct the side chain carboxylic acid pattern in Rule 1 to ensure accurate matching of α-amino acids with side-chain carboxylic acids.**

  - **Issue**: The current pattern for side-chain carboxylic acids:

    ```python
    side_chain_carboxylic_acid = '[C;!$(C=O)][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'
    ```

    is too general and may match carboxylic acids not on the side chain.

  - **Suggestion**: Restrict the pattern to side chains attached to the α-carbon of amino acids:

    ```python
    side_chain_carboxylic_acid = '[NX3;H2][CX4H]([C;X4][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'
    ```

    This ensures that only α-amino acids with side-chain carboxylic acids are matched.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Check and adjust the exclusion of additional coordinating groups in Rule 4.**

  - **Issue**: The exclude patterns for Rule 4 may not comprehensively prevent molecules with additional coordinating groups from being matched.

    ```python
    'exclude_patterns': ['[NX3]', '[OX2]', '[SX2]', '[PX3]', '[FX1]', '[ClX1]', '[BrX1]', '[IX1]']
    ```

  - **Suggestion**: Ensure that these exclude patterns are comprehensive and accurately prevent molecules with any additional coordinating groups from being matched. Consider using more general patterns or including more functional groups as needed.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Update the patterns for Rule 9 to specifically target α-amino acids with hydrophobic aromatic side chains lacking coordinating functionalities.**

  - **Issue**: The current pattern may not accurately capture the lack of coordinating functionalities.

    ```python
    alpha_amino_acid_aromatic_side_chain = '[NX3;H2][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])[c]'
    ```

  - **Suggestion**: Refine the pattern to include only aromatic side chains without coordinating groups:

    ```python
    alpha_amino_acid_aromatic_side_chain = '[NX3;H2][CX4H]([c][CX4H])[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'
    ```

    This pattern ensures that only the intended amino acids are matched.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Ensure that Rule 5 accurately matches ω-amino acids with chain lengths of 7 or more carbons.**

  - **Issue**: The pattern for ω-amino acids may not be specific to chain lengths of 7 or more carbons.

    ```python
    omega_amino_acid = '[NX3;H2][C;X4]CCCCCC[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'
    ```

  - **Suggestion**: Adjust the pattern to explicitly specify chain lengths of 7 or more carbons:

    ```python
    omega_amino_acid = '[NX3;H2][C;X4]C{6,}[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'  # At least 7 carbons in the chain
    ```

    Use repetitive patterns or specify a range for the number of carbon atoms in the chain.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Add stereochemistry considerations where necessary.**

  - **Issue**: Some SMILES strings include stereochemistry (e.g., `C[C@H](C(=O)O)N`), but the SMARTS patterns may not account for stereochemistry, potentially affecting matches.

  - **Suggestion**: Include stereochemistry-aware patterns if the stereochemistry is relevant to the rules, or explicitly specify that stereochemistry should be ignored when matching.

    ```python
    mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smi, sanitize=False)
    Chem.SanitizeMol(mol)
    ```

    Use `sanitize=False` to control stereochemistry handling during parsing.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Improve error handling to provide informative messages during pattern matching.**

  - **Issue**: The current code appends zeros in case of errors without indicating the cause, which can hinder debugging.

  - **Suggestion**: Implement try-except blocks that log or print informative error messages:

    ```python
    try:
        # Pattern matching code
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error matching rule {rule['number']} for SMILES '{smi}': {e}")
        row.append(0)
    ```

    This will help identify and fix issues during pattern matching.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Validate the compiled SMARTS patterns before using them for matching.**

  - **Issue**: Invalid SMARTS patterns can cause unexpected behavior or errors during matching.

  - **Suggestion**: Add validation steps to ensure that all SMARTS patterns are correctly compiled:

    ```python
    for pat in rule.get('patterns', []):
        mol_pat = Chem.MolFromSmarts(pat)
        if mol_pat is None:
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid SMARTS pattern in rule {rule['number']}: {pat}")
        compiled_patterns.append(mol_pat)
    ```

    This proactive approach prevents the use of invalid patterns.

- **Suggestion 11**: **Ensure consistency in hydrogen atom specifications in SMARTS patterns.**

  - **Issue**: Inconsistent use of hydrogen specifications (`H`, `H1`, `H2`, etc.) may lead to incorrect matches.

  - **Suggestion**: Review and standardize hydrogen specifications across all patterns to ensure accurate matching.

- **Suggestion 12**: **Test the SMARTS patterns individually with known examples to verify their accuracy.**

  - **Suggestion**: Create a test suite where each pattern is tested against molecules that should match and should not match. This will help confirm that the patterns are functioning as intended.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics:**

The current set of rules demonstrates promising improvements in terms of **confidence** and **lift** compared to the reference metrics from previous iterations. Below is a detailed analysis:

---

**1. Confidence:**

- **Current Average Train Confidence:** Approximately **0.6756**
- **Previous Average Train Confidence:** Approximately **0.5874**

*Interpretation:*

The current rules have a higher average confidence, indicating that when the rule conditions are met, there is a **67.56%** chance that the prediction (high or low yield) is correct. This is an improvement over the previous confidence levels, suggesting that the current rules are more reliable in their predictions when they apply.

---

**2. Lift:**

- **Current Average Train Lift:** Approximately **1.3558**
- **Previous Average Train Lift:** Approximately **1.1304**

*Interpretation:*

A lift value greater than 1 indicates that the occurrence of the rule condition increases the likelihood of the prediction compared to random chance. The current average lift of **1.3558** signifies a stronger association between the rule conditions and the outcomes than the previous average lift. This improvement means that the current rules are more effective at identifying relationships that lead to the predicted yields.

---

**3. Support:**

- **Current Average Train Support:** Approximately **0.0305**
- **Previous Average Train Support:** Approximately **0.1756**

*Interpretation:*

The current rules have significantly lower support compared to previous iterations. A support of **3.05%** means that the rules cover a small portion of the dataset. While high confidence and lift are desirable, low support indicates that the rules are applicable to fewer cases, which may limit their practical utility in broader applications.

---

**4. Leverage:**

- **Current Average Train Leverage:** Approximately **0.0064**
- **Previous Average Train Leverage:** Approximately **0.0124**

*Interpretation:*

Leverage measures the improvement over random chance. The current leverage is positive but lower than before, suggesting a modest improvement in predictive capability. However, since some previous leverage values were negative, the positive value in the current rules is still a favorable outcome.

---

**Overall Assessment:**

The current rules are **more specific**, evidenced by higher confidence and lift but lower support. They are better at predicting the correct outcome when applicable but apply to fewer instances in the dataset.

---

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules:**

To enhance the performance and practicality of the current rules, the following strategies are recommended:

**1. Increase Rule Support While Maintaining Confidence and Lift:**

- **Generalize Rule Conditions:**
  - **Broaden Specific Criteria:** Identify overly specific conditions that limit the applicability of rules. For instance, if a rule applies only to modifiers with exact chain lengths, consider expanding the acceptable range.
  - **Example Improvement:** Combine similar functional groups or chemical structures into broader categories. For example, grouping modifiers with carboxylic acid groups regardless of chain length if they exhibit similar behavior.

- **Merge Similar Rules:**
  - **Identify Overlaps:** Look for rules that predict the same outcome and have similar conditions. Merging them can increase support.
  - **Example:** Rules 1 and 3 both involve modifiers that enhance coordination with the metal center through carboxylic acid groups. Combining these could create a rule with higher support.

**2. Refine Rules with Low Confidence or Lift:**

- **Reevaluate Rule Conditions:**
  - **Modify or Remove Ineffective Rules:** Rules with confidence close to 50% (e.g., Rule 5 with 53.33% confidence) contribute little to predictive power and may introduce uncertainty.
  - **Adjust Conditions:** For such rules, consider adding additional conditions or constraints that improve their confidence and lift.

- **Eliminate Redundant or Contradictory Rules:**
  - **Consistency Check:** Ensure that rules do not contradict each other or predict different outcomes for similar conditions.
  - **Simplify Rule Set:** A smaller set of high-performing rules can be more effective than a larger set of mediocre ones.

**3. Balance Specificity and Generality:**

- **Optimize Rule Granularity:**
  - **Avoid Overfitting:** Highly specific rules may not generalize well to new data.
  - **Aim for General Applicability:** Rules should be specific enough to be accurate but general enough to apply to multiple instances.

- **Use Hierarchical Rule Structures:**
  - **Create Sub-Rules:** Develop broader rules with high support and confidence, and use sub-rules to capture exceptions or specific cases.
  - **Example:** A general rule about aromatic carboxylic acids predicting high yield, with sub-rules specifying the effect of different substituents.

**4. Incorporate Additional Predictive Features:**

- **Include More Chemical Descriptors:**
  - **Expand Feature Set:** Consider other molecular properties such as electron density, steric factors, or hydrophobicity that may influence yield.
  - **Use Quantitative Measures:** Incorporate quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) to enhance rule conditions.

- **Apply Statistical and Machine Learning Techniques:**
  - **Feature Importance Analysis:** Use methods like decision trees or random forests to identify the most significant predictors.
  - **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly update rules based on new data and insights from these analyses.

**5. Validate and Test Rules with External Data:**

- **Use Test Datasets:**
  - **Assess Generalizability:** Ensure that rules perform well not just on training data but also on unseen data.
  - **Monitor Overfitting:** A significant drop in confidence or lift on test data indicates potential overfitting.

- **Cross-Validation:**
  - **K-Fold Validation:** Divide the dataset into k subsets and validate the rules across different folds to ensure stability.

**6. Continuous Iterative Refinement:**

- **Monitor Metrics After Changes:**
  - **Track Improvements:** After modifying rules, compare the new metrics to previous ones to assess the impact.
  - **Set Targets:** Aim for incremental improvements in support, confidence, and lift.

- **Collaborative Review:**
  - **Peer Feedback:** Have other team members review the rules for additional insights.
  - **Domain Expertise:** Consult with chemists or domain experts to ensure the chemical plausibility of the rules.

---

**Conclusion:**

The current rules have improved in terms of confidence and lift, indicating stronger predictive relationships when the rules apply. However, the low support suggests that the rules are too specific and cover a small portion of the dataset. By generalizing rule conditions, merging similar rules, and incorporating additional predictive features, we can increase the support while maintaining or improving confidence and lift.

Continuous refinement and validation are crucial. By balancing specificity with generality and leveraging statistical techniques, we can develop a more robust and practical set of rules that effectively predict catalytic performance across a broader range of cases.

Traditional Commenter Message:
**Comments on Accuracies of the Validation Set and Train Set:**

The previous models demonstrated consistent and relatively high validation accuracies around 0.76, with test accuracies of 0.75 and 0.625. In contrast, the current iteration shows a noticeable decrease in validation accuracy, starting at 0.514 and incrementally improving to 0.542, 0.571, and 0.6 before dropping back to 0.514. This decline suggests that the current set of rules used to generate the feature matrix may not be as effective as the previous ones.

The lower accuracies indicate that the model's ability to correctly predict the loading of modifiers on the catalyst has diminished. This could be due to several factors, including overfitting to the training data, underfitting, or the insufficiency of the current rules in capturing the necessary chemical features that influence catalyst loading.

**Analysis Based on SHAP Values Calculated on the Validation Set:**

The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis provides insights into how each rule influences the model's predictions for individual molecules. By examining the SHAP values, we can identify which rules contribute most significantly to incorrect predictions.

For molecules where the predicted loading is **low** but the experimental value is **high**, rules with high negative SHAP values for high loading are likely contributing to the underestimation. Conversely, for molecules where the predicted loading is **high** but the experimental value is **low**, rules with high positive SHAP values for high loading may be causing overestimation.

In the provided SHAP analysis, **Rule 15** consistently shows a negative SHAP value (-0.0198) for high loading across several molecules where the model underestimates the loading:

- *Example*: For molecule **C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N**, the predicted loading is low while the experimental value is high, and Rule 15 has a SHAP value of -0.0198.

This pattern suggests that Rule 15 might be contributing to the underprediction of catalyst loading in these cases.

Additionally, in earlier iterations, other rules (e.g., **Rule 6**, **Rule 8**, **Rule 9**, **Rule 10**, **Rule 14**, **Rule 16**) showed significant SHAP values, both positive and negative, indicating their influence on the predictions. For instance, in one iteration:

- **Rule 6** had a SHAP value of -0.0396 for multiple molecules where the model underpredicted the loading.
- **Rule 10**, **Rule 14**, and **Rule 16** had positive SHAP values, potentially contributing to overprediction in some cases.

**Recommendations for Improving the Current Rules:**

1. **Refine Rule 15**:

   - **Issue**: Rule 15 shows negative SHAP values in cases where the model underpredicts the catalyst loading for molecules with high experimental values.
   - **Action**: Re-express or adjust Rule 15 to better capture the chemical features associated with high loading. Consider if the rule is too general or misclassifying certain functional groups.

2. **Review Rules with High SHAP Contributions**:

   - Identify rules with consistently high positive SHAP values in overestimations and high negative SHAP values in underestimations.
   - **Examples**:
     - **Rule 6**: Negative SHAP values contributing to underestimations.
     - **Rule 10**: Positive SHAP values possibly leading to overestimations.
   - **Action**: Reassess these rules to determine if they are accurately representing the chemical characteristics that influence catalyst loading.

3. **Increase Rule Specificity**:

   - Some rules might be too broad, causing them to incorrectly influence the model's predictions.
   - **Action**: Make rules more specific by adding additional constraints or splitting them into sub-rules.
   - **Example**: If a rule applies to all aromatic carboxylic acids, but only certain substituents affect loading, specify those substituents in the rule.

4. **Incorporate Additional Coordinating Functionalities**:

   - Consider modifiers with functional groups not currently emphasized in the rules that may influence catalyst loading.
   - **Action**: Introduce new rules capturing the effects of such groups (e.g., phosphates, nitriles, or sulfonic acids).

5. **Analyze Overfitting or Underfitting**:

   - The decrease in accuracy may indicate overfitting to the training data or underfitting due to overly simplistic rules.
   - **Action**: Perform cross-validation and consider regularization techniques to enhance the model's generalizability.

6. **Review Chemical Insights and Literature**:

   - Revisit the chemical rationale behind each rule to ensure they are grounded in established chemical principles.
   - **Action**: Consult literature to identify additional factors affecting catalyst loading that may not be currently accounted for.

7. **Update or Remove Ineffective Rules**:

   - If certain rules consistently contribute to incorrect predictions, consider modifying or removing them.
   - **Action**: Use the SHAP analysis to guide which rules may be ineffective.

8. **Balance the Dataset**:

   - Ensure that the dataset has a balanced representation of high and low loading instances to prevent bias.
   - **Action**: If the dataset is imbalanced, consider data augmentation or resampling techniques.

9. **Use Feature Selection Methods**:

   - Apply statistical methods to identify the most significant features (rules) contributing to accurate predictions.
   - **Action**: Utilize techniques like recursive feature elimination to refine the feature set.

10. **Iterative Testing and Validation**:

    - Continue to iteratively test the model after making adjustments to the rules.
    - **Action**: Monitor validation accuracy and SHAP values after each iteration to assess improvements.

**Conclusion:**

The current set of rules appears to be less effective in predicting catalyst loading accurately, as evidenced by the decreased validation accuracies and the SHAP analysis. Focusing on refining rules that negatively impact predictions, like Rule 15, and enhancing rules that capture key chemical features can improve the model's performance. Incorporating more detailed chemical insights and ensuring that the rules are both specific and representative of the underlying chemistry will likely lead to better predictive accuracy.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

The current task involves optimizing a set of rules designed to predict the yield of a radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction of aliphatic alcohols. These rules are based on the structural properties of molecular modifiers as represented by their SMILES strings. The goal is to improve the predictive performance of these rules, as measured by metrics such as support, confidence, lift, and accuracy, without overfitting the model.

**Key Findings from Previous Iterations and Analyses**

1. **Performance Metrics**:
   - The current rules show **high confidence (67.56%)** and **lift (1.3558)**, indicating that when the rules apply, they are relatively reliable.
   - However, **support is low (3.05%)**, meaning the rules apply to a small portion of the dataset.
   - Validation accuracy has decreased compared to previous iterations, dropping to around **51-60%**, suggesting that the model's overall predictive ability has declined.

2. **SHAP Analysis**:
   - **Rule 15** consistently shows negative SHAP values for molecules where the predicted loading is low but the experimental value is high, indicating that this rule may be contributing to underprediction.
   - Other rules, such as **Rule 6**, **Rule 10**, and **Rule 16**, have been identified as potentially influencing incorrect predictions either by underestimating or overestimating the yield.

3. **Issues Identified in the Current Rules**:
   - Some SMARTS patterns within the rules may be too general or too specific, leading to misclassifications.
   - Certain functional groups and substituents (e.g., bromomethyl groups, electron-withdrawing/donating groups) are not adequately captured by the existing patterns.
   - There may be inconsistencies in hydrogen atom specifications, contributing to inaccurate pattern matching.
   - Overfitting may be occurring due to highly specific rules that do not generalize well to new data.

**Suggestions to Improve Current Rules**

1. **Refine SMARTS Patterns in Existing Rules**:

   - **Rule 2 (Electron-Withdrawing Groups)**:
     - **Issue**: The current EWG patterns do not include halomethyl groups (e.g., `-CH₂Br`), leading to missed matches.
     - **Action**: Expand EWG patterns to include halomethyl groups:
       ```python
       ewg_patterns = [
           '[F,Cl,Br,I]',  # Halogens
           '[CX3](=[OX1])[NX3](=O)[OX1-]',  # Nitro group
           '[CX4](F)(F)F',  # Trifluoromethyl
           '[CH2][F,Cl,Br,I]',  # Halomethyl groups
           '[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]',  # Carboxyl groups
           '[SX4](=O)(=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]',  # Sulfonyl groups
       ]
       ```
     - **Benefit**: This ensures modifiers like 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid are correctly classified as high-yield predictors.

   - **Rule 6 (Electron-Donating Groups)**:
     - **Issue**: EDG patterns may be too broad, leading to false positives.
     - **Action**: Refine EDG patterns to specifically target para-substituted EDGs:
       ```python
       para_edg_aromatic_acid = 'c1cc([OX2H,$(OC),$(NC)])ccc1[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'
       ```
     - **Benefit**: This reduces misclassification of modifiers that should not predict low yield.

   - **Rule 1 (α-Amino Acids with Side-Chain Carboxylic Acids)**:
     - **Issue**: The pattern may inadvertently match molecules without the intended structure.
     - **Action**: Update the pattern to accurately reflect side-chain carboxylic acids attached to α-amino acids:
       ```python
       side_chain_carboxylic_acid = '[NX3;H2][CX4H]([C;D3][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'
       ```
     - **Benefit**: Improves matching accuracy for modifiers like aspartic acid and glutamic acid.

   - **Rule 5 (ω-Amino Acids with Long Chains)**:
     - **Issue**: The pattern may not accurately capture chain lengths of 7 or more carbons.
     - **Action**: Specify chain lengths using repetition or ranges:
       ```python
       omega_amino_acid = '[NX3;H2][C;X4]C{6,}[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'
       ```
     - **Benefit**: Ensures only ω-amino acids with the desired chain length are matched.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

Yes, there is a significant possibility for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. The following points support this conclusion:

- **Low Support Indicates Underfitting**: The low support for the current rules suggests that they are not capturing enough of the dataset, which is a sign of underfitting rather than overfitting. By refining the rules to cover more instances while maintaining high confidence and lift, we can improve the model's performance.

- **Adjusting Rather Than Adding Complexity**: The suggested optimizations focus on refining existing patterns and correcting issues rather than adding unnecessary complexity. This approach mitigates the risk of overfitting.

- **Data-Driven Adjustments**: The recommendations are based on analyses of model performance metrics and SHAP values, ensuring that changes are informed by evidence of their potential impact.

- **Chemical Plausibility**: Maintaining alignment with chemical principles ensures that the rules remain generalizable and applicable to unseen data.

**Conclusion**

By implementing the above suggestions, we can enhance the predictive performance of the rules, increase their applicability across the dataset, and reduce instances of incorrect predictions. The focus on refining patterns, adjusting rule conditions, and validating changes carefully will help optimize the rules without introducing overfitting.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **
- ** Advice 1 **: Refine the SMARTS patterns in **Rule 2** to include halomethyl groups as electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs). Expand the EWG patterns to capture modifiers like 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid by adding halomethyl groups to the list:
  ```python
  ewg_patterns = [
      '[F,Cl,Br,I]',  # Halogens
      '[CX3](=[OX1])[NX3](=O)[OX1-]',  # Nitro group
      '[CX4](F)(F)F',  # Trifluoromethyl
      '[CH2][F,Cl,Br,I]',  # Halomethyl groups
      '[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]',  # Carboxyl groups
      '[SX4](=O)(=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]',  # Sulfonyl groups
  ]
  ```
  This ensures that modifiers with halomethyl substituents are correctly classified as high-yield predictors.

- ** Advice 2 **: Refine the SMARTS patterns in **Rule 6** to more specifically target para-substituted electron-donating groups (EDGs) lacking additional coordination sites. Adjust the pattern to reduce false positives by focusing on common EDGs at the para position:
  ```python
  para_edg_aromatic_acid = 'c1ccc(cc1[OX2H,$(OC),$(NC)])[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'
  ```
  This modification enhances the accuracy of the rule by matching only modifiers that fit the specified criteria.

- ** Advice 3 **: Update the SMARTS pattern in **Rule 1** to accurately capture α-amino acids with side chains containing carboxylic acid groups. Ensure the pattern reflects the correct attachment of the side-chain carboxylic acid:
  ```python
  alpha_amino_acid_with_side_chain_carboxylate = '[NX3;H2][CX4H]([CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'
  ```
  This adjustment improves matching accuracy for modifiers like aspartic acid and glutamic acid.

- ** Advice 4 **: Adjust the SMARTS pattern in **Rule 5** to accurately capture ω-amino acids with chain lengths of 7 or more carbons. Specify the chain length using repetition in the pattern:
  ```python
  omega_amino_acid_long_chain = '[NX3;H2][C;X4][C;X4]{5,}[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'
  ```
  This ensures only ω-amino acids with chains of the specified length are matched, such as 7-aminoheptanoic acid and 8-aminooctanoic acid.

- ** Advice 5 **: Reevaluate **Rule 15** due to its negative impact on predictions. Consider removing or revising the rule to align with experimental data. If retained, ensure the SMARTS pattern accurately reflects modifiers that lead to high yield without causing underprediction.

- ** Advice 6 **: Merge similar rules to increase support and generality. For instance, combine **Rule 1** and **Rule 3** into a single rule that captures modifiers with carboxylic acid groups coordinating to the metal center through additional sites like amino or pyridine nitrogen atoms.

- ** Advice 7 **: Generalize rules where chemically justified. Expand rules predicting high yield with aromatic carboxylic acids to include substituted positions beyond para, such as ortho and meta, if they contribute positively to coordination and yield.

- ** Advice 8 **: Incorporate additional coordinating functional groups into the SMARTS patterns, such as phosphates, nitriles, or sulfonic acids, which may enhance metal coordination and catalytic activity. This broadens the scope of modifiers considered.

- ** Advice 9 **: Ensure consistent hydrogen specifications in all SMARTS patterns. Use explicit hydrogen counts to accurately represent the intended molecular structures and prevent misclassification due to hydrogen count inconsistencies.

- ** Advice 10 **: Validate and test each SMARTS pattern individually. Create a test suite with positive and negative examples to confirm that each pattern correctly matches intended modifiers and excludes incorrect ones, improving overall rule reliability.

- ** Advice 11 **: Enhance error handling and pattern validation in the rule generation process. Implement checks to detect and report invalid or ambiguous SMARTS patterns, facilitating debugging and preventing model errors.

- ** Advice 12 **: Incorporate stereochemistry into SMARTS patterns where relevant. Specify stereocenters in patterns when stereochemistry affects coordination and yield, improving matching accuracy for chiral modifiers.

- ** Advice 13 **: Use data-driven adjustments based on performance metrics and SHAP analysis. Prioritize revising rules identified as sources of significant mispredictions to improve model accuracy.

- ** Advice 14 **: Avoid overfitting by simplifying overly complex rules and ensuring that refinements are justified by chemical reasoning. Focus on adjustments that enhance generalizability without unnecessary complexity.

- ** Advice 15 **: Continuously update and refine the rules based on new data and insights. Regular reassessment ensures the model remains accurate and adapts to new findings, maintaining its predictive performance.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and well-defined, describing α-amino acids with side chains terminating in carboxylic acid groups predicting high yield. The property insight is strong, explaining that additional carboxylates enhance metal coordination. It combines multiple structural features and is supported by at least two data points (aspartic acid and glutamic acid), providing good coverage.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 clearly states that aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted EWGs predict high yield, with the insight that EWGs increase carboxylate acidity to improve metal coordination. While examples like 4-nitrobenzoic acid support the rule, exceptions such as 4-formylbenzoic acid (which has a para-EWG but yields low) suggest the rule might not account for all EWGs. Coverage is moderate, and the rule could benefit from refinement to exclude certain EWGs.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear, indicating that aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted EDGs predict low yield due to decreased carboxylate acidity hindering coordination. This rule combines structural features and is supported by multiple data points (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid), providing strong coverage.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear and offers solid property insight into how intramolecular hydrogen bonding from ortho-hydroxyl or ortho-formyl groups limits carboxylate availability, predicting low yield. It combines multiple substructures and is well-supported by data points like 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid and 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid, ensuring good coverage.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 provides a clear description of aromatic heterocyclic carboxylic acids with pyridine rings directly attached to the carboxylate group predicting high yield due to the pyridine nitrogen acting as an additional coordination site. The rule is complex and supported by data points such as pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid, offering good coverage.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear, stating that aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths between 5 and 8 carbons lacking additional functional groups predict high yield due to favorable hydrophobic interactions. However, coverage is limited to a single data point (octanoic acid), suggesting the need for additional supporting examples to strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 clearly explains that ω-amino acids with chain lengths of 7 carbons or more predict low yield because terminal amino groups and longer chains introduce steric hindrance. It combines structural features and is well-supported by data points such as 7-aminoheptanoic acid and 8-aminooctanoic acid, ensuring good coverage.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear and provides property insight into how flexible polyether chains reduce effective coordination, predicting low yield. However, with only one supporting data point (2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid), the rule lacks sufficient coverage and would benefit from additional examples.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear in stating that α-amino acids with hydrophobic aromatic side chains lacking additional coordinating groups predict low yield due to the absence of coordination sites. Coverage is limited to a single example (phenylalanine), indicating the need for more data points to strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 clearly describes that modifiers with thiol groups attached to short aliphatic chains and a carboxylic acid group predict high yield because thiol groups provide additional coordination sites. The rule is complex but only supported by one data point (3-sulfanylpropanoic acid), suggesting more examples are needed for robust coverage.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is clear, with property insight explaining that perfluorinated alkyl chains decrease carboxylate basicity, hindering coordination and predicting low yield. Coverage is limited to a single data point (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), so additional examples are necessary for stronger support.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 provides a clear description but may overlap with other rules (like Rule 5) due to the inclusion of additional aromatic rings. The property insight about steric hindrance is plausible, but coverage is limited to one data point (4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid), highlighting a need for refinement and more supporting data.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear, explaining that α-amino acids with side chains containing indole rings predict high yield via π-interactions enhancing coordination. The rule is supported by a single example (tryptophan), indicating that more data points are required for adequate coverage.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 clearly states that modifiers with aromatic carboxylic acids connected via long aliphatic chains to hydroxyphenyl groups predict high yield. The property insight about improved interaction is sound, but the rule is only backed by one data point (5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid), pointing to insufficient coverage.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 is clear and offers property insight on how thiol groups in aromatic systems may delocalize electron pairs, reducing coordination and predicting low yield. However, with only one supporting example (4-sulfanylbenzoic acid), the rule lacks adequate coverage.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Refine Rule 2 to Account for Exceptions**  
  While Rule 2 states that *aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) predict a high yield*, there are exceptions like **4-formylbenzoic acid** that yield low. Consider specifying which EWGs enhance yield (e.g., nitro, halogens) and excluding others (e.g., formyl groups). Update the rule to reflect that only strong EWGs that significantly increase carboxylate acidity lead to high yields.

- **Advice 2**: **Increase Coverage for Rules with Limited Data Points**  
  Rules such as 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 are supported by only one data point each. To improve their robustness:
  - **Merge Similar Rules**: Combine rules that share underlying property insights to enhance coverage. For example, merge Rules 10 and 13 regarding thiol-containing modifiers.
  - **Broaden Rule Criteria**: Expand the criteria to include more compounds from the dataset. For instance, adjust Rule 6 to include aliphatic carboxylic acids with varying chain lengths if they also lack additional coordinating groups.

- **Advice 3**: **Reevaluate and Consolidate Overlapping Rules**  
  Rules 5 and 12 both address aromatic carboxylic acids with structural features that affect coordination (heterocyclic rings and rigidity). Consider consolidating these rules into one that accounts for both heterocyclic systems and extended aromatic structures, specifying how rigidity and heteroatoms influence yield.

- **Advice 4**: **Address Contradictory Data Points within Rules**  
  Identify and incorporate exceptions or contradictory data into the rules:
  - For example, **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** yields high despite Rule 12 predicting low yield for rigid multi-ring structures. Modify the rule to account for the presence of additional coordination sites like heteroatoms that may override the effects of rigidity.

- **Advice 5**: **Ensure Each Rule Meets the Coverage Criterion**  
  Strengthen the rules by ensuring each is supported by at least two data points:
  - Reassess rules with limited support and either find additional examples from the dataset or adjust the rule criteria to encompass more compounds.
  - For instance, expand Rule 13 to include other thiol-containing modifiers or combine it with Rule 10 to meet the coverage requirement.

- **Advice 6**: **Incorporate Steric and Electronic Factors into Combined Rules**  
  Many rules address steric hindrance and electronic effects separately. Create comprehensive rules that consider both factors:
  - Develop a rule that states: *Modifiers with functional groups that cause steric hindrance or reduce electron density on coordination sites predict low yield*.
  - Use this rule to explain low yields for bulky modifiers or those with strong electron-withdrawing groups that decrease basicity (e.g., perfluorinated acids in Rule 11).

- **Advice 7**: **Clarify Functional Group Effects and Their Positional Influence**  
  Emphasize the importance of functional group positions on aromatic rings:
  - Differentiate between ortho-, meta-, and para-substitutions and how they affect intramolecular interactions and coordination ability.
  - Refine rules to specify these positional effects, enhancing predictive accuracy.

- **Advice 8**: **Utilize Quantitative Property Relationships Where Applicable**  
  Where possible, incorporate quantitative measures such as pKa values or Hammett constants to define the influence of substituents on carboxylate acidity and coordination ability:
  - This approach can help refine rules like Rule 2 and Rule 3 by providing a threshold for when substituents shift the yield outcome.

- **Advice 9**: **Update Rules Based on Property Insights Rather Than Specific Examples**  
  Focus on the underlying chemical principles that govern yield rather than specific compounds:
  - This will make rules more generalizable and applicable to new modifiers.
  - For example, rephrase rules to emphasize that *modifiers enhance yield when they increase the electron density on coordination sites without introducing steric hindrance*.

- **Advice 10**: **Validate and Continuously Update Rules with New Data**  
  As more experimental data becomes available, revisit and adjust the rules to maintain their accuracy and relevance:
  - Encourage ongoing data collection and analysis to refine the rules.
  - Use statistical methods to assess the significance of each rule and its predictive power.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains terminating in carboxylic acid groups** predict a **high yield**. The presence of an additional carboxylate enhances coordination with the metal center.
   - *Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid), **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid).

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromo)** predict a **high yield**. These groups increase the acidity of the carboxylate, enhancing metal coordination.
   - *Examples*: **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.
   - *Exception*: Modifiers with para-formyl groups (e.g., **4-formylbenzoic acid**) predict a **low yield** due to potential interference with coordination.

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxyl)** predict a **low yield**. Electron-donating groups decrease carboxylate acidity, hindering metal coordination.
   - *Examples*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 5 to 8 carbons and lacking additional polar functional groups** predict a **high yield**. The hydrophobic chains favor interactions with the catalyst environment.
   - *Example*: **octanoic acid**.
   - *Counterexamples*: Modifiers with terminal polar groups (e.g., **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**) predict a **low yield** due to increased polarity interfering with coordination.

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **ω-amino acids with chain lengths of 7 carbons or more** predict a **low yield**. Terminal amino groups introduce polarity and potential steric hindrance, reducing coordination efficiency.
   - *Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing **aliphatic thiol groups along with a carboxylic acid group** predict a **high yield**. Thiol groups provide additional coordination sites to the metal center.
   - *Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups** predict a **low yield**. In aromatic systems, delocalization reduces the thiol's ability to coordinate effectively.
   - *Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with ortho-hydroxyl or ortho-formyl groups capable of intramolecular hydrogen bonding** predict a **low yield**. Intramolecular interactions limit the availability of the carboxylate for coordination.
   - *Example*: **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **flexible polyether chains terminating with a carboxylic acid group** predict a **low yield**. Ether linkages increase chain flexibility and solvation, reducing effective coordination with the metal.
   - *Example*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **perfluorinated alkyl chains attached to carboxylic acid groups** predict a **low yield**. Strong electron-withdrawing effects decrease carboxylate basicity, hindering coordination.
    - *Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains containing heteroaromatic rings capable of metal coordination** predict a **high yield**. Heteroatoms in the ring provide additional coordination sites.
    - *Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan).

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids extended with additional aromatic rings connected directly to the carboxylate group** predict a **low yield**. Increased steric hindrance and rigidity can prevent optimal alignment for coordination.
    - *Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with heterocyclic rings incorporated via aliphatic spacers** predict a **high yield**. The aliphatic spacer allows for flexible positioning of coordinating groups, enhancing interaction with the metal center.
    - *Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**.

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups** predict a **high yield**. Hydroxyl groups can enhance solubility and participate in hydrogen bonding, facilitating metal coordination.
    - *Example*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**.

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with hydrophobic side chains lacking additional coordinating groups** predict a **low yield**. The absence of side-chain coordination sites reduces metal interaction.
    - *Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine).

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains terminating in carboxylic acid groups** predict a **high yield**. The presence of an additional carboxylate enhances coordination with the metal center.
   - *Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid), **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid).

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromo)** predict a **high yield**. These groups increase the acidity of the carboxylate, enhancing metal coordination.
   - *Examples*: **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.
   - *Exception*: Modifiers with para-formyl groups (e.g., **4-formylbenzoic acid**) predict a **low yield** due to potential interference with coordination.

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxyl)** predict a **low yield**. Electron-donating groups decrease carboxylate acidity, hindering metal coordination.
   - *Examples*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 5 to 8 carbons and lacking additional polar functional groups** predict a **high yield**. The hydrophobic chains favor interactions with the catalyst environment.
   - *Example*: **octanoic acid**.
   - *Counterexamples*: Modifiers with terminal polar groups (e.g., **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**) predict a **low yield** due to increased polarity interfering with coordination.

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **ω-amino acids with chain lengths of 7 carbons or more** predict a **low yield**. Terminal amino groups introduce polarity and potential steric hindrance, reducing coordination efficiency.
   - *Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing **aliphatic thiol groups along with a carboxylic acid group** predict a **high yield**. Thiol groups provide additional coordination sites to the metal center.
   - *Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups** predict a **low yield**. In aromatic systems, delocalization reduces the thiol's ability to coordinate effectively.
   - *Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with ortho-hydroxyl or ortho-formyl groups capable of intramolecular hydrogen bonding** predict a **low yield**. Intramolecular interactions limit the availability of the carboxylate for coordination.
   - *Example*: **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **flexible polyether chains terminating with a carboxylic acid group** predict a **low yield**. Ether linkages increase chain flexibility and solvation, reducing effective coordination with the metal.
   - *Example*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **perfluorinated alkyl chains attached to carboxylic acid groups** predict a **low yield**. Strong electron-withdrawing effects decrease carboxylate basicity, hindering coordination.
    - *Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains containing heteroaromatic rings capable of metal coordination** predict a **high yield**. Heteroatoms in the ring provide additional coordination sites.
    - *Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan).

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids extended with additional aromatic rings connected directly to the carboxylate group** predict a **low yield**. Increased steric hindrance and rigidity can prevent optimal alignment for coordination.
    - *Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with heterocyclic rings incorporated via aliphatic spacers** predict a **high yield**. The aliphatic spacer allows for flexible positioning of coordinating groups, enhancing interaction with the metal center.
    - *Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**.

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups** predict a **high yield**. Hydroxyl groups can enhance solubility and participate in hydrogen bonding, facilitating metal coordination.
    - *Example*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid**.

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with hydrophobic side chains lacking additional coordinating groups** predict a **low yield**. The absence of side-chain coordination sites reduces metal interaction.
    - *Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine).

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For **Rule 1**, combine the counts of carboxylic acid and carboxylate groups to accurately detect molecules with at least two carboxyl groups. The current implementation counts `carboxylic_acid` and `carboxylate_anion` separately, each with a threshold of 2, which may miss molecules that have one carboxylic acid and one carboxylate group. Modify the `count_thresholds` to sum the counts of both groups together or adjust the patterns to match either form in a single pattern.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: In **Rule 2**, the SMARTS pattern `'c1cc([N+](=O)[O-]|Br)ccc1C(=O)O'` may not match all para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs). Expand the pattern to include other strong EWGs like cyano (`C#N`), trifluoromethyl (`C(F)(F)F`), and others. Adjust the pattern to `'c1ccc([$(N(=O)=O),Br,C#N,C(F)(F)F])cc1C(=O)O'`, ensuring the EWG is in the para position relative to the carboxylic acid.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For **Rule 3**, the SMARTS pattern `'c1cc([CH3,OCH3,OH])ccc1C(=O)O'` may not be correctly interpreted due to incorrect grouping. In SMARTS, use separate patterns for each substituent or use the logical OR operator correctly. Replace with `'c1cc([$([CH3]),$([OCH3]),$([OH])])ccc1C(=O)O'` to accurately represent para-substituted electron-donating groups (EDGs).

- ** Suggestion 4 **: In **Rule 4**, the pattern `'[CH3][CH2]{3,6}[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'` may not capture all aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 5 to 8 carbons, especially if branching occurs. Adjust the pattern to include both linear and branched chains, for example, `'C[C@@H]([CH2]){2,5}[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'`. Also, ensure that the `exclude_patterns` for terminal polar groups correctly exclude modifiers with amino, hydroxyl, or thiol groups at any position, not just terminal, by using patterns like `'[NX3;H2]', '[OX2H]', '[SX2H]'`.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: For **Rule 5**, confirm that the SMARTS pattern `'[NX3;H2][CH2]{6,}[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'` correctly identifies ω-amino acids with chain lengths of 7 carbons or more. Consider including potential protonation states or N-substituted amines by adjusting the pattern to `'[NX3;H2,H1][CH2]{6,}[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'`.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: In **Rule 6**, ensure that both the aliphatic thiol group and the carboxylic acid group are present on the same molecule. Combine the patterns into one that requires both functionalities, such as `'[CH2][SX2H][CH2][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'`, ensuring the thiol and carboxylic acid are correctly positioned relative to each other.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: For **Rule 7**, the pattern `'c1cc([SX2H])ccc1C(=O)O'` may only match thiol groups at specific positions on the aromatic ring. Generalize the pattern to `'c1cc([SX2H])ccc1C(=O)O'` or use a variable position pattern like `'c1ccc([SX2H])cc1C(=O)O'` to capture thiol groups at any position on the ring.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: In **Rule 8**, the pattern for ortho-hydroxyl or ortho-formyl groups `'[c][c]([OH,C=O])[c][c](C(=O)O)[c]'` may not accurately capture molecules with these groups. Separate the patterns for ortho-hydroxyl and ortho-formyl substitutions:
  - Ortho-hydroxyl: `'c1c([OH])cccc1C(=O)O'`
  - Ortho-formyl: `'c1c(C=O)cccc1C(=O)O'`
  Ensure these patterns accurately reflect the positions relative to the carboxylic acid.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: For **Rule 9**, the SMARTS pattern `'[#6](-O[#6]){2,}-C(=O)O'` may not capture all flexible polyether chains terminating with a carboxylic acid group. Adjust the pattern to include variable lengths and ensure the terminal carboxylic acid is correctly matched. Use a pattern like `'[CX4H2]-O-[CX4H2]-O-[CX4H2]-C(=O)[OX2H1]'` with appropriate repetition for longer chains.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: In **Rule 10**, refine the pattern for perfluorinated alkyl chains to accommodate varying chain lengths. Use a more general pattern like `'C(F)(F)(F)(F)*C(=O)O'` or include a repeating unit for CF2 groups: `'C(F)(F)([C](F)(F))*C(=O)O'`.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: For **Rule 11**, adjust the pattern to accurately identify α-amino acids with side chains containing heteroaromatic rings. Use a pattern like `'[NX3;H2][CH](C(=O)[OX2H1])[CH2][a][n,o,s]'` to capture amino acids like tryptophan and histidine.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: In **Rule 12**, expand the pattern to capture various structures of aromatic carboxylic acids extended with additional aromatic rings. Use patterns like `'c1ccc(c(c1)c2ccccc2)C(=O)O'` or `[c][c]([c][c][c][c][c][c])C(=O)O` to include different fused and biphenyl systems.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: For **Rule 13**, adjust the pattern to allow for aliphatic spacers of varying lengths between the aromatic ring and heterocyclic ring. Use a pattern like `'c1ccc(cc1)CC[n,o,s]2cccc2C(=O)O'`, where the spacer can be adjusted as needed.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: In **Rule 14**, the pattern `'[CX4]([OH])[CX4]([OH])[CX4]-C(=O)O'` may not capture all aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups. Use a more general pattern like `'[CX4;!$(C=O)]([OH])[CX4;!$(C=O)]([OH])[CX4;!$(C=O)]([OH])C(=O)O'` to match molecules with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups.

- ** Suggestion 15 **: For **Rule 15**, verify that the pattern `'[NX3;H2][CH](C(=O)O)[CH2][c]1[cH][cH][cH][cH][cH]1'` accurately matches α-amino acids with hydrophobic side chains like phenylalanine. Adjust the pattern to `'[NX3;H2][CH](C(=O)[OX2H1])[CH2][c]1[cH][cH][cH][cH][cH]1'` and ensure that it excludes side chains with additional coordinating groups.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify and Quantify Functional Group Effects**  
  Revise the rules to focus on quantifiable properties of functional groups that can be directly derived from SMILES strings. For example, instead of categorical terms like "strong electron-withdrawing groups," assign numerical values to substituents using parameters such as Hammett sigma constants or Taft steric parameters. This allows for the creation of a numeric feature matrix based on electronic and steric effects.

- **Advice 2**: **Consolidate Similar Rules Using Descriptors**  
  Combine rules that deal with similar structural motifs by using molecular descriptors. For instance, Rules 2 and 3 can be unified by introducing electronic descriptors that quantify the electron-donating or electron-withdrawing nature of substituents (e.g., substituent electronegativity or resonance effects). This approach reduces redundancy and streamlines the rules.

- **Advice 3**: **Introduce Quantitative Structure-Property Relationships (QSPRs)**  
  Incorporate QSPRs that relate molecular structure to reactivity and yield. Utilize descriptors such as LogP for hydrophobicity, polar surface area for polarity, and molecular weight. These descriptors can be calculated from SMILES strings and used to predict the impact on yield numerically.

- **Advice 4**: **Include Steric and Hydrophobic Parameters**  
  Add rules that account for steric hindrance and hydrophobic interactions quantitatively. Use parameters like Verloop steric parameters or molecular volume to represent steric effects. For hydrophobicity, include partition coefficients or hydrophobic fragment counts derived from the molecular structure.

- **Advice 5**: **Utilize Molecular Fingerprints and Machine Learning**  
  Generate molecular fingerprints (e.g., MACCS keys, Morgan fingerprints) from the SMILES strings to capture the presence of specific substructures. Employ machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and correlations between these fingerprints and the reaction yield, which can reveal new insights beyond the current rule set.

- **Advice 6**: **Revise Rules with Statistical Validation**  
  Reevaluate the existing rules by statistically analyzing the dataset to confirm their validity. Use regression analysis or decision tree methods to determine which molecular features most significantly impact yield. This data-driven approach can highlight which rules are most predictive and should be retained or modified.

- **Advice 7**: **Expand Rules to Cover Underrepresented Modifiers**  
  Identify modifiers in the dataset that do not fit well into the current rules and analyze their structural features. Develop new rules or adjust existing ones to account for these modifiers by incorporating features like ring size, heteroatom content, or flexibility.

- **Advice 8**: **Clarify and Standardize Functional Group Definitions**  
  Ensure that functional groups are consistently defined throughout the rules. For example, clearly distinguish between aliphatic and aromatic thiols or specify the nature of side chains in amino acids. This reduces ambiguity and improves the ability to generate features programmatically.

- **Advice 9**: **Incorporate Three-Dimensional Structural Considerations**  
  Where possible, include descriptors that account for three-dimensional molecular geometry, such as chirality centers or conformational flexibility. These can influence the coordination environment and, consequently, the reaction yield.

- **Advice 10**: **Provide Examples with Corresponding Descriptors**  
  For each rule, include examples with calculated descriptor values to illustrate how modifiers fit the rule quantitatively. This aids in the interpretation and application of the rules when generating numerical data.

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with ortho-substituted groups capable of intramolecular hydrogen bonding** (e.g., ortho-hydroxyl and ortho-formyl) predict a **low yield**. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding limits the availability of the carboxylate for coordination.
   - *Example*: **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with heterocyclic rings connected via aliphatic spacers** predict a **high yield**. The flexible spacer allows optimal positioning for coordination with the metal center.

** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify Rules into Quantifiable Descriptors**  
  Reframe the current rules by identifying key structural features that can be easily quantified. Replace qualitative descriptions with numerical counts or binary indicators. For example:
  - Instead of "modifiers with side chains containing additional carboxylic acid groups," specify "number of carboxylic acid groups > 1."
  - Use descriptors like "number of hydroxyl groups," "presence (1) or absence (0) of amino groups," "chain length (number of carbons)," etc.

- **Advice 2**: **Develop a Standardized Feature Set**  
  Create a comprehensive list of molecular descriptors applicable to all modifiers. Utilize cheminformatics software to calculate features such as:
  - **Physicochemical Properties**: Molecular weight, LogP (hydrophobicity), topological polar surface area (TPSA), pKa values.
  - **Structural Features**: Counts of specific functional groups (carboxyl, amino, hydroxyl, thiol), number of aromatic rings, heteroatoms (N, O, S).
  - **Electronic Descriptors**: Hammett sigma constants, electron-donating/withdrawing substituent effects.

- **Advice 3**: **Convert Rules into Decision Tree Format**  
  Structure the rules as a hierarchical decision tree based on quantifiable features. This approach facilitates translation into a numerical feature matrix. For example:
  1. **Is the modifier aromatic?** (Yes = 1, No = 0)
  2. If aromatic:
     - **Position of substituents**: Para (1), Ortho/Meta (0)
     - **Type of substituents**: Electron-withdrawing (1), Electron-donating (0)
  3. If aliphatic:
     - **Chain length**: Number of carbons
     - **Presence of polar terminal groups**: Yes (1), No (0)

- **Advice 4**: **Eliminate Exceptions by Refining Rules**  
  Address exceptions by examining underlying factors and adjusting the rules accordingly. For instance:
  - Recognize that amino groups can serve as additional coordination sites despite being electron-donating.
  - Modify Rule 2 to include the coordination ability of functional groups, not just their electronic properties.
  - Incorporate flexibility for multifunctional groups that influence yield through multiple mechanisms.

- **Advice 5**: **Merge Similar Rules to Reduce Complexity**  
  Combine overlapping rules to streamline the rule set and simplify feature extraction. For example:
  - Merge Rules 3 and 13 by focusing on aliphatic carboxylic acids with or without terminal polar groups, using a binary indicator for terminal functional groups.
  - Consolidate Rules 1, 10, and 11 by creating a descriptor for α-amino acids with additional coordinating side chains.

- **Advice 6**: **Utilize Molecular Fingerprints for Feature Generation**  
  Apply computational methods to generate molecular fingerprints (e.g., MACCS keys, Morgan fingerprints) that represent the presence or absence of substructural features in a binary vector format. This facilitates input into machine learning models and captures detailed structural information.

- **Advice 7**: **Incorporate Computational Predictors**  
  Use predictive computational chemistry tools to calculate properties like partial charges, HOMO/LUMO energies, and coordination tendencies. These numerical values can enhance the feature matrix and improve correlations with yield outcomes.

- **Advice 8**: **Create a Feature Matrix from Descriptor Calculations**  
  For each modifier in the dataset, calculate the selected descriptors and compile them into a feature matrix. Use this matrix to perform statistical analyses or train machine learning models to identify patterns and refine the rules based on empirical data.

- **Advice 9**: **Validate and Update Rules Based on Data Analysis**  
  After generating the feature matrix and analyzing correlations with yield, adjust the rules to reflect findings. Remove or modify rules that do not align with the data, and consider adding new rules for uncovered patterns.

**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify and Quantify Rule Descriptors**  
  Revise the rules to focus on quantifiable structural features that can be directly extracted from SMILES strings. Replace qualitative descriptions with specific, countable attributes. For example, instead of stating "side chains containing additional carboxylic acid groups," specify "modifiers with two or more carboxylic acid groups." This allows for numerical representation and easier feature extraction.

- **Advice 2**: **Use SMARTS Patterns for Structural Features**  
  Translate the rules into SMARTS (SMILES Arbitrary Target Specification) patterns to identify functional groups and substructures programmatically. SMARTS patterns enable automated detection of specific motifs within SMILES strings, facilitating the creation of a numerical feature matrix based on the presence or absence of these patterns.

- **Advice 3**: **Develop a Numerical Feature Matrix**  
  Create a feature matrix where each column represents a specific structural feature or functional group identified in the rules, and each row corresponds to a modifier. Use binary values (1 for presence, 0 for absence) or counts to indicate the occurrence of these features in each modifier. This matrix can be used for statistical analysis and machine learning models.

- **Advice 4**: **Incorporate Molecular Descriptors and Fingerprints**  
  Utilize molecular descriptors (e.g., molecular weight, logP, topological polar surface area) and fingerprints (e.g., MACCS keys, Morgan fingerprints) that quantitatively represent molecular properties and substructures. These descriptors can be calculated using cheminformatics tools like RDKit and provide a rich set of numerical features for analysis.

- **Advice 5**: **Quantify Chain Lengths and Groups Numerically**  
  Specify numerical thresholds in the rules for chain lengths and the number of functional groups. For example, instead of "chains longer than 5 carbons," use "aliphatic chains with more than 5 carbons (n > 5)." This numerical specificity allows for direct translation into numerical features.

- **Advice 6**: **Consolidate and Generalize Similar Rules**  
  Merge overlapping rules and generalize where possible to reduce complexity. For instance, combine rules related to electron-withdrawing groups enhancing acidity into a single rule with parameters that can be numerically quantified (e.g., Hammett sigma constants).

- **Advice 7**: **Eliminate Ambiguous and Qualitative Terms**  
  Remove or redefine terms that are subjective or difficult to measure, such as "increased solvation" or "interference with coordination." Replace them with quantifiable properties like "number of hydrogen bond donors/acceptors" or "total polar surface area," which can be numerically assessed.

- **Advice 8**: **Apply Cheminformatics Tools for Feature Extraction**  
  Leverage cheminformatics software to automate the extraction of features from SMILES strings. Tools like RDKit can calculate a wide array of molecular descriptors and can identify structural features based on SMARTS patterns, streamlining the creation of the numerical feature matrix.

- **Advice 9**: **Reevaluate and Refine the Rules Based on Data**  
  Analyze the existing dataset to identify discrepancies between the rules' predictions and actual yields. Adjust the rules to correct misclassifications, ensuring they are consistent and accurately reflect the data trends.

- **Advice 10**: **Incorporate Machine Learning for Rule Optimization**  
  Utilize machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and relationships within the data that may not be apparent from manual rule creation. Machine learning models can highlight which features are most predictive of high or low yield, informing further refinement of the rules.

- **Advice 11**: **Prioritize Predictive Features with High Impact**  
  Focus on the structural features and functional groups that have the most significant impact on yield according to statistical analyses. Prioritize these in the rules to enhance their predictive power and relevance.

- **Advice 12**: **Standardize Nomenclature and Definitions**  
  Ensure consistent use of chemical terminology and definitions throughout the rules. Standardization facilitates accurate feature extraction and reduces confusion or misinterpretation during the numerical translation process.

**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Increase Rule Coverage by Incorporating Additional Data Points or Merging Similar Rules**

  Several rules (e.g., Rules 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15) are currently supported by only one data point, which limits their reliability. To strengthen these rules, consider the following actions:
  
  - **Collect More Data**: Seek additional modifiers that fit the structural criteria of these rules and test their yields. This will provide a stronger statistical basis for the rules.
  
  - **Merge Similar Rules**: Identify rules with overlapping structural features or property insights and combine them to create more robust rules with broader coverage. For example, Rules 6 and 10 both involve modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups enhancing metal coordination; merging them could improve coverage and clarity.

- **Advice 2**: **Refine or Remove Rules that Conflict with Experimental Data**

  Rule 14 predicts that modifiers with aromatic carboxylic acids having meta-substituted electron-donating groups (e.g., hydroxy) result in a **low yield**. However, the dataset shows that **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** yields high, contradicting this rule. To address this:
  
  - **Reevaluate the Rule Criteria**: Adjust the rule to accommodate exceptions or narrow the scope to exclude conflicting cases.
  
  - **Provide Additional Examples**: Collect more data on modifiers with similar structures to determine if the exception is an anomaly or if the rule needs significant revision.
  
  - **Consider Removing the Rule**: If the rule consistently conflicts with data and lacks strong physical-chemical justification, it may be best to omit it.

- **Advice 3**: **Enhance Clarity by Simplifying and Consolidating Rules**

  Some rules contain complex descriptions or overlap with others, potentially causing confusion. To improve clarity:
  
  - **Simplify Language**: Use concise and consistent terminology to describe structural features.
  
  - **Consolidate Overlapping Rules**: For instance, Rules 3 and 13 both address aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal polar groups affecting yield. Combining them can create a comprehensive rule that is easier to apply.

- **Advice 4**: **Strengthen Rules with Additional Physical-Chemical Rationale**

  For rules with limited property insight or weak justification, provide more detailed explanations of how the structural features influence the reaction. For example:
  
  - **Rule 12**: Elaborate on how additional amide groups in side chains may engage in intramolecular hydrogen bonding or resonance stabilization, reducing the availability of coordination sites.
  
  - **Rule 15**: Explain how multiple methoxy groups on an aromatic ring can donate electron density through resonance, potentially affecting metal coordination differently than single methoxy substitutions.

- **Advice 5**: **Adjust Rules to Align with Physical-Chemical Principles and Experimental Trends**

  Ensure that all rules are consistent with known chemical behavior and the observed data. For example:
  
  - **Rule 7 and Rule 13 Overlap**: Both rules mention intramolecular interactions (hydrogen bonding, side reactions) hindering metal coordination. Consider integrating them into a single rule focused on functional groups adjacent to carboxylic acids that can interfere with binding.
  
  - **Rule 8 and Rule 11 Similarities**: Both rules address electron-withdrawing groups decreasing carboxylate basicity. Merging insights from these rules could strengthen the overall understanding of electronic effects on yield.

- **Advice 6**: **Provide Specific Structural Examples and Counterexamples for Each Rule**

  To improve the applicability of the rules:
  
  - **Include Additional Examples**: Supply more modifiers that fit each rule's criteria, both supporting (high yield) and contradictory (low yield), to help users better understand the scope.
  
  - **Highlight Borderline Cases**: Identify modifiers that are exceptions to the rules and explain the possible reasons, enhancing the user's ability to predict outcomes in ambiguous situations.

- **Advice 7**: **Incorporate SMILES Notation for Precise Structural Definitions**

  As the rules are intended to be SMILES-based, include SMILES strings for each example modifier. This provides an exact structural representation, reducing ambiguity and aiding in computational analyses.

  - **For Example**:
    - *Rule 1 Example*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid) – SMILES: `NC(C(=O)O)CC(=O)O`
    - *Rule 2 Example*: **4-nitrobenzoic acid** – SMILES: `O=C(O)c1ccc(cc1)[N+](=O)[O-]`
  
- **Advice 8**: **Validate and Update Rules with Ongoing Experimental Data**

  Continuously refine the rules by incorporating new experimental results. This iterative process will improve the accuracy and reliability of the rules over time.

  - **Establish Feedback Mechanisms**: Create a system where experimentalists can report new data, successes, and failures, allowing for real-time updates to the rules.

- **Advice 9**: **Consider Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) Modeling**

  Utilize computational tools to analyze the structural features of modifiers quantitatively. QSAR models can identify patterns and provide insights that may not be apparent through qualitative rules alone.

  - **Develop Predictive Models**: Combine the existing data with molecular descriptors to create models that predict yields based on structural properties.

- **Advice 10**: **Train Machine Learning Algorithms with the Existing Dataset**

  Implement machine learning techniques to uncover complex relationships between modifier structures and reaction yields.

  - **Enhance Predictive Power**: Machine learning models can capture nonlinear relationships and interactions between multiple structural features, improving prediction accuracy beyond what is feasible with simple rules.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Translate Qualitative Rules into Quantitative Descriptors**  
  Convert the current qualitative rules into quantifiable molecular descriptors that can be directly calculated from SMILES representations. For example, instead of stating "Modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups predict a high yield," assign numerical values to electron-withdrawing capacities using known constants like Hammett σ values.

- **Advice 2**: **Utilize Cheminformatics Tools for Descriptor Calculation**  
  Employ cheminformatics software to calculate a comprehensive set of molecular descriptors (e.g., functional group counts, molecular weight, LogP, topological polar surface area). These numerical descriptors can form the basis of a feature matrix suitable for machine learning models.

- **Advice 3**: **Define SMARTS Patterns for Structural Features**  
  Develop SMARTS (SMILES Arbitrary Target Specification) patterns corresponding to each rule to enable automated matching of modifiers to structural features. This will facilitate the creation of binary or count-based features indicating the presence of specific substructures.

- **Advice 4**: **Simplify and Consolidate Overlapping Rules**  
  Review the current rules for overlaps and redundancies. Combine similar rules to create broader, more generalizable rules that are easier to implement numerically. For example, merge rules addressing steric hindrance into a single rule quantified by molecular volume or surface area.

- **Advice 5**: **Incorporate Quantitative Steric and Electronic Descriptors**  
  Introduce descriptors that quantify steric effects (e.g., van der Waals volume) and electronic properties (e.g., Mulliken charges, HOMO-LUMO gap) to replace qualitative statements about steric hindrance and electronic effects.

- **Advice 6**: **Standardize Feature Matrix Structure**  
  Establish a consistent format for the feature matrix, ensuring that each molecular descriptor is clearly defined and calculated uniformly across all modifiers. This will improve data quality and facilitate model training.

- **Advice 7**: **Use Statistical Methods to Validate and Refine Rules**  
  Apply statistical analysis to determine the significance of each descriptor in predicting yield. Remove or adjust rules associated with descriptors that do not show a strong correlation with the experimental data.

- **Advice 8**: **Incorporate Additional Relevant Descriptors**  
  Expand the descriptor set to include other potentially relevant properties such as hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, number of rotatable bonds, or solubility parameters to capture effects not currently addressed by the rules.

- **Advice 9**: **Automate Descriptor Extraction and Feature Generation**  
  Develop scripts or software pipelines that automatically extract descriptors from SMILES inputs and generate the feature matrix. Automation reduces errors and increases efficiency in handling large datasets.

- **Advice 10**: **Iteratively Update Rules Based on Model Performance**  
  Use machine learning models to predict yields and iteratively update the rules based on model insights. If certain descriptors consistently contribute to prediction errors, revisit the corresponding rules for refinement.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**
- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 effectively predicts high yields for modifiers that are α-amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxylic acid groups, such as aspartic and glutamic acid. The rule is clear, provides solid physicochemical insight into enhanced metal coordination due to extra carboxylate groups, combines structural features, and is supported by multiple data points.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 suggests that short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (chains of five carbons or fewer), optionally with terminal amino or thiol groups, predict high yield, while longer chains predict low yield. However, octanoic acid, an eight-carbon chain modifier, yields a high result, contradicting the rule. This inconsistency indicates that the rule lacks clarity and may not accurately account for all relevant modifiers, necessitating refinement to improve its predictive ability.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 addresses aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted groups capable of metal coordination, predicting high yield, and those with non-coordinating electron-donating groups predicting low yield. While this holds for some modifiers like 4-aminobenzoic acid, it fails for 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid, which, despite having a thiol group capable of coordination, results in a low yield. This inconsistency suggests that the rule requires refinement to more accurately predict outcomes based on specific substituents.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 effectively distinguishes between modifiers where a pyridine ring is connected via an aliphatic linker (high yield) and those where it is directly connected to the aromatic ring (low yield). The rule is clear, provides good physicochemical insight regarding flexibility aiding coordination, combines key structural elements, and is supported by relevant data points, satisfying all scoring criteria.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 accurately predicts high yields for α-amino acids with side chains containing heteroaromatic rings, like tryptophan, due to additional coordination sites, and low yields for those with hydrophobic aromatic side chains lacking such coordination ability, like phenylalanine. The rule is clear, insightful, combines key structural features, and is supported by data, meeting all criteria effectively.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 predicts high yields for modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid, such as gluconic acid, due to enhanced solubility and coordination opportunities. The rule is clear, offers solid physicochemical insights, considers combinations of functional groups, and is supported by data points, aligning well with the scoring criteria.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 predicts low yields for modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains attached to carboxylic acid groups due to reduced basicity hindering coordination. While the rule is clear and provides good physicochemical reasoning, it is supported by only one data point, limiting its robustness according to the coverage criterion, which requires at least two supporting data points.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 appropriately predicts low yields for modifiers with flexible polyether chains terminating with a carboxylic acid group, due to reduced likelihood of effective metal coordination. The rule is clear, provides good insight, combines structural features, and is supported by multiple data points, satisfying the scoring criteria effectively.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 suggests that modifiers with bulky or fused aromatic systems containing potential coordination sites predict high yields. Although the rule is clear and offers insightful reasoning, it appears to be supported by only one data point, which may not meet the coverage requirement of at least two data points, potentially limiting its applicability.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 predicts low yields for aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with additional keto groups due to potential chelation or side reactions interfering with catalyst activity. While the rule is clear and provides good physicochemical reasoning, it is based on a single data point, which does not satisfy the coverage criterion, limiting its robustness.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 addresses modifiers capable of intramolecular hydrogen bonding, predicting low yields due to reduced availability of the carboxylate group for metal coordination. The rule is clear and insightful but is supported by only one data point, which may not satisfy the coverage requirement, suggesting a need for additional supporting data.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 predicts low yields for amino acids or peptides containing additional amide groups in the side chain due to potential metal ion sequestration or intramolecular interactions hindering coordination. The rule is clear, provides reasonable physicochemical insight, considers combinations of structural features, and is supported by at least two data points, aligning well with the scoring criteria.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 suggests that modifiers with aromatic carboxylic acids meta-substituted with nitrogen-containing heterocycles predict high yields due to favorable interactions without significant steric hindrance. While the rule is clear and offers good insight, it is supported by only one data point, which falls short of the coverage criterion, indicating that more data is needed to validate the rule fully.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 predicts low yields for modifiers with trifluoroacetyl groups attached to aliphatic chains with carboxylic acid functionalities due to electron-withdrawing effects reducing nucleophilicity. The rule is clear and provides reasonable insight but is based on a single data point, not meeting the coverage criterion and limiting its robustness.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 effectively predicts low yields for modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal hydroxyl or amino groups beyond five carbons, due to increased hydrophobicity and steric bulk impeding metal coordination. The rule is clear, provides good physicochemical reasoning, combines structural features, and is well-supported by multiple data points, satisfying the scoring criteria.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Revise Rule 2 to Address Chain Length Exceptions**

  - **Issue**: Rule 2 states that aliphatic carboxylic acids with chains of five carbons or fewer predict a high yield, while longer chains predict a low yield. However, **octanoic acid** (an eight-carbon chain) yields a high result, contradicting the rule.

  - **Recommendation**: Modify Rule 2 to focus on the presence of terminal polar groups rather than chain length alone. The revised rule could be:

    - **Revised Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids without terminal polar functional groups** (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) predict a **high yield**, regardless of chain length. The absence of terminal polar groups reduces solvation and steric hindrance, allowing effective metal coordination.

    - **Supporting Examples**:
      - **High Yield**: **octanoic acid**, **5-aminopentanoic acid** (terminal amino group in a short chain).
      - **Low Yield**: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid** (long chains with terminal polar groups).

- **Advice 2**: **Refine Rule 3 to Specify Effective Coordinating Groups**

  - **Issue**: Rule 3 suggests that para-substituted groups capable of metal coordination predict a high yield. However, **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** has a para thiol group (a potential coordinating group) but yields a low result, indicating an inconsistency.

  - **Recommendation**: Update Rule 3 to specify which para-substituents enhance yield based on their coordination effectiveness. Distinguish between strong and weak coordinating groups.

    - **Revised Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted strong metal-coordinating groups** (e.g., amino, nitro, pyridyl) predict a **high yield**. Modifiers with para-substituted groups that are **poor metal ligands** (e.g., thiol, methyl) predict a **low yield**.

    - **Supporting Examples**:
      - **High Yield**: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**.
      - **Low Yield**: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**, **4-methylbenzoic acid**.

- **Advice 3**: **Consolidate Rules with Limited Data Support**

  - **Issue**: Several rules (e.g., Rules 9, 10, 13, 14) are based on a single data point, reducing their robustness.

  - **Recommendation**: Combine these rules or broaden their criteria to improve coverage. For instance, merge rules related to electron-withdrawing groups affecting coordination.

    - **Consolidated Rule**: Modifiers containing **strong electron-withdrawing groups** (e.g., perfluoroalkyl, trifluoroacetyl, keto groups adjacent to carboxylic acids) predict a **low yield** due to decreased basicity and potential side reactions interfering with metal coordination.

    - **Supporting Examples**:
      - **Low Yield**: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**, **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**, **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**.

- **Advice 4**: **Correct Rule 13 Based on Experimental Data**

  - **Issue**: Rule 13 predicts that modifiers with meta-substituted nitrogen-containing heterocycles yield a high result, but **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** shows a **high yield** in the data, contradicting the rule as written.

  - **Recommendation**: Amend Rule 13 to reflect the observed data accurately.

    - **Revised Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with meta-substituted nitrogen-containing heterocycles** predict a **high yield** due to the nitrogen providing additional coordination without significant steric hindrance.

    - **Supporting Example**:
      - **High Yield**: **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid).

- **Advice 5**: **Ensure Sufficient Data Points for Each Rule**

  - **Issue**: Some rules are based on single examples, limiting their predictive power.

  - **Recommendation**: Before finalizing a rule, ensure it is supported by at least two data points. If data is limited, consider conducting additional experiments or searching literature for supporting evidence.

- **Advice 6**: **Improve Clarity and Specificity in Rule Definitions**

  - **Issue**: Some rules lack precise definitions, which may lead to misclassification.

  - **Recommendation**: Use unambiguous chemical terminology and, where possible, include structural descriptors or SMILES strings. For example, specify the exact position of substituents on aromatic rings (ortho, meta, para) and clarify functional group characteristics.

- **Advice 7**: **Integrate Steric and Electronic Effects in Rules**

  - **Issue**: Current rules may not fully account for the combined impact of steric hindrance and electronic factors on yield.

  - **Recommendation**: Develop rules that consider both steric and electronic properties. For instance:

    - Modifiers with **bulky substituents near coordination sites** may predict a **low yield** due to steric hindrance.
    - Modifiers with **electron-donating groups that reduce metal affinity** may also predict a **low yield**.

- **Advice 8**: **Include Exceptions and Special Cases in Rules**

  - **Issue**: Some modifiers may not fit general trends due to unique structural features.

  - **Recommendation**: Acknowledge exceptions within the rules and provide reasoning. For example:

    - **Exception in Rule 2**: Despite being a long-chain acid, **octanoic acid** yields a high result, possibly due to its lack of polar terminal groups and minimal steric hindrance at the coordination site.

- **Advice 9**: **Use SMILES Notation for Precise Rule Application**

  - **Issue**: Structural ambiguities can arise without precise chemical representations.

  - **Recommendation**: Incorporate SMILES strings in the rules to define exact molecular structures, aiding in accurate classification and prediction.

    - For example, provide SMILES examples alongside chemical names in the rules.

- **Advice 10**: **Cross-Validate Rules with Additional Data Sets**

  - **Issue**: Rules derived from a limited dataset may not generalize well.

  - **Recommendation**: Validate the revised rules against external datasets or through computational modeling to assess their predictive accuracy and adjust them accordingly.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxylic acid groups** predict a **high yield**. The presence of multiple carboxylate groups enhances coordination with the metal center, facilitating better catalyst activity.
   - *Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid), **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid).

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with chains of five carbons or fewer**, optionally containing **terminal amino or thiol groups**, predict a **high yield**. Short chains and polar functional groups improve solubility and metal coordination.
   - *Examples*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**, **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
   - Modifiers with **longer aliphatic chains (more than five carbons)** predict a **low yield** due to increased hydrophobicity and steric hindrance interfering with effective coordination.
     - *Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted groups capable of metal coordination** (e.g., amino, nitro, pyridyl) predict a **high yield**. These substituents provide additional coordination sites or influence electron distribution favorably.
   - *Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**.
   - Modifiers with **para-substituted electron-donating groups lacking coordinating ability** (e.g., methyl) predict a **low yield** due to decreased acidity and lack of additional coordination.
     - *Example*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**.

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with a pyridine ring connected via an aliphatic linker** predict a **high yield**. The flexible linker allows the pyridine nitrogen to effectively coordinate with the metal center.
   - *Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**.
   - Modifiers where the **pyridine ring is directly connected to the aromatic ring** predict a **low yield** due to steric hindrance and reduced flexibility hindering effective coordination.
     - *Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains containing heteroaromatic rings capable of metal coordination** predict a **high yield**. Heteroatoms in the aromatic ring provide additional sites for metal binding.
   - *Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan).
   - Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with hydrophobic aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms** predict a **low yield** due to insufficient coordination sites.
     - *Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine).

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing **multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid group** predict a **high yield**. The hydroxyl groups enhance solubility and provide additional hydrogen bonding and coordination opportunities.
   - *Example*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid).

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing **perfluorinated alkyl chains attached to carboxylic acid groups** predict a **low yield**. Strong electron-withdrawing effects decrease the basicity of the carboxylate ion, hindering effective metal coordination.
   - *Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers with **flexible polyether chains terminating with a carboxylic acid group** predict a **low yield**. The high flexibility and solvation of polyether chains reduce the likelihood of effective metal coordination.
   - *Examples*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**.

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **bulky or fused aromatic systems with potential coordination sites**, such as lactone or ketone groups, predict a **high yield**. The rigidity and electron delocalization in these structures facilitate effective metal binding.
   - *Example*: **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**.

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with additional keto groups** predict a **low yield**. The presence of keto groups may lead to chelation or side reactions that interfere with the catalyst's activity.
    - *Example*: **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**.

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with ortho-substituted hydroxyl and formyl groups capable of intramolecular hydrogen bonding** predict a **low yield**. Intramolecular hydrogen bonds reduce the availability of the carboxylate group for metal coordination.
    - *Example*: **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **amino acids or peptides containing additional amide groups in the side chain** predict a **low yield**. Amide functionalities may sequester metal ions or engage in intramolecular interactions that hinder coordination.
    - *Example*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with meta-substituted nitrogen-containing heterocycles** predict a **high yield**. The meta position allows for favorable interactions without significant steric hindrance.
    - *Example*: **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid).

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers containing **trifluoroacetyl groups attached to aliphatic chains with carboxylic acid functionalities** predict a **low yield**. The electron-withdrawing trifluoroacetyl group reduces the nucleophilicity of coordinating atoms.
    - *Example*: **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**.

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal hydroxyl or amino groups beyond five carbons** predict a **low yield**. Increased chain length leads to higher hydrophobicity and steric bulk, impeding effective metal coordination.
    - *Examples*: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

**End of Rules**

---

**Explanation and Analysis:**

In generating these rules, I have:

- **Considered the dataset thoroughly**, focusing on the structural features of the modifiers and their correlation with the observed high or low yields.
- **Revised and refined existing rules** to correct any inconsistencies with the data, ensuring that each rule accurately predicts the yield based on the modifier's structure.
- **Combined functional groups** and structural motifs to create comprehensive rules that cover a broader range of the dataset, aligning with the requirement to prioritize rules with wider coverage.
- **Maintained a balance** between simple rules with higher coverage (e.g., Rules 1, 2, and 3) and more complex rules with lower coverage but valuable insights (e.g., Rules 9 and 14).

By focusing on the underlying **physicochemical properties**, such as electron-donating or withdrawing effects, steric hindrance, coordination ability, and solubility, these rules provide a predictive framework for assessing new modifiers based on their structural features.---------------------------------------------------------------

Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: *Revise the SMARTS patterns for 'aliphatic_chain' and 'longer_aliphatic_chain' in Rule 2 to accurately represent carbon chain lengths.* The current patterns may not correctly match chains of five carbons or fewer and longer than five carbons. Consider using the `[*]` wildcard and specifying chain lengths using the `{n}` quantifier more accurately. For example:
  - **Aliphatic chain (5 carbons or fewer)**: `'[CX4;!$(C=O)](-[CX4;!$(C=O)]){2,4}'` to match linear aliphatic chains between 3 to 5 carbons.
  - **Longer aliphatic chain (more than 5 carbons)**: `'[CX4;!$(C=O)](-[CX4;!$(C=O)]){5,}'` to match chains of 6 or more carbons.

- **Suggestion 2**: *Modify Rule 2's function to align with the natural language description by making terminal amino or thiol groups optional.* The current code requires these groups to be present, whereas they are optional in the rule. Adjust the function to:
  ```python
  lambda mol: (
      mol.HasSubstructMatch(patterns['carboxylic_acid']) and
      mol.HasSubstructMatch(patterns['aliphatic_chain']) and
      not mol.HasSubstructMatch(patterns['longer_aliphatic_chain'])
  )
  ```
  Then, separately account for the presence of terminal amino or thiol groups if needed.

- **Suggestion 3**: *Correct the 'para_substituted_aromatic' SMARTS pattern in Rule 3 to accurately detect para-disubstituted benzene rings.* The current pattern may not specifically match para-substitution. Use a pattern like `'c1cc([#6])ccc1'` with appropriate substitution points or the more precise `'c1cc([R])cc([R2])c1'` where substituents are at positions 1 and 4.

- **Suggestion 4**: *Refine the electron-withdrawing groups in Rule 3 to focus on groups capable of metal coordination as per the rule.* Remove carboxylic acids and halogens if they are not relevant. Include patterns for amino (`'[NH2,NH1]'`), nitro (`'[NX3](=O)=O'`), and pyridyl groups.

- **Suggestion 5**: *Adjust the 'electron_donating_group' pattern in Rule 3.1 to include methyl groups instead of hydroxyl groups.* Since methyl groups are the electron-donating groups lacking coordinating ability mentioned in the rule, use `'[CH3]'` attached to an aromatic ring at the para position.

- **Suggestion 6**: *Enhance Rule 4 to accurately detect aromatic carboxylic acids with a pyridine ring connected via an aliphatic linker.* Create a SMARTS pattern that identifies a benzene ring connected through an aliphatic chain to a pyridine ring, such as:
  ```python
  pyridine_linker = '[cH]1ccc([CX4][CX2,CR0][CX2,CR0][c]2ncccc2)cc1'
  ```
  Ensure the pattern accounts for the linker length and connectivity.

- **Suggestion 7**: *Modify Rule 4.1 to detect direct connections between pyridine and aromatic rings without an aliphatic linker.* Use a SMARTS pattern that identifies a direct bond between the two rings, like:
  ```python
  direct_pyridine_connection = 'c1ccc([c]2ncccc2)cc1'
  ```
  This pattern matches a benzene ring directly connected to a pyridine ring.

- **Suggestion 8**: *Update the 'heteroaromatic_ring' pattern in Rule 5 to include fused heteroaromatic systems like indole rings.* The current pattern does not capture fused rings. Use a pattern such as:
  ```python
  heteroaromatic_fused_ring = '[n,o,s]1[c,c]ccc1'
  ```
  Or more specifically for indole:
  ```python
  indole_pattern = 'c1c[nH]c2cccc2c1'
  ```
  Ensure the pattern matches heteroatom-containing aromatic systems relevant to the rule.

- **Suggestion 9**: *Refine the 'hydroxyl_group_adjacent' pattern in Rule 6 to ensure hydroxyl groups are adjacent to the carboxylic acid group.* Create a pattern that matches hydroxyl groups on carbons alpha or beta to the carboxylic acid carbon:
  ```python
  hydroxyl_adjacent = '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CX4][OX2H]'
  ```
  This pattern identifies a carboxylic acid with an adjacent hydroxyl group.

- **Suggestion 10**: *Expand the 'perfluoroalkyl_chain' pattern in Rule 7 to match longer perfluorinated chains.* Use recursive SMARTS or adjust the pattern to match multiple consecutive carbons fully substituted with fluorines:
  ```python
  perfluoro_chain = '[CX4]([F])([F])[CX4]([F])([F])[CX4]([F])([F])'
  ```
  Or use a recursive pattern to capture variable chain lengths:
  ```python
  perfluoro_chain_recursive = '[CX4](F)(F)-[$([CX4](F)(F)-)]*[CX4](F)(F)'
  ```

- **Suggestion 11**: *Thoroughly review and test all SMARTS patterns and rule functions for accuracy.* Each pattern should be validated against known examples to ensure correct matches. Utilize cheminformatics tools or RDKit's `CheckMol` to verify SMARTS expressions and adjust them as necessary.

    Train support: 0.055639097744360905
    Train confidence: 0.6578947368421053

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Metrics Compared to Reference Metrics:**

1. **Train Confidence:**

   - **Reference Metrics:** 
     - Mean Train Confidence: 0.6352 and 0.5396.
   - **Current Metrics:** 
     - Train Confidence: 0.6579.
   - **Comment:** 
     - The current train confidence of **65.79%** is higher than both of the reference train confidence values. This suggests that the current set of rules is correctly predicting the positive class (high yield) more frequently on the training data compared to previous iterations. An increase in confidence indicates that when the rule conditions are met, the likelihood of accurately predicting a high yield has improved.

2. **Train Lift:**

   - **Reference Metrics:** 
     - Mean Train Lift: 1.2048 and 1.0559.
   - **Current Metrics:** 
     - Train Lift: 1.3149.
   - **Comment:** 
     - The current train lift of **1.3149** is higher than the reference metrics. Lift measures how much better the model is at predicting the outcome than random chance. A lift greater than 1 indicates that the rule is effective. The higher lift in the current rules suggests that they are more powerful in identifying high-yield cases than previous rules.

3. **Train Support:**

   - **Reference Metrics:** 
     - Mean Train Support: 0.1667 and 0.1845.
   - **Current Metrics:** 
     - Train Support: 0.0556.
   - **Comment:** 
     - The current train support of **5.56%** is significantly lower than the reference metrics. Support indicates the proportion of the dataset that the rules apply to. A lower support means that the current rules cover a smaller portion of the training data. While the confidence and lift have improved, the decrease in support suggests that the rules might be too specialized or not general enough.

4. **Train Leverage:**

   - **Reference Metrics:** 
     - Mean Train Leverage: 0.0289 and -0.0041.
   - **Current Metrics:** 
     - Train Leverage: 0.0068.
   - **Comment:** 
     - The current leverage is positive but lower than the higher reference value. Positive leverage indicates a stronger association than expected by chance. While the current leverage is an improvement over the negative value, it is still lower than the previous positive leverage, implying there's room for improvement in the rules' ability to capture meaningful associations.

**Determining if a Local Minimum Has Been Reached:**

- **Iteration Analysis:**

  - **Train Confidence Over Iterations:**
    - 63.00% → 66.67% → 62.85% → 64.37% → 53.33% → 67.56% → 65.79%
    - *Observation:* The confidence fluctuates across iterations but shows an overall increasing trend, peaking at **67.56%** in iteration 6 before slightly decreasing.
  
  - **Train Lift Over Iterations:**
    - 1.2650 → 1.3327 → 1.2554 → 1.2940 → 1.0611 → 1.3558 → 1.3149
    - *Observation:* The lift also varies, with the highest value of **1.3558** in iteration 6, followed by a slight decrease in the current iteration.

- **Conclusion:**

  - The metrics have shown improvement over the iterations but appear to be plateauing, with only marginal gains in the most recent iterations.
  - The slight decrease after iteration 6 suggests that we've approached a point where further iterations yield diminishing returns.
  - Therefore, it is likely that a local maximum (peak performance) has been reached with the current approach.

**Suggestions for Improving Current Rules:**

1. **Increase Rule Support:**

   - **Issue:** Low train support indicates that the rules apply to a small fraction of the dataset.
   - **Action:** Generalize the rules to cover a broader range of modifiers without sacrificing accuracy.
     - *Combine Similar Rules:* Merge rules with overlapping conditions to increase coverage.
     - *Relax Constraints:* Soften overly strict conditions that exclude many data points.

2. **Validate with Test Data:**

   - **Issue:** Lack of test metrics prevents assessment of the rules' generalization ability.
   - **Action:** Apply the current rules to a separate test dataset to evaluate performance.
     - *Check for Overfitting:* Ensure that high performance isn't limited to the training data.
     - *Adjust Rules Accordingly:* Modify rules that don't generalize well.

3. **Analyze Misclassified Instances:**

   - **Issue:** Understanding errors can provide insights for improvement.
   - **Action:** Examine cases where the rules incorrectly predict yield.
     - *Identify Patterns:* Look for common features in misclassified instances.
     - *Refine Rules:* Update existing rules or create new ones to account for these patterns.

4. **Balance Rule Complexity and Generality:**

   - **Issue:** Overly complex rules may not generalize well; overly simple rules may lack precision.
   - **Action:** Find the optimal balance between specificity and generalization.
     - *Simplify Complex Rules:* Remove unnecessary conditions that limit applicability.
     - *Add Specificity to Vague Rules:* Include essential conditions to improve prediction accuracy.

5. **Incorporate Additional Features:**

   - **Issue:** Current rules may not capture all relevant factors influencing yield.
   - **Action:** Include other physicochemical properties and structural features.
     - *Electronic Effects:* Consider electron-donating or -withdrawing groups.
     - *Steric Factors:* Account for steric hindrance in modifiers.
     - *Solubility and Lipophilicity:* Include parameters like LogP or water solubility.

6. **Prioritize High Leverage Rules:**

   - **Issue:** Leverage indicates the strength of association beyond chance; higher leverage is desirable.
   - **Action:** Focus on developing rules that increase leverage.
     - *Target Frequent Patterns:* Build rules around modifiers that frequently contribute to high yield.
     - *Avoid Rare Exceptions:* Ensure rules are not based on outliers or rare occurrences.

7. **Resolve Conflicting Rules:**

   - **Issue:** Some modifiers may satisfy multiple rules with different predictions.
   - **Action:** Establish a hierarchy or weighting system for rules.
     - *Rule Confidence as a Weight:* Use confidence levels to prioritize rules.
     - *Consensus Approach:* Require multiple rules to agree for a prediction.

8. **Iterate with Feedback:**

   - **Issue:** Continuous improvement relies on iterative refinement.
   - **Action:** Use the insights from each iteration to enhance rule development.
     - *Set Clear Objectives:* Define what improvements are needed (e.g., higher support).
     - *Monitor Overfitting:* Keep track of performance on both training and test data.

**Conclusion:**

- **Performance Evaluation:**

  - The current rules have improved in terms of **confidence** and **lift** compared to reference metrics, indicating better predictive power on the training data.
  - However, the decrease in **support** suggests that the rules may be too narrow, limiting their applicability.

- **Next Steps:**

  - Validate the current rules on test data to ensure they generalize beyond the training set.
  - Focus on increasing support without significantly compromising confidence and lift.
  - Incorporate additional features and refine rules based on misclassification analysis.

- **Final Recommendation:**

  - Given that a local maximum in performance seems to have been reached, it's time to shift focus from fine-tuning existing rules to broadening their applicability and ensuring robustness through validation on new data.

By addressing the issues of low support and potential overfitting, and by incorporating the suggested improvements, the current rules can be enhanced to provide more reliable and generalizable predictions for the catalytic problem at hand.

**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

**1. Evaluate Effectiveness:**

The latest validation accuracy achieved is **65.71%**, representing an improvement over previous iterations within this program, where accuracies ranged from **51.43%** to **60%**. However, the reference validation accuracies provided were consistently around **76%** with test accuracies varying between **62.5%** and **75%**. While the current rules have led to improved performance compared to earlier iterations, there is still a gap between the current accuracy and the reference benchmark.

**Conclusion:** The current rules are partially effective but may require further refinement to achieve accuracy levels comparable to the reference metrics.

---

**2. Assess Overfitting/Underfitting:**

- **Underfitting:** The model's validation accuracy is significantly lower than the reference accuracy of **76%**, suggesting that the model may not be capturing all the relevant patterns in the data. This points toward potential underfitting, where the model is too simple to represent the underlying distribution effectively.

- **Overfitting:** There is no evidence of overfitting based on the provided data. Overfitting would typically manifest as a high accuracy on the training set and a low accuracy on the validation set. Since we do not have separate training accuracy metrics, we cannot conclusively determine overfitting.

**Conclusion:** The model may be underfitting, indicating a need for more expressive rules or additional features to capture complex relationships in the data.

---

**3. Analyze Discrepancies Using SHAP Values:**

The SHAP analysis provides insights into which rules contribute most to mispredictions. We analyze molecules where the predicted loading differs from the experimental value:

**a. Cases Where Predicted Loading is High but Experimental Value is Low:**

- **Molecule:** *C₁=CC(=CC=C₁C(=O)O)S*
  - **Rules with High Positive SHAP Values:**
    - **Rule11 SHAP Value:** +0.0342
    - **Rule12 SHAP Value:** +0.0306
  - **Analysis:** Rules **11** and **12** contribute significantly to the overestimation. These rules may be overgeneralizing or mischaracterizing certain features of this molecule.

- **Molecule:** *CC₁=CC=C(C=C₁)C(=O)O*
  - **Rules with High Positive SHAP Values:**
    - **Rule10 SHAP Value:** +0.0899
    - **Rule11 SHAP Value:** +0.0369
  - **Analysis:** Rules **10** and **11** are contributing to the overprediction of loading in this case.

**b. Cases Where Predicted Loading is Low but Experimental Value is High:**

- **Molecule:** *C₁=CC(=CC=C₁CCCCC(=O)O)O*
  - **Rules with High Negative SHAP Values:**
    - **Rule4 SHAP Value:** -0.1427
    - **Rule10 SHAP Value:** -0.3062
  - **Analysis:** Rules **4** and **10** are heavily penalizing the prediction, leading to underestimation.

- **Molecule:** *C(CCN)CC(=O)O*
  - **Rules with High Negative SHAP Values:**
    - **Rule4 SHAP Value:** -0.0932
    - **Rule7 SHAP Value:** -0.0967
  - **Analysis:** Rules **4** and **7** are significantly contributing to the underprediction.

**Conclusion:** Rules **4**, **7**, **10**, **11**, and **12** are frequently associated with large SHAP values in cases of misprediction and may need re-evaluation.

---

**4. Interpret Accuracy Improvements:**

The increase in validation accuracy from **51.43%** to **65.71%** indicates that the iterative refinement of the rules is leading to better model performance. However, since the accuracy is still below the reference benchmark, there is potential for further improvement.

**Conclusion:** The current rules are moving in the right direction but have not yet achieved optimal predictive performance.

---

**5. Derive Insights from SHAP Analysis:**

The SHAP values highlight specific rules that are strongly influencing the model's predictions, both positively and negatively. By identifying rules with consistently high positive or negative SHAP values in mispredicted cases, we can pinpoint which rules may be overestimating or underestimating the catalyst loading.

- **Overestimation Issues:**
  - **Rules to Investigate:** **Rule11**, **Rule12**, **Rule10**
  - **Insight:** These rules may be too broadly defined or may not account for molecular contexts that negate their effects.

- **Underestimation Issues:**
  - **Rules to Investigate:** **Rule4**, **Rule7**, **Rule10**
  - **Insight:** These rules might be harshly penalizing certain molecular features that, in some contexts, actually contribute to higher catalyst loading.

**Conclusion:** Refining these rules based on detailed molecular analysis could enhance the model's predictive accuracy.

---

**Recommendations for Improvement**

**1. Refine Rules Associated with Overestimation:**

- **Rule10 (Modifiers with additional keto groups predict low yield):**
  - **Issue:** Rule10 is contributing to both overestimation and underestimation in different contexts.
  - **Recommendation:** Reassess the conditions under which keto groups affect catalyst loading. Consider incorporating exceptions or additional context, such as the position of keto groups relative to coordination sites.

- **Rule11 (Modifiers with intramolecular hydrogen bonding predict low yield):**
  - **Issue:** Rule11 may be overpredicting low yield for molecules where intramolecular hydrogen bonding doesn't significantly impede metal coordination.
  - **Recommendation:** Modify the rule to account for cases where intramolecular hydrogen bonds are weak or do not interfere with coordination. Include structural assessments to determine the actual impact on metal binding.

- **Rule12 (Modifiers with additional amide groups predict low yield):**
  - **Issue:** Rule12 might not consider that in some molecules, amide groups can facilitate coordination or not interfere significantly.
  - **Recommendation:** Reevaluate the rule to distinguish between amide groups that hinder coordination and those that do not. Consider the overall molecular context and proximity of amide groups to the coordinating sites.

**2. Adjust Rules with High Negative SHAP Values for Underestimation:**

- **Rule4 (Modifiers with pyridine rings connected via aliphatic linkers predict high yield):**
  - **Issue:** Rule4 is contributing to underestimation in molecules where pyridine rings might not be effectively coordinating due to steric hindrance or other factors.
  - **Recommendation:** Refine the rule to specify the optimal linker length and flexibility. Account for cases where linkers are too short or rigid, hindering effective coordination.

- **Rule7 (Modifiers with perfluorinated alkyl chains predict low yield):**
  - **Issue:** Rule7 may be penalizing molecules where the presence of fluorine atoms does not significantly reduce catalyst loading.
  - **Recommendation:** Adjust the rule to consider the degree of fluorination and the overall impact on electronic properties. Include exceptions for cases where the electron-withdrawing effect is mitigated.

**3. Improve Generalization to Address Underfitting:**

- **Expand Feature Set:**
  - Incorporate additional molecular descriptors or rules that capture features not currently considered, such as steric factors, specific electronic effects, or solvent interactions.

- **Combine Overlapping Rules:**
  - Identify and merge rules that cover similar structural motifs to reduce redundancy and improve model simplicity.

**4. Use Insights from SHAP Analysis:**

- **Data-Driven Rule Refinement:**
  - Use the SHAP analysis to identify patterns where certain rules consistently contribute to mispredictions. Investigate these patterns to understand underlying molecular reasons and adjust the rules accordingly.

- **Iterative Testing:**
  - After refining the rules, perform additional validation to assess the impact on model accuracy. Continue this iterative process to progressively enhance the model.

---

**Final Remarks**

The SHAP analysis has been instrumental in highlighting specific rules that may be contributing to inaccuracies in the model's predictions. By methodically refining these rules and considering the molecular contexts in which they apply, it is possible to improve the predictive performance of the model. Focusing on rules that frequently contribute to mispredictions will help address underfitting and move the model closer to the desired accuracy benchmarks.

     - Revise SMARTS patterns to accurately represent carbon chain lengths.
     - Use quantifiers to specify exact chain lengths, ensuring correct matching of aliphatic chains.

   - **Modify Functional Group Requirements:**
     - In Rule 2, make terminal amino or thiol groups optional to align with the natural language description.
     - Update the rule function to reflect optional presence, increasing support.

   - **Correct Aromatic Substitution Patterns in Rule 3:**
     - Update the 'para_substituted_aromatic' pattern to accurately detect para-disubstituted benzene rings.
     - Ensure the pattern matches the intended substitutions capable of metal coordination.

   - **Refine Electron-Donating and Withdrawing Group Patterns:**
     - Exclude groups not relevant to coordination (e.g., carboxylic acids) in Rule 3.
     - Adjust patterns to focus on substituents mentioned in the rules (e.g., amino, nitro, methyl groups).

   - **Enhance Detection of Linkers in Rule 4:**
     - Create SMARTS patterns that accurately identify pyridine rings connected via aliphatic linkers.
     - Account for linker length and flexibility to better predict coordination ability.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxylic acid groups** predict a **high yield**. The presence of multiple carboxylate groups enhances coordination with the metal center, facilitating better catalyst activity.
   - *Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid), **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid).

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with chains of five carbons or fewer**, optionally containing **terminal amino or thiol groups**, predict a **high yield**. Short chains and polar functional groups improve solubility and metal coordination.

     - *Example*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**.

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with a pyridine ring connected via an aliphatic linker** predict a **high yield**. The flexible linker allows the pyridine nitrogen to effectively coordinate with the metal center.
   - *Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**.
   - Modifiers where the **pyridine ring is directly connected to the aromatic ring** predict a **low yield** due to steric hindrance and reduced flexibility hindering effective coordination.
     - *Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains containing heteroaromatic rings capable of metal coordination** predict a **high yield**. Heteroatoms in the aromatic ring provide additional sites for metal binding.

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **bulky or fused aromatic systems with potential coordination sites**, such as lactone or ketone groups, predict a **high yield**. The rigidity and electron delocalization in these structures facilitate effective metal binding.
   - *Example*: **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**.

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with additional keto groups** predict a **low yield**. The presence of keto groups may lead to chelation or side reactions that interfere with the catalyst's activity.
    - *Example*: **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**.

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with ortho-substituted hydroxyl and formyl groups capable of intramolecular hydrogen bonding** predict a **low yield**. Intramolecular hydrogen bonds reduce the availability of the carboxylate group for metal coordination.
    - *Example*: **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **amino acids or peptides containing additional amide groups in the side chain** predict a **low yield**. Amide functionalities may sequester metal ions or engage in intramolecular interactions that hinder coordination.
    - *Example*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with meta-substituted nitrogen-containing heterocycles** predict a **high yield**. The meta position allows for favorable interactions without significant steric hindrance.
    - *Example*: **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid).

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers containing **trifluoroacetyl groups attached to aliphatic chains with carboxylic acid functionalities** predict a **low yield**. The electron-withdrawing trifluoroacetyl group reduces the nucleophilicity of coordinating atoms.
    - *Example*: **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**.

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal hydroxyl or amino groups beyond five carbons** predict a **low yield**. Increased chain length leads to higher hydrophobicity and steric bulk, impeding effective metal coordination.
    - *Examples*: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

**Explanation and Analysis:**

In generating these rules, I have:

- **Considered the dataset thoroughly**, focusing on the structural features of the modifiers and their correlation with the observed high or low yields.
- **Revised and refined existing rules** to correct any inconsistencies with the data, ensuring that each rule accurately predicts the yield based on the modifier's structure.
- **Combined functional groups** and structural motifs to create comprehensive rules that cover a broader range of the dataset, aligning with the requirement to prioritize rules with wider coverage.
- **Maintained a balance** between simple rules with higher coverage (e.g., Rules 1, 2, and 3) and more complex rules with lower coverage but valuable insights (e.g., Rules 9 and 14).

By focusing on the underlying **physicochemical properties**, such as electron-donating or withdrawing effects, steric hindrance, coordination ability, and solubility, these rules provide a predictive framework for assessing new modifiers based on their structural features.---------------------------------------------------------------

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Refine the SMARTS patterns in Rule 2 to accurately represent aliphatic carboxylic acids with chains of five carbons or fewer.** Use SMARTS quantifiers to specify chain lengths, e.g., `[CH2]` repetitions `{0,3}` to represent chains up to five carbons including the terminal carboxyl group. Make the presence of terminal amino or thiol groups optional by enclosing them in parentheses with a question mark, increasing the rule's support and aligning it with the natural language description.

- **Advice 2**: **Modify the SMARTS patterns in Rule 3 to correctly identify para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with metal-coordinating substituents.** Update the pattern to detect para-disubstituted benzene rings with functional groups like amino (`-NH2`), nitro (`-NO2`), or pyridyl groups. Ensure that the carboxylic acid is counted as one substituent and the coordinating group as the other, and exclude substituents that do not enhance coordination, such as methyl groups.

- **Advice 3**: **Enhance detection in Rule 4 by creating SMARTS patterns that accurately identify pyridine rings connected via an aliphatic linker to an aromatic carboxylic acid.** Define the linker length explicitly in the pattern (e.g., `[CH2]` repetitions) and ensure flexibility is accounted for. Distinguish between modifiers where the pyridine is directly attached to the aromatic ring versus those with a linker, as steric factors affect coordination ability.

- **Advice 4**: **Update Rule 5 to include fused heteroaromatic systems in the SMARTS patterns.** Modify the pattern to detect α-amino acids with side chains containing heteroaromatic rings, such as indole in tryptophan. Use SMARTS patterns that match fused rings with heteroatoms, enhancing the rule's coverage and predictive accuracy.

- **Advice 5**: **Refine Rule 6 by ensuring the SMARTS patterns detect multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid.** Adjust the pattern to match polyhydroxy carboxylic acids, using multiple `-OH` groups attached to adjacent carbons. This will accurately identify modifiers like gluconic acid and improve rule performance.

- **Advice 6**: **Reevaluate Rule 7 to consider the degree of fluorination and its impact on metal coordination.** Modify the SMARTS pattern to detect perfluorinated alkyl chains explicitly, and assess whether partial fluorination may have different effects on yield compared to full fluorination. This adjustment will improve the rule's specificity.

- **Advice 7**: **Address mispredictions related to Rule 4 by incorporating steric hindrance considerations.** Update the rule to account for cases where pyridine linkers, despite being flexible, may not facilitate coordination due to bulkiness or unfavorable conformations. Include steric descriptors or modify the pattern to exclude overly hindered structures.

- **Advice 8**: **Combine overlapping rules to increase support and simplify the model.** For example, merge Rules 1 and 5 by creating a broader rule that covers α-amino acids with side chains containing carboxylic acids or heteroaromatic rings capable of metal coordination. This will enhance coverage and reduce model complexity.

- **Advice 9**: **Relax overly strict conditions in rules to broaden applicability.** Soften constraints by allowing for variations in chain length or substituent positions, provided the essential coordinating features are present. This will prevent underfitting and improve the model's generalization to new modifiers.

- **Advice 10**: **Incorporate steric and electronic factors into the rules.** Use descriptors such as the size of substituents (e.g., bulky groups) and electronic properties (e.g., electron-donating or withdrawing effects) in the SMARTS patterns or rule criteria. This will enhance the rules' ability to predict coordination potential and reaction yield accurately.

- **Advice 11**: **Validate and iterate the updated rules using cross-validation and external datasets.** Apply the refined rules to additional data to assess their performance and generalizability. Analyze any misclassifications to identify persistent issues or gaps in the rules, and refine them accordingly.

- **Advice 12**: **Establish a hierarchy or weighting system among the rules based on their predictive confidence.** Assign higher priority to rules with greater accuracy or confidence levels. When multiple rules apply to a modifier, use the hierarchy to resolve conflicts, improving the overall reliability of predictions.

**Explanation and Analysis:**

In developing these rules, I have:

- **Combined multiple sub-structures** to form comprehensive rules that align with the observed yields.
- **Considered underlying physicochemical properties**, such as electron-donating/-withdrawing effects, steric hindrance, hydrophobicity, and the ability of functional groups to coordinate with metal centers.
- **Ensured clarity** by explicitly stating whether the rule predicts a high or low yield based on the structural features of the modifiers.
- **Prioritized broader coverage**, with rules like 1–5 covering multiple compounds, while also including more specific rules to capture unique cases.
- **Balanced simplicity and complexity**, providing straightforward rules with high coverage and nuanced rules that address specific structural features affecting reactivity.

These rules suggest that **effective metal coordination** is the key factor influencing the yield. Functional groups that can **donate electron density** and provide **additional coordination sites** (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, thiol, and nitrogen-containing heterocycles) tend to enhance yield. Conversely, modifiers with **steric hindrance**, **electron-withdrawing groups**, or **structures that reduce solubility** and **coordination efficiency** tend to result in lower yields.

The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 clearly states that modifiers containing bulky fused aromatic systems with potential coordination sites predict high yield due to the rigid aromatic systems facilitating effective metal binding. The property insight is appropriate. However, the rule is supported by only one data point, limiting its coverage. To increase its robustness, more supporting data would be beneficial. The balance between complexity and coverage could be improved.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 suggests that modifiers with thiol or sulfhydryl groups adjacent to carboxylic acids predict high yield due to strong coordination of sulfur-containing groups with metal centers. However, the coverage is conflicting: while 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid supports the rule by showing high yield, 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid contradicts it by showing low yield. This inconsistency indicates that the rule may not fully capture the factors influencing yield for such modifiers. The property insight is sound, but the coverage and balance need reconsideration.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 clearly states that modifiers with electron-withdrawing substituents, like trifluoroacetyl groups, predict low yield due to decreased electron density hindering effective coordination. The property insight is appropriate. However, the rule is only supported by a single data point, limiting its coverage. Additional supporting data would enhance its robustness.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Resolve Chain Length Inconsistencies**  
  Review and adjust rules related to aliphatic carboxylic acids and chain length. There are contradictions, such as octanoic acid (8 carbons) showing a **high yield** despite Rule 7 predicting that long-chain acids result in **low yield**. Consider redefining the cutoff for chain length or incorporating additional factors like terminal functional groups and overall hydrophobicity to accurately reflect the data.

- **Advice 2**: **Refine Thiol-Containing Modifier Rules**  
  Address inconsistencies in Rule 14 regarding thiol groups. Both **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (aliphatic thiol) and **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (aromatic thiol) are thiol-containing modifiers but have opposite yields. Modify the rule to differentiate between aliphatic and aromatic thiols, noting that aliphatic thiols enhance metal coordination (predicting **high yield**), while aromatic thiols may not due to electron delocalization (predicting **low yield**).

- **Advice 3**: **Enhance Coverage of Rules with Limited Data Support**  
  For rules supported by only one data point (e.g., Rules 8, 9, 11, 13, and 15), seek additional examples within the dataset or literature to strengthen them. Alternatively, consider merging these rules with related ones to increase coverage and improve robustness.

- **Advice 4**: **Clarify the Impact of Substituents on Aromatic Rings**  
  In rules concerning aromatic carboxylic acids (Rules 3 and 4), explicitly state how different substituents affect metal coordination. For instance, clarify that para-substituted groups with lone pairs (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) enhance coordination, while those without coordinating ability (e.g., methyl) do not. This will improve the predictive power and clarity of these rules.

- **Advice 5**: **Incorporate Steric Hindrance Considerations**  
  Address steric effects in rules where bulky groups influence yield. For example, modify Rule 13 to explain that while bulky fused aromatic systems can enhance metal binding, excessive steric bulk may hinder coordination. Provide guidelines on the acceptable size and configuration of such systems.

- **Advice 6**: **Adjust Rules on Electron-Withdrawing Groups**  
  Reevaluate rules involving electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., Rule 15). While these groups can reduce electron density on coordinating atoms, their overall impact may vary. Consider the group's position relative to the coordination site and balance between decreasing electron density and promoting acidity, which can enhance coordination.

- **Advice 7**: **Emphasize Solubility and Flexibility Factors**  
  In rules like Rule 9 concerning polyether chains, highlight how increased solubility and chain flexibility affect metal coordination negatively. Provide specific chain length or flexibility thresholds that distinguish between high and low yield modifiers.

- **Advice 8**: **Provide Comprehensive Examples and Counterexamples**  
  For each rule, include multiple examples and counterexamples from the dataset to illustrate the rule's application and limitations. This will aid in understanding and help users apply the rules more effectively.

- **Advice 9**: **Integrate Additional Functional Group Effects**  
  Examine the impact of other functional groups present in modifiers, such as carbonyls, amides, and halogens. Update or create rules to reflect how these groups influence yield through electronic effects or potential side reactions (e.g., revise Rule 10 to account for carbonyl group positioning).

- **Advice 10**: **Ensure Consistency with the Dataset**  
  Cross-check all rules against the entire dataset to identify and resolve any discrepancies. Adjust rules as necessary to ensure they consistently predict the observed yields, thereby improving their reliability and applicability.

- **Advice 11**: **Strengthen Physicochemical Explanations**  
  Enhance the explanations within each rule to more thoroughly explain the underlying physicochemical principles. This will improve understanding of how specific structural features influence metal coordination and catalytic activity.

- **Advice 12**: **Simplify Overly Complex Rules**  
  Where possible, simplify rules to make them more user-friendly. Combine rules with overlapping features or outcomes to reduce redundancy. Simplified rules are easier to apply and less prone to misinterpretation.

- **Advice 13**: **Regularly Update Rules with New Data**  
  Establish a process for updating the rules as new data becomes available. This will ensure that the rule set remains current and continues to provide accurate predictions over time.

**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with two carboxylic acid groups** predict a **high yield**. The presence of both the amino group and additional carboxylate enhances coordination with metal centers, improving catalyst activity.
   - *Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid), **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid).

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted amino or nitro groups** predict a **high yield**. These substituents enhance metal binding through additional coordination sites.
   - *Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**.
   - Modifiers with **para-substituted non-coordinating groups** (e.g., methyl) predict a **low yield** due to decreased coordination propensity.
     - *Example*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**.

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids containing nitrogen heterocycles**, such as pyridine rings, predict a **high yield**. Nitrogen atoms act as additional coordination sites for metal ions.
   - *Examples*: **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid), **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**.
   - Modifiers where the **heterocycle is sterically hindered or less accessible** predict a **low yield**.
     - *Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **small aliphatic carboxylic acids (chain length ≤ 6 carbons) with terminal amino groups** predict a **high yield**. The amino group enhances metal coordination, and shorter chains reduce steric hindrance.
   - *Example*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**.
   - Modifiers with **longer aliphatic chains** or lacking amino groups predict a **low yield** due to decreased solubility and coordination.
     - *Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **octanoic acid**.

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing **thiol (–SH) groups attached to aliphatic chains** predict a **high yield**. Thiol groups strongly coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.
   - *Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
   - If the thiol group is **attached to an aromatic ring**, the yield may be **low** due to steric hindrance or potential oxidation.
     - *Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains containing heteroatoms capable of metal coordination**, such as indole rings, predict a **high yield**.
   - *Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan).
   - Modifiers with **hydrophobic side chains lacking heteroatoms** predict a **low yield** due to insufficient coordination sites.
     - *Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine).

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing **multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxylic acid (polyhydroxy acids)** predict a **high yield**. The hydroxyl groups provide additional sites for metal coordination.
   - *Examples*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid), **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**.

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups**, such as perfluoroalkyl chains, predict a **low yield**. Electron-withdrawing effects reduce the basicity of the carboxylate ion, hindering metal coordination.
   - *Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **long aliphatic chains (chain length > 6 carbons) without additional coordinating groups** predict a **low yield**. Increased hydrophobicity and steric bulk hinder effective metal coordination.
   - *Examples*: **octanoic acid**, **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with carbonyl-containing substituents** (e.g., aldehydes, ketones) predict a **low yield**. These groups may interfere with metal coordination or participate in side reactions.
    - *Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**.

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers containing **polyether chains terminating with carboxylic acid groups** predict a **low yield**. High flexibility and solvation reduce the likelihood of effective metal coordination.
    - *Examples*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**.

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **bulky fused aromatic systems capable of chelation**, such as lactones or diketones, predict a **high yield**. The rigid structures facilitate effective metal binding.
    - *Examples*: **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**, **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**.

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **amino acids or peptides containing additional amide groups in the side chain** predict a **low yield**. Amide functionalities may chelate metal ions differently, affecting catalyst activity.
    - *Examples*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**, **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**.

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with ortho-substituted hydroxyl and formyl groups capable of intramolecular hydrogen bonding** predict a **low yield**. Intramolecular interactions reduce availability for metal coordination.
    - *Example*: **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers containing **electron-donating methoxy groups on aromatic rings extending from aliphatic chains** predict a **high yield**. Methoxy groups can enhance metal coordination through electron donation.
    - *Example*: **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.
    - Modifiers with **methoxy groups but lacking flexible linkers** may predict a **low yield** due to steric hindrance.
      - *Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.

**Explanation and Analysis:**

In developing these rules, the following considerations were made:

- **Combination of Substructures**: Each rule combines multiple functional groups to explain their collective impact on yield. For example, Rule 1 focuses on α-amino acids with two carboxylic groups, considering both amino and carboxylate functionalities.

- **Underlying Physicochemical Properties**:
  - **Coordination Ability**: High-yield modifiers often contain functional groups (amino, hydroxyl, thiol, nitrogen heterocycles) capable of coordinating with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity.
  - **Electron Density**: Electron-donating groups (e.g., amino, methoxy) increase electron density on coordinating atoms, facilitating metal coordination.
  - **Steric Effects**: Bulky groups or long chains can hinder coordination due to steric hindrance, leading to lower yields.
  - **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., fluorinated chains) decrease electron density, impeding coordination.
  - **Flexibility and Solubility**: Highly flexible molecules or those with hydrophobic characteristics may have reduced effective coordination with metal centers.
  - **Intramolecular Interactions**: Functional groups that participate in intramolecular hydrogen bonding reduce the availability of coordination sites.

- **Clarity in Prediction**: Each rule clearly states whether the yield is predicted to be high or low based on the structural features described.

- **Coverage and Balance**:
  - **Broader Coverage**: Rules like 1–5 and 7–9 cover multiple compounds, capturing general trends in the dataset.
  - **Specificity**: Rules like 12 and 14 address specific substructures that have notable effects on yield.
  - **Balance Between Simplicity and Complexity**: The rules range from simple (e.g., Rule 2 on para-substituted groups) to more complex combinations of functional groups (e.g., Rule 15 on methoxy groups with flexible linkers).

These rules emphasize that **effective metal coordination is crucial for high yield** in the reaction. Modifiers that enhance coordination through electron-donating groups and additional coordination sites tend to improve yield. Conversely, modifiers that hinder coordination due to steric bulk, electron-withdrawing effects, or intramolecular interactions tend to result in lower yields.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: **Rules 1 to 7** are well-constructed, meeting all the criteria effectively. They are clear in their predictions, provide substantial physicochemical insights, consider combinations of functional groups (complexity), have sufficient coverage with multiple supporting data points, and maintain a good balance between specificity and general applicability.

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 8** is clear and offers valuable property insight regarding electron-withdrawing groups hindering metal coordination. However, its coverage is limited to a single data point (**2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**), which reduces the robustness of the rule. Expanding the dataset with additional modifiers containing electron-withdrawing groups would strengthen this rule.

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 9** faces an inconsistency with the dataset. While the rule predicts that modifiers with long aliphatic chains without additional coordinating groups yield low results, **octanoic acid** is an exception in the dataset, displaying a **high yield** (contrary to the rule's prediction). This discrepancy affects the rule's clarity and reliability. Revisiting the rule to account for such exceptions or refining its conditions would improve its accuracy.

- **Comment 4**: **Rules 10 to 13** are effective and align well with the criteria. They are clear in their structural descriptions and yield predictions, offer solid physicochemical insights (such as the impact of carbonyl groups, polyether chains, amide functionalities, and intramolecular hydrogen bonding on metal coordination), consider complex combinations of substructures, and are supported by at least two data points each. The balance between their specificity and the number of compounds they cover is appropriate.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 14** provides clear guidance on modifiers with ortho-substituted hydroxyl and formyl groups capable of intramolecular hydrogen bonding predicting low yield. While it offers good property insight and complexity, its coverage is limited to a single example (**5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**). To enhance the rule's validity, additional data points featuring similar structural characteristics should be included.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 15** is comprehensive and meets all the criteria. It clearly describes the effect of electron-donating methoxy groups on aromatic rings with flexible linkers, providing high yield predictions. The rule combines structural features thoughtfully (complexity), offers solid property insights into how methoxy groups enhance metal coordination, and is backed by multiple data points (**4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** showing high yield and **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** showing low yield), ensuring good coverage and balance.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with two carboxylic acid groups** predict a **high yield**. The presence of both the amino group and additional carboxylate enhances coordination with metal centers, improving catalyst activity.
   - *Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid), **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid).

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted amino or nitro groups** predict a **high yield**. These substituents enhance metal binding through additional coordination sites.
   - *Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**.
   - Modifiers with **para-substituted non-coordinating groups** (e.g., methyl) predict a **low yield** due to decreased coordination propensity.
     - *Example*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**.

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids containing nitrogen heterocycles**, such as pyridine rings, predict a **high yield**. Nitrogen atoms act as additional coordination sites for metal ions.
   - *Examples*: **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid), **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**.
   - Modifiers where the **heterocycle is sterically hindered or less accessible** predict a **low yield**.
     - *Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **small aliphatic carboxylic acids (chain length ≤ 6 carbons) with terminal amino groups** predict a **high yield**. The amino group enhances metal coordination, and shorter chains reduce steric hindrance.
   - *Example*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**.
   - Modifiers with **longer aliphatic chains** or lacking amino groups predict a **low yield** due to decreased solubility and coordination.
     - *Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **octanoic acid**.

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing **thiol (–SH) groups attached to aliphatic chains** predict a **high yield**. Thiol groups strongly coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.
   - *Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
   - If the thiol group is **attached to an aromatic ring**, the yield may be **low** due to steric hindrance or potential oxidation.
     - *Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains containing heteroatoms capable of metal coordination**, such as indole rings, predict a **high yield**.
   - *Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan).
   - Modifiers with **hydrophobic side chains lacking heteroatoms** predict a **low yield** due to insufficient coordination sites.
     - *Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine).

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing **multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxylic acid (polyhydroxy acids)** predict a **high yield**. The hydroxyl groups provide additional sites for metal coordination.
   - *Examples*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid), **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**.

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups**, such as perfluoroalkyl chains, predict a **low yield**. Electron-withdrawing effects reduce the basicity of the carboxylate ion, hindering metal coordination.
   - *Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **long aliphatic chains (chain length > 6 carbons) without additional coordinating groups** predict a **low yield**. Increased hydrophobicity and steric bulk hinder effective metal coordination.
   - *Examples*: **octanoic acid**, **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with carbonyl-containing substituents** (e.g., aldehydes, ketones) predict a **low yield**. These groups may interfere with metal coordination or participate in side reactions.
    - *Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**.

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers containing **polyether chains terminating with carboxylic acid groups** predict a **low yield**. High flexibility and solvation reduce the likelihood of effective metal coordination.
    - *Examples*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**.

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **bulky fused aromatic systems capable of chelation**, such as lactones or diketones, predict a **high yield**. The rigid structures facilitate effective metal binding.
    - *Examples*: **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**, **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**.

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **amino acids or peptides containing additional amide groups in the side chain** predict a **low yield**. Amide functionalities may chelate metal ions differently, affecting catalyst activity.
    - *Examples*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**, **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**.

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with ortho-substituted hydroxyl and formyl groups capable of intramolecular hydrogen bonding** predict a **low yield**. Intramolecular interactions reduce availability for metal coordination.
    - *Example*: **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers containing **electron-donating methoxy groups on aromatic rings extending from aliphatic chains** predict a **high yield**. Methoxy groups can enhance metal coordination through electron donation.
    - *Example*: **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.
    - Modifiers with **methoxy groups but lacking flexible linkers** may predict a **low yield** due to steric hindrance.
      - *Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.

**End of Rules**

**Explanation and Analysis:**

In developing these rules, the following considerations were made:

- **Combination of Substructures**: Each rule combines multiple functional groups to explain their collective impact on yield. For example, Rule 1 focuses on α-amino acids with two carboxylic groups, considering both amino and carboxylate functionalities.

- **Underlying Physicochemical Properties**:
  - **Coordination Ability**: High-yield modifiers often contain functional groups (amino, hydroxyl, thiol, nitrogen heterocycles) capable of coordinating with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity.
  - **Electron Density**: Electron-donating groups (e.g., amino, methoxy) increase electron density on coordinating atoms, facilitating metal coordination.
  - **Steric Effects**: Bulky groups or long chains can hinder coordination due to steric hindrance, leading to lower yields.
  - **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., fluorinated chains) decrease electron density, impeding coordination.
  - **Flexibility and Solubility**: Highly flexible molecules or those with hydrophobic characteristics may have reduced effective coordination with metal centers.
  - **Intramolecular Interactions**: Functional groups that participate in intramolecular hydrogen bonding reduce the availability of coordination sites.

- **Clarity in Prediction**: Each rule clearly states whether the yield is predicted to be high or low based on the structural features described.

- **Coverage and Balance**:
  - **Broader Coverage**: Rules like 1–5 and 7–9 cover multiple compounds, capturing general trends in the dataset.
  - **Specificity**: Rules like 12 and 14 address specific substructures that have notable effects on yield.
  - **Balance Between Simplicity and Complexity**: The rules range from simple (e.g., Rule 2 on para-substituted groups) to more complex combinations of functional groups (e.g., Rule 15 on methoxy groups with flexible linkers).

These rules emphasize that **effective metal coordination is crucial for high yield** in the reaction. Modifiers that enhance coordination through electron-donating groups and additional coordination sites tend to improve yield. Conversely, modifiers that hinder coordination due to steric bulk, electron-withdrawing effects, or intramolecular interactions tend to result in lower yields.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Rule 1** – Correct the Application of `count_threshold`  
  **Issue**: The implementation of Rule 1 checks for the presence of a primary amine and a carboxylic acid, with a `count_threshold` for `carboxylic_acid` set to 2. However, in the code, the `count_threshold` may not be correctly applied because the SMARTS pattern used as the key in the `count_threshold` dictionary may not match `pat.GetSmarts()` in the loop.  
  **Suggestion**: Modify the code to ensure that the count thresholds are correctly associated with their respective patterns. One way is to use identifiers or reference the pattern objects directly instead of relying on SMARTS strings for keys. For example, store the count thresholds alongside the compiled patterns:

  ```python
  # In the rule definition
  'patterns': [
      {'smarts': [primary_amine], 'threshold': None},
      {'smarts': [carboxylic_acid], 'threshold': 2},  # Require at least 2 carboxylic acids
  ],
  ```

  Then, in the code, check for the threshold:

  ```python
  for pattern_info in rule['compiled_patterns']:
      group_match = False
      for pat in pattern_info['smarts']:
          matches = mol.GetSubstructMatches(pat)
          if matches:
              # Check for count threshold
              if pattern_info['threshold']:
                  if len(matches) >= pattern_info['threshold']:
                      group_match = True
                      break
              else:
                  group_match = True
                  break
      if not group_match:
          match = False
          break
  ```

- **Suggestion 2**: **Rule 3** – Use More General Patterns for Nitrogen Heterocycles  
  **Issue**: The current pattern for Rule 3 uses the SMARTS `'n1ccccc1'`, which matches only pyridine rings and may miss other nitrogen heterocycles.  
  **Suggestion**: Update the pattern to match any nitrogen heterocycle. Use a more general SMARTS pattern like `'[n]1cccc1'` for five-membered rings or `'[nR]'` to match any aromatic nitrogen ring atom. Alternatively, include patterns for common nitrogen heterocycles such as pyrrole, imidazole, pyrimidine, etc.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Rule 4** – Implement Chain Length Restriction  
  **Issue**: Rule 4 specifies small aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths ≤ 6 carbons. The current code checks for a primary amine and carboxylic acid but does not consider the chain length.  
  **Suggestion**: Add code to calculate the longest carbon chain in the molecule and ensure it does not exceed six carbons. You can use RDKit's `Chem.GetLongestPath()` or perform a BFS traversal to find the longest path consisting of carbon atoms.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Rule 5** – Correct Exclude Patterns for Aromatic Thiols  
  **Issue**: The exclude patterns for Rule 5 are `[aromatic_nitro, aromatic_amino]`, which do not exclude thiol groups attached to aromatic rings as intended.  
  **Suggestion**: Modify the exclude pattern to specifically match thiol groups attached to aromatic rings. Use the SMARTS pattern `'[c][SX2H]'` to match aromatic thiols. Update the rule as follows:

  ```python
  'exclude_patterns': [
      ['[c][SX2H]'],  # Exclude thiol attached to aromatic ring
  ],
  ```

- **Suggestion 5**: **Rule 6** – Refine Patterns for Side Chains with Heteroatoms  
  **Issue**: The pattern for Rule 6 (`'[primary_amine, carboxylic_acid, '[#7,#8,#15,#16]']'`) may match any molecule with these atoms, not necessarily α-amino acids with side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms like indole rings.  
  **Suggestion**: Use SMARTS patterns that specifically match indole rings or side chains with coordinating heteroatoms. For example, include the indole pattern `'c1c[cH]c2c1cc[nH]2'` and ensure that it's connected to the α-amino acid structure.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Rule 7** – Ensure Correct Application of Hydroxyl Group Count  
  **Issue**: As with Rule 1, the `count_threshold` for hydroxyl groups may not be applied correctly due to pattern matching issues.  
  **Suggestion**: Similar to Suggestion 1, associate thresholds directly with patterns and ensure they are correctly checked in the code. Also, update the hydroxyl group pattern to match all hydroxyl groups, including those attached to carbons near carboxylic acids.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Rule 8** – Expand Patterns for Electron-Withdrawing Groups  
  **Issue**: The pattern for perfluoroalkyl chains (`'[CX4]([F,Cl,Br,I])([F,Cl,Br,I])[F,Cl,Br,I]'`) might only match specific cases and miss longer chains.  
  **Suggestion**: Use a recursive SMARTS pattern to match perfluoroalkyl chains of varying lengths. For example: `'[CX4](F)(F)[CX2](F)(F)[CX2](F)(F)F'` for longer chains, or use '`[CX4](F)(F)(F)`' to match trifluoromethyl groups and extend from there.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Rule 9** – Identify Long Aliphatic Chains More Accurately  
  **Issue**: The pattern for long aliphatic chains might be too specific (`'[CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2]'`) and miss chains of different lengths or branching.  
  **Suggestion**: Use a SMARTS pattern that matches aliphatic chains longer than six carbons, possibly using recursive definitions. Alternatively, calculate the maximum aliphatic chain length in the molecule and check if it exceeds six.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Rule 11** – Match Polyether Chains Correctly  
  **Issue**: Checking for two occurrences of ether linkages (`'[#6][OX2][#6]'`) may not specifically identify polyether chains.  
  **Suggestion**: Use SMARTS patterns that match repeating ether units, such as `'[$([CX4][OX2][CX4][OX2][CX4])]'` for at least three ether units. Adjust the `count_threshold` accordingly or use recursive SMARTS to match polyether chains of any length.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Rule 13** – Refine Patterns for Side Chain Amide Groups  
  **Issue**: The current pattern may not specifically target amino acids or peptides with additional amide groups in the side chain.  
  **Suggestion**: Create SMARTS patterns that match amino acids with side-chain amide groups. For example, for lysine with an acetamido group, you might use `'[NX3][CX3](=O)[NX3][CX3][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'`. Ensure the side-chain amide is connected appropriately.

- **Suggestion 11**: **Code Logic Enhancements**  
  **Issue**: The code's matching logic may not be correctly grouping patterns and applying thresholds, leading to incorrect matches in the feature matrix.  
  **Suggestion**:

  - Ensure that within each rule, all required patterns must be present for a positive match.
  - Update the matching loop to correctly handle multiple patterns and their thresholds.
  - Add debug statements or logging to verify that patterns are being matched as expected during execution.

- **Suggestion 12**: **Testing and Validation**  
  **Issue**: The identical rows in the feature matrix suggest that the code may not be correctly distinguishing between different SMILES inputs.  
  **Suggestion**:

  - Test each rule individually with SMILES strings known to match and not match the rule to ensure the code functions correctly.
  - Use unit tests to validate that each SMARTS pattern and rule logic works as intended.
  - Verify that the feature matrix reflects the expected predictions based on the rules and the given SMILES.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with two carboxylic acid groups** predict a **high yield**. The presence of both the amino group and additional carboxylate enhances coordination with metal centers, improving catalyst activity.
   - *Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid), **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid).

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted amino or nitro groups** predict a **high yield**. These substituents enhance metal binding through additional coordination sites.
   - *Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**.
   - Modifiers with **para-substituted non-coordinating groups** (e.g., methyl) predict a **low yield** due to decreased coordination propensity.
     - *Example*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**.

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids containing nitrogen heterocycles**, such as pyridine rings, predict a **high yield**. Nitrogen atoms act as additional coordination sites for metal ions.
   - *Examples*: **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid), **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**.
   - Modifiers where the **heterocycle is sterically hindered or less accessible** predict a **low yield**.
     - *Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **small aliphatic carboxylic acids (chain length ≤ 6 carbons) with terminal amino groups** predict a **high yield**. The amino group enhances metal coordination, and shorter chains reduce steric hindrance.
   - *Example*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**.
   - Modifiers with **longer aliphatic chains** or lacking amino groups predict a **low yield** due to decreased solubility and coordination.
     - *Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **octanoic acid**.

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing **thiol (–SH) groups attached to aliphatic chains** predict a **high yield**. Thiol groups strongly coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.
   - *Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
   - If the thiol group is **attached to an aromatic ring**, the yield may be **low** due to steric hindrance or potential oxidation.
     - *Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side chains containing heteroatoms capable of metal coordination**, such as indole rings, predict a **high yield**.
   - *Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan).
   - Modifiers with **hydrophobic side chains lacking heteroatoms** predict a **low yield** due to insufficient coordination sites.
     - *Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine).

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing **multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxylic acid (polyhydroxy acids)** predict a **high yield**. The hydroxyl groups provide additional sites for metal coordination.
   - *Examples*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid), **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**.

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups**, such as perfluoroalkyl chains, predict a **low yield**. Electron-withdrawing effects reduce the basicity of the carboxylate ion, hindering metal coordination.
   - *Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **long aliphatic chains (chain length > 6 carbons) without additional coordinating groups** predict a **low yield**. Increased hydrophobicity and steric bulk hinder effective metal coordination.
   - *Examples*: **octanoic acid**, **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with carbonyl-containing substituents** (e.g., aldehydes, ketones) predict a **low yield**. These groups may interfere with metal coordination or participate in side reactions.
    - *Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**.

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers containing **polyether chains terminating with carboxylic acid groups** predict a **low yield**. High flexibility and solvation reduce the likelihood of effective metal coordination.
    - *Examples*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**.

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **bulky fused aromatic systems capable of chelation**, such as lactones or diketones, predict a **high yield**. The rigid structures facilitate effective metal binding.
    - *Examples*: **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**, **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**.

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **amino acids or peptides containing additional amide groups in the side chain** predict a **low yield**. Amide functionalities may chelate metal ions differently, affecting catalyst activity.
    - *Examples*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**, **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**.

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with ortho-substituted hydroxyl and formyl groups capable of intramolecular hydrogen bonding** predict a **low yield**. Intramolecular interactions reduce availability for metal coordination.
    - *Example*: **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers containing **electron-donating methoxy groups on aromatic rings extending from aliphatic chains** predict a **high yield**. Methoxy groups can enhance metal coordination through electron donation.
    - *Example*: **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.
    - Modifiers with **methoxy groups but lacking flexible linkers** may predict a **low yield** due to steric hindrance.
      - *Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.

**End of Rules**

---

**Explanation and Analysis:**

In developing these rules, the following considerations were made:

- **Combination of Substructures**: Each rule combines multiple functional groups to explain their collective impact on yield. For example, Rule 1 focuses on α-amino acids with two carboxylic groups, considering both amino and carboxylate functionalities.

- **Underlying Physicochemical Properties**:
  - **Coordination Ability**: High-yield modifiers often contain functional groups (amino, hydroxyl, thiol, nitrogen heterocycles) capable of coordinating with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity.
  - **Electron Density**: Electron-donating groups (e.g., amino, methoxy) increase electron density on coordinating atoms, facilitating metal coordination.
  - **Steric Effects**: Bulky groups or long chains can hinder coordination due to steric hindrance, leading to lower yields.
  - **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., fluorinated chains) decrease electron density, impeding coordination.
  - **Flexibility and Solubility**: Highly flexible molecules or those with hydrophobic characteristics may have reduced effective coordination with metal centers.
  - **Intramolecular Interactions**: Functional groups that participate in intramolecular hydrogen bonding reduce the availability of coordination sites.

- **Clarity in Prediction**: Each rule clearly states whether the yield is predicted to be high or low based on the structural features described.

- **Coverage and Balance**:
  - **Broader Coverage**: Rules like 1–5 and 7–9 cover multiple compounds, capturing general trends in the dataset.
  - **Specificity**: Rules like 12 and 14 address specific substructures that have notable effects on yield.
  - **Balance Between Simplicity and Complexity**: The rules range from simple (e.g., Rule 2 on para-substituted groups) to more complex combinations of functional groups (e.g., Rule 15 on methoxy groups with flexible linkers).

These rules emphasize that **effective metal coordination is crucial for high yield** in the reaction. Modifiers that enhance coordination through electron-donating groups and additional coordination sites tend to improve yield. Conversely, modifiers that hinder coordination due to steric bulk, electron-withdrawing effects, or intramolecular interactions tend to result in lower yields.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- **Suggestion 1**: In **Rule 1**, modify the code to specifically identify **α-amino acids** by ensuring that the amino group and one carboxylic acid group are attached to the same carbon atom (the α-carbon). Update the SMARTS pattern to reflect this, such as using `'[CX4;H1](N)([CH3])[C](=O)[O]'` to match α-amino acids. This ensures that only amino acids with the correct positioning of functional groups are matched.

- **Suggestion 2**: In **Rule 4**, adjust the code to ensure that the **primary amine is terminal** on an aliphatic chain of length ≤6 carbons. Modify the SMARTS pattern to check that the primary amine is attached to the end of the carbon chain, such as `'[NX3;H2][CH2]{1,5}[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'`, and verify that the chain length does not exceed 6 carbons including the carboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 3**: In **Rule 6**, refine the code to match **α-amino acids with side chains containing specific heteroatoms capable of metal coordination**, such as indole rings. Update the SMARTS pattern to identify side chains attached to the α-carbon that contain these heterocyclic rings. For example, use patterns like `'[CX4;H1](N)([CH2][c]1c[nH]c2c1cccc2)[C](=O)[O]'` to specifically match tryptophan and similar amino acids.

- **Suggestion 4**: In **Rule 7**, modify the code to **exclude hydroxyl groups that are part of carboxylic acids**, so only free hydroxyl groups are counted. Adjust the SMARTS pattern for hydroxyl groups to prevent matching the hydroxyl in –COOH, such as `'[OX2H][C;!$(C=O)]'`, which matches hydroxyl groups attached to carbons not double-bonded to oxygen.

- **Suggestion 5**: For **Rule 3**, expand the SMARTS pattern to include other **nitrogen heterocycles** beyond pyridine rings, such as pyridazine, pyrimidine, and pyrazine. Use a more general SMARTS pattern like `'[n][c]1ncccc1'` or include multiple patterns to cover a variety of nitrogen-containing heterocycles.

- **Suggestion 6**: Review and adjust the code for rules where **steric hindrance** or **substituent positions** are significant factors (e.g., Rules 2, 3, 5, 10, 14, 15). Ensure that the SMARTS patterns accurately capture these features by specifying positions (ortho, meta, para) and steric hindrance conditions.

- **Suggestion 7**: Implement **additional checks for chain lengths and branching** where applicable, especially in **Rules 4 and 9**. Use RDKit functions to calculate the longest carbon chain and determine if it meets the criteria of the rule.

- **Suggestion 8**: Incorporate more **specific exclusion patterns** where necessary to prevent false positives. For example, in **Rule 5**, ensure that thiol groups on aromatic rings are correctly excluded by adjusting the exclude pattern to `'[SX2H][c]'`.

- **Suggestion 9**: Add **commented examples** within the code for each rule, showing which SMILES strings should match and explaining why. This will aid in verifying the correctness of the SMARTS patterns.

- **Suggestion 10**: Include **error handling and logging** to capture cases where SMILES strings fail to parse or where unexpected matches occur. This will help identify and fix issues in the SMARTS patterns and overall code logic.

** End of Suggestions **

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify and Generalize the Rules Based on Key Functional Groups**

  Focus on the presence or absence of specific functional groups that have a direct impact on yield. Streamline the rules to emphasize individual functional groups (e.g., amino, carboxyl, hydroxyl, thiol) rather than complex combinations. This simplifies rule application and makes feature extraction more straightforward.

- **Advice 2**: **Use Quantitative Molecular Descriptors**

  Incorporate easily computable molecular descriptors derived from the SMILES strings. These can include:

  - **Count of Specific Atoms or Groups**: Number of nitrogen atoms, oxygen atoms, sulfur atoms, carboxylic acid groups, amino groups, hydroxyl groups, etc.
  - **Structural Features**: Ring count, presence of heterocycles, chain length of aliphatic chains.

**Explanation and Analysis:**

In developing these rules, the following considerations were made:

- **Combination of Substructures**: Each rule combines multiple functional groups to explain their collective impact on yield. For example, Rule 2 considers both the aromatic ring and para-substituted amino or nitro groups.

- **Underlying Physicochemical Properties**:
  - **Coordination Ability**: High-yield modifiers often contain functional groups (amino, hydroxyl, thiol, nitrogen heterocycles) capable of coordinating with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity.
  - **Electron Density**: Electron-donating groups (e.g., amino, methoxy) increase electron density on coordinating atoms, facilitating metal coordination.
  - **Steric Effects**: Bulky groups or long chains can hinder coordination due to steric hindrance, leading to lower yields.
  - **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., fluorinated chains) decrease electron density, impeding coordination.
  - **Flexibility and Solubility**: Highly flexible molecules or those with hydrophobic characteristics may have reduced effective coordination with metal centers.
  - **Intramolecular Interactions**: Functional groups that participate in intramolecular hydrogen bonding reduce the availability of coordination sites.

- **Clarity in Prediction**: Each rule clearly states whether the yield is predicted to be high or low based on the structural features described.

- **Coverage and Balance**:
  - **Broader Coverage**: Rules like 1–5 and 7–9 cover multiple compounds, capturing general trends in the dataset.
  - **Specificity**: Rules like 13 and 15 address specific substructures that have notable effects on yield.
  - **Balance Between Simplicity and Complexity**: The rules range from simple (e.g., Rule 4 on chain length and amino groups) to more complex combinations of functional groups (e.g., Rule 12 on methoxy groups with flexible linkers).

These rules emphasize that **effective metal coordination is crucial for high yield** in the reaction. Modifiers that enhance coordination through electron-donating groups and additional coordination sites tend to improve yield. Conversely, modifiers that hinder coordination due to steric bulk, electron-withdrawing effects, or intramolecular interactions tend to result in lower yields.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and easily applicable, as it specifically describes α-amino acids with two carboxylic acid groups (dicarboxylic amino acids), which directly maps to the dataset examples. The physicochemical insight is solid, highlighting the enhanced coordination ability due to the presence of both amino and carboxylate groups. The rule considers a combination of substructures (amino and carboxylic groups), demonstrating appropriate complexity. It is supported by at least two data points—(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid and (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid—which both exhibit high yield, showing good coverage. Overall, the rule is well-balanced between specificity and applicability.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clearly defined, specifying that aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted amino or nitro groups predict high yield, while those with para-methyl groups predict low yield. This clarity allows for straightforward application. The rule provides physicochemical insight by explaining that amino and nitro groups enhance metal coordination due to additional coordination sites, whereas methyl groups do not contribute to coordination. It combines substructures (aromatic ring, carboxylic acid, specific para-substituents), satisfying the complexity criterion. It is supported by multiple data points: 4-aminobenzoic acid and 4-nitrobenzoic acid (high yield), and 4-methylbenzoic acid (low yield), indicating adequate coverage. The rule is balanced, capturing key differences in substituents' effects on yield.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear and allows us to determine whether a modifier will predict high or low yield based on the presence of a pyridine ring attached to a carboxylic acid and considerations of steric hindrance. The physicochemical insight is sound, explaining that the pyridine nitrogen acts as an additional coordination site, enhancing metal ion binding, while steric hindrance reduces this effect. The rule considers combinations of substructures and steric factors, adding complexity. It is supported by at least two high-yield data points—pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid—and one low-yield point—4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid—showing good coverage. The rule is balanced, capturing the impact of structural features and steric effects.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear in its description of short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal amino groups predicting high yield, and longer chains or lack of amino groups predicting low yield. The physicochemical rationale is logical, highlighting the role of amino groups in metal coordination and the impact of steric hindrance from longer chains. However, the rule does not align with all data points: octanoic acid (a long-chain acid without an amino group) shows high yield in the dataset, which contradicts the rule's prediction. This suggests that the rule may lack sufficient coverage or may need refinement to account for exceptions. While the rule considers combinations of substructures (chain length and amino groups), the mismatch with the data indicates that the rule may not be fully accurate, affecting its balance.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clearly defined, specifying that thiol groups attached to aliphatic chains predict high yield, while attachment to aromatic rings predicts low yield. The physicochemical insight is appropriate, noting the strong metal coordination by thiol groups and the potential steric or reactivity issues when attached to aromatic rings. The rule involves combinations of substructures, considering both the functional group (thiol) and its context (aliphatic vs. aromatic attachment). It is supported by at least one high-yield data point (3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) and one low-yield point (4-sulfanylbenzoic acid), providing adequate coverage. Overall, the rule is balanced and aligns with the dataset.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear, distinguishing between α-amino acids with side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms and those without. The physicochemical insight is accurate, recognizing that heteroatoms like nitrogen in the indole ring can coordinate with metals, enhancing yield, while aromatic side chains lacking such heteroatoms do not contribute to coordination. The rule incorporates combinations of substructures (amino acid backbone and side chain properties), satisfying the complexity criterion. It is supported by data points—tryptophan (high yield) and phenylalanine (low yield)—demonstrating coverage. The rule is balanced and aligns well with the dataset.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 clearly states that polyhydroxy acids predict high yield due to multiple hydroxyl groups providing coordination sites. The physicochemical insight is appropriate, as additional hydroxyl groups can coordinate with metal centers. The rule combines substructures (carboxylic acid with multiple proximal hydroxyl groups), satisfying the complexity criterion. It is supported by at least two high-yield data points—(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid and 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid—indicating good coverage. The rule is balanced between specificity and applicability.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is clear, indicating that aromatic carboxylic acids with ortho or para carbonyl-containing substituents predict low yield. The physicochemical insight is logical, suggesting that such substituents might interfere with metal coordination or lead to side reactions. The rule involves combinations of substructures (aromatic ring, carboxylic acid, specific carbonyl substituents at certain positions), providing complexity. It is supported by at least two low-yield data points—4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid—showing good coverage. The rule is well-balanced and aligns with the dataset.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 states that modifiers with long aliphatic chains (>6 carbons) without additional coordinating groups predict low yield due to hindered coordination. While this is a reasonable physicochemical rationale, the rule does not align with all data points. Specifically, octanoic acid (an eight-carbon chain without additional coordinating groups) shows high yield in the dataset, contradicting the rule's prediction. However, other examples like 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid and 8-aminooctanoic acid do have low yields, supporting the rule partially. The rule is clear and considers combinations of chain length and presence of coordinating groups, but inconsistency with the data affects its coverage and balance.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 clearly states that modifiers with electron-withdrawing groups like fluoroalkyl chains predict low yield due to reduced electron density for coordination. The physicochemical insight is valid. However, the rule is supported by only one data point in the dataset (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid), limiting its coverage. It considers the combination of substructures, specifically electron-withdrawing groups, but the lack of multiple supporting examples affects the rule's robustness and balance.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 presents a clear prediction that polyether carboxylic acids or modifiers with long ethylene glycol chains predict low yield due to reduced effective metal coordination from increased flexibility and solvation. The physicochemical insight is appropriate. The rule considers combinations of substructures (polyether chains and carboxylic acid groups), adding complexity. It is supported by at least two low-yield data points—2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid and 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid—demonstrating good coverage. The rule is balanced and aligns with the dataset.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is somewhat complex but clearly explains that methoxy groups on aromatic rings connected via flexible linkers predict high yield, while methoxy groups directly attached to rigid structures predict low yield. The physicochemical insight accounts for electron donation of methoxy groups and the influence of linker flexibility on coordination. The rule considers combinations of substructures and linker properties, adding complexity. It is supported by one high-yield data point (4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid) and one low-yield data point (3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid), providing limited coverage. While the rule captures nuanced structural effects, its applicability may be constrained due to the small number of supporting examples.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear in stating that aromatic lactones or fused ring systems with carboxylic acid groups predict high yield due to rigid structures facilitating metal binding. The physicochemical insight is reasonable. However, the rule is supported by only one data point in the dataset (1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid), limiting its coverage. The rule considers specific complex substructures, adding complexity, but the lack of multiple supporting examples reduces its robustness and balance.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 clearly indicates that amino acids or peptides with additional amide or acetamido groups in the side chain predict low yield due to altered metal chelation. The physicochemical insight is appropriate. The rule considers combinations of substructures (amino acids with specific side-chain functionalities), providing complexity. It is supported by at least two low-yield data points—(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid and 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid—indicating good coverage. The rule is balanced and consistent with the dataset.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 is clear, stating that modifiers with heteroatoms in both backbone and side chain predict high yield due to multiple coordination sites enhancing metal binding. The physicochemical insight is valid. The rule considers combinations of substructures with coordinating heteroatoms, adding complexity. However, it is supported by only one data point in the dataset (2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid), limiting coverage. While the rule is theoretically sound, the lack of multiple supporting examples affects its applicability and balance.

**Explanation and Analysis:**

In developing these rules, the following considerations were taken into account:

- **Combination of Substructures**: Each rule integrates multiple functional groups or structural features to explain their collective impact on the yield. For instance, Rule 2 combines an aromatic ring with specific para-substituents (amino or nitro groups).

- **Underlying Physicochemical Properties**:
  - **Coordination Ability**: High-yield modifiers often contain functional groups (amino, hydroxyl, thiol, nitrogen heterocycles) that can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance.
  - **Electron Density**: Electron-donating groups (e.g., amino, methoxy) increase electron density on coordinating atoms, facilitating stronger metal coordination.
  - **Steric Effects**: Bulky substituents or extended chains can cause steric hindrance, reducing the effectiveness of metal coordination and leading to lower yields.
  - **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., fluorinated chains, aldehydes) decrease electron density, impeding coordination.
  - **Flexibility and Solvation**: Highly flexible molecules or those with hydrophobic characteristics may have reduced ability to effectively coordinate with metal centers.
  - **Intramolecular Interactions**: Functional groups that can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds may reduce the availability of coordination sites.

- **Clarity in Prediction**: Each rule explicitly states whether the structural features predict a high or low yield, allowing for clear application to new modifiers.

- **Coverage and Balance**:
  - **Broader Coverage**: Rules like 1–5 address common structural motifs in the dataset, covering multiple compounds and capturing general trends.
  - **Specificity**: More detailed rules (e.g., Rule 11 on methoxy groups with flexible linkers) address specific compounds with notable effects on yield.
  - **Balance Between Simplicity and Complexity**: The rules range from general guidelines to more nuanced observations, aligning with the requirement to balance coverage and complexity.

This limits the reliability and balance of the rule.

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13** is clear and provides good physical-chemical insight into how additional amide or acetamido groups in side chains may alter metal chelation. It combines amino acids or peptides with specific side-chain modifications, satisfying the complexity criterion. The rule is supported by data points: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** and **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (both predicting low yield), ensuring adequate coverage and balance.

- **Comment 14**: **Rule 14** clearly defines modifiers with long aliphatic chains (≥7 carbons) without additional coordinating groups predicting low yield, providing physical-chemical insight into how hydrophobicity and steric bulk hinder coordination. The rule considers chain length and the absence of functional groups, meeting the complexity criterion. It is supported by data points: **8-aminooctanoic acid** (low yield), but the exception of **octanoic acid** (high yield) suggests that other factors may modulate the effect, slightly affecting the balance and coverage.

- **Comment 15**: **Rule 15** is redundant with **Rule 3**, both addressing modifiers containing pyridine rings directly connected to carboxylic acids predicting high yield, and those with additional linkers predicting low yield due to steric hindrance. While the physical-chemical insight and complexity are acceptable, this duplication indicates a lack of balance in the set of rules. Moreover, combining these similar rules could improve coverage and reduce redundancy.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Standardize and Quantify Rule Criteria**  
  Refine the rules by specifying exact structural criteria that can be directly extracted from SMILES strings. Replace qualitative descriptions like "short-chain" or "long aliphatic chains" with specific carbon atom counts or chain lengths. For example, define "short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids" as those with aliphatic chains containing **four or fewer carbons**.

- **Advice 2**: **Convert Rules into Binary Features Using SMARTS Patterns**  
  For each rule, create corresponding SMARTS (SMILES Arbitrary Target Specification) patterns that identify the key functional groups or substructures. This facilitates the automatic detection of these features in the modifiers and allows for the generation of a numeric feature matrix with binary indicators (1 for presence, 0 for absence).

- **Advice 3**: **Merge and Simplify Overlapping Rules**  
  Combine similar rules to reduce redundancy and improve clarity. For instance, merge Rules 1, 4, and 6 by creating a general rule for modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing coordinating functional groups (e.g., amino, carboxylic acid, thiol, hydroxyl, or heterocycles).

- **Advice 4**: **Incorporate Molecular Descriptors as Numerical Features**  
  Extract numerical molecular descriptors from the SMILES strings using cheminformatics tools like RDKit or Chemistry Development Kit (CDK). Descriptors may include:
  - **Topological Polar Surface Area (TPSA)**
  - **Number of Hydrogen Bond Donors (HBD) and Acceptors (HBA)**
  - **Molecular Weight (MW)**
  - **LogP (Octanol-Water Partition Coefficient)**
  - **Counts of Specific Functional Groups** (e.g., amino groups, carboxylic acids, aromatic rings)
  Including these descriptors in the feature matrix can help quantify the impact of molecular features on the yield.

- **Advice 5**: **Develop Quantitative Rules Based on Descriptor Thresholds**  
  Transform qualitative rules into quantitative ones by establishing thresholds for numerical descriptors. For example:
  - Modifiers with **TPSA > 75 Å²** tend to result in **high yield**.
  - Modifiers with **LogP < 2.5** are associated with **high yield**.
  - Modifiers containing **three or more coordinating atoms** (O, N, S) predict a **high yield**.

- **Advice 6**: **Automate Feature Extraction for High-Throughput Analysis**  
  Use scripting and cheminformatics libraries to automate the extraction of features from SMILES strings. This approach ensures consistency and efficiency in generating the numeric feature matrix required for statistical analysis or machine learning models.

- **Advice 7**: **Reevaluate Rules Using Statistical Correlation Analysis**  
  Perform statistical analyses (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests) to identify which features most strongly correlate with high or low yield. Use this data-driven approach to refine existing rules or develop new ones based on quantitative evidence.

- **Advice 8**: **Clarify and Consolidate Rules with Explicit Substructures**  
  Provide clear definitions of substructures involved in each rule. Include structural diagrams or specify fragments in SMILES notation for precise identification. For example:
  - High yield modifiers contain the **pyridine carboxylic acid** fragment: `c1cccnc1C(=O)O`.

- **Advice 9**: **Simplify Complex Rules Affecting Computational Accessibility**  
  Identify and simplify rules that are too complex for practical computation. For instance, rules involving intramolecular interactions or steric hindrance may be challenging to quantify directly. Focus on easily computable features and consider omitting overly complicated rules in favor of statistically significant descriptors.

- **Advice 10**: **Weight Rules Based on Predictive Strength**  
  Assign weights to rules according to their predictive accuracy determined through validation with the dataset. This weighted approach helps prioritize features that have a more significant impact on the yield, improving the overall predictability of the model.

- **Advice 11**: **Update Rules to Reflect Exceptions and Anomalies**  
  Analyze cases where the current rules do not accurately predict the yield (e.g., octanoic acid being an exception). Revise the rules to account for such exceptions, possibly by introducing new descriptors or adjusting thresholds.

- **Advice 12**: **Create a Hierarchical Rule Structure**  
  Organize the rules in a hierarchical manner, starting with the most general descriptors and moving to more specific ones. This structure can improve the efficiency of feature extraction and model training by filtering modifiers through successive layers of criteria.

- **Advice 13**: **Incorporate Machine Learning for Feature Selection**  
  Utilize machine learning algorithms to identify the most significant features impacting the yield. Techniques like feature importance rankings from tree-based models can highlight which molecular descriptors or structural features are most predictive, guiding further refinement of the rules.

- **Advice 14**: **Ensure Consistency in Terminology and Definitions**  
  Standardize the language used in the rules to avoid confusion. Use consistent definitions for functional groups and structural terms throughout all rules. This clarity is crucial for both manual interpretation and computational parsing.

- **Advice 15**: **Validate and Iterate on the Improved Ruleset**  
  After implementing these improvements, validate the new ruleset against experimental data. Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess performance. Iterate on the rules as necessary to enhance predictive capability.

These rules have been carefully formulated to illustrate the relationship between the structural features of molecular modifiers and the resulting high or low yield in the reaction. Each rule combines multiple sub-structures (functional groups), such as amino groups, aromatic rings, and chain length, to predict the outcome based on underlying physicochemical properties like metal coordination ability, steric effects, and electronic factors.

By applying these rules, one can predict the expected yield for any given molecular modifier based on its structural characteristics.

  Revise the current rules to focus on simple, quantifiable structural features that can be directly extracted from SMILES strings. This means breaking down complex structural descriptions into basic components like the number of specific functional groups (e.g., carboxylic acids, amino groups), ring systems, or atom types. For example, instead of "α-amino acids with side-chain carboxylic acid groups," specify "molecules containing both an alpha-amino group and at least one additional carboxylic acid group."

- **Advice 2**: **Develop a Standardized Feature Set**  
  Create a standardized set of molecular descriptors that are universally applicable across all modifiers. These descriptors should include counts of specific atoms (N, O, S, F), counts of functional groups (amino groups, carboxylic acids, hydroxyl groups), and properties like molecular weight, hydrophobicity (LogP), and topological polar surface area (TPSA). Utilize cheminformatics tools like RDKit to calculate these descriptors directly from the SMILES strings.

- **Advice 3**: **Convert Structural Features into Binary Variables**  
  Transform the presence or absence of particular structural features into binary variables (1 for presence, 0 for absence). This facilitates the generation of a numeric feature matrix suitable for statistical analysis and machine learning models. For instance, create binary descriptors for features like "contains aromatic ring," "has thiol group," or "contains pyridine nitrogen."

- **Advice 4**: **Break Down Complex Rules into Independent Features**  
  Deconstruct rules that combine multiple features into separate, independent features to assess their individual impact on yield. For example, if a rule involves both chain length and functional group presence, create separate descriptors for chain length (e.g., number of carbons in the longest chain) and functional group counts.

- **Advice 5**: **Utilize Molecular Fingerprints**  
  Generate molecular fingerprints (e.g., ECFP6, MACCS keys) from the SMILES strings. These fingerprints provide a numerical representation of molecular substructures and can capture patterns not immediately evident from simple descriptors. Fingerprints can be directly used in machine learning models to predict yields.

- **Advice 6**: **Quantify Steric and Electronic Effects**  
  Replace qualitative assessments like "steric hindrance" or "electron-withdrawing effects" with quantifiable parameters. Calculate steric parameters such as molar volume or molecular van der Waals surface area. Use electronic descriptors like Hammett sigma constants, calculated partial charges, or electrophilicity indices to represent electronic effects numerically.

- **Advice 7**: **Incorporate Quantitative Structure–Activity Relationship (QSAR) Modeling**  
  Use QSAR techniques to establish mathematical relationships between molecular descriptors and the reaction yield. This approach leverages statistical methods to correlate numerical features with experimental outcomes, providing predictive models based on quantifiable data.

- **Advice 8**: **Employ Machine Learning Algorithms**  
  Utilize machine learning algorithms (e.g., random forests, support vector machines, neural networks) to analyze the numerical feature matrix. These algorithms can identify complex, nonlinear relationships between molecular features and yields, potentially uncovering new insights and patterns beyond human-derived rules.

- **Advice 9**: **Automate Feature Extraction**  
  Ensure all rules and descriptors can be programmatically extracted from SMILES strings using cheminformatics libraries. This automation reduces human error, increases reproducibility, and significantly speeds up data processing—making it practical to handle large datasets.

- **Advice 10**: **Reevaluate and Refine Existing Rules**  
  Continuously validate and refine the rules using the numerical data. Identify which features have statistically significant correlations with high or low yields. Discard or modify rules that do not hold up under quantitative analysis. This iterative process will improve the reliability and predictive power of the rules.

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with long chains (>6 carbons) without additional coordinating groups** predict a **variable yield**. Increased chain length can hinder coordination due to steric factors, but exceptions exist.
    - *Example*: **octanoic acid** predicts a **high yield** despite its length.

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups connected via an aliphatic linker** predict a **high yield**. The linker provides flexibility, allowing better coordination.
    - *Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.
    - Modifiers with hydroxyl groups **directly attached to the aromatic ring** predict a **low yield** due to rigidity and steric hindrance.
      - *Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers containing **lactone rings with carboxylic acid groups** predict a **high yield**. The rigid lactone structure aids in effective metal coordination.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Quantify Structural Features in the Rules**  
  Refine the current rules to specify quantifiable structural features that can be directly extracted from SMILES strings. For each rule, identify specific molecular descriptors such as the count of functional groups (e.g., carboxylic acids, amino groups), presence of heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur atoms), ring systems (aromatic or aliphatic), and chain lengths. This will enable the generation of a numeric feature matrix by assigning numerical values to these descriptors.

- **Advice 2**: **Standardize Functional Group Definitions**  
  Create a standardized list of functional groups and structural motifs relevant to the reaction yield. Define each group precisely so that it can be algorithmically detected within SMILES strings. For example, specify amines as primary, secondary, or tertiary, and carboxylic acids as mono-, di-, or poly-carboxylic acids. This standardization will facilitate consistent feature extraction across different molecules.

- **Advice 3**: **Develop Binary and Continuous Descriptors**  
  For each structural feature identified, assign binary descriptors (1 or 0) to indicate the presence or absence of that feature, and continuous descriptors to represent counts or proportions. For instance, use a binary descriptor for the presence of a pyridine ring (1 if present, 0 if not) and a continuous descriptor for the number of carboxylic acid groups. This approach will create a comprehensive feature matrix suitable for quantitative analysis.

- **Advice 4**: **Integrate Molecular Property Calculations**  
  Incorporate calculable molecular properties into the rules, such as molecular weight, topological polar surface area (TPSA), LogP values, and hydrogen bond donors and acceptors. These properties can be derived from SMILES strings using cheminformatics tools and may correlate with the reaction yield. Including them will enhance the predictive power of the feature matrix.

- **Advice 5**: **Simplify and Merge Overlapping Rules**  
  Review the current rules for overlap and redundancy. Combine similar rules to reduce complexity. For example, rules concerning amino acids with coordinating side chains (Rules 1 and 6) can be merged into a single rule focusing on amino acids with side chains containing heteroatoms capable of metal coordination. Simplifying the rules will make feature extraction more straightforward.

- **Advice 6**: **Create a Feature Extraction Protocol**  
  Develop a clear protocol or algorithm for extracting features from SMILES strings based on the refined rules. This protocol should outline the steps to parse each molecule, identify relevant functional groups, and assign descriptor values. Providing examples alongside the protocol will aid in accurate and consistent feature extraction.

- **Advice 7**: **Validate Rules Against the Dataset**  
  Cross-reference the refined rules with the provided dataset to ensure consistency and accuracy. Identify any discrepancies where the rules do not predict the yield correctly and adjust the rules accordingly. This validation step will help in refining the rules to better match empirical observations.

- **Advice 8**: **Incorporate Stereochemistry Where Relevant**  
  Consider the stereochemistry of modifiers if it impacts the yield. For example, specific enantiomers or diastereomers may coordinate differently with metal centers. Ensure that stereochemical information is included in the descriptors when relevant.

- **Advice 9**: **Leverage Cheminformatics Software**  
  Utilize cheminformatics libraries (e.g., RDKit) to automate the feature extraction process. These tools can parse SMILES strings and calculate a wide range of molecular descriptors efficiently. Automation will improve the scalability and reproducibility of feature generation.

- **Advice 10**: **Document Assumptions and Limitations**  
  Clearly document any assumptions made during the rule refinement and feature extraction processes. Acknowledge the limitations of the rules and the feature matrix, such as exceptions or cases where the rules may not apply. This transparency will aid in interpreting the results and guiding further optimization.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side-chain carboxylic acid groups** predict a **high yield**. The combination of amino and multiple carboxylic acid groups enhances metal coordination.
   - *Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid), **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid).

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted amino groups** predict a **high yield**. The amino group on the aromatic ring provides additional coordination sites.
   - *Example*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**.
   - Conversely, modifiers with **para-substituted alkyl groups** predict a **low yield** due to lack of coordination enhancement.
     - *Example*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**.

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **pyridine carboxylic acids or contain a pyridine ring directly connected to a carboxylic acid** predict a **high yield**. The pyridine nitrogen acts as an additional coordination site.
   - *Examples*: **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**.
   - Modifiers where the pyridine ring is connected via an additional aromatic ring predict a **low yield** due to steric hindrance affecting coordination.
     - *Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (≤5 carbons) with terminal amino groups** predict a **high yield**. The terminal amino group enhances metal binding without significant steric hindrance.
   - *Example*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**.
   - Modifiers with **longer aliphatic chains (≥6 carbons) with terminal amino groups** predict a **low yield** due to increased steric bulk and reduced solubility.
     - *Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing **thiol (–SH) groups attached to aliphatic chains** predict a **high yield**. Thiol groups strongly coordinate with metal centers.
   - *Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
   - If the thiol group is **attached to an aromatic ring**, the yield is likely **low** due to possible steric hindrance and reduced flexibility.
     - *Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing **multiple hydroxyl groups (polyhydroxy carboxylic acids)** predict a **high yield**. The additional hydroxyl groups enhance metal binding through multiple coordination sites.
   - *Examples*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid), **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**.

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position** predict a **high yield**. Electron-withdrawing groups increase acidity, enhancing metal coordination.
   - *Examples*: **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (nitro group), **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (bromomethyl group).

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **aldehyde (–CHO) groups attached directly to aromatic rings** predict a **low yield**. Aldehyde groups can interfere with metal coordination or participate in side reactions.
   - *Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups connected via an aliphatic linker** predict a **high yield**. The linker provides flexibility, allowing better coordination.
   - *Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.
   - Modifiers with hydroxyl groups **directly attached to the aromatic ring** predict a **low yield** due to rigidity and steric hindrance.
     - *Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms capable of metal coordination** predict a **high yield**. The heteroatoms enhance coordination with the metal center.
    - *Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan).
    - Modifiers with **aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms** predict a **low yield** due to fewer coordination sites.
      - *Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine).

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers containing **perfluorinated aliphatic chains** predict a **low yield**. Electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms reduce electron density, hindering effective metal coordination.
    - *Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **flexible polyether chains** predict a **low yield**. The flexibility and solvation of polyether chains reduce effective metal coordination.
    - *Example*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers containing **lactone rings with carboxylic acid groups** predict a **high yield**. The rigid lactone structure aids in effective metal coordination.
    - *Example*: **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**.

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with long chains (>6 carbons) without additional polar functional groups** can predict a **high yield**, as the lack of interfering groups allows coordination via the carboxylate.
    - *Example*: **octanoic acid**.
    - Modifiers with **long aliphatic chains and terminal polar groups** (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) predict a **low yield** due to steric hindrance and reduced solubility.
      - *Examples*: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **amino acids or peptides with additional amide or acetamido groups in the side chain** predict a **low yield**. Amide groups may compete with carboxylate groups for metal binding, reducing coordination efficiency.
    - *Examples*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**, **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Adjust Rule 1 SMARTS Patterns**: The current patterns for Rule 1 are not correctly matching α-amino acids with side-chain carboxylic acid groups, such as aspartic acid and glutamic acid. Modify the patterns to accurately represent the side-chain carboxylic acid group attached to the β or γ carbon of the amino acid. For example, use patterns like `[NX3][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX2H1])[CX4][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` to capture the additional carboxylic acid in the side chain.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Fix 'count_threshold' Implementation**: The `count_threshold` keys may not match the SMARTS strings returned by `pat.GetSmarts()`, leading to incorrect application of thresholds. To resolve this, after compiling the patterns, store their SMARTS strings using `pat.GetSmarts()` and use these as keys in `count_threshold`. Alternatively, match patterns based on their index or maintain a mapping between original patterns and compiled patterns.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Refine Rule 10 and 10.1 Patterns**: The patterns for Rules 10 and 10.1 are improperly matching amino acids without aromatic side chains, such as aspartic acid. Update the patterns to specifically target amino acids with aromatic side chains. For Rule 10, use patterns like `[NX3][CX4H]([#6])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1].[c][n][c]` to match tryptophan. For Rule 10.1, ensure the pattern matches amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms, like phenylalanine.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Correct Rule 15 Patterns**: Aspartic acid is incorrectly matching Rule 15 due to overly broad patterns. Adjust the patterns to detect amino acids or peptides with amide or acetamido groups in the side chain. Use specific side-chain patterns like `[CX3](=O)[NX3][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` attached to the α-carbon to prevent false positives.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Verify All SMARTS Patterns**: Review each SMARTS pattern to ensure it precisely represents the natural language rule without overgeneralization. Overly broad patterns can lead to incorrect matches. Refining the patterns by including more specific atomic environments and connectivity will improve accuracy.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Implement Unit Tests with Examples**: Incorporate unit tests using the examples provided for each rule to verify that the patterns correctly match the intended structures. This will help identify mismatches between the rules and the code implementation.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Handle Stereochemistry and Tautomers**: Ensure that the SMARTS patterns account for stereochemistry where relevant and consider possible tautomeric forms of functional groups, as they might affect pattern matching.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Improve Pattern Grouping Logic**: In the code logic, ensure that for each rule, all required patterns must match simultaneously (logical AND), while within pattern groups, at least one pattern should match (logical OR). Clarify this in the code to prevent misinterpretation of rules.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Performance:**

Based on the provided metrics, we will compare the performance of the current rules against the previous reference metrics, focusing on **confidence** and **lift**, to assess progress and identify areas for improvement.

---

**1. Support:**

- **Previous Train Support Mean:** Approximately **0.17** to **0.18**.
- **Current Train Support:** **0.05195**.

**Comment:** The current support is significantly lower than the previous average. This indicates that the current rules cover a smaller portion of the dataset. While lower support can be acceptable if confidence and lift are improved, it may also suggest that the rules are too specific or not widely applicable.

---

**2. Confidence:**

- **Previous Train Confidence Mean:** Approximately **0.54** to **0.64**.
- **Current Train Confidence:** **0.5748**.

**Comment:** The current confidence is within the range of previous values but slightly lower than the previous maximum. This suggests that the accuracy of the current rules in predicting high yield is comparable to earlier iterations but has not improved.

---

**3. Lift:**

- **Previous Train Lift Mean:** Approximately **1.06** to **1.20**.
- **Current Train Lift:** **1.1456**.

**Comment:** The current lift is within the range of previous values but does not exceed the previous maximum. Since lift measures how much better the rule is at predicting the outcome compared to random chance, the current rules are moderately better than chance but show no significant improvement over previous rules.

---

**4. Leverage:**

- **Previous Train Leverage Mean:** Approximately **-0.0041** to **0.0289**.
- **Current Train Leverage:** **0.00197**.

**Comment:** The current leverage is positive but lower than the previous maximum. This indicates a slight positive association between the conditions and the prediction but suggests that the rules offer limited additional predictive power beyond chance.

---

**Interpreting the Metrics:**

- **Support Reduction:** The decrease in support from approximately **0.17-0.18** to **0.05195** suggests that the new rules apply to fewer cases in the dataset. This could be due to the rules being too narrow or specific.
  
- **Confidence Stability:** Confidence remains within the previous range, indicating that when the rules do apply, they predict the outcome with similar accuracy.

- **Lift Consistency:** Lift values are consistent with previous metrics but have not improved. This means that the predictive strength relative to random chance has not increased.

- **Leverage Minimal Change:** The low leverage indicates that the association strength has not significantly improved, and the rules may not be capturing stronger relationships in the data.

---

**Evaluation of Iterations During the Current Program:**

Reviewing the metrics from the current iteration:

- **Train Supports** range from **0.0038** to **0.0556**, generally lower than previous averages.
- **Train Confidences** range from **0.5333** to **0.6756**, comparable to previous confidence levels.
- **Train Lifts** range from **1.0611** to **1.3558**, with some higher than previous lifts, such as **1.3558**.
- **Train Leverages** are generally low but positive, indicating modest associations.

Some individual rules during this iteration showed higher lifts (e.g., **1.3558**) but had very low supports (e.g., **0.0305**), indicating that they apply to very few cases.

---

**Identifying Potential Issues:**

1. **Low Support Rules:** Many current rules have low support, making them less practical for broader application.

2. **Overfitting:** The specificity of rules may lead to overfitting, where rules perform well on training data but poorly on unseen data.

3. **Inconsistent Lift Improvements:** While some rules exhibit higher lifts, this is not consistent across all rules, and the overall lift has not significantly improved.

---

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

1. **Increase Support by Generalizing Rules:**

   - **Review Rule Specificity:** Examine the conditions of each rule to identify if they are too specific. For instance, if a rule specifies a particular functional group attached to a specific position on a ring, consider generalizing it to include similar positions or functional groups.
   
   - **Combine Similar Rules:** Merge rules that predict the same outcome and have overlapping conditions to increase their support.
   
   - **Example:** Rules 2 and 7 both involve aromatic carboxylic acids with substituents influencing electron density. Combining these may increase support.

2. **Focus on High Lift and Confidence Rules:**

   - **Prioritize Rules with Lift > 1.3:** Rules with higher lifts indicate stronger predictive power. Identify which rules have higher lifts and analyze if their conditions can be slightly broadened without significantly reducing confidence.
   
   - **Enhance Confidence:** Strive to improve confidence levels above the previous maximum (e.g., over **0.64**) by refining rule conditions.

3. **Eliminate or Revise Low-Performing Rules:**

   - **Rules with Low Lift and Confidence:** Re-evaluate rules that have lifts close to **1** or confidence significantly below the average, as they may not contribute meaningful predictive value.
   
   - **Address Negative Leverage:** Though current leverage values are positive, any rules with negative leverage in iterations should be revised or removed.

4. **Balance Rule Complexity:**

   - **Avoid Overly Complex Rules:** Complex rules may have low support and may not generalize well. Simplify conditions where possible to create broader rules without sacrificing much confidence or lift.
   
   - **Example:** If a rule specifies multiple functional groups and steric conditions, assess if all are necessary.

5. **Incorporate Additional Data:**

   - **Explore Other Descriptors:** Consider adding molecular descriptors or features that capture electronic, steric, or solubility properties, which may enhance the predictive power of the rules.
   
   - **Use Domain Knowledge:** Leverage chemical knowledge to identify features likely to influence catalytic performance.

6. **Iterative Refinement:**

   - **Cross-Validation:** Use cross-validation techniques to test the rules on different subsets of data, ensuring they perform well across the dataset.
   
   - **Monitor Overfitting:** Be cautious of rules performing exceptionally well on training data but not on test data.

7. **Feedback from Misclassifications:**

   - **Analyze Incorrect Predictions:** Review cases where the rules fail to predict the correct yield to understand limitations or missing factors that could be incorporated.

8. **Assess Rule Interactions:**

   - **Identify Conflicting Rules:** Ensure that rules do not contradict each other, which may confuse the model and reduce overall performance.
   
   - **Hierarchy of Rules:** Establish a priority or hierarchy if certain rules are more reliable than others.

---

**Conclusion:**

The current rules maintain confidence levels comparable to previous iterations but show reduced support and no significant improvement in lift. This suggests that while the accuracy of predictions remains stable when the rules apply, their applicability has decreased, and their overall predictive power relative to chance has not significantly improved.

**To enhance the performance of the current rules:**

- **Broaden Rule Applicability:** Adjust rule conditions to cover a larger portion of the dataset without compromising confidence excessively.
- **Improve Predictive Strength:** Focus on increasing lift by identifying and emphasizing features with strong associations to high yield.
- **Regularly Validate Rules:** Continually test rules against new data to ensure they generalize well and adjust as necessary.

By implementing these recommendations, we can work towards developing a set of rules that are both broadly applicable and have strong predictive capabilities, ultimately improving the performance of the catalytic prediction model.

Traditional Commenter Message:
**Performance Analysis of Current Rules**

**Accuracy Metrics:**

- **Current Iteration Accuracy:** The model achieved an accuracy of **54.29%** (0.5429) on the 5-fold validation set in the latest iteration.
  
- **Previous Iterations Accuracies:** 
  - Validation Accuracies were consistently around **76%** (0.76).
  - Test Accuracies ranged from **62.5%** (0.625) to **75%** (0.75).

**Comparison:**

- **Decrease in Accuracy:** The current accuracy of 54.29% represents a significant decrease from previous validation accuracies of 76%. This indicates that the modifications made to the rules or model in the latest iteration have adversely affected performance.

**Effectiveness of Current Rules:**

- **Reduced Effectiveness:** The decline in accuracy suggests that the current set of rules may not be effectively capturing the underlying patterns necessary for accurate predictions.
  
- **Potential Issues:** The model may be misclassifying a significant number of molecules, possibly due to overfitting specific patterns or underfitting important features.

---

**Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting**

- **Underfitting Indicators:**
  - The substantial drop in validation accuracy suggests that the model is **underfitting**. It may be too simplistic or lacking essential features to capture the complexity of the data.
  - Consistently low SHAP values across multiple rules for certain molecules indicate that the model isn't sensitive enough to their specific characteristics.

- **Overfitting Indicators:**
  - If certain rules are too specific, they may capture noise in the training data, leading to poor generalization on validation data.
  - High variance in SHAP values for the same rule across different molecules suggests that the rule may be overfitting to specific cases.

---

**SHAP Analysis Insights**

The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values provide insight into how each rule contributes to the prediction for each molecule. By analyzing these values, we can identify which rules are contributing to incorrect predictions.

**Underestimated Loadings (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**

- **Molecules Affected:**
  - *Examples:* C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N, C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O, C1=CNC(=O)C=C1C(=O)O, among others.

- **Key Rules with High Negative SHAP Values:**
  - **Rule11**: Consistently negative SHAP values for these molecules, indicating it contributes to predicting low loading.
    - *Example:* For molecule C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N, Rule11 SHAP value is -0.0218.

  - **Rule15**: Also shows negative SHAP values, reinforcing low loading predictions.
    - *Example:* For the same molecule, Rule15 SHAP value is -0.0259.

- **Implications:**
  - **Rule11** and **Rule15** may be too restrictive or not capturing the intended chemical features, leading to underestimation.

**Overestimated Loadings (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**

- **Molecules Affected:**
  - *Examples:* C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N, C(CCCC(=O)O)CCCN, among others.

- **Key Rules with High Positive SHAP Values:**
  - **Rule14**: Positive SHAP values contributing to high loading predictions.
    - *Example:* For molecule C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N, Rule14 SHAP value is 0.0374.

  - **Rule15**: Also contributes positively in some cases.
    - *Example:* For the same molecule, Rule15 SHAP value is 0.0816.

- **Implications:**
  - **Rule14** and **Rule15** may be overemphasizing certain features, leading to overestimation.

---

**Analysis of Specific Rules**

**Rule11:** Modifiers containing **perfluorinated aliphatic chains** predict a **low yield**.

- **Findings:**
  - Negative SHAP values even for molecules without perfluorinated chains suggest Rule11 may be incorrectly penalizing certain modifiers.
  - This could be due to overlapping features or misclassification within the rule's logic.

**Rule14:** Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with long chains (>6 carbons) without additional polar functional groups** predict a **high yield**.

- **Findings:**
  - Positive SHAP values in molecules where high loading is overestimated indicate Rule14 may be too broadly defined.
  - The rule may not account for subtle differences in molecular structure that affect yield.

**Rule15:** Modifiers that are **amino acids or peptides with additional amide or acetamido groups in the side chain** predict a **low yield**.

- **Findings:**
  - Both positive and negative SHAP values suggest inconsistency.
  - The rule may need refinement to better distinguish between molecules that truly meet its criteria.

---

**Recommendations for Improvement**

1. **Refine Rules with High Positive SHAP Values for Overestimated Loadings**

   - **Adjust Rule14:**
     - **Issue:** Overestimates loading due to broad categorization of long-chain aliphatic acids.
     - **Action:** Add specificity by incorporating additional criteria, such as excluding molecules with certain functional groups that reduce yield.
     - **Example Revision:** Modify Rule14 to exclude long-chain acids with terminal amino or hydroxyl groups, aligning with observations of steric hindrance.

   - **Adjust Rule15:**
     - **Issue:** Inconsistent impact on predictions, sometimes contributing to overestimation.
     - **Action:** Re-evaluate the definition to ensure it correctly identifies modifiers with side-chain amide groups that reduce yield.
     - **Example Revision:** Clarify the position and context of amide groups to prevent misclassification.

2. **Adjust Rules with High Negative SHAP Values for Underestimated Loadings**

   - **Refine Rule11:**
     - **Issue:** May be too broadly penalizing, leading to underestimation for modifiers without perfluorinated chains.
     - **Action:** Add conditions to the rule to ensure it only applies to modifiers with significant perfluorination.
     - **Example Revision:** Specify the minimum number of fluorine atoms or chain length required to trigger the rule.

   - **Refine Rule13:**
     - **Issue:** Negative SHAP values in cases where high loading is underestimated.
     - **Action:** Ensure the rule accurately captures the effect of lactone rings on metal coordination.
     - **Example Revision:** Include considerations for the size and substitution of lactone rings.

3. **Improve Generalization to Address Underfitting**

   - **Review Overall Rule Set:**
     - **Action:** Assess all rules for overlap and gaps, ensuring that collectively they cover the diversity of the dataset without overcomplicating the model.
     - **Balance Complexity:** Avoid overly specific rules that only apply to a few molecules, which can lead to underfitting.

   - **Incorporate Additional Features:**
     - **Action:** Integrate new descriptors or rules that capture overlooked chemical properties influencing yield, such as hydrogen bonding capacity or molecular flexibility.

4. **Iteratively Refine Rules Using SHAP Insights**

   - **Focus on Consistently Misclassified Molecules:**
     - **Action:** Identify molecules that are repeatedly misclassified across iterations and analyze which rules contribute most to their incorrect predictions.
  
   - **Test Rule Modifications:**
     - **Action:** After adjusting rules, retrain the model and evaluate changes in SHAP values and accuracy to confirm improvements.

5. **Consider Rule Interactions and Combined Effects**

   - **Analyze Rule Synergy:**
     - **Action:** Examine how combinations of rules affect predictions, as certain rules may counteract or amplify each other's effects.
     - **Optimize Rule Hierarchy:** Establish a hierarchy or weighting system for rules based on their reliability and impact.

6. **Validate with Chemical Intuition**

   - **Consult Domain Knowledge:**
     - **Action:** Cross-reference rule adjustments with established chemical principles to ensure they make scientific sense.
     - **Avoid Overfitting to the Data:** Ensure changes are justifiable beyond the dataset to maintain generalization.

---

**Conclusion**

The decline in model performance indicates a need to refine the current rules. By focusing on rules that contribute most to misclassifications, such as Rules 11, 14, and 15, and adjusting them based on SHAP analysis and chemical reasoning, we can enhance the model's predictive accuracy. Iterative testing and validation will be essential to ensure that rule refinements lead to genuine improvements without introducing overfitting or underfitting.

*Next Steps:*

- **Implement Rule Adjustments:** Apply the recommended modifications to the identified rules.
- **Retrain the Model:** Utilize the updated rules to generate a new feature matrix and retrain the model.
- **Evaluate Performance:** Assess the model's accuracy and analyze SHAP values to determine the effectiveness of the changes.
- **Repeat as Necessary:** Continue the iterative process of refinement until the model's performance stabilizes and aligns with desired accuracy levels.

---

**Note:** Consistent monitoring of both accuracy metrics and SHAP values throughout this process will provide critical feedback, guiding further adjustments to the rules and ensuring the model remains robust and generalizable.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimization**

The current set of rules for predicting the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction has been evaluated through various performance metrics, including support, confidence, lift, leverage, accuracy, and SHAP analysis. The key findings and suggestions for improvement are summarized below:

**1. Low Support and Specificity of Rules**

- **Observation**: Many of the current rules have low support, meaning they apply to a small fraction of the dataset. This reduces the practical applicability of the rules.
- **Direction for Optimization**: Generalize the rules to cover a broader range of molecules without significantly compromising confidence and lift. This can be achieved by:
  - Broadening the functional groups or structural motifs included in the rules.
  - Combining similar rules that predict the same outcome to increase support.

**2. Issues with SMARTS Pattern Matching**

- **Observation**: Incorrect or overly broad SMARTS patterns are causing misclassification of molecules. For example, aspartic acid is incorrectly matched by patterns intended for other amino acids.
- **Suggestions**:
  - **Adjust Rule 1 Patterns**: Modify the SMARTS patterns to accurately represent α-amino acids with side-chain carboxylic acid groups. Ensure that patterns specifically capture side-chain carboxylic acids attached to the β or γ carbon.
  - **Refine Rule 10 and 10.1 Patterns**: Update the patterns to correctly identify amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms for Rule 10 and those lacking heteroatoms for Rule 10.1.
  - **Correct Rule 15 Patterns**: Narrow down the patterns to detect only amino acids or peptides with amide or acetamido groups in the side chain, avoiding false positives like aspartic acid.

**3. Overfitting and Underfitting Concerns**

- **Observation**: The significant drop in validation accuracy from previous iterations suggests underfitting, while specific rules might be overfitting to certain molecules.
- **Direction for Optimization**:
  - **Simplify Overly Complex Rules**: Remove unnecessary specificity that doesn't contribute to predictive power.
  - **Ensure Adequate Generalization**: Balance rule complexity to avoid underfitting. Rules should capture essential features influencing the reaction yield.

**4. Inconsistent SHAP Values and Misclassifications**

- **Observation**: Certain rules contribute significantly to incorrect predictions, as indicated by SHAP analysis.
- **Suggestions**:
  - **Analyze and Adjust Problematic Rules**:
    - **Rule 11**: Refine to ensure it only penalizes modifiers with significant perfluorination, avoiding negative impact on unrelated molecules.
    - **Rule 14**: Add specificity to prevent overestimating yield for molecules that do not align with the intended criteria.
    - **Rule 15**: Clarify the conditions to accurately identify modifiers with side-chain amide groups that reduce yield.

**5. Verification and Testing**

- **Suggestion**:
  - **Implement Unit Tests with Examples**: Use the provided examples for each rule to verify that the SMARTS patterns correctly match intended structures.
  - **Conduct Cross-Validation**: Ensure that rules perform consistently across different subsets of data, reducing the likelihood of overfitting.

**6. Consideration of Stereochemistry and Tautomerism**

- **Observation**: Stereochemistry and tautomeric forms may affect pattern matching and, consequently, rule performance.
- **Direction for Optimization**:
  - **Handle Stereochemistry in Patterns**: Incorporate stereochemical considerations into SMARTS patterns where relevant.
  - **Account for Tautomeric Forms**: Ensure that tautomerism does not lead to incorrect pattern matching.

**7. Improve Pattern Grouping Logic**

- **Suggestion**: Clarify the logical relationships within the code, ensuring that for each rule, all required patterns must match simultaneously (logical AND), while multiple patterns within a group are considered alternatives (logical OR).

**8. Integration of Additional Features**

- **Direction for Optimization**:
  - **Incorporate Molecular Descriptors**: Include features that capture electronic effects, steric hindrance, and solubility, which might influence the reaction yield.
  - **Leverage Chemical Knowledge**: Use domain expertise to identify and include relevant chemical properties in the rules.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

Based on the analysis, there is significant potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting:

- **Refinement of SMARTS Patterns**: Improving the accuracy of pattern matching will enhance rule performance and reduce misclassifications.
- **Broadening Rule Applicability**: Generalizing certain rules can increase their support and make the model more robust.
- **Elimination of Redundant or Conflicting Rules**: Streamlining the rule set to remove overlaps and contradictions will improve clarity and predictive power.
- **Regular Validation and Iterative Refinement**: Continuous testing and adjustment based on performance metrics and SHAP analysis will help optimize the rules effectively.

** Start of Advice **

- ** Advice 1 **: **Revise Rule 1 SMARTS Patterns** to accurately represent α-amino acids with side-chain carboxylic acid groups. Ensure the SMARTS patterns specifically match amino acids where the side-chain carboxylic acid is attached to the β or γ carbon, avoiding misclassification of other amino acids. For example, adjust the pattern to require a carboxylic acid group two or three carbons away from the amino group.

- ** Advice 2 **: **Refine Rule 10 and Rule 10.1 SMARTS Patterns** to correctly identify amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms (Rule 10) and those lacking heteroatoms (Rule 10.1). Update the patterns to:
  - For Rule 10: Match aromatic side chains with heteroatoms such as indole or imidazole rings (e.g., tryptophan, histidine).
  - For Rule 10.1: Match aromatic side chains without heteroatoms (e.g., phenylalanine), ensuring they do not overlap with Rule 10.

- ** Advice 3 **: **Modify Rule 15 SMARTS Patterns** to specifically detect modifiers with amide or acetamido groups in the side chain. Adjust the patterns to exclude amino acids like aspartic acid, which lack side-chain amide groups, by requiring the amide functionality to be part of the side chain beyond the central amino acid structure.

- ** Advice 4 **: **Generalize Rules with Low Support** to increase their applicability. Combine similar rules or broaden functional group definitions to cover more compounds without compromising predictive accuracy. For example, merge Rules 2 and 7 by generalizing to "aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituents enhancing metal coordination."

- ** Advice 5 **: **Simplify Overly Specific Rules** to prevent overfitting. Remove unnecessary constraints that do not significantly impact yield prediction. Focus on essential functional groups or structural elements that influence metal coordination and reactivity.

- ** Advice 6 **: **Enhance Specificity of Rule 11** by refining the SMARTS pattern to target only modifiers with extensive perfluorination. Require multiple adjacent carbon atoms to be fully fluorinated to avoid penalizing compounds with fewer or isolated fluorine atoms.

- ** Advice 7 **: **Add Specificity to Rule 14** by clarifying that high yield is predicted for long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (>6 carbons) without any additional polar functional groups. Modify the rule to explicitly exclude modifiers with terminal polar groups like hydroxyl or amino groups, which may decrease yield due to steric hindrance or solubility issues.

- ** Advice 8 **: **Adjust Rule 15** to accurately identify modifiers with side-chain amide or acetamido groups that reduce yield. Ensure the SMARTS patterns specifically match side-chain amide functionalities and do not misclassify other functional groups. This can be achieved by specifying the amide linkage within the side chain in the pattern.

- ** Advice 9 **: **Incorporate Stereochemistry and Tautomerism in SMARTS Patterns** where relevant. Use stereochemical descriptors in SMARTS to match specific enantiomers if stereochemistry affects the reaction outcome. Account for tautomeric forms by including alternative representations in the patterns.

- ** Advice 10 **: **Clarify Logical Operators in Pattern Grouping**. Within each rule, use logical AND to require all necessary patterns to match simultaneously. Use logical OR for multiple patterns that represent alternative features leading to the same prediction. This ensures accurate pattern matching and rule application.

- ** Advice 11 **: **Implement Unit Tests with Provided Examples** for each rule. Verify that the SMARTS patterns correctly match the intended compounds and do not match unintended ones. Adjust patterns based on test results to improve precision and avoid misclassifications.

- ** Advice 12 **: **Conduct Cross-Validation and Iterative Refinement** of the rules. Evaluate rule performance on different subsets of the data to ensure consistency and avoid overfitting. Use performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and SHAP values to guide refinements.

- ** Advice 13 **: **Incorporate Additional Molecular Descriptors** into the rules to capture electronic effects, steric hindrance, and solubility factors. This may include parameters like Hammett sigma values for substituents, calculated steric parameters, or polar surface area to better predict yield outcomes.

- ** Advice 14 **: **Utilize Chemical Expertise to Identify New Patterns**. Engage with chemists to identify additional functional groups or structural motifs that influence metal coordination and reactivity. Incorporate these insights into new or existing rules to enhance predictive capability.

- ** Advice 15 **: **Review and Remove Redundant or Conflicting Rules**. Analyze the current rule set to identify overlaps or contradictions. Streamline the rules by merging similar ones and eliminating those that do not significantly contribute to predictive performance.

- ** Advice 16 **: **Use SHAP Analysis to Identify Problematic Rules**. Regularly perform SHAP value analysis to pinpoint rules that contribute to incorrect predictions. Focus on adjusting these rules to improve overall model accuracy and reliability.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Quantify Functional Groups and Structural Features**  
  Modify the rules to be based on quantifiable functional groups and structural features that can be directly derived from SMILES strings. For example, instead of stating "Modifiers that are α-amino acids with side-chain carboxylic acid groups predict a high yield," specify "Modifiers containing an α-amino acid backbone and at least one side-chain carboxylic acid group (count ≥1) predict a high yield." This allows for the creation of numerical features such as counts of amino groups, carboxylic acid groups, ring systems, etc.

- **Advice 2**: **Define Clear Molecular Descriptors for Each Rule**  
  For each rule, identify specific molecular descriptors that correlate with the observed yields. Use descriptors like the number of hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, molecular weight, topological polar surface area, chain length, presence of specific atoms (e.g., nitrogen, sulfur), and counts of specific substructures (e.g., aromatic rings, pyridine rings). Ensure these descriptors can be calculated directly from the SMILES using cheminformatics tools like RDKit.

- **Advice 3**: **Standardize Terminology and Criteria Across Rules**  
  Use consistent and standardized terminology for functional groups and structural motifs. Replace subjective terms like "short chains" or "long chains" with specific numeric criteria (e.g., chain length ≤5 carbons or chain length ≥6 carbons). This precision facilitates the conversion of rules into numeric features.

- **Advice 4**: **Consolidate Overlapping Rules**  
  Identify and merge overlapping or similar rules to reduce redundancy and complexity. For example, Rules 2 and 7 both discuss aromatic carboxylic acids with functional groups at the para position. Combine them into a single rule with specified criteria for electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups and their impact on yield.

- **Advice 5**: **Introduce Binary Indicators for Key Functionalities**  
  Create binary (True/False) features for the presence or absence of key functional groups identified in the rules. For instance, include indicators for "contains amino group," "contains carboxylic acid group," "contains thiol group," "contains pyridine ring," etc. This simplification aids in constructing a numerical feature matrix.

- **Advice 6**: **Incorporate Molecular Flexibility and Steric Hindrance Metrics**  
  Include descriptors that measure molecular flexibility (e.g., number of rotatable bonds) and steric hindrance (e.g., minimal projection area). This can help quantify rules related to steric effects, such as those in Rule 3 regarding steric hindrance from additional aromatic rings.

- **Advice 7**: **Utilize Substructure Matching with SMARTS Patterns**  
  Define SMARTS patterns for specific substructures mentioned in the rules (e.g., α-amino acids, pyridine carboxylic acids). Use substructure searches to identify these patterns in the modifiers. This approach allows for automated and precise identification of relevant functional groups from SMILES.

- **Advice 8**: **Apply Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) Modeling**  
  Shift towards QSAR modeling by generating a comprehensive set of molecular descriptors and using statistical or machine learning methods to correlate these descriptors with the yield. This data-driven approach can uncover patterns not immediately evident from qualitative rules.

- **Advice 9**: **Re-Evaluate Rules with Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**  
  Perform PCA on the calculated descriptors to identify the most significant features influencing the yield. Adjust the rules to emphasize these key features, ensuring they are quantifiable and directly linked to the numerical data.

- **Advice 10**: **Implement Decision Tree Analysis to Refine Rules**  
  Use decision tree algorithms to analyze the dataset and extract rules based on the most informative descriptors. This method translates the complex relationships in the data into a set of if-then rules that are inherently numeric and computationally friendly.

- **Advice 11**: **Address Solubility and Electronic Effects Numerically**  
  Incorporate descriptors that quantify solubility (e.g., LogP) and electronic effects (e.g., Hammett sigma constants) to numerically represent rules related to solubility issues and electron-withdrawing/donating groups.

- **Advice 12**: **Standardize Chain Length Definitions**  
  Define explicit numerical thresholds for chain lengths affecting yield, as in Rule 4 and Rule 14. Use the exact number of carbons to differentiate between high and low yield predictions, enabling precise numerical classification.

- **Advice 13**: **Expand Descriptors to Include Atom Types and Hybridization**  
  Include descriptors accounting for atom types (e.g., sp2 vs. sp3 carbons), which can influence steric and electronic properties. This can help quantify rules involving aromatic vs. aliphatic chains or rings.

- **Advice 14**: **Create a Comprehensive Descriptor Table for Modifiers**  
  Compile all relevant descriptors into a comprehensive table for each modifier, ensuring all features from the rules are represented numerically. This table will serve as the feature matrix for modeling and analysis.

- **Advice 15**: **Validate and Refine Rules Using Cross-Validation Techniques**  
  Test the predictive power of the rules by applying them to a validation set. Use statistical metrics to assess performance and refine the rules accordingly, focusing on numerical thresholds and descriptor significance.

The rule focuses on specific structural features, and coverage is adequate with two supporting data points.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 clearly distinguishes between amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms and those without. It provides good physico-chemical insight into the role of heteroatoms in metal coordination. The rule considers complex sub-structures, adding to its complexity. Coverage is limited to one data point for each prediction, which may reduce its robustness.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is clear in identifying perfluorinated aliphatic chains as low yield modifiers and provides adequate physico-chemical reasoning. The rule focuses on specific electron-withdrawing effects, contributing to its complexity. Coverage is limited to a single data point, which may not fully support the rule.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 effectively differentiates between long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with and without additional polar groups, offering clarity. It provides solid physico-chemical insight into how steric hindrance and solubility issues impact yield. The rule's complexity is appropriate, and coverage is acceptable with multiple supporting data points.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 clearly specifies the structural differences that affect yield in aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups. It provides adequate physico-chemical insight into the importance of flexibility for metal coordination. The rule considers complex structures, adding to its complexity. Coverage is limited, with one data point for each prediction.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear and provides sufficient physico-chemical insight into how lactone rings aid metal coordination. The complexity of the rule is appropriate, focusing on specific ring structures. Coverage is limited to one data point, which may not be sufficient for strong support.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 offers clarity by identifying specific amino acids and peptides as low yield due to additional amide groups. It provides adequate physico-chemical insight into competitive metal binding. The rule considers complex sub-structures, adding to its complexity. Coverage meets the minimum with two supporting data points.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 clearly identifies modifiers with carbonyl groups within the aliphatic chain as predicting low yield and offers sufficient physico-chemical reasoning. The complexity is moderate, focusing on specific functional groups. Coverage is adequate with two supporting data points.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Combine similar rules to reduce redundancy and enhance clarity.** Specifically, merge **Rule 2** and **Rule 7** since both address the influence of para-substituted groups on aromatic carboxylic acids and their impact on yield. A unified rule can encompass both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups, detailing how different substituents at the para position affect metal coordination and reaction yield.

- **Advice 2**: **Enhance the coverage of rules with limited supporting data points.** For rules like **Rule 11** (perfluorinated aliphatic chains), **Rule 13** (lactone rings with carboxylic acid groups), and **Rule 15** (modifiers with carbonyl groups within the aliphatic chain), seek additional examples or experimental data to strengthen their validity. If more data isn't available, consider integrating these rules into broader, more general rules to improve their applicability.

- **Advice 3**: **Re-evaluate and possibly combine rules with overlapping concepts to improve robustness.** For instance, **Rule 5** (thiol group attachment) and **Rule 9** (amino acids with aromatic heteroatoms) both deal with heteroatom coordination and steric effects. Combining them or redefining the scope can enhance the overall coherence and applicability of the rules.

- **Advice 4**: **Improve clarity in rules with broad terms by specifying structural features.** In **Rule 6** (modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups), specify which positions and configurations of hydroxyl groups are most effective for enhancing metal coordination. This will make the rule more precise and easier to apply.

- **Advice 5**: **Address inconsistencies and ensure consistency across all rules.** For example, **Rule 14** suggests that long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without polar groups predict a high yield, which contradicts earlier rules about steric hindrance from long aliphatic chains. Clarify under what conditions chain length and the presence or absence of polar groups affect yield to maintain consistency.

- **Advice 6**: **Expand rules with limited data by considering related structures.** For **Rule 13** (lactone rings with carboxylic acid groups predicting high yield), consider including other cyclic structures or rigid ring systems that may also enhance metal coordination. This broadens the rule's applicability and increases coverage.

- **Advice 7**: **Incorporate additional physico-chemical reasoning into the rules.** Provide more detailed explanations for why certain structural features affect yield. For instance, explain how electron-withdrawing groups increase acidity and enhance metal coordination, or how flexibility and solvation impact coordination effectiveness in polyether chains.

- **Advice 8**: **Ensure each rule includes multiple supporting data points for validation.** Rules should be based on at least two or more examples to confirm their reliability. Gather additional experimental results or literature data to support rules like **Rule 5**, **Rule 11**, and **Rule 13**.

- **Advice 9**: **Simplify complex rules by focusing on key structural elements that influence yield.** This makes the rules easier to understand and apply. Avoid overly complex combinations of substructures unless they significantly impact the outcome.

- **Advice 10**: **Integrate rules that focus on electron-withdrawing effects into a generalized rule.** Rules regarding perfluorinated chains (**Rule 11**) and para-substituted nitro groups could be combined into a rule about how electron-withdrawing groups affect metal coordination and yield.

- **Advice 11**: **Provide clear distinctions between exceptions and general trends.** If certain modifiers, like octanoic acid in **Rule 14**, are exceptions to general trends, explain the reasons and conditions under which these exceptions occur.

- **Advice 12**: **Update rules based on new experimental data or insights.** Continually refine the rules as more information becomes available to ensure they remain accurate and relevant.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side-chain carboxylic acid groups** predict a **high yield**. The presence of both amino and additional carboxyl groups enhances metal coordination with the catalyst.

   - *Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid), **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid).

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted groups capable of metal coordination** predict a **high yield**. Functional groups such as amino, nitro, or bromomethyl at the para position provide additional coordination sites.

   - *Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.
   - Modifiers with para groups that do not enhance coordination (e.g., methyl) predict a **low yield** due to lack of additional coordination sites.
     - *Example*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**.
   - Modifiers with para-aldehyde groups predict a **low yield** as aldehyde groups can interfere with metal coordination or engage in side reactions.
     - *Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **pyridine carboxylic acids or contain a pyridine ring directly connected to a carboxylic acid** predict a **high yield**. The nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring acts as an additional coordination site.

   - *Examples*: **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**.
   - Modifiers where the pyridine ring is connected via an additional aromatic ring predict a **low yield** due to steric hindrance affecting coordination.
     - *Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal amino groups** predict a yield dependent on chain length:
   - **High yield** for short chains (≤5 carbons). The terminal amino group enhances metal binding without significant steric hindrance.
     - *Example*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**.
   - **Low yield** for longer chains (≥6 carbons) due to increased steric bulk and reduced solubility.
     - *Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing **thiol (–SH) groups** predict yield based on attachment:
   - **High yield** when the thiol group is attached to an **aliphatic chain**, providing flexibility for effective metal coordination.
     - *Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
   - **Low yield** when the thiol group is **attached to an aromatic ring**, potentially causing steric hindrance and reduced flexibility.
     - *Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing **multiple hydroxyl groups (polyhydroxy carboxylic acids)** predict a **high yield**. Additional hydroxyl groups offer multiple coordination sites, enhancing metal binding.

   - *Examples*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid), **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**.
   - Modifiers with hydroxyl groups **directly attached to aromatic rings** predict a **low yield** due to rigidity and potential steric hindrance.
     - *Examples*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing **aldehyde (–CHO) groups attached directly to aromatic rings** predict a **low yield**. Aldehyde groups can interfere with metal coordination or undergo side reactions that reduce yield.

   - *Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers with **flexible polyether chains** predict a **low yield**. The high flexibility and solvation of polyether chains reduce effective metal coordination.

   - *Examples*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**.

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms capable of metal coordination** predict a **high yield**. Heteroatoms like nitrogen in the side chain enhance coordination with the metal center.

   - *Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan).
   - Modifiers with aromatic side chains **lacking heteroatoms** predict a **low yield** due to fewer coordination sites.
     - *Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine).

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing **perfluorinated aliphatic chains** predict a **low yield**. Electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms reduce electron density, hindering effective metal coordination.

    - *Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with long chains (>6 carbons) without additional polar functional groups** predict a **high yield**. The lack of interfering groups allows coordination via the carboxylate without steric hindrance.

    - *Example*: **octanoic acid**.
    - Modifiers with **long aliphatic chains and terminal polar groups** (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) predict a **low yield** due to increased steric bulk and potential solubility issues.
      - *Examples*: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups connected via an aliphatic linker** predict a **high yield**. The linker provides flexibility, allowing better coordination with the metal center.

    - *Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.
    - Modifiers with hydroxyl groups **directly attached to the aromatic ring** predict a **low yield** due to rigidity and possible steric hindrance.
      - *Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers containing **lactone rings with carboxylic acid groups** predict a **high yield**. The rigid lactone structure aids in effective metal coordination by positioning coordinating groups appropriately.

    - *Example*: **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**.

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **amino acids or peptides with additional amide or acetamido groups in the side chain** predict a **low yield**. Amide groups can compete with carboxylate groups for metal binding, reducing coordination efficiency.

    - *Examples*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**, **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**.

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers with **carbonyl groups (ketone, amide, ester) within the aliphatic chain** predict a **low yield**. These groups can interfere with metal coordination or alter the electronic properties of the molecule.

    - *Examples*: **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**, **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Rule 1**: The current SMARTS patterns for `alpha_amino_acid` (`'[NX3;H2][CX4H]([#6])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'`) and `carboxylic_acid` (`'[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'`) do not ensure that there is an additional carboxylic acid in the side chain. This could incorrectly match any α-amino acid, even those without side-chain carboxylic acid groups. To improve specificity, modify the pattern to detect amino acids with **two or more carboxylic acid groups**. One approach is to check for an α-amino acid with at least **two** carboxylic acid groups:

  ```python
  # Modified pattern for amino acids with side-chain carboxylic acid
  'alpha_amino_acid_with_side_chain_carboxylic_acid': '[NX3;H2][CX4H]([#6])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1].[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
  ```
  Alternatively, use a single SMARTS pattern that ensures there's an additional carboxylic acid connected to the side chain:

  ```python
  'alpha_amino_acid_with_side_chain_carboxylic_acid': '[NX3;H2][C@@H]([C](=O)[O])[C][C](=O)[O]'
  ```

- **Suggestion 2**: **Rule 2**: The SMARTS patterns for `para_amino_group`, `para_nitro_group`, and `para_bromomethyl_group` may not accurately capture **para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids** with groups capable of metal coordination. Modify the patterns to ensure they match aromatic rings with substituents at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid group. For example:

  ```python
  # Generic pattern for para-substituted benzoic acid with coordinating groups
  'para_substituted_aromatic_with_coordinating_group': 'c1cc(ccc1C(=O)O)[NX3;!H0,#7,#8,#15,#16]'
  'para_substituted_aromatic_with_coordinating_group': 'c1cc(ccc1C(=O)O)[N+](=O)[O-]'
  'para_substituted_aromatic_with_coordinating_group': 'c1cc(ccc1C(=O)O)CBr'
  ```

- **Suggestion 3**: **Rule 2.1 and 2.2**: Ensure that the patterns for `para_methyl_group` and `para_aldehyde_group` specifically match these substituents at the para position. For example:

  ```python
  'para_methyl_group': 'c1ccc(cc1C(=O)O)C'  # Methyl group at para position
  'para_aldehyde_group': 'c1ccc(cc1C(=O)O)C=O'  # Aldehyde group at para position
  ```

- **Suggestion 4**: **Rule 3**: The pattern `'pyridine_carboxylic_acid': 'n1cccc1C(=O)O'` may not capture all pyridine carboxylic acids. Use a more general pattern to match pyridine rings substituted with carboxylic acid groups:

  ```python
  'pyridine_carboxylic_acid': 'n1cccc1C(=O)[OX2H1]'
  ```

- **Suggestion 5**: **Rule 4**: The current implementation checks for chain lengths but may not accurately count carbon atoms in the chain. Modify the code to extract the aliphatic chain between the carboxylic acid and the terminal amino group and count its length. Use a recursive SMARTS pattern or cheminformatics library functions to determine the chain length.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Rule 5**: For thiol groups, refine the patterns to distinguish between aliphatic and aromatic attachments. Ensure that `thiol_aliphatic_chain` matches thiol groups connected to aliphatic carbons, and `thiol_aromatic_ring` matches those connected to aromatic carbons:

  ```python
  'thiol_aliphatic_chain': '[CX4][SX2H]'  # Thiol attached to sp3 carbon
  'thiol_aromatic_ring': 'c[SX2H]'  # Thiol attached to aromatic ring
  ```

- **Suggestion 7**: **Rule 6**: Update the pattern for `polyhydroxy_carboxylic_acid` to accurately match molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain ending with a carboxylic acid. Use a more general pattern or count the number of hydroxyl groups in the molecule.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Rule 9**: The pattern `'aromatic_side_chain_with_heteroatom'` may be too restrictive or inaccurate. Modify it to match amino acids with side chains containing aromatic rings with heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen in indole of tryptophan):

  ```python
  'aromatic_side_chain_with_heteroatom': '[NX3;H2][CX4H]([#6])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][#6][#6]c1c[nH]c2c1cccc2'  # Example pattern for tryptophan
  ```

- **Suggestion 9**: **Rule 11**: For long aliphatic chains without additional polar functional groups, ensure the pattern excludes molecules with polar groups elsewhere in the molecule. Adjust the `exclude_smarts` to catch other polar groups, and refine `long_aliphatic_chain` to match chains longer than 6 carbons:

  ```python
  'long_aliphatic_chain': '[CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4]'  # 7 carbon chain
  'terminal_polar_group': '[CX4][OX2H1]', '[CX4][NX3;H2]', '[CX4][SX2H]'  # Terminal hydroxyl, amino, or thiol groups
  ```

- **Suggestion 10**: **Rule 15**: The pattern `'carbonyl_within_chain': '[#6][CX3](=O)[#6]'` may match any carbonyl group in the molecule. Refine it to detect carbonyl groups within the aliphatic chain, excluding terminal carboxylic acid groups. You might need to specify that the carbonyl is connected to carbons on both sides that are part of an aliphatic chain:

  ```python
  'carbonyl_within_chain': '[CX4][CX3](=O)[CX4]'  # Carbonyl flanked by sp3 carbons
  ```

- **Suggestion 11**: Review all SMARTS patterns for accuracy and completeness. Some patterns may be too general or too specific, leading to false positives or negatives. Consider using cheminformatics tools to test the patterns against known examples and adjust them accordingly.

- **Suggestion 12**: Include additional checks in the code to handle stereochemistry and tautomers if relevant to the rules. For example, specifying chiral centers in amino acids can improve the specificity of matches.

- **Suggestion 13**: Add comments in the code explaining each SMARTS pattern and any assumptions made. This documentation will help collaborators understand and modify the code as needed.

- **Suggestion 14**: Implement unit tests for each rule using known molecules that should match or not match. This testing will help validate the correctness of the SMARTS patterns and the overall code logic.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

**Introduction**

In evaluating the performance of the current set of rules, we focus on the key metrics of **confidence** and **lift**, as they provide insight into the predictive strength and usefulness of the rules. We will compare the current metrics with the previous metrics to assess improvements and identify areas for enhancement. Additionally, we will determine whether a local minimum has been reached and if sufficient iterations have been conducted.

---

**Comparison with Previous Metrics**

**Previous Metrics (Baseline Averages):**

- **Train Support:** Average of 0.1756
- **Train Confidence:** Average of 0.5874
- **Train Lift:** Average of 1.1304
- **Train Leverage:** Average of 0.01238

**Current Metrics:**

- **Train Support:** 0.0484
- **Train Confidence:** 0.5869
- **Train Lift:** 1.1609
- **Train Leverage:** 0.00642

---

**Observations:**

1. **Train Confidence:**
   - **Previous Average:** 0.5874
   - **Current:** 0.5869
   - **Analysis:** The train confidence has remained virtually unchanged compared to the previous average, indicating consistent predictive accuracy in the current rules.

2. **Train Lift:**
   - **Previous Average:** 1.1304
   - **Current:** 1.1609
   - **Analysis:** There is a slight improvement in the train lift, suggesting that the current rules are marginally better at predicting high yields compared to random chance than the previous set.

3. **Train Support:**
   - **Previous Average:** 0.1756
   - **Current:** 0.0484
   - **Analysis:** The train support has significantly decreased, indicating that the current rules cover a smaller portion of the training data. This suggests that while rules might be more precise, they apply to fewer instances.

4. **Train Leverage:**
   - **Previous Average:** 0.01238
   - **Current:** 0.00642
   - **Analysis:** The train leverage has decreased, reflecting a reduced difference between the observed support and the expected support if items were independent. This may be due to the lower support of the current rules.

---

**Analysis of Iteration Metrics:**

Throughout the iterations, metrics have fluctuated:

- **Train Confidence:** Ranged from **0.5333** to **0.6756**, with some iterations achieving higher confidence than the current value.
- **Train Lift:** Ranged from **1.0611** to **1.3558**, with some iterations showing higher lift.

These fluctuations suggest that the rule generation process has explored various rule sets with differing performance characteristics.

---

**Determining if a Local Minimum Has Been Reached**

The current metrics show marginal improvements in **lift** but not in **confidence** when compared to previous averages. Additionally, the **support** has decreased, which may not be desirable as it implies less generality. The fluctuations in metrics across iterations suggest that we may not have converged to a global optimum. However, the diminishing returns in improving the metrics indicate that a local minimum may have been reached.

Given that the improvements are minimal and the cost of additional iterations may outweigh the benefits, it may be reasonable to consider that sufficient iterations have been conducted for this phase.

---

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

1. **Increase Rule Support:**
   - **Objective:** Enhance the applicability of rules to a larger portion of the dataset without significantly compromising confidence and lift.
   - **Approach:**
     - **Generalize Overly Specific Rules:** Relax certain conditions in rules to cover more instances.
     - **Combine Similar Rules:** Identify and merge rules with overlapping conditions to create more general rules.
     - **Example:** Rules 2 and 12 both deal with aromatic carboxylic acids with substituents; consider combining them to create a broader rule that covers more compounds.

2. **Optimize Confidence and Lift Balance:**
   - **Objective:** Maintain or improve confidence and lift while increasing support.
   - **Approach:**
     - **Analyze Low Confidence Rules:** Identify rules with confidence significantly lower than the average and adjust or remove them.
     - **Refine High Lift Rules:** Focus on rules with high lift but low support to see if they can be broadened to increase support without losing lift.
     - **Example:** Rule 5 has conditional outcomes based on attachment points; perhaps re-evaluating the conditions to find a balance that improves confidence.

3. **Review Rule Specificity:**
   - **Objective:** Avoid overfitting by ensuring rules are not too narrowly defined.
   - **Approach:**
     - **Assess the Necessity of Detailed Conditions:** Determine if all specified conditions are essential or if some can be omitted.
     - **Simplify Complex Rules:** Break down complex rules into simpler components that are easier to generalize.
     - **Example:** Rule 9 specifies amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms; perhaps including amino acids with aliphatic side chains that have similar properties.

4. **Incorporate Additional Data Insights:**
   - **Objective:** Leverage more data features to improve rule strength.
   - **Approach:**
     - **Feature Engineering:** Create new features that may have predictive power, such as electronic properties or steric factors.
     - **Data Augmentation:** Use chemoinformatics tools to derive descriptors that could be included in rule conditions.

5. **Cross-Validation with Test Data:**
   - **Objective:** Ensure that improvements in training metrics generalize to unseen data.
   - **Approach:**
     - **Evaluate Rules on Test Set:** Check the performance of current rules on a test dataset to assess overfitting.
     - **Iteratively Refine Based on Test Performance:** Adjust rules that do not perform well on test data.

---

**Conclusion**

The current rules demonstrate stable confidence and a slight improvement in lift compared to previous iterations. However, the decreased support suggests that the rules are applicable to fewer instances, which may limit their practical usefulness. By focusing on increasing support while maintaining confidence and lift, and by avoiding overfitting through generalizing rules, we can enhance the overall performance of the rule set. Further iterations incorporating these recommendations may lead to a better balance between rule generality and predictive power.

---

**Next Steps**

- **Implement Recommended Adjustments:** Apply the suggested improvements to the current rules.
- **Monitor Metric Changes:** Observe how the metrics respond to changes, particularly support, confidence, and lift.
- **Determine Convergence:** After applying adjustments, re-evaluate to see if further significant improvements are achievable.

By continuing to refine the rules with these strategies, we aim to develop a robust set of rules that provide high predictive accuracy while being broadly applicable.

**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

**1. Accuracy Analysis:**

The latest 5-fold validation accuracy achieved is **68.57%**. This represents an improvement over previous iterations, where validation accuracies were observed at:

- 51.43%
- 54.29%
- 57.14%
- 60.00%
- 65.71%
- 54.29%

Compared to the initial reference metric where the test accuracy was around **75%**, the current model is approaching the baseline performance but still falls short by approximately 6 percentage points. The consistent increase in validation accuracy over iterations suggests that the modifications to the rules are positively impacting the model's predictive capabilities.

**2. Effectiveness of Current Rules:**

The current set of rules has led to an improved validation accuracy, indicating that the model's ability to generalize to unseen data has enhanced. However, the gap between the current accuracy and the reference test accuracy of 75% indicates there is still room for improvement. The rules are effective but may not yet capture all the nuances necessary for optimal performance.

**3. Overfitting/Underfitting Assessment:**

- **Overfitting:** There is no strong evidence of overfitting. The validation accuracy has improved without a significant drop in performance across the folds, suggesting the model is not just memorizing the training data.
  
- **Underfitting:** The model may still be underfitting to some extent, as it hasn't reached the reference test accuracy. This suggests that the current rules may not be sufficiently capturing all the relevant features affecting the catalyst's loading.

**5. Identification of Potentially Problematic Rules:**

**Overestimated Loadings (High Positive SHAP Values in Misclassifications):**

- **Rule 1:** Significant positive SHAP value (+0.2839) in overestimating loading for *C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N*.
  
- **Rule 11:** Positive contribution in misclassifications, suggesting potential overemphasis on long aliphatic chains without considering other functional groups.

- **Rule 22:** High positive SHAP value (+0.1049) in overestimating loading, indicating this rule may be contributing to incorrect high predictions.

**Underestimated Loadings (High Negative SHAP Values in Misclassifications):**

- **Rule 7:** Large negative SHAP values (e.g., -0.1490 for *C(CS)C(=O)O*) in underestimations. Rule 7 penalizes modifiers with aldehyde groups attached directly to aromatic rings, but may not be applicable to certain aliphatic compounds.

- **Rule 1:** Negative SHAP values in underestimations for molecules like *C(CCN)CC(=O)O* and *CCCCCCCC(=O)O* suggest that Rule 1 may be too restrictive or not accounting for certain beneficial features.

- **Rule 8:** Negative SHAP values contributing to underestimated loadings, possibly indicating that penalizing flexible polyether chains may not be universally applicable.

**6. Interpretation of Accuracy Improvements:**

The incremental improvements in accuracy suggest that the rules are increasingly capturing relevant features influencing catalyst loading. However, the misclassifications indicate that certain rules may be over-generalized or misapplied to specific molecular structures, leading to errors in prediction.

**Opportunities for Improving Current Rules**

**1. Refine Rule 1:**

- **Issue:** Rule 1 is contributing both positively and negatively in misclassifications. Its broad definition may not account for nuances in molecules with structural similarities but different coordination properties.
  
- **Recommendation:** Modify Rule 1 to be more specific about the context in which α-amino acids with side-chain carboxylic acid groups predict high yield. Consider incorporating side-chain length, steric effects, and presence of additional functional groups.

**2. Adjust Rule 7:**

- **Issue:** Rule 7 penalizes modifiers with aldehyde groups attached directly to aromatic rings, but is contributing to underestimations when applied to aliphatic compounds without such features.
  
- **Recommendation:** Refine Rule 7 to ensure it is only applied to aromatic compounds with directly attached aldehyde groups. Introduce a condition to exclude aliphatic compounds or adjust the rule to prevent misapplication.

**3. Re-evaluate Rule 11:**

- **Issue:** Rule 11 assumes that long aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar groups predict high yield. Misclassifications suggest that this may not hold for all such compounds.
  
- **Recommendation:** Consider the impact of chain length beyond a certain point, solubility issues, and the potential need for additional functional groups to facilitate effective metal coordination.

**4. Modify Rule 22:**

- **Issue:** Rule 22 is contributing to overestimations with high positive SHAP values in misclassified molecules. The specifics of Rule 22 are not provided, but its influence indicates a need for refinement.
  
- **Recommendation:** Analyze the definition and application of Rule 22 to ensure it accurately captures the structural features that genuinely contribute to high catalyst loading.

**5. Consider Interactions Between Rules:**

- **Issue:** Some misclassifications may result from additive effects of multiple rules, especially when rules contradict each other.
  
- **Recommendation:** Introduce rule hierarchies or weighting factors to balance the influence of conflicting rules. Employ conditional logic to handle cases where certain rules should take precedence.

**6. Incorporate Additional Molecular Descriptors:**

- **Issue:** Certain molecular features influencing catalyst loading may not be captured by the current rules.
  
- **Recommendation:** Expand the rule set to include descriptors such as electronic effects, steric hindrance, and solubility parameters. This could involve creating new rules or refining existing ones to account for these factors.

**Conclusion and Next Steps**

The current rules have improved the model's performance but still exhibit limitations leading to misclassifications. By refining rules that contribute to overestimations and underestimations, especially those identified through SHAP analysis, we can enhance the model’s predictive accuracy. Iterative refinement, guided by both statistical analysis and chemical intuition, will be essential in developing a robust model capable of generalizing effectively to new data.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

1. **Refine Rules with High Positive SHAP Values in Misclassifications:**

   - **Rule 1:** Adjust the scope to account for additional structural factors that may influence metal coordination negatively, even in α-amino acids.
  
   - **Rule 11 and Rule 22:** Reassess the conditions under which these rules predict high yield, incorporating considerations for steric hindrance and electronic effects.

2. **Adjust Rules with High Negative SHAP Values in Misclassifications:**

   - **Rule 7:** Limit its application to avoid penalizing molecules incorrectly, ensuring it targets only those structures that genuinely interfere with metal coordination.

   - **Rule 8:** Reevaluate the assumption that flexible polyether chains always predict low yield; consider exceptions where flexibility might not impede coordination.

3. **Improve Generalization to Address Underfitting:**

   - **Incorporate Cross-Terms:** Introduce rules that consider interactions between functional groups, recognizing that certain combinations may influence loading differently than when considered individually.
  
   - **Balance Rule Influence:** Implement a weighting mechanism to prevent any single rule from disproportionately affecting the prediction, especially when evidence from SHAP values suggests overcontribution.

4. **Use Insights from SHAP Analysis to Refine Rules:**

   - **Data-Driven Adjustments:** Utilize the SHAP values to identify patterns of misclassification and adjust rules accordingly, ensuring they align with observed data trends.

   - **Expert Review:** Engage domain experts to interpret SHAP findings in the context of chemical knowledge, guiding rule modifications that are both statistically and chemically sound.

5. **Iterative Evaluation:**

   - **Continuous Testing:** After refining the rules, re-evaluate the model's performance to assess the impact of changes, ensuring that improvements are realized in validation accuracy.

   - **Monitor for Overfitting:** Keep track of validation and training accuracy to detect any signs of overfitting resulting from rule adjustments.

By systematically refining the current rules based on performance metrics and SHAP analysis, we can enhance the model's ability to accurately predict catalyst loading, thereby contributing valuable insights to the catalytic problem under investigation.

   - **Iterative Refinement and Validation:**
     - Continue refining rules based on performance metrics and validation results.
     - Use cross-validation and test sets to monitor for overfitting and generalization performance.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

There is a clear possibility for further optimization of the current rules without leading to overfitting. The incremental improvements in validation accuracy, coupled with the identification of specific rules contributing to misclassifications, indicate that targeted refinements can enhance model performance. By carefully adjusting the rules based on both statistical analysis and chemical reasoning, we can improve the predictive accuracy while maintaining the model's ability to generalize.

**Conclusion**

Considering the above, further optimization of the current rules is necessary and feasible. The suggested directions aim to refine the rules to better capture the nuances influencing catalyst loading and yield, ultimately improving the model's performance.

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side-chain carboxylic acid groups** predict a **high yield**. The presence of both amino and additional carboxyl groups enhances metal coordination with the catalyst.

   - *Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid), **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid).

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted groups capable of metal coordination** predict a **high yield**. Functional groups such as amino, nitro, or bromomethyl at the para position provide additional coordination sites.

   - *Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.
   - Modifiers with para groups that do not enhance coordination (e.g., methyl) predict a **low yield** due to lack of additional coordination sites.
     - *Example*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**.
   - Modifiers with para-aldehyde groups predict a **low yield** as aldehyde groups can interfere with metal coordination or engage in side reactions.
     - *Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **pyridine carboxylic acids or contain a pyridine ring directly connected to a carboxylic acid** predict a **high yield**. The nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring acts as an additional coordination site.

   - *Examples*: **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**.
   - Modifiers where the pyridine ring is connected via an additional aromatic ring predict a **low yield** due to steric hindrance affecting coordination.
     - *Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal amino groups** predict a yield dependent on chain length:
   - **High yield** for short chains (≤5 carbons). The terminal amino group enhances metal binding without significant steric hindrance.
     - *Example*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**.
   - **Low yield** for longer chains (≥6 carbons) due to increased steric bulk and reduced solubility.
     - *Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing **thiol (–SH) groups** predict yield based on attachment:
   - **High yield** when the thiol group is attached to an **aliphatic chain**, providing flexibility for effective metal coordination.
     - *Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
   - **Low yield** when the thiol group is **attached to an aromatic ring**, potentially causing steric hindrance and reduced flexibility.
     - *Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**.

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing **multiple hydroxyl groups (polyhydroxy carboxylic acids)** predict a **high yield**. Additional hydroxyl groups offer multiple coordination sites, enhancing metal binding.

   - *Examples*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid), **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**.
   - Modifiers with hydroxyl groups **directly attached to aromatic rings** predict a **low yield** due to rigidity and potential steric hindrance.
     - *Examples*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing **aldehyde (–CHO) groups attached directly to aromatic rings** predict a **low yield**. Aldehyde groups can interfere with metal coordination or undergo side reactions that reduce yield.

   - *Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.

    - *Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with long chains (>6 carbons) without additional polar functional groups** predict a **high yield**. The lack of interfering groups allows coordination via the carboxylate without steric hindrance.

    - *Example*: **octanoic acid**.
    - Modifiers with **long aliphatic chains and terminal polar groups** (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) predict a **low yield** due to increased steric bulk and potential solubility issues.
      - *Examples*: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups connected via an aliphatic linker** predict a **high yield**. The linker provides flexibility, allowing better coordination with the metal center.

    - *Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.
    - Modifiers with hydroxyl groups **directly attached to the aromatic ring** predict a **low yield** due to rigidity and possible steric hindrance.
      - *Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers containing **lactone rings with carboxylic acid groups** predict a **high yield**. The rigid lactone structure aids in effective metal coordination by positioning coordinating groups appropriately.

    - *Example*: **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**.

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **amino acids or peptides with additional amide or acetamido groups in the side chain** predict a **low yield**. Amide groups can compete with carboxylate groups for metal binding, reducing coordination efficiency.

    - *Examples*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**, **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**.

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers with **carbonyl groups (ketone, amide, ester) within the aliphatic chain** predict a **low yield**. These groups can interfere with metal coordination or alter the electronic properties of the molecule.

    - *Examples*: **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**, **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **
- ** Advice 1 **: **Refine Rule 1** to specifically target α-amino acids with side-chain carboxylic acid groups. Modify the SMARTS pattern to detect amino acids that have at least two carboxylic acid groups—one at the α-position and one in the side chain. For example, adjust the pattern to:

  ```
  [NX3H2]-[CX4]-[CX3](=O)-[OX1H]  // α-amino acid backbone
  and
  [CX4]-[CX3](=O)-[OX1H]         // Side-chain carboxylic acid
  ```

  Ensure the pattern excludes amino acids without side-chain carboxylic acids to prevent overprediction of high yields.

- ** Advice 2 **: **Enhance Rule 2** by refining SMARTS patterns to accurately capture para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating groups. Create specific patterns for each functional group:

  - For para-amino groups:
    ```
    c1ccc(cc1)[NX3;H2]
    ```
  - For para-nitro groups:
    ```
    c1ccc(cc1)[N+](=O)[O-]
    ```
  - For para-bromomethyl groups:
    ```
    c1ccc(cc1)CBr
    ```

  Exclude substituents that do not enhance coordination (e.g., methyl groups) by ensuring they are not matched by these patterns.

- ** Advice 3 **: **Generalize Rule 3** by expanding the SMARTS pattern to include various pyridine carboxylic acids. Use a pattern that captures pyridine rings with carboxylic acid substituents at any position:

  ```
  c1ccncc1C(=O)O
  ```

  This allows detection of all isomers of pyridine carboxylic acids, enhancing the rule's applicability.

- ** Advice 4 **: **Adjust Rule 4** to accurately measure the aliphatic chain length between the carboxylic acid and the terminal amino group. Implement code to count carbon atoms in the chain:

  - For high yield (chain length ≤ 5 carbons):
    ```
    O=C[CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][NX3H2]
    ```
  - For low yield (chain length ≥ 6 carbons):
    ```
    O=C[CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][NX3H2]
    ```

  Ensure that the chain length is correctly counted to improve prediction accuracy.

- ** Advice 5 **: **Refine Rule 5** by distinguishing thiol group attachments. Create separate SMARTS patterns:

  - For thiol groups on aliphatic chains (high yield):
    ```
    [CX4][CX4][SX2H]
    ```
  - For thiol groups on aromatic rings (low yield):
    ```
    c1cc([SX2H])ccc1
    ```

  This ensures accurate identification of the thiol group's attachment point.

- ** Advice 6 **: **Modify Rule 7** to apply only to aromatic compounds with aldehyde groups directly attached to the ring. Adjust the SMARTS pattern to:

  ```
  c1cc([CX3H]=O)ccc1
  ```

  Exclude aliphatic aldehydes and molecules where the aldehyde is not directly attached to an aromatic ring to prevent misclassification.

- ** Advice 7 **: **Reevaluate Rule 8** by introducing specificity regarding flexible polyether chains. Limit the rule to modifiers where polyether chains are the dominant feature affecting coordination. Adjust the SMARTS pattern to detect long polyether chains without other strong coordinating groups:

  ```
  [OX2][CX4][CX4][OX2][CX4][CX4][OX2][CX4]
  ```

  Allow exceptions where other coordinating groups offset the flexibility issue.

- ** Advice 8 **: **Expand Rule 9** to include amino acids with various aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms. Update the SMARTS pattern to:

  ```
  [NX3H2][CX4][CX4][c][n]
  ```

  This captures side chains like tryptophan and others with heteroatoms capable of metal coordination.

- ** Advice 9 **: **Reassess Rule 11** by adjusting the chain length threshold and considering the presence of functional groups that may hinder coordination. Modify the rule to predict high yield for long aliphatic chains (>6 carbons) **only if** they do not contain additional polar groups. Update the SMARTS pattern:

  ```
  [CH3][CH2]{6,}[C](=O)O  // Long aliphatic chain carboxylic acids without polar groups
  ```

  Exclude modifiers with terminal polar groups like hydroxyl or amino groups.

- ** Advice 10 **: **Refine Rule 15** by adjusting the SMARTS pattern to detect interfering carbonyl groups within the aliphatic chain, excluding terminal carboxylic acids. Use a pattern such as:

  ```
  [CX4][CX3](=O)[CX4]  // Ketone within the chain
  ```

  Ensure that carboxylic acid functionalities are not misclassified as internal carbonyl groups.

   - *Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid), **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid).

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituents capable of metal coordination** (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl) predict a **high yield**. These substituents provide additional coordination sites for the metal center.

   - *Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.
   - Modifiers with para-substituents that do not enhance coordination (e.g., methyl) or interfere with coordination (e.g., aldehyde) predict a **low yield** due to lack of effective metal interaction.
     - *Examples*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**.

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **pyridine carboxylic acids** or have a pyridine ring directly connected to a carboxylic acid predict a **high yield**. The nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring acts as an additional coordination site enhancing metal binding.

   - *Examples*: **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**.
   - If the pyridine ring is connected via another aromatic ring, steric hindrance reduces coordination efficiency, predicting a **low yield**.
     - *Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal amino or hydroxyl groups** predict yield based on chain length:
   - **High yield** for short chains (up to 5 carbons), where the polar group can coordinate effectively without steric hindrance.
     - *Examples*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**, **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
   - **Low yield** for longer chains (more than 5 carbons), where increased chain length leads to steric hindrance and reduced solubility.
     - *Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**.

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing **multiple hydroxyl groups (polyhydroxy carboxylic acids)** predict a **high yield**. Additional hydroxyl groups offer multiple coordination sites, enhancing metal binding.
   - *Examples*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid), **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**.
   - Modifiers with hydroxyl groups **directly attached to aromatic rings** predict a **low yield** due to rigidity and potential steric hindrance.
     - *Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups** and moderate chain length (6–8 carbons) predict a **high yield**. The absence of interfering groups allows effective coordination via the carboxylate.
   - *Example*: **octanoic acid**.

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted aliphatic chains bearing coordinating groups** predict a **high yield**. The aliphatic linker provides flexibility, allowing better coordination with the metal center.
   - *Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.
   - Modifiers with coordinating groups **directly attached to the aromatic ring** predict a **low yield** due to rigidity.
     - *Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms capable of metal coordination** predict a **high yield**. Heteroatoms like nitrogen enhance coordination with the metal center.
   - *Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan).
   - Aromatic side chains **lacking heteroatoms** predict a **low yield** due to fewer coordination sites.
     - *Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine).

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **functional groups that can interfere with metal coordination** (e.g., aldehyde, ketone, amide groups within the molecule) predict a **low yield**. These groups can compete with or disrupt effective metal binding.
   - *Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**, **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **highly electronegative substituents** (e.g., perfluorinated chains) predict a **low yield**. Electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms reduce electron density, hindering effective metal coordination.
    - *Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers with **flexible polyether chains** predict a **low yield**. The high flexibility and solvation of polyether chains reduce effective metal coordination.
    - *Example*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers containing **rigid ring structures with coordinating groups positioned favorably** predict a **high yield**. The rigidity aids in effective metal binding.
    - *Example*: **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**.

The rule is clear and provides physical-chemical insight on how additional hydroxyl groups offer multiple coordination sites. It considers combinations of functional groups, fulfilling the complexity criterion. Supported by examples like **gluconic acid** and **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (high yield), and **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (low yield), the coverage is acceptable.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 asserts that aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups and of moderate chain length (6–8 carbons) predict high yield. The rule is clear and provides insight into the effective coordination of the unimpeded carboxylate group with the metal center. It focuses on specific structural features, meeting the complexity criterion. However, coverage is limited, with only one supporting example—**octanoic acid**. Additional data points would strengthen the rule's coverage.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 specifies that aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted aliphatic chains bearing coordinating groups predict high yield, whereas those with coordinating groups directly attached to the aromatic ring predict low yield due to rigidity hindering coordination. The rule is clear and provides physical-chemical insight on the flexibility provided by the aliphatic linker. It considers combinations of substructures, satisfying the complexity criterion. Supported by examples like **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (high yield) and **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (low yield), the coverage is adequate.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 states that amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms capable of metal coordination predict high yield, while those lacking heteroatoms predict low yield. The rule is clear and provides physical-chemical insight into the role of heteroatoms like nitrogen in enhancing metal binding. It addresses complexity by considering side-chain structures. Supported by data points such as **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan, high yield) and **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine, low yield), the coverage is acceptable.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 indicates that modifiers containing functional groups that can interfere with metal coordination (e.g., aldehyde, ketone, amide groups) predict low yield. The rule is clear and provides physical-chemical insight into how these groups may compete with or disrupt effective metal binding. It considers combinations of interfering functional groups, satisfying the complexity criterion. Supported by examples such as **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**, and **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (all low yield), the coverage is good.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 asserts that modifiers with highly electronegative substituents (e.g., perfluorinated chains) predict low yield due to electron-withdrawing effects that reduce electron density on coordinating atoms. The rule is clear and offers adequate physical-chemical insight. It considers the impact of electronegative substituents on coordination, meeting the complexity criterion. However, coverage is limited, with only one supporting example—**2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**. Additional data points would strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 states that modifiers with flexible polyether chains predict low yield due to high flexibility and solvation reducing effective metal coordination. The rule is clear and provides physical-chemical insight on how flexibility and solvation negatively affect coordination. It considers specific structural features, satisfying the complexity criterion. Coverage is limited to one example—**2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**. More supporting data would improve the rule's coverage.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 indicates that modifiers containing rigid ring structures with favorably positioned coordinating groups predict high yield. The rule is clear and provides physical-chemical insight into how rigidity and the positioning of coordinating groups facilitate effective metal binding. It considers combinations of structural features, meeting the complexity criterion. Coverage is limited with only one supporting example—**1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**. Additional examples would enhance the rule's coverage.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side-chain carboxylic acid groups** predict a **high yield**. The combination of the amino group and an additional carboxyl group enhances coordination with the metal center, stabilizing the catalyst.

   - *Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid), **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid).

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituents capable of metal coordination** (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl groups) predict a **high yield**. These substituents provide additional coordination sites for metal binding.

   - *Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.
   - Modifiers with para-substituents that do not enhance coordination (e.g., methyl) or contain groups that interfere with coordination (e.g., aldehyde) predict a **low yield** due to ineffective metal interaction.
     - *Examples*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**.

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **pyridine carboxylic acids** or have a pyridine ring directly connected to a carboxylic acid predict a **high yield**. The nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring acts as an additional coordination site, enhancing metal binding.

   - *Examples*: **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**.
   - If the pyridine ring is connected via another aromatic ring, steric hindrance reduces coordination efficiency, predicting a **low yield**.
     - *Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal amino or hydroxyl groups** predict yield based on chain length:
   - **High yield** for short chains (up to 5 carbons), where the polar group can coordinate effectively without steric hindrance.
     - *Examples*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**, **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
   - **Low yield** for longer chains (more than 5 carbons), where increased chain length leads to steric hindrance and reduced coordination efficiency.
     - *Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**, **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**.

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing **multiple hydroxyl groups (polyhydroxy carboxylic acids)** predict a **high yield**. The additional hydroxyl groups offer multiple coordination sites, enhancing metal binding and catalyst stabilization.

   - *Examples*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid), **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**.
   - Modifiers with hydroxyl groups **directly attached to aromatic rings** predict a **low yield** due to rigidity and potential steric hindrance affecting metal coordination.
     - *Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups** and of moderate chain length (6–8 carbons) predict a **high yield**. The unimpeded carboxylate group can coordinate effectively with the metal center.

   - *Example*: **octanoic acid**.
   - Absence of additional functional groups prevents interference with metal coordination.

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted aliphatic chains bearing coordinating groups** predict a **high yield**. The aliphatic linker provides flexibility, allowing the coordinating group to interact effectively with the metal center.

   - *Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.
   - Modifiers with coordinating groups **directly attached to the aromatic ring** predict a **low yield**, as rigidity may hinder effective coordination.
     - *Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms capable of metal coordination** predict a **high yield**. Heteroatoms like nitrogen in the side chain enhance metal binding.

   - *Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan).
   - Aromatic side chains **lacking heteroatoms** predict a **low yield**, due to fewer coordination sites.
     - *Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine).

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **functional groups that can interfere with metal coordination** (e.g., aldehyde, ketone, amide groups) predict a **low yield**. These groups may compete with or disrupt effective metal binding.

   - *Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**, **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **highly electronegative substituents** (e.g., perfluorinated chains) predict a **low yield**. Electron-withdrawing groups reduce electron density on coordinating atoms, hindering effective metal coordination.

    - *Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers with **flexible polyether chains** predict a **low yield**. The high flexibility and solvation of polyether chains reduce the likelihood of effective metal coordination.

    - *Example*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers containing **rigid ring structures with favorably positioned coordinating groups** predict a **high yield**. The rigidity and positioning facilitate effective metal binding.

    - *Example*: **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**.

Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: **Review and Correct Rule 1's SMARTS Pattern**  
  The current SMARTS pattern for identifying α-amino acids with side-chain carboxylic acid groups (`'alpha_amino_acid': '[NX3][CX4H]([*])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'`) does not adequately capture side-chain carboxylic acid groups. It primarily matches the backbone of any α-amino acid but doesn't ensure the presence of additional carboxylic acid groups in the side chain.  
  **Improvement**: Modify the SMARTS pattern to explicitly require a side-chain carboxylic acid group. A possible pattern is:
  ```python
  'alpha_amino_acid_with_side_chain_cooh': '[NX3][CX4H]([*])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
  ```
  This pattern ensures that there is an α-amino acid backbone with an additional carboxylic acid group attached to the side chain.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Refine Rule 2's Pattern to Accurately Identify Para-Substituted Aromatic Carboxylic Acids**  
  The current code for Rule 2 uses a general aromatic carboxylic acid pattern (`'aromatic_carboxylic_acid': '[c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'`) and checks for coordinating groups anywhere in the molecule. This can lead to false positives/negatives.  
  **Improvement**: Create a SMARTS pattern that specifically matches para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating groups in the para position. For example:
  ```python
  'para_substituted_aromatic_coordinating': 'c1ccc([CX3](=O)[OX2H1])c([$(N),$(O),$(S),$(Br),$(I),$(Cl),$(F)])c1'
  ```
  This pattern ensures the substituent is in the para position relative to the carboxylic acid and is a coordinating group.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Adjust Rule 3 to Correctly Differentiate Between Pyridine-Carboxylic Acids and Other Aromatic Carboxylic Acids**  
  The SMARTS pattern for pyridine carboxylic acid (`'[n][c][c][c][c][c][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'`) may not match all pyridine carboxylic acids correctly, and the negative pattern (`'aromatic_carboxylic_acid'`) is too general, causing many compounds to be incorrectly assigned a negative prediction.  
  **Improvement**: Use a more specific pattern for pyridine carboxylic acids:
  ```python
  'pyridine_carboxylic_acid': '[nH0c]1cccc([CX3](=O)[OX2H1])c1'
  ```
  Also, adjust the negative pattern to only match compounds where the pyridine ring is connected via another aromatic ring:
  ```python
  'pyridine_via_aromatic_ring': '[c][c]([c][n][c][c])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
  ```
  Update the code to differentiate correctly based on these patterns.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Improve Rule 4 by Accurately Defining Chain Lengths and Terminal Functional Groups**  
  The SMARTS patterns for short and long aliphatic chains with terminal amino or hydroxyl groups use repetition counts (`{2,5}` and `{6,}`). However, the patterns may not match correctly due to syntax errors and may not ensure that the amino or hydroxyl group is terminal.  
  **Improvement**: Correct the repetition syntax and ensure terminal positioning:
  ```python
  'short_chain_with_terminal_polar': '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H2][NX3H2,OX2H1]'
  'long_chain_with_terminal_polar': '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CX4H2]{5,}[NX3H2,OX2H1]'
  ```
  These patterns start from the carboxylic acid and count carbons to the terminal amino or hydroxyl group.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Refine Rule 5 to Distinguish Between Polyhydroxy Carboxylic Acids and Aromatic Hydroxyls**  
  The current pattern for polyhydroxy carboxylic acids (`'[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CX4]([OX2H])[CX4]([OX2H])[CX4]([OX2H])'`) may not match compounds with varying numbers of hydroxyl groups. Also, the exclusion pattern for aromatic hydroxyl (`'[c][OX2H]'`) is too general and may exclude compounds incorrectly.  
  **Improvement**: Use recursive SMARTS to match multiple hydroxyl groups and ensure they're not aromatic:
  ```python
  'polyhydroxy_aliphatic_acid': '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][C;!R]([OX2H])[C;!R]([OX2H])[C;!R]([OX2H])'
  'aromatic_hydroxyl': '[c][OX2H]'
  ```
  This way, only aliphatic hydroxyl groups are considered for high yield predictions.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Clarify Rule 6 Pattern for Medium-Length Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids**  
  The pattern for medium aliphatic carboxylic acids is hardcoded for a 6-carbon chain, which may not cover the range (6–8 carbons) specified in the rule.  
  **Improvement**: Generalize the pattern to include chains of 6 to 8 carbons:
  ```python
  'medium_aliphatic_carboxylic_acid': '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CX4H2]{5,7}[CH3]'
  ```
  This pattern matches aliphatic carboxylic acids with a chain length of 6 to 8 carbons.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Enhance Rule 7 Patterns to Correctly Identify Para-Substituted Aliphatic Chains with Coordinating Groups**  
  The current pattern may not accurately distinguish between coordinating groups attached via an aliphatic chain versus directly to the aromatic ring.  
  **Improvement**: Define patterns that specify the substituent is connected via an aliphatic chain to the para position:
  ```python
  'para_substituted_aromatic_with_aliphatic_polar': 'c1ccc(cc1C(=O)O)CC[NX3H2,OX2H1]'
  'para_substituted_aromatic_direct_polar': 'c1ccc([NX3H2,OX2H1])cc1C(=O)O'
  ```
  Use these patterns to assign high yield for the first and low yield for the second.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Correct Rule 8 Patterns for Amino Acids with Aromatic Side Chains Containing Heteroatoms**  
  The current patterns may not correctly identify heteroatoms in the side chains or may fail to match the amino acid backbone.  
  **Improvement**: Use more precise patterns to capture amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms:
  ```python
  'amino_acid_with_aromatic_heteroatom_side_chain': '[NX3][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX2H1])[CX4][c][n,o,s]'
  'amino_acid_with_aromatic_side_chain_no_heteroatom': '[NX3][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX2H1])[CX4][c]([#6])[c]'
  ```
  Ensure that the side chain is aromatic and check for the presence or absence of heteroatoms.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Expand Rule 9's Interfering Groups to Include All Relevant Functional Groups**  
  The interfering groups are currently limited to aldehyde, ketone, and amide but may miss other functional groups that interfere with metal coordination, such as nitriles or nitro groups.  
  **Improvement**: Broaden the pattern list:
  ```python
  'interfering_groups': ['[CX3H1=O]', '[CX3](=O)[#6]', '[CX3](=O)[NX3]', '[NX3](=O)=O', '[CX2]#N']
  ```
  This includes nitro groups and nitriles.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Refine Rule 10 Pattern for Perfluorinated Chains**  
  Using a trifluoromethyl group as a proxy may not capture all perfluorinated chains.  
  **Improvement**: Use a pattern that matches any carbon with at least two fluorines:
  ```python
  'perfluorinated_chain': '[CX4]([F])([F])[F,Cl,Br,I]'
  ```
  Or to match perfluoroalkyl chains:
  ```python
  'perfluoroalkyl_chain': '[CX4]([F])([F])[F]'
  ```

- **Suggestion 11**: **Update Rule 11 Pattern to Accurately Identify Flexible Polyether Chains**  
  The current pattern may miss molecules with longer or shorter polyether chains or ethers that are not in a repeating sequence.  
  **Improvement**: Use a recursive pattern to match polyethers:
  ```python
  'polyether_chain': '[CX4][OX2][CX4]([OX2][CX4]){2,}'
  ```
  This matches chains with at least two repeating –O–CH2– units.

- **Suggestion 12**: **Enhance Rule 12 Pattern for Rigid Ring Structures with Coordinating Groups**  
  The current pattern may be too specific and miss other rigid ring systems with coordinating groups.  
  **Improvement**: Generalize the pattern to include other rigid heterocycles with coordinating atoms positioned favorably:
  ```python
  'rigid_ring_with_coordinating_groups': '[c]1[c,o,n,s][c,o,n,s][c]([C](=O)[OX2H1])[c,o,n,s][c,o,n,s]1'
  ```
  This pattern allows for various heteroatoms in the ring that can coordinate with metals.

- **Suggestion 13**: **Implement Rule Matching with Proper Logical Conditions**  
  Ensure that the code checks for exclusive conditions where applicable. For example, in Rule 5, avoid assigning a high yield if the molecule also matches the exclusion pattern for aromatic hydroxyls.  
  **Improvement**: In the code, use logical operators to enforce exclusivity where necessary:
  ```python
  if mol.HasSubstructMatch(rule['patterns'][0]) and not mol.HasSubstructMatch(rule['exclude_pattern']):
      row.append(rule['prediction'])
  else:
      row.append(0)
  ```
  This prevents conflicting assignments.

- **Suggestion 14**: **Validate SMARTS Patterns with Test Cases**  
  Before applying the patterns to the dataset, validate each SMARTS pattern against known compounds to ensure they match the intended structures.  
  **Improvement**: Create a set of test SMILES strings for each rule (both positive and negative examples) and verify that the patterns correctly identify them.

- **Suggestion 15**: **Use RDKit's Built-In Functionality for Chain Lengths and Substituents**  
  Instead of relying on repetition counts in SMARTS, which can be error-prone, use RDKit functions to calculate chain lengths or to identify substituents in specific positions.  
  **Improvement**: For example, to check chain lengths:
  ```python
  chain = Chem.rdmolops.GetShortestPath(mol, start_atom_idx, end_atom_idx)
  if len(chain) >= 6 and len(chain) <= 8:
      # Assign high yield
  ```
  This approach provides more flexibility and accuracy.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of the Current Rules Based on Metrics**

**1. Overview of Current Metrics:**

- **Train Support:** 3.10%
- **Train Confidence:** 52.54%
- **Train Lift:** 1.0435
- **Train Leverage:** 0.0032

**2. Comparison with Previous Metrics:**

*Previous Metrics Averages:*

- **Train Support:** Approximately 17.56%
- **Train Confidence:** Approximately 58.74%
- **Train Lift:** Approximately 1.13
- **Train Leverage:** Approximately 0.0124

**Observations:**

- **Support Decrease:** The current rules have a significantly lower support compared to the previous metrics. The support has decreased from around 17.56% to 3.10%.

  - *Implication:* The current rules apply to a much smaller portion of the dataset, indicating they may be too specific or not capturing enough instances.

- **Confidence Decrease:** Confidence has decreased slightly from approximately 58.74% to 52.54%.

  - *Implication:* The likelihood that the prediction is correct when the rule conditions are met has diminished.

- **Lift Decrease:** The lift has decreased from approximately 1.13 to 1.0435, approaching 1.

  - *Implication:* A lift close to 1 indicates that the rule's predictive power is not significantly better than random chance. The current rules are less effective at improving the prediction over the prior probability.

- **Leverage Decrease:** Leverage has decreased from approximately 0.0124 to 0.0032.

  - *Implication:* The rules provide less additional information than expected by chance, highlighting a weaker association between the conditions and the predictions.

**3. Analysis of Iterations:**

Throughout the iterations, the metrics have shown fluctuation:

- **Initial Iterations:** Some rules had higher confidence (up to 66.67%) and higher lift (up to 1.33) but very low support (around 1.25%).

  - *Observation:* These rules were highly specific, applying to very few cases but performing well within those cases.

- **Subsequent Iterations:** As support increased (up to 5.56%), confidence and lift generally decreased.

  - *Observation:* Attempting to generalize the rules to cover more data led to reduced accuracy and association strength.

- **Final Iteration:** The current rules have modest support (3.10%) but lower confidence and lift compared to earlier iterations.

  - *Observation:* The balance between support and confidence has not been optimized, and the rules may have become too generalized without maintaining predictive power.

**4. Assessment of Local Minimum and Iterations:**

- **Local Minimum Indication:** The trend suggests that we may have reached a local minimum where further iterations are not yielding significant improvements in the metrics.

  - **Evidence:** Despite multiple iterations, we are observing diminishing returns, with neither support, confidence, nor lift showing substantial enhancements.

- **Sufficiency of Iterations:** The iterations conducted so far may be sufficient to conclude that the current approach is not optimizing the desired metrics.

  - **Recommendation:** It may be time to reevaluate the methodology rather than continuing with additional iterations that are unlikely to produce better results.

**5. Recommendations for Improving the Current Rules:**

**A. Increase Rule Support:**

- **Broaden Rule Conditions:**
  - Simplify overly specific conditions to cover a larger portion of the dataset.
  - Identify common attributes among high-yield cases to create more inclusive rules.

- **Example:**
  - Instead of focusing on specific substituents (e.g., "Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side-chain carboxylic acid groups**"), consider broader categories (e.g., "Modifiers that are amino acids with polar side chains").

**B. Enhance Confidence and Lift:**

- **Refine Rule Precision:**
  - Identify key predictive features that strongly correlate with high yield.
  - Eliminate or adjust conditions that introduce noise or exceptions.

- **Balancing Specificity and Generality:**
  - Aim for rules that strike a balance between being too narrow (high confidence but low support) and too broad (high support but low confidence).

**C. Utilize Statistical Analysis:**

- **Correlation Studies:**
  - Perform statistical tests to identify significant relationships between modifiers' features and yield outcomes.
  - Use correlation coefficients to prioritize features with the strongest predictive power.

**D. Incorporate Domain Expertise:**

- **Leverage Chemical Knowledge:**
  - Consider the chemical properties and reactivity of modifiers in the context of the catalytic problem.
  - Collaborate with chemists to understand underlying mechanisms that contribute to high or low yields.

**E. Reevaluate Rule Structure:**

- **Assess Functional Group Interactions:**
  - Reexamine how different functional groups affect metal coordination and catalyst stability.
  - Consider electronic and steric factors comprehensively.

- **Simplify Complex Rules:**
  - Break down complex rules into simpler, additive components to isolate their effects on performance.

**F. Alternative Approaches:**

- **Machine Learning Models:**
  - Employ classification algorithms (e.g., decision trees, random forests) to discover patterns that may not be evident through manual rule creation.

- **Cross-Validation:**
  - Use cross-validation techniques to test rule performance on different subsets of data, ensuring they generalize well.

**6. Conclusion:**

The current rules, while detailed, are not performing optimally based on the provided metrics:

- **Low Support:** Indicates rules are too narrow and not widely applicable.
- **Modest Confidence and Lift:** Suggests rules are not significantly better than random chance.
- **Decreased Leverage:** Points to a weaker association between the conditions and outcomes.

**Path Forward:**

To improve the rules:

- **Rebalance Rule Complexity:** Simplify overly complex rules to increase applicability without sacrificing too much predictive accuracy.
- **Focus on High-Impact Features:** Utilize statistical methods to identify and prioritize features that have the strongest correlation with high yields.
- **Iterative Refinement:** Continue refining the rules with a focus on improving both support and confidence metrics, potentially revisiting earlier iterations for insights.
- **Integrate Expert Insights:** Collaborate with domain experts to incorporate nuanced chemical understanding into the rule development process.

By adopting these strategies, we can work towards developing rules that are both meaningful and effective in predicting high yields, ultimately enhancing the success of the research program.

Traditional Commenter Message:
**Comments on the Accuracies of the Validation Set and Training Set:**

The current 5-fold validation accuracy achieved by the classification model is **60%**, as indicated by:

- **Current Accuracy**:  
  - *Validation Accuracy*: **0.6**

This accuracy is lower compared to the previous reference accuracies provided:

- **Previous Reference Accuracies**:
  - *Validation Accuracies*: **[0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]**
  - *Test Accuracies*: **0.75**, **0.625**

The decline in validation accuracy from approximately **76%** to **60%** suggests that the current set of rules may not be performing as effectively as in previous iterations. This decrease indicates potential issues with the current rules leading to misclassifications.

---

**Analysis Based on the SHAP Value Calculated on the Validation Set:**

The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis provides insights into how each rule contributes to the model's predictions. From the SHAP values, we can identify which rules are contributing significantly to incorrect predictions.

**Key Observations:**

1. **Overestimation of Modifier Loading**:
   - For several molecules, the model predicts a **high** loading when the experimental value is **low**.
   - In these cases, certain rules have high positive SHAP values, indicating they contribute significantly to the overestimation.

2. **Underestimation of Modifier Loading**:
   - There are fewer instances where the model predicts a **low** loading while the experimental value is **high**. This suggests that underestimation is less of an issue compared to overestimation in the current model.

**Examples of Overestimation:**

1. **Molecule:** *C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N*
   - **Predicted Loading:** High
   - **Experimental Value:** Low
   - **SHAP Values:**
     - *Rule 5*: **0.04136**
     - *Rule 10*: **0.03981**

2. **Molecule:** *C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O*
   - **Predicted Loading:** High
   - **Experimental Value:** Low
   - **SHAP Values:**
     - *Rule 5*: **0.04136**
     - *Rule 10*: **0.03981**

In both cases, **Rule 5** and **Rule 10** have high positive SHAP values, indicating that they heavily influence the model toward predicting a high loading, contrary to the experimental results.

**Examples of Underestimation:**

- There are no significant cases provided where the model underestimates the loading (i.e., predicts low when the experimental value is high), suggesting that the model is less prone to this error under the current rules.

---

**Assessing Overfitting/Underfitting and Rule Effectiveness:**

- **Overfitting:** The decrease in validation accuracy suggests that the model may be overfitting to patterns specific to the training data and not generalizing well to new data.
- **Underfitting:** Alternatively, the model may not be capturing the underlying relationships adequately due to overly simplistic or inaccurate rules.
- **Rule Effectiveness:** The current rules, especially **Rule 5** and **Rule 10**, may not be effectively distinguishing between molecules that lead to high versus low modifier loading.

---

**Interpretation of Accuracy Improvements:**

- **Local Minimum:** Given that the validation accuracy has decreased and SHAP analysis indicates consistent misclassifications, it appears that the current set of rules may have reached a performance plateau or local minimum.
- **Need for Iteration:** The decline in accuracy and identified issues suggest that further iterations and refinements of the rules are necessary to improve model performance.

---

**Deriving Insights from SHAP Analysis:**

- **Rules with High Positive SHAP Values in Misclassifications:** 
  - *Rule 5* and *Rule 10* consistently contribute to overestimations in cases where the model predicts high loading but the experimental value is low.
- **Rules with High Negative SHAP Values:** 
  - In this analysis, there are no prominent instances where high negative SHAP values lead to underestimations.
- **Patterns in Misclassifications:**
  - The misclassified molecules often share structural features that may not be adequately captured or are misrepresented by the current rules.

---

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules:**

1. **Refine Rule 5: Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups**

   - **Current Rule 5 Summary:**
     - Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (polyhydroxy carboxylic acids) predict a **high yield**.
   - **Issue Identified:**
     - Rule 5 is contributing to overestimations in molecules where the experimental loading is low.
     - High SHAP values in cases of misclassification indicate that Rule 5 may be too general.
   - **Suggested Improvements:**
     - **Add Specificity:** Introduce additional criteria to Rule 5 to differentiate between effective and ineffective modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups.
       - Consider steric hindrance due to hydroxyl positioning.
       - Evaluate the impact of hydroxyl group distribution (e.g., whether they are adjacent or spread out).
     - **Exclude Certain Structures:** Identify and exclude specific molecular structures where multiple hydroxyl groups do not enhance metal coordination effectively.

2. **Adjust Rule 10: Modifiers with Highly Electronegative Substituents**

   - **Current Rule 10 Summary:**
     - Modifiers with highly electronegative substituents (e.g., perfluorinated chains) predict a **low yield**.
   - **Issue Identified:**
     - Despite predicting a low yield, Rule 10 is contributing positively to high loading predictions in misclassified molecules.
     - Negative SHAP values expected in low predictions are not significant.
   - **Suggested Improvements:**
     - **Re-evaluate the Rule's Implementation:** Ensure that the rule correctly identifies and penalizes modifiers with electronegative substituents.
     - **Fine-tune Thresholds:** Adjust the thresholds for what constitutes a "highly electronegative" substituent.
     - **Consider Electronic Effects:** Incorporate the overall electronic effect of substituents on the molecule's coordination ability.

3. **Incorporate Additional Structural Considerations**

   - **Introduce New Rules:**
     - **Steric Hindrance Factors:** Account for bulky groups that may hinder coordination despite other favorable features.
     - **Resonance and Electron Distribution:** Consider how resonance structures and electron delocalization affect metal coordination.
   - **Modify Existing Rules:**
     - Integrate considerations of molecular flexibility versus rigidity, which can impact the ability of coordinating groups to interact with the metal center.

4. **Enhance Generalization to Address Overfitting/Underfitting**

   - **Simplify Overly Complex Rules:**
     - Remove unnecessary complexity that may cause the model to overfit to specific cases.
   - **Balance Specificity and Generality:**
     - Ensure that rules are neither too general (leading to misclassifications) nor too specific (failing to generalize).

5. **Iteratively Test and Validate Rule Adjustments**

   - **Use Cross-Validation:**
     - Implement k-fold cross-validation to ensure that changes improve performance consistently across different subsets of the data.
   - **Monitor SHAP Values After Adjustments:**
     - Recalculate SHAP values to assess the impact of rule modifications on model predictions.
   - **Ensure Alignment with Experimental Data:**
     - Validate that rule adjustments lead to predictions that align more closely with experimental outcomes.

6. **Leverage SHAP Analysis to Refine Rules**

   - **Identify Patterns in Misclassifications:**
     - Use SHAP values to detect which molecular features are consistently associated with incorrect predictions.
   - **Adjust Rules Accordingly:**
     - Modify or introduce rules that specifically address these features.

7. **Consider External Factors**

   - **Metal Coordination Chemistry:**
     - Integrate principles from coordination chemistry to inform rule development.
     - Consider ligand field effects and chelation tendencies.
   - **Functional Group Interactions:**
     - Account for possible intramolecular interactions that may affect the availability of coordinating groups.

---

**Concluding Remarks:**

The decrease in validation accuracy and insights from the SHAP analysis indicate that the current rules require refinement to improve model performance. Specifically, focusing on **Rule 5** and **Rule 10**, which significantly contribute to misclassifications, can lead to better alignment between predictions and experimental results.

By incorporating the recommendations above, the model can achieve a better balance between sensitivity and specificity, enhancing its predictive capabilities. Continuous iterative refinement, guided by SHAP analysis and validation metrics, will be essential in developing a robust model that generalizes well to new data.

---

**Next Steps:**

- **Implement the Suggested Rule Adjustments:**
  - Modify **Rule 5** and **Rule 10** based on the recommendations.
- **Retrain the Model:**
  - Use the updated rules to generate a new feature matrix.
  - Retrain the classification model with the revised feature matrix.
- **Re-evaluate Model Performance:**
  - Assess the new validation accuracy.
  - Perform SHAP analysis to examine the impact of the adjustments.
- **Iteratively Refine:**
  - Continue the cycle of adjustment, training, and evaluation until the model performance stabilizes and aligns closely with experimental data.

By systematically addressing the identified issues and iteratively refining the rules, the model's accuracy and reliability can be significantly improved.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

The current set of rules aims to predict the yield of a radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp^3)^–H bond functionalization reaction of aliphatic alcohols based on the molecular structure of modifiers. The rules are derived from SMARTS patterns that identify specific structural features in the modifiers.

**1. Analysis of Current Rules and Metrics:**

- **Decreased Performance Metrics:**
  - **Train Support:** Decreased from approximately 17.56% to 3.10%, indicating that the current rules apply to a smaller portion of the dataset.
  - **Train Confidence:** Slightly decreased to 52.54%, suggesting reduced predictive reliability when the rule conditions are met.
  - **Train Lift:** Decreased to 1.0435, approaching 1, which implies that the predictive power of the rules is not significantly better than random chance.
  - **Train Leverage:** Decreased to 0.0032, indicating a weaker association between the conditions and the predictions.

- **Validation Accuracy:**
  - The 5-fold validation accuracy dropped to 60%, which is lower than previous accuracies (~76%), suggesting that the current rules may not generalize well.

- **SHAP Analysis Insights:**
  - **Rule 5** and **Rule 10** contribute significantly to overestimations where the model predicts high yields but experimental values are low.
  - There is a pattern of misclassifications indicating that certain rules may be incorrectly influencing the predictions.

**2. Suggestions to Improve Current Rules:**

**Suggestion 1: Review and Correct Rule 1's SMARTS Pattern**

- **Issue:** The pattern for α-amino acids with side-chain carboxylic acid groups does not adequately ensure the presence of a side-chain carboxylic acid.
- **Improvement:** Modify the SMARTS pattern to explicitly require a side-chain carboxylic acid group.
  - **Updated Pattern:**
    ```python
    'alpha_amino_acid_with_side_chain_cooh': '[NX3][CX4H]([*])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
    ```

**Suggestion 2: Refine Rule 2's Pattern for Para-Substituted Aromatic Carboxylic Acids**

- **Issue:** The current pattern may lead to false positives/negatives by not specifically targeting para-substituents.
- **Improvement:** Create a SMARTS pattern that matches para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating groups in the para position.
  - **Updated Pattern:**
    ```python
    'para_substituted_aromatic_coordinating': 'c1ccc([CX3](=O)[OX2H1])c([$(N),$(O),$(S),$(Br),$(I),$(Cl),$(F)])c1'
    ```

**Suggestion 3: Adjust Rule 3 to Differentiate Pyridine-Carboxylic Acids**

- **Issue:** The current patterns may incorrectly classify pyridine derivatives.
- **Improvement:** Use more specific patterns for pyridine carboxylic acids and those connected via another aromatic ring.
  - **Updated Patterns:**
    ```python
    'pyridine_carboxylic_acid': '[nH0c]1cccc([CX3](=O)[OX2H1])c1'
    'pyridine_via_aromatic_ring': '[c][c]([c][n][c][c])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
    ```

**Suggestion 4: Improve Rule 4 by Defining Chain Lengths and Terminal Functional Groups**

- **Issue:** Syntax errors and improper chain length definitions leading to incorrect matches.
- **Improvement:** Correct repetition syntax and ensure terminal positioning of amino or hydroxyl groups.
  - **Updated Patterns:**
    ```python
    'short_chain_with_terminal_polar': '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][NX3H2,OX2H1]'
    'long_chain_with_terminal_polar': '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CH2]{5,}[NX3H2,OX2H1]'
    ```

**Suggestion 5: Refine Rule 5 to Distinguish Polyhydroxy Carboxylic Acids**

- **Issue:** The pattern may not match compounds with varying hydroxyl group numbers and may incorrectly exclude certain compounds.
- **Improvement:** Use recursive SMARTS to match multiple aliphatic hydroxyl groups and exclude aromatic hydroxyls.
  - **Updated Patterns:**
    ```python
    'polyhydroxy_aliphatic_acid': '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][C;!R]([OX2H])[C;!R]([OX2H])[C;!R]([OX2H])'
    'aromatic_hydroxyl': '[c][OX2H]'
    ```

**Suggestion 6: Clarify Rule 6 for Medium-Length Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids**

- **Issue:** The pattern is hardcoded for 6-carbon chains, not covering the specified range.
- **Improvement:** Generalize the pattern to include chains of 6 to 8 carbons.
  - **Updated Pattern:**
    ```python
    'medium_aliphatic_carboxylic_acid': '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CH2]{4,6}[CH3]'
    ```

**Suggestion 7: Enhance Rule 7 for Para-Substituted Aliphatic Chains with Coordinating Groups**

- **Issue:** Difficulty in distinguishing substituents connected via aliphatic chains.
- **Improvement:** Define patterns specifying aliphatic chain connection to coordinating groups.
  - **Updated Patterns:**
    ```python
    'para_substituted_aromatic_with_aliphatic_polar': 'c1ccc(cc1C(=O)O)CC[NX3H2,OX2H1]'
    'para_substituted_aromatic_direct_polar': 'c1ccc([NX3H2,OX2H1])cc1C(=O)O'
    ```

**Suggestion 8: Correct Rule 8 for Amino Acids with Aromatic Side Chains Containing Heteroatoms**

- **Issue:** Incorrect identification of heteroatoms in side chains.
- **Improvement:** Use precise patterns to capture amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms.
  - **Updated Patterns:**
    ```python
    'amino_acid_with_aromatic_heteroatom_side_chain': '[NX3][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX2H1])[CX4][c][n,o,s]'
    'amino_acid_with_aromatic_side_chain_no_heteroatom': '[NX3][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX2H1])[CX4][c][c][c]'
    ```

**Suggestion 9: Expand Rule 9's Interfering Groups**

- **Issue:** Current patterns may miss other functional groups that interfere with metal coordination.
- **Improvement:** Broaden the pattern list to include groups like nitro and nitrile.
  - **Updated Patterns:**
    ```python
    'interfering_groups': ['[CX3H1=O]', '[CX3](=O)[#6]', '[CX3](=O)[NX3]', '[NX3](=O)=O', '[CX2]#N']
    ```

**Suggestion 10: Refine Rule 10 for Perfluorinated Chains**

- **Issue:** May not capture all perfluorinated chains.
- **Improvement:** Match any carbon with at least two fluorines.
  - **Updated Pattern:**
    ```python
    'perfluoroalkyl_chain': '[CX4]([F])([F])[F]'
    ```

**Suggestion 11: Update Rule 11 for Flexible Polyether Chains**

- **Issue:** Current pattern may miss polyethers of varying lengths.
- **Improvement:** Use recursive pattern to match polyethers.
  - **Updated Pattern:**
    ```python
    'polyether_chain': '[CX4][OX2][CX4]([OX2][CX4]){2,}'
    ```

**Suggestion 12: Enhance Rule 12 for Rigid Ring Structures**

- **Issue:** Pattern may be too specific and miss other effective structures.
- **Improvement:** Generalize the pattern to include various heterocycles.
  - **Updated Pattern:**
    ```python
    'rigid_ring_with_coordinating_groups': '[c]1[c,o,n,s][c,o,n,s][c]([CX3](=O)[OX2H1])[c,o,n,s][c,o,n,s]1'
    ```

**Suggestion 13: Implement Proper Logical Conditions in Rule Matching**

- **Issue:** Potential conflicts in rule assignments.
- **Improvement:** Use logical operators to enforce exclusivity where necessary.

**Suggestion 14: Validate SMARTS Patterns with Test Cases**

- **Improvement:** Create test SMILES strings for each rule to ensure correct pattern matching before applying them to the dataset.

**Suggestion 15: Use RDKit's Built-In Functionality**

- **Improvement:** Utilize RDKit functions for chain length calculations and substituent identification instead of relying solely on SMARTS patterns.

**3. Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

Based on the analysis, there is significant room for improvement in the current rules:

- **Low Train Support and Confidence:** Indicates that the current rules are too specific or not accurately capturing the key features influencing yield.
- **Decreased Validation Accuracy:** Suggests that the model is underfitting and not generalizing well, rather than overfitting.
- **SHAP Analysis Insights:** Highlight specific rules (particularly **Rule 5** and **Rule 10**) that contribute to misclassifications, indicating that refining these rules could enhance model performance.

**Conclusion:**

Further optimization of the current rules is possible and necessary to improve predictive performance without the risk of overfitting. By implementing the suggested improvements, we can increase both the applicability and accuracy of the rules, leading to a model that better captures the underlying chemistry influencing the reaction yield.

Final Metric Message:

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side-chain carboxylic acid groups** predict a **high yield**. The combination of the amino group and an additional carboxyl group enhances coordination with the metal center, stabilizing the catalyst.

   - *Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid), **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid).

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituents capable of metal coordination** (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl groups) predict a **high yield**. These substituents provide additional coordination sites for metal binding.

   - *Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.
   - Modifiers with para-substituents that do not enhance coordination (e.g., methyl) or contain groups that interfere with coordination (e.g., aldehyde) predict a **low yield** due to ineffective metal interaction.
     - *Examples*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**.

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **pyridine carboxylic acids** or have a pyridine ring directly connected to a carboxylic acid predict a **high yield**. The nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring acts as an additional coordination site, enhancing metal binding.

   - *Examples*: **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**.
   - If the pyridine ring is connected via another aromatic ring, steric hindrance reduces coordination efficiency, predicting a **low yield**.
     - *Example*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal amino or hydroxyl groups** predict yield based on chain length:
   - **High yield** for short chains (up to 5 carbons), where the polar group can coordinate effectively without steric hindrance.
     - *Examples*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**, **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
   - **Low yield** for longer chains (more than 5 carbons), where increased chain length leads to steric hindrance and reduced coordination efficiency.
     - *Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**, **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**.

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing **multiple hydroxyl groups (polyhydroxy carboxylic acids)** predict a **high yield**. The additional hydroxyl groups offer multiple coordination sites, enhancing metal binding and catalyst stabilization.

   - *Examples*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid), **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**.
   - Modifiers with hydroxyl groups **directly attached to aromatic rings** predict a **low yield** due to rigidity and potential steric hindrance affecting metal coordination.
     - *Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional polar functional groups** and of moderate chain length (6–8 carbons) predict a **high yield**. The unimpeded carboxylate group can coordinate effectively with the metal center.

   - *Example*: **octanoic acid**.
   - Absence of additional functional groups prevents interference with metal coordination.

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted aliphatic chains bearing coordinating groups** predict a **high yield**. The aliphatic linker provides flexibility, allowing the coordinating group to interact effectively with the metal center.

   - *Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.
   - Modifiers with coordinating groups **directly attached to the aromatic ring** predict a **low yield**, as rigidity may hinder effective coordination.
     - *Example*: **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**.

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms capable of metal coordination** predict a **high yield**. Heteroatoms like nitrogen in the side chain enhance metal binding.

   - *Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan).
   - Aromatic side chains **lacking heteroatoms** predict a **low yield**, due to fewer coordination sites.
     - *Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine).

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **functional groups that can interfere with metal coordination** (e.g., aldehyde, ketone, amide groups) predict a **low yield**. These groups may compete with or disrupt effective metal binding.

   - *Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**, **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**.

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **highly electronegative substituents** (e.g., perfluorinated chains) predict a **low yield**. Electron-withdrawing groups reduce electron density on coordinating atoms, hindering effective metal coordination.

    - *Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers with **flexible polyether chains** predict a **low yield**. The high flexibility and solvation of polyether chains reduce the likelihood of effective metal coordination.

    - *Example*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers containing **rigid ring structures with favorably positioned coordinating groups** predict a **high yield**. The rigidity and positioning facilitate effective metal binding.

    - *Example*: **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- ** Advice 1 **: **Update Rule 1's SMARTS Pattern for α-Amino Acids with Side-Chain Carboxylic Acid Groups**  
  The current pattern does not adequately ensure the presence of a side-chain carboxylic acid group. Modify the SMARTS pattern to explicitly require this group:
  ```python
  'alpha_amino_acid_with_side_chain_cooh': '[NX3][CX4H]([*])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CH2][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'
  ```
  This pattern ensures the amino acid has a side-chain with a carboxylic acid group, improving the accuracy of Rule 1.

- ** Advice 2 **: **Refine Rule 2's Pattern for Para-Substituted Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Coordinating Groups**  
  The current pattern may not specifically target para-substituents with coordinating groups. Update the SMARTS pattern:
  ```python
  'para_substituted_aromatic_coordinating': 'c1cc([CX3](=O)[OX2H1])cc([NX3H2,NX4+,OX2H1,OX1-,S,O-,Br,I,Cl,F])c1'
  ```
  This pattern matches aromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating substituents in the para position, enhancing Rule 2's specificity.

- ** Advice 3 **: **Adjust Rule 3's Patterns to Differentiate Pyridine Carboxylic Acids**  
  Use specific SMARTS patterns to distinguish between pyridine carboxylic acids and those connected via another aromatic ring:
  ```python
  'pyridine_carboxylic_acid': 'n1ccccc1C(=O)O'
  'pyridine_via_aromatic_ring': 'n1cccc(c1)c2ccccc2C(=O)O'
  ```
  This refinement improves Rule 3's ability to predict yields based on the positioning of the pyridine ring.

- ** Advice 4 **: **Improve Rule 4 by Correctly Defining Chain Lengths and Terminal Functional Groups**  
  Ensure proper chain length definitions and correct any syntax errors:
  ```python
  'short_chain_with_terminal_polar': '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CH2]{2,4}[NX3H2,OX2H1]'
  'long_chain_with_terminal_polar': '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CH2]{5,}[NX3H2,OX2H1]'
  ```
  This adjustment provides accurate matching for aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal amino or hydroxyl groups in Rule 4.

- ** Advice 5 **: **Refine Rule 5 to Distinguish Polyhydroxy Carboxylic Acids**  
  Use recursive SMARTS to match multiple aliphatic hydroxyl groups and exclude aromatic hydroxyls:
  ```python
  'polyhydroxy_aliphatic_acid': '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][C;!R]([OX2H])[C;!R]([OX2H])[C;!R]([OX2H])'
  ```
  This pattern ensures Rule 5 accurately predicts high yields for modifiers with multiple aliphatic hydroxyl groups.

- ** Advice 6 **: **Clarify Rule 6 for Medium-Length Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids**  
  Generalize the pattern to include chains of 6 to 8 carbons:
  ```python
  'medium_aliphatic_carboxylic_acid': '[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CH2]{4,6}[CH3]'
  ```
  This improvement increases the coverage of Rule 6 for appropriate chain lengths.

- ** Advice 7 **: **Enhance Rule 7 for Para-Substituted Aromatic Chains with Coordinating Groups via Aliphatic Linkers**  
  Define patterns that specify an aliphatic linker between the aromatic ring and the coordinating group:
  ```python
  'para_substituted_aromatic_with_aliphatic_polar': 'c1cc([CX3](=O)[OX2H1])ccc1CC[NX3H2,OX2H1]'
  ```
  This enhancement allows Rule 7 to accurately predict high yields for modifiers with flexible aliphatic linkers.

- ** Advice 8 **: **Correct Rule 8's Patterns for Amino Acids with Aromatic Side Chains Containing Heteroatoms**  
  Use precise patterns to capture these amino acids:
  ```python
  'amino_acid_with_aromatic_heteroatom_side_chain': '[NX3][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX2H1])[CX4][CX4][c][n,o,s]'
  'amino_acid_with_aromatic_side_chain_no_heteroatom': '[NX3][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX2H1])[CX4][CX4][c][c][c]'
  ```
  This correction improves Rule 8's specificity and prediction accuracy.

- ** Advice 9 **: **Expand Rule 9 to Include Additional Interfering Functional Groups**  
  Broaden the list of interfering groups in the SMARTS patterns:
  ```python
  'interfering_groups': ['[CX3H1=O]', '[CX3](=O)[#6]', '[CX3](=O)[NX3]', '[NX3](=O)=O', '[CX2]#N', '[SX4](=O)(=O)[O-]']
  ```
  By including groups like nitro and nitrile, Rule 9 more effectively predicts low yields due to coordination interference.

- ** Advice 10 **: **Refine Rule 10 for Perfluorinated Chains**  
  Modify the pattern to capture any carbon with at least two fluorines:
  ```python
  'perfluoroalkyl_chain': '[CX4]([F])([F])[F,Cl,Br,I,F]'
  ```
  This refinement ensures Rule 10 accurately identifies modifiers with electron-withdrawing perfluorinated chains.

- ** Advice 11 **: **Update Rule 11 for Flexible Polyether Chains**  
  Use recursive patterns to match polyether chains of varying lengths:
  ```python
  'polyether_chain': '[CX4][OX2][CX4]([OX2][CX4]){1,}'
  ```
  This update allows Rule 11 to correctly identify modifiers with flexible polyether chains.

- ** Advice 12 **: **Enhance Rule 12 for Rigid Ring Structures with Coordinating Groups**  
  Generalize the pattern to include various heterocycles:
  ```python
  'rigid_ring_with_coordinating_groups': '[cR]1[cR][o,n,s][cR]([CX3](=O)[OX2H1])[cR][cR]1'
  ```
  This enhancement broadens Rule 12 to cover more structures that favor high yields.

- ** Advice 13 **: **Implement Proper Logical Conditions in Rule Matching**  
  Use logical operators to enforce exclusivity and prevent conflicts in rule assignments. For example:
  - If a modifier matches Rule 1, exclude it from matching Rule 9 by adding conditions.
  - Implement decision trees or precedence rules to resolve overlaps.

- ** Advice 14 **: **Validate SMARTS Patterns with Test Cases Before Application**  
  Create test SMILES strings for each rule to ensure accurate pattern matching:
  - For Rule 1: Test with aspartic acid and glutamic acid SMILES.
  - For Rule 5: Test with gluconic acid and exclude aromatic hydroxyls.

- ** Advice 15 **: **Utilize RDKit's Built-In Functionality for Enhanced Analysis**  
  Use RDKit functions to complement SMARTS patterns:
  - Use `Chem.GetDistanceMatrix()` to calculate chain lengths.
  - Use `Chem.FindSubstructureMatches()` for substructure identification.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side-chain carboxylic acid groups** predict a **high yield**. The presence of both an amino group and additional carboxyl groups enhances metal coordination due to multiple binding sites.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid), **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid).
   - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine), lacking additional carboxyl groups, predicts a **low yield**.

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituents capable of metal coordination**, such as amino, nitro, or bromomethyl groups, predict a **high yield**. These substituents provide additional coordination sites and enhance electron delocalization.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Modifiers with para-substituents that are electron-donating or interfere with coordination, like methyl or formyl groups, predict a **low yield**.
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**.

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a **pyridine ring directly attached to a carboxylic acid group** predict a **high yield**. The nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring offers an additional coordination site, enhancing metal binding.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Example*: If the pyridine ring is connected via another aromatic ring, as in **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**, steric hindrance reduces coordination efficiency, predicting a **low yield**.

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal amino groups and chain lengths of five carbons or fewer** predict a **high yield**. Short chains allow effective coordination without significant steric hindrance.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**, **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Modifiers with longer chains (more than five carbons), such as **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**, predict a **low yield** due to decreased coordination efficiency.

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids** predict a **high yield**. Multiple hydroxyl groups increase the number of coordination sites and enhance metal complex stability.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid), **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Example*: Modifiers with hydroxyl groups directly attached to aromatic rings, like **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**, predict a **low yield** due to reduced flexibility for coordination.

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aliphatic side chains bearing coordinating groups** predict a **high yield**. The aliphatic linker provides flexibility, allowing effective metal coordination.

   - *High Yield Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Example*: If coordinating groups are directly attached to rigid aromatic rings, as in **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**, steric hindrance predicts a **low yield**.

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms capable of metal coordination** predict a **high yield**. Heteroatoms like nitrogen enhance metal binding.

   - *High Yield Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan).
   - *Low Yield Example*: Amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms, such as **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine), predict a **low yield**.

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **aldehyde, ketone, or amide groups adjacent to carboxylic acid groups** predict a **low yield**. These groups can compete with or disrupt metal coordination.

   - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**, **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**.

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **highly electronegative substituents**, such as perfluorinated chains, predict a **low yield**. Electron-withdrawing groups reduce electron density on coordinating atoms, hindering metal interaction.

   - *Low Yield Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **flexible polyether chains** predict a **low yield**. The solvation and flexibility of polyether chains decrease the likelihood of effective metal coordination.

    - *Low Yield Example*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids of moderate chain length (six to eight carbons) without additional functional groups** predict a **high yield**. The unimpeded carboxylate group can coordinate effectively with the metal center.

    - *High Yield Example*: **octanoic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Example*: Modifiers with additional polar groups that may cause steric hindrance, such as **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, predict a **low yield**.

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **rigid cyclic structures containing appropriately positioned coordinating groups** predict a **high yield**. Rigid structures can facilitate precise metal binding.

    - *High Yield Examples*: **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**, **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Example*: Rigid structures with interfering groups predict a **low yield**.

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers containing **sulfur-containing groups** such as thiols predict yield based on the position of the sulfur atom:

    - **High Yield** when the sulfur is in a position favoring coordination.
      - *Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
    - **Low Yield** when the sulfur is part of a group that may hinder coordination.
      - *Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (steric hindrance from the aromatic ring).

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **peptides or amino acids with bulky side chains or amide bonds** near the coordinating sites predict a **low yield**. Steric hindrance and competing interactions reduce metal coordination efficiency.

    - *Low Yield Examples*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**, **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**.

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers with **electron-rich aromatic rings bearing methoxy groups** predict a **high yield**. Methoxy groups enhance electron density and coordination ability.

    - *High Yield Example*: **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Example*: If the methoxy groups are absent or replaced with groups that reduce electron density, the yield is predicted to be **low**.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with side-chain carboxylic acid groups** predict a **high yield**. The presence of both an amino group and additional carboxyl groups enhances metal coordination due to multiple binding sites.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid), **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid).
   - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine), lacking additional carboxyl groups, predicts a **low yield**.

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituents capable of metal coordination**, such as amino, nitro, or bromomethyl groups, predict a **high yield**. These substituents provide additional coordination sites and enhance electron delocalization.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Modifiers with para-substituents that are electron-donating or interfere with coordination, like methyl or formyl groups, predict a **low yield**.
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**.

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers containing a **pyridine ring directly attached to a carboxylic acid group** predict a **high yield**. The nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring offers an additional coordination site, enhancing metal binding.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Example*: If the pyridine ring is connected via another aromatic ring, as in **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**, steric hindrance reduces coordination efficiency, predicting a **low yield**.

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal amino groups and chain lengths of five carbons or fewer** predict a **high yield**. Short chains allow effective coordination without significant steric hindrance.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**, **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Modifiers with longer chains (more than five carbons), such as **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**, predict a **low yield** due to decreased coordination efficiency.

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids** predict a **high yield**. Multiple hydroxyl groups increase the number of coordination sites and enhance metal complex stability.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid), **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Example*: Modifiers with hydroxyl groups directly attached to aromatic rings, like **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**, predict a **low yield** due to reduced flexibility for coordination.

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aliphatic side chains bearing coordinating groups** predict a **high yield**. The aliphatic linker provides flexibility, allowing effective metal coordination.

   - *High Yield Example*: **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Example*: If coordinating groups are directly attached to rigid aromatic rings, as in **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**, steric hindrance predicts a **low yield**.

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with aromatic side chains containing heteroatoms capable of metal coordination** predict a **high yield**. Heteroatoms like nitrogen enhance metal binding.

   - *High Yield Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan).
   - *Low Yield Example*: Amino acids with aromatic side chains lacking heteroatoms, such as **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine), predict a **low yield**.

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **aldehyde, ketone, or amide groups adjacent to carboxylic acid groups** predict a **low yield**. These groups can compete with or disrupt metal coordination.

   - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**, **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**.

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **highly electronegative substituents**, such as perfluorinated chains, predict a **low yield**. Electron-withdrawing groups reduce electron density on coordinating atoms, hindering metal interaction.

   - *Low Yield Example*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**.

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **flexible polyether chains** predict a **low yield**. The solvation and flexibility of polyether chains decrease the likelihood of effective metal coordination.

    - *Low Yield Example*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids of moderate chain length (six to eight carbons) without additional functional groups** predict a **high yield**. The unimpeded carboxylate group can coordinate effectively with the metal center.

    - *High Yield Example*: **octanoic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Example*: Modifiers with additional polar groups that may cause steric hindrance, such as **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, predict a **low yield**.

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **rigid cyclic structures containing appropriately positioned coordinating groups** predict a **high yield**. Rigid structures can facilitate precise metal binding.

    - *High Yield Examples*: **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**, **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Example*: Rigid structures with interfering groups predict a **low yield**.

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers containing **sulfur-containing groups** such as thiols predict yield based on the position of the sulfur atom:

    - **High Yield** when the sulfur is in a position favoring coordination.
      - *Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
    - **Low Yield** when the sulfur is part of a group that may hinder coordination.
      - *Example*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (steric hindrance from the aromatic ring).

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **peptides or amino acids with bulky side chains or amide bonds** near the coordinating sites predict a **low yield**. Steric hindrance and competing interactions reduce metal coordination efficiency.

    - *Low Yield Examples*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**, **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**.

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers with **electron-rich aromatic rings bearing methoxy groups** predict a **high yield**. Methoxy groups enhance electron density and coordination ability.

    - *High Yield Example*: **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Example*: If the methoxy groups are absent or replaced with groups that reduce electron density, the yield is predicted to be **low**.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: Adjust the `count_threshold` implementation in the code for **Rule 1**. Currently, `count_threshold` uses the SMARTS pattern string as the key, but due to the compilation of SMARTS patterns into RDKit Mol objects, the pattern matching may not correspond correctly. Modify the code to ensure that the `count_threshold` keys match the compiled pattern or use a consistent identifier to track patterns through compilation and matching. This will help accurately count the additional carboxylic acid groups, ensuring that α-amino acids with side-chain carboxylic acid groups are correctly identified.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Review and correct the SMARTS patterns for **Rule 2**, specifically for `para_substituent_amino`, `para_substituent_nitro`, and `para_substituent_bromomethyl`. The current patterns may not correctly represent para-substituted groups. Adjust the patterns to explicitly match substituents at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid group on an aromatic ring. For example, use more precise ring and atom numbering to ensure correct positional matching.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For **Rule 2**, consider combining the substituents capable of metal coordination into a single, more general SMARTS pattern. Alternatively, use logical OR operations within a single SMARTS pattern to capture all relevant para-substituents, reducing redundancy and potential mismatches.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Modify the SMARTS pattern for `alpha_amino_acid` in **Rule 1**. The current pattern may be too restrictive or not accurately represent all α-amino acids. Ensure that the pattern accounts for the central α-carbon attached to an amino group, a hydrogen, any side chain (R group), and a carboxylic acid. This may involve using more general wildcard atoms or adjusting bond specifications to capture all valid α-amino acids.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: Implement a mapping between SMARTS pattern strings and their compiled RDKit Mol objects to ensure consistency when using them as keys in dictionaries like `count_threshold`. This can prevent mismatches and ensure accurate pattern matching and counting throughout the code.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: For **Rule 8**, verify that the patterns for `aldehyde_adjacent_to_carboxylic_acid`, `ketone_adjacent_to_carboxylic_acid`, and `amide_adjacent_to_carboxylic_acid` correctly match molecules containing these functional groups adjacent to carboxylic acids. Adjust the patterns if they are too general or not specific enough to match the intended structures.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: Enhance the matching logic to handle overlapping substructures appropriately. In cases where multiple patterns may match the same atoms (e.g., the carboxylic acid group in both `alpha_amino_acid` and `additional_carboxylic_acid`), ensure that counts and matches are correctly calculated without double-counting or missing critical matches.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Add explicit checks for chiral centers and stereochemistry where relevant, such as in **Rule 1** with α-amino acids. Including stereochemical specifications in the SMARTS patterns can improve the accuracy of matching chiral molecules, which is important in amino acids.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: Increase the number of test cases for each rule, including both positive and negative examples. This will help validate the effectiveness of the SMARTS patterns and matching logic, allowing for iterative improvement of the code based on observed mismatches.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Provide detailed comments and documentation within the code for each SMARTS pattern and rule implementation. This will make it easier to understand the intended matching logic and facilitate collaboration and troubleshooting among team members.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Simplify the Rules with Quantifiable Features**  
  Redefine the rules using clear, quantifiable molecular features that can be easily extracted from SMILES strings or molecular structures. For instance, instead of describing modifiers qualitatively (e.g., "Modifiers containing sulfur in a position favoring coordination"), specify features like "Modifiers with a sulfur atom within three bonds of a carboxylic acid group."

- **Advice 2**: **Utilize Standardized Molecular Descriptors**  
  Incorporate standardized molecular descriptors and physicochemical properties that are computationally accessible. Utilize cheminformatics tools to calculate descriptors such as:
  - Total number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors
  - Topological polar surface area (TPSA)
  - Molecular weight
  - LogP (octanol-water partition coefficient)
  - Number of rotatable bonds
  These numerical values can be directly used to generate a feature matrix for modeling.

- **Advice 3**: **Consolidate Overlapping Rules**  
  Identify and merge rules that share common structural features to reduce complexity and redundancy. For example, combine rules related to aromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating para-substituents into a single rule that accounts for any substituent capable of metal coordination at the para position.

- **Advice 4**: **Define Numerical Thresholds for Key Features**  
  Establish numerical thresholds or ranges for important molecular features based on statistical analysis of the dataset. For example:
  - "Modifiers with TPSA > 75 Å² predict a high yield."
  - "Modifiers with a molecular weight between 100 and 200 g/mol predict a high yield."
  - "Modifiers with more than two carboxylic acid groups predict a high yield."

- **Advice 5**: **Implement a Feature Matrix Based on Structural Counts**  
  Create a feature matrix where each modifier is represented by counts of specific functional groups and structural elements, such as:
  - Number of carboxylic acid groups
  - Number of amino groups
  - Number of hydroxyl groups
  - Presence (1) or absence (0) of sulfur atoms
  - Chain length (number of carbon atoms)
  - Ring count and type (aromatic vs. aliphatic)

- **Advice 6**: **Use Molecular Fingerprints for Representation**  
  Represent modifiers using molecular fingerprints (e.g., ECFP4, MACCS keys), which provide a binary vector encoding the presence or absence of substructures. This facilitates machine learning models to learn patterns directly from molecular structures without relying solely on predefined rules.

- **Advice 7**: **Automate Feature Extraction with Cheminformatics Tools**  
  Employ cheminformatics libraries like RDKit to automate the extraction of molecular features from SMILES strings. This ensures consistency and reduces manual errors in feature generation, making it easier to scale up with more data.

- **Advice 8**: **Revise Rules to Be More Computationally Friendly**  
  Rewrite the rules to focus on features that are directly computable. For example:
  - Original Rule: "Modifiers with bulky side chains near coordinating sites predict a low yield."
  - Revised Rule: "Modifiers with a steric hindrance parameter (e.g., molar refractivity) above a certain threshold predict a low yield."

- **Advice 9**: **Incorporate Electronic Effects Numerically**  
  Quantify electronic effects using Hammett sigma constants or similar parameters for substituents on aromatic rings. This allows for numerical representation of electron-donating or -withdrawing properties influencing the yield.

- **Advice 10**: **Perform Statistical Analysis to Refine Rules**  
  Use statistical methods, such as regression analysis or decision trees, to identify which molecular features significantly impact yield. Adjust the rules to prioritize these features, improving their predictive power.

- **Advice 11**: **Provide Clear Guidelines for Rule Exceptions**  
  Acknowledge and specify any exceptions within the rules to account for outliers in the dataset. This helps prevent incorrect predictions and improves the robustness of the rules.

- **Advice 12**: **Prioritize Rules Based on Predictive Strength**  
  Rank the rules according to their statistical significance and predictive accuracy. Focus efforts on refining the most impactful rules to optimize the overall prediction model.

- **Advice 13**: **Enhance Rules with Machine Learning Insights**  
  Integrate insights from machine learning models back into the rules. Features identified as important by models like random forests can be incorporated into the rules for better alignment between empirical data and rule-based predictions.

**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Quantify Rule Descriptors**  
  Revise the current rules to include quantifiable descriptors that can be directly extracted from SMILES strings. For instance, specify the exact number of coordinating groups (e.g., number of carboxylic acid groups, amino groups, hydroxyl groups) and their positions relative to the main functional group. This will facilitate the creation of a numerical feature matrix.

- **Advice 2**: **Standardize Functional Group Definitions**  
  Define functional groups using standard chemical definitions that can be programmatically identified. For example, instead of stating "side chains containing heteroatoms capable of metal coordination," specify the presence of functional groups like amines, carboxylates, or thiols, which can be counted and used as numerical features.

- **Advice 3**: **Incorporate Molecular Properties**  
  Include molecular properties such as molecular weight, LogP (octanol-water partition coefficient), topological polar surface area (TPSA), and the number of rotatable bonds in the rules. These properties are easily calculable from SMILES strings and can provide numerical data for modeling.

- **Advice 4**: **Use Structural Alerts and Fingerprints**  
  Implement structural alerts or molecular fingerprints (e.g., MACCS keys, Morgan fingerprints) to represent the presence of specific substructures numerically. This allows for the conversion of structural information into binary or count-based features in the feature matrix.

- **Advice 5**: **Classify Electron-Withdrawing and Donating Groups Numerically**  
  Assign numerical values to electron-withdrawing or electron-donating effects using Hammett sigma constants or other inductive effect scales. This quantifies the electronic influence of substituents and aids in numerical modeling.

- **Advice 6**: **Simplify and Merge Similar Rules**  
  Analyze the existing rules for overlap and redundancy. Combine similar rules and focus on key descriptors that have the most significant impact on yield. This simplification will reduce complexity and make it easier to generate numerical features.

- **Advice 7**: **Define Spatial or Steric Parameters**  
  Incorporate parameters that represent steric effects, such as Van der Waals volume or steric hindrance indices. Quantifying steric bulk can help model the influence of bulky groups on coordination efficiency.

- **Advice 8**: **Utilize Chemoinformatics Software**  
  Leverage chemoinformatics tools and software to automate the extraction of numerical descriptors from SMILES strings. Tools like RDKit can calculate a wide range of molecular descriptors needed for the feature matrix.

- **Advice 9**: **Include Coordination Ability Indicators**  
  Quantify the coordination potential by counting the number of lone pair-bearing heteroatoms (N, O, S) that are not involved in resonance stabilization. This provides a numerical measure of the ligand's ability to coordinate with the metal center.

- **Advice 10**: **Revise Rules Based on Data Correlation**  
  Perform statistical analysis to identify which descriptors correlate most strongly with yield. Use this analysis to adjust the rules, focusing on descriptors with high predictive power, which can be numerically represented.

These properties can be calculated from SMILES strings and provide quantitative data for modeling and rule generation.

- **Advice 4**: **Quantify Electronic Effects Using Hammett Constants**  
  For aromatic compounds, assign Hammett sigma constants to substituents to quantify electron-withdrawing or electron-donating effects. This numerical representation allows for more precise rules regarding how electronic factors influence the yield.

- **Advice 5**: **Streamline and Consolidate Overlapping Rules**  
  Review the current rules for overlap and redundancy. Combine similar rules to reduce complexity. For instance, rules regarding electron-withdrawing groups (Rules 2 and 7) can be merged and expressed quantitatively based on the electronic properties of substituents.

- **Advice 6**: **Address Chain Length and Flexibility Numerically**  
  Instead of qualitative descriptions of chain length and flexibility, define clear numerical thresholds. Specify exact carbon chain lengths and calculate flexibility parameters like the number of rotatable bonds to include in the feature matrix.

- **Advice 7**: **Use Software Tools for Automated Descriptor Generation**  
  Leverage cheminformatics libraries such as RDKit to automate the extraction of molecular descriptors from SMILES strings. This ensures consistency and efficiency in generating the numerical data needed for rule development and modeling.

- **Advice 8**: **Apply Machine Learning for Rule Discovery**  
  Utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze the numerical feature matrix and identify patterns or correlations that may not be evident through manual rule creation. This data-driven approach can lead to the discovery of new, more predictive rules.

- **Advice 9**: **Introduce Scores or Indices for Coordination Potential**  
  Develop a coordination potential score based on the number and type of coordinating groups (e.g., carboxylic acids, amino, hydroxyl, thiol groups). Assign weights to each functional group based on their known coordinating strength with metal centers.

- **Advice 10**: **Consider Steric Factors Quantitatively**  
  Include steric descriptors such as molar refractivity or Sterimol parameters to account for steric hindrance effects. Quantifying steric bulk can improve the accuracy of predictions related to metal coordination efficiency.

- **Advice 11**: **Create a Hierarchical Rule Framework**  
  Organize the rules hierarchically, starting from broad classifiers to more specific ones. Begin with general features (e.g., presence of coordinating groups) and narrow down to specific structural motifs. This structure aids in systematic feature extraction and rule application.

- **Advice 12**: **Standardize Nomenclature and Terminology**  
  Ensure all functional groups and substituents are described using standard chemical nomenclature that aligns with computational chemistry conventions. This standardization facilitates programming and avoids ambiguity in rule interpretation.

- **Advice 13**: **Validate and Refine Rules with Cross-Validation**  
  Continuously test the rules against experimental data using statistical methods. Employ cross-validation techniques to assess the predictive power of the rules and adjust them based on performance metrics.

- **Advice 14**: **Document Assumptions and Limitations**  
  Clearly document any assumptions made during rule creation and acknowledge the limitations of the current dataset. This transparency allows for better understanding and future refinement of the rules.

- **Advice 15**: **Engage in Iterative Collaboration with Data Scientists**  
  Work closely with data scientists and chemoinformaticians to ensure that the rules are practically implementable in computational models. Their expertise can guide the adaptation of chemical knowledge into effective numerical representations.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with a para-substituted amino group** predict a **high yield**. The amino group at the para position enhances metal coordination through additional nitrogen coordination sites and increases electron density on the aromatic ring.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Aromatic carboxylic acids without a para-amino group or with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position, such as **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, predict a **low yield** due to decreased electron density and poorer metal coordination.

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal amino groups and a carbon chain length of five carbons or fewer** predict a **high yield**. The proximity of the amino and carboxyl groups facilitates chelation with metal centers.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**, **3-aminopropanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Modifiers with longer carbon chains, such as **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**, predict a **low yield** due to decreased chelation efficiency caused by increased chain flexibility.

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids** predict a **high yield**. Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous coordination sites for metal binding, enhancing catalyst stability and performance.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid), **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Monohydroxy or non-hydroxy carboxylic acids like **octanoic acid** predict a **low yield** due to fewer coordination sites.

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position**, such as hydroxyl or methoxy groups, predict a **high yield**. EDGs increase electron density, facilitating stronger metal coordination.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**, **4-methoxybenzoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Aromatic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position, such as **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, predict a **low yield**.

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with heteroatoms in the ring**, such as pyridine derivatives, predict a **high yield**. The heteroatoms provide additional coordination sites and enhance binding with metal centers.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Aromatic carboxylic acids without ring heteroatoms, like **benzoic acid**, predict a **low yield**.

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with adjacent carboxyl groups**, such as succinic acid, predict a **high yield**. The two carboxyl groups can chelate to the metal center effectively.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid), **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid).
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Monocarboxylic acids like **pentanoic acid** predict a **low yield** due to fewer coordination sites.

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**. Thiol groups act as strong ligands, enhancing metal coordination.

   - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Thiol-containing acids with thiol groups further from the carboxyl group or with steric hindrance predict a **low yield**.

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers with **bulky or sterically hindered groups near coordinating sites** predict a **low yield**. Steric hindrance impedes effective coordination with the metal center.

   - *Low Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine), **4-tert-butylbenzoic acid**.
   - *High Yield Examples*: Modifiers without bulky groups near coordination sites, such as **benzoic acid**, may predict a **high yield** if they meet other criteria.

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups located beta to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**. The beta-hydroxyl facilitates chelation by forming stable five-membered chelate rings.

   - *High Yield Example*: **3-hydroxypropanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Acids without beta-hydroxyl groups or with hydroxyls further away from the carboxyl group predict a **low yield**.

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing **fluorinated alkyl chains** predict a **low yield**. Fluorine's strong electronegativity withdraws electron density, reducing the ability of coordinating atoms to bind metals effectively.

    - *Low Yield Examples*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**, **trifluoroacetic acid**.
    - *High Yield Examples*: Non-fluorinated analogs like **pentanoic acid** predict a **high yield** if they meet other criteria.

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with ortho-dihydroxy groups** (catechols) predict a **high yield**. The two hydroxyl groups can form strong chelating interactions with metal centers.

    - *High Yield Examples*: **2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Examples*: Monohydroxybenzoic acids or those without ortho-dihydroxy groups predict a **low yield**.

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **additional coordinating functional groups such as carbonyls, amides, or imines adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**. These groups can participate in metal binding, enhancing complex stability.

    - *High Yield Examples*: **2-oxoacetic acid**, **glyoxylic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Examples*: Acids lacking adjacent coordinating groups predict a **low yield**.

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with side chains capable of metal coordination**, such as carboxylate, hydroxyl, or thiol groups, predict a **high yield**. Side chains enhance metal binding through additional coordination sites.

    - *High Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid), **(2S)-2-amino-3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Cysteine).
    - *Low Yield Examples*: Amino acids with non-coordinating side chains, like **(2S)-2-amino-4-methylpentanoic acid** (Leucine), predict a **low yield**.

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers with **strong electron-withdrawing groups directly attached to the carboxylate-bearing carbon** predict a **low yield**. These groups decrease the nucleophilicity of coordinating atoms, hindering metal binding.

    - *Low Yield Examples*: **Trichloroacetic acid**, **cyanoacetic acid**.
    - *High Yield Examples*: Acids without such electron-withdrawing groups or with electron-donating groups predict a **high yield** if other criteria are met.

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **macrocyclic or polycyclic aromatic compounds with multiple heteroatoms** predict a **high yield** due to the formation of stable chelate complexes with metals.

    - *High Yield Examples*: **1,10-phenanthroline-2-carboxylic acid**, **dipyridylamine derivatives**.
    - *Low Yield Examples*: Non-cyclic or monocyclic compounds lacking multiple heteroatoms predict a **low yield**.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Revise Rule 1** to account for aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) that can still predict a high yield. For example, **4-nitrobenzoic acid** has a para-nitro group (an EWG) yet shows high yield in the dataset. Modify the rule to focus on substituents that enhance metal coordination through increased acidity or additional coordination sites, regardless of their electron-withdrawing or donating nature. The revised rule could state that **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituents that enhance metal binding through increased acidity or additional coordination sites predict a high yield**.

- **Advice 2**: **Adjust Rule 4** to reflect that not all electron-withdrawing groups at the para position predict a low yield. Recognize that certain EWGs, such as nitro groups, may increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, facilitating metal coordination and leading to a high yield. Modify the rule to specify which EWGs enhance metal binding due to their effect on acidity and which ones hinder it due to electron withdrawal from coordinating atoms.

- **Advice 3**: **Modify Rule 3** to account for aliphatic carboxylic acids like **octanoic acid**, which show a high yield despite lacking multiple hydroxyl groups. Recognize that **medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups** can effectively coordinate with metal centers due to the unimpeded carboxylate group. Either adjust Rule 3 or create a new rule to reflect that **simple aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium chain lengths predict a high yield**.

- **Advice 4**: **Reassess Rules with Limited Data Support**, such as Rules 9, 11, 12, and 14. Due to insufficient data points supporting these rules, consider refining them to be more general or temporarily removing them until more data is available. Focus on rules that are strongly supported by multiple data points to ensure reliability and accuracy in predictions.

- **Advice 5**: **Incorporate Flexibility in Functional Group Effects** across the rules. Rather than categorizing substituents strictly as electron-donating or electron-withdrawing, consider the overall effect on metal coordination, including factors like increased acidity, additional coordination sites, and the ability to facilitate chelation. This holistic approach will improve the predictive power of the rules by accounting for exceptions observed in the dataset.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with a para-substituted amino group** predict a **high yield**. The amino group at the para position enhances metal coordination through additional nitrogen coordination sites and increases electron density on the aromatic ring.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Aromatic carboxylic acids without a para-amino group or with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position, such as **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, predict a **low yield** due to decreased electron density and poorer metal coordination.

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal amino groups and a carbon chain length of five carbons or fewer** predict a **high yield**. The proximity of the amino and carboxyl groups facilitates chelation with metal centers.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**, **3-aminopropanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Modifiers with longer carbon chains, such as **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**, predict a **low yield** due to decreased chelation efficiency caused by increased chain flexibility.

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids** predict a **high yield**. Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous coordination sites for metal binding, enhancing catalyst stability and performance.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid), **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Monohydroxy or non-hydroxy carboxylic acids like **octanoic acid** predict a **low yield** due to fewer coordination sites.

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position**, such as hydroxyl or methoxy groups, predict a **high yield**. EDGs increase electron density, facilitating stronger metal coordination.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**, **4-methoxybenzoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Aromatic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position, such as **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, predict a **low yield**.

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with heteroatoms in the ring**, such as pyridine derivatives, predict a **high yield**. The heteroatoms provide additional coordination sites and enhance binding with metal centers.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Aromatic carboxylic acids without ring heteroatoms, like **benzoic acid**, predict a **low yield**.

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with adjacent carboxyl groups**, such as succinic acid, predict a **high yield**. The two carboxyl groups can chelate to the metal center effectively.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid), **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid).
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Monocarboxylic acids like **pentanoic acid** predict a **low yield** due to fewer coordination sites.

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**. Thiol groups act as strong ligands, enhancing metal coordination.

   - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Thiol-containing acids with thiol groups further from the carboxyl group or with steric hindrance predict a **low yield**.

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers with **bulky or sterically hindered groups near coordinating sites** predict a **low yield**. Steric hindrance impedes effective coordination with the metal center.

   - *Low Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine), **4-tert-butylbenzoic acid**.
   - *High Yield Examples*: Modifiers without bulky groups near coordination sites, such as **benzoic acid**, may predict a **high yield** if they meet other criteria.

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups located beta to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**. The beta-hydroxyl facilitates chelation by forming stable five-membered chelate rings.

   - *High Yield Example*: **3-hydroxypropanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Acids without beta-hydroxyl groups or with hydroxyls further away from the carboxyl group predict a **low yield**.

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing **fluorinated alkyl chains** predict a **low yield**. Fluorine's strong electronegativity withdraws electron density, reducing the ability of coordinating atoms to bind metals effectively.

    - *Low Yield Examples*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**, **trifluoroacetic acid**.
    - *High Yield Examples*: Non-fluorinated analogs like **pentanoic acid** predict a **high yield** if they meet other criteria.

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with ortho-dihydroxy groups** (catechols) predict a **high yield**. The two hydroxyl groups can form strong chelating interactions with metal centers.

    - *High Yield Examples*: **2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Examples*: Monohydroxybenzoic acids or those without ortho-dihydroxy groups predict a **low yield**.

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **additional coordinating functional groups such as carbonyls, amides, or imines adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**. These groups can participate in metal binding, enhancing complex stability.

    - *High Yield Examples*: **2-oxoacetic acid**, **glyoxylic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Examples*: Acids lacking adjacent coordinating groups predict a **low yield**.

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with side chains capable of metal coordination**, such as carboxylate, hydroxyl, or thiol groups, predict a **high yield**. Side chains enhance metal binding through additional coordination sites.

    - *High Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid), **(2S)-2-amino-3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Cysteine).
    - *Low Yield Examples*: Amino acids with non-coordinating side chains, like **(2S)-2-amino-4-methylpentanoic acid** (Leucine), predict a **low yield**.

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers with **strong electron-withdrawing groups directly attached to the carboxylate-bearing carbon** predict a **low yield**. These groups decrease the nucleophilicity of coordinating atoms, hindering metal binding.

    - *Low Yield Examples*: **Trichloroacetic acid**, **cyanoacetic acid**.
    - *High Yield Examples*: Acids without such electron-withdrawing groups or with electron-donating groups predict a **high yield** if other criteria are met.

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **macrocyclic or polycyclic aromatic compounds with multiple heteroatoms** predict a **high yield** due to the formation of stable chelate complexes with metals.

    - *High Yield Examples*: **1,10-phenanthroline-2-carboxylic acid**, **dipyridylamine derivatives**.
    - *Low Yield Examples*: Non-cyclic or monocyclic compounds lacking multiple heteroatoms predict a **low yield**.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Modify the SMARTS pattern for Rule 1 to accurately capture aromatic carboxylic acids with a para-substituted amino group.**

  - **Issue**: The current SMARTS pattern for Rule 1 (`'[c]1[c][c][c][NX3;H2,H1][c]1[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'`) does not match compounds like 4-aminobenzoic acid (`C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)N`). This is because the pattern incorrectly assumes the amino group is directly connected to the aromatic ring without considering branching or different atom ordering in SMILES.
  
  - **Suggestion**: Update the SMARTS pattern to more generally match an amino group at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid on an aromatic ring. Use recursive SMARTS or adjust the ring closure to ensure correct matching:
    - New Pattern: `c1ccc(N)cc1C(=O)O`
    - In the code: Replace `para_substituted_amino_group` with `c1ccc([NX3;H2,H1])cc1[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]`

- **Suggestion 2**: **Correct the implementation of Rule 2 to accurately identify aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal amino groups and carbon chain length of five carbons or fewer.**

  - **Issue**: The current pattern `'[NX3;H2][C;!R]{1,5}[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'` may not correctly exclude chains longer than five carbons and does not ensure the amino group is terminal.
  
  - **Suggestion**: Modify the pattern to enforce the terminal amino group and limit the carbon chain length:
    - New Pattern: `NCCCC[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]`
    - In the code: Use `'^N[C;!R]{0,4}[C;!R][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'` to specify a terminal amine connected to a chain of up to five carbons ending with a carboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Adjust the code for Rule 3 to correctly count multiple hydroxyl groups in polyhydroxy carboxylic acids.**

  - **Issue**: The current implementation uses separate patterns for carboxylic acid and hydroxyl group but does not properly count the number of hydroxyl groups. It may match molecules with only one hydroxyl group.
  
  - **Suggestion**: Implement a pattern that matches carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups and counts them:
    - New Pattern: Use the SMARTS `'[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'` for carboxylic acid and check that the molecule contains at least two hydroxyl groups using `'[OX2H]'`.
    - In the code: After matching the carboxylic acid, count hydroxyl groups using `mol.GetSubstructMatches(Chem.MolFromSmarts('[OX2H]'))` and ensure the count meets or exceeds `rule['min_hydroxyls']`.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Refine the SMARTS pattern for Rule 4 to correctly identify electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids.**

  - **Issue**: The current `edg` pattern in the code (`'[$([OX2H]),$([OX2][CH3]),$([NX3;H2,H1][#6])]'`) may not cover all relevant EDGs and may not ensure they are at the para position.
  
  - **Suggestion**: Expand the `edg` pattern to include other common EDGs such as alkyl groups and ensure the substitution is at the para position:
    - New Pattern: `c1cc([CX4])ccc1[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` for alkyl groups.
    - In the code: Update the pattern to `'[c]1[c][c][c][cX4,$(c[OX2H]),$(c[OX2][CH3]),$(c[NX3;H2,H1])][c]1[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'`.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Improve the SMARTS pattern for Rule 5 to accurately detect aromatic carboxylic acids with heteroatoms in the ring, including various heteroaromatic systems.**

  - **Issue**: The current pattern (`'[n,o,s]1cccc1[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'`) may miss heterocycles where the heteroatom position varies, such as pyridine derivatives like pyridine-3-carboxylic acid.
  
  - **Suggestion**: Generalize the pattern to account for different heteroatoms and their positions within the ring:
    - New Pattern: `'[n,o,s]1cccc([CX3](=O)[OX2H1])1'`
    - In the code: Use a pattern that matches any heteroaromatic ring with a carboxylic acid substituent, regardless of heteroatom position.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Enhance the pattern for Rule 8 to capture a broader range of bulky or sterically hindered groups near coordinating sites.**

  - **Issue**: The current pattern only checks for a tert-butyl group adjacent to a carboxylic acid (`'[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][C](C)(C)C'`) and may not detect other sterically hindering groups.
  
  - **Suggestion**: Expand the pattern to include various bulky groups near coordination sites:
    - New Pattern: `'[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][C;X4]([CX4])([CX4])[CX4]'` to represent any carbon attached to three other carbons.
    - In the code: Use the SMARTS pattern to detect quaternary carbons adjacent to the carboxyl group.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Review and correct the code logic for Rule 13 to ensure amino acids with coordinating side chains are properly identified.**

  - **Issue**: The pattern may not correctly associate side chains capable of metal coordination with the amino acid backbone.
  
  - **Suggestion**: Implement recursive SMARTS to match amino acids with coordinating functional groups in their side chains:
    - In the code: Create a pattern for the amino acid backbone (`'N[C@@H](C(=O)O)'`) and ensure that side chains contain at least one coordinating group by searching for substructures like hydroxyl (`'[OX2H]'`), thiol (`'[SX2H]'`), or carboxyl (`'[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'`) groups connected to the alpha carbon.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Refine the pattern for Rule 14 to accurately detect electron-withdrawing groups directly attached to the carboxylate-bearing carbon.**

  - **Issue**: The current pattern (`'[CX3](C)(C)[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'`) may not match all relevant compounds, such as trichloroacetic acid or cyanoacetic acid.
  
  - **Suggestion**: Adjust the pattern to include various strong EWGs:
    - New Pattern: `'[CX3]([Cl,F,Br,I,NX1]C)([Cl,F,Br,I,NX1])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'`
    - In the code: Use a SMARTS that matches carbons bearing strong electron-withdrawing substituents (halogens, nitriles) directly attached to the carboxylic carbon.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Add thorough validation and unit tests to ensure each rule correctly matches the intended SMILES structures.**

  - **Issue**: Without validation, mismatches between expected and actual rule applications may go unnoticed.
  
  - **Suggestion**: For each rule, create test cases with known compounds (both positives and negatives) to verify that the SMARTS patterns and code logic are working as intended. This helps detect issues early and ensures the feature matrix accurately reflects the rules.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Performance**

Based on the provided metrics, we'll analyze the performance of the current rules by comparing them to the reference metrics from previous iterations, focusing on **confidence** and **lift**.

---

### **1. Comparison of Confidence**

**Previous Train Confidence (Average):**

- From Reference Metrics:
  - 0.6352 and 0.5396
- **Average:** (0.6352 + 0.5396) / 2 = **0.5874**

**Current Train Confidence:**

- **0.5405**

**Observation:**

- **Decrease in Confidence:** The current train confidence is **0.5405**, which is slightly lower than the previous average of **0.5874**.
- **Interpretation:** Confidence represents the proportion of times the rule prediction is correct when the rule conditions are met. A decrease suggests that the rules are less accurate in predicting the outcome based on their conditions.

---

### **2. Comparison of Lift**

**Previous Train Lift (Average):**

- From Reference Metrics:
  - 1.2048 and 1.0559
- **Average:** (1.2048 + 1.0559) / 2 = **1.1304**

**Current Train Lift:**

- **1.0931**

**Observation:**

- **Decrease in Lift:** The current train lift is **1.0931**, down from the previous average of **1.1304**.
- **Interpretation:** Lift measures how much more likely the prediction is given the condition than without it. A decrease indicates that the rules are providing less additional predictive power compared to the baseline rate of the prediction.

---

### **3. Comparison of Support**

**Previous Train Support (Average):**

- From Reference Metrics:
  - 0.1667 and 0.1845
- **Average:** (0.1667 + 0.1845) / 2 = **0.1756**

**Current Train Support:**

- **0.1010**

**Observation:**

- **Decrease in Support:** The current train support is **0.1010**, lower than the previous average of **0.1756**.
- **Interpretation:** Support indicates how frequently the rule applies in the dataset. A lower support means the rules cover fewer instances, which may reduce their reliability.

---

### **4. Comparison of Leverage**

**Previous Train Leverage (Average):**

- From Reference Metrics:
  - 0.0289 and -0.0041
- **Average:** (0.0289 + (-0.0041)) / 2 = **0.0124**

**Current Train Leverage:**

- **0.0047**

**Observation:**

- **Decrease in Leverage:** The current train leverage is **0.0047**, which is lower than the previous average of **0.0124**.
- **Interpretation:** Leverage measures the difference between the observed rule support and the expected support if the items were independent. A decrease suggests that the association between the rule conditions and the predictions has weakened.

---

### **5. Determining if a Local Minimum Has Been Reached**

**Evidence of a Local Minimum:**

- **Consistent Decrease in Key Metrics:** The decreases in confidence, lift, support, and leverage suggest that the current set of rules is not improving the model's performance relative to previous iterations.
- **Plateauing Performance:** The marginal changes in the metrics over multiple iterations indicate that further adjustments to the current rules may not yield significant improvements.

**Conclusion:**

- **Possible Local Minimum:** The model may have reached a local minimum where current optimization methods are no longer enhancing performance significantly.

---

### **6. Adequacy of Iterations**

**Number of Iterations Conducted:**

- **Multiple Iteration Metrics Provided:** Several sets of metrics from different iterations indicate that extensive tuning has been performed.
- **Current Ruleset Size:** The development of **15 rules** suggests that a substantial effort has been made to capture the relevant patterns in the data.

**Conclusion:**

- **Sufficient Iterations Performed:** It's likely that enough iterations have been completed to assess the effectiveness of the current approach.

---

**Recommendations for Improving the Current Rules**

Based on the analysis, here are some suggestions for improving the current rules:

### **1. Reassess Rule Complexity**

- **Simplify Overly Complex Rules:**
  - Complex rules may have high confidence but low support.
  - Simplifying conditions can increase support while maintaining acceptable confidence levels.
- **Avoid Overfitting:**
  - Overly specific rules may capture noise rather than meaningful patterns.

### **2. Enhance Rule Diversity**

- **Introduce New Features:**
  - Incorporate additional chemical properties or descriptors that may influence yield.
  - Consider electronic, steric, and hydrophobic properties that weren't included before.
- **Balance Between Specificity and Generality:**
  - Aim for rules that are general enough to apply to a broader range of instances but specific enough to maintain predictive power.

### **3. Merge and Refine Similar Rules**

- **Identify Redundant Rules:**
  - Combine rules that predict the same outcome based on similar conditions.
- **Eliminate Conflicting Rules:**
  - Address rules that may contradict each other, as they can confuse the predictive model.

### **4. Utilize Statistical Validation**

- **Cross-Validation:**
  - Implement k-fold cross-validation to ensure that the rules generalize well to unseen data.
- **Statistical Significance Testing:**
  - Evaluate the p-values of the associations to ensure that the rules are statistically significant.

### **5. Incorporate Domain Expertise**

- **Consult Chemists or Material Scientists:**
  - Experts can provide insights into chemical interactions that are not apparent from data alone.
- **Validate Rules with Theoretical Knowledge:**
  - Ensure that the rules make sense chemically and are supported by scientific principles.

### **6. Focus on High-Impact Predictors**

- **Prioritize Features with Strong Associations:**
  - Identify which chemical groups or structural features have the most influence on yield.
- **Weighted Rules:**
  - Assign weights to rules based on their confidence and lift to prioritize more predictive rules.

### **7. Expand Data Coverage**

- **Increase Dataset Size:**
  - If possible, gather more data to improve support and the reliability of the rules.
- **Ensure Data Quality:**
  - Check for any inconsistencies or errors in the data that may affect the metrics.

### **8. Explore Alternative Modeling Techniques**

- **Machine Learning Models:**
  - Consider using machine learning algorithms like decision trees, random forests, or neural networks that can capture non-linear relationships.
- **Ensemble Methods:**
  - Combine different models to improve overall predictive performance.

### **9. Re-evaluate Metric Thresholds**

- **Adjust Confidence and Lift Thresholds:**
  - Setting higher thresholds may improve the quality of the rules but at the cost of support.
- **Optimize for the Desired Outcome:**
  - Decide whether it's more critical to have high confidence or to cover more cases (support), and adjust accordingly.

---

**Conclusion**

The current set of rules shows a slight decline in performance compared to previous iterations, as evidenced by the decreases in confidence and lift. This suggests that the existing approach has reached its limits and may require a different strategy to achieve better results.

**Next Steps:**

- **Implement the Recommendations:**
  - Begin by simplifying rules and incorporating domain expertise.
- **Monitor Metric Changes:**
  - Keep track of how adjustments affect the metrics to identify improvements.
- **Iterative Refinement:**
  - Continue refining the rules while being mindful of overfitting and diminishing returns.

By addressing these areas, it's possible to enhance the performance of the rules and potentially move beyond the current local minimum.

Traditional Commenter Message:
**Comments on the Accuracies of the Validation Set and Training Set:**

The current iteration of the classification model yielded a validation accuracy of **42.86%**, which is notably lower than the accuracies obtained in previous iterations and the reference data provided. Previous validation accuracies were consistently higher, often exceeding **60%**, with some iterations achieving up to **68.57%**. This decline in accuracy suggests that the current set of rules used to generate the feature matrix may not be effectively capturing the underlying patterns necessary for accurate predictions.

**Analysis Based on the SHAP Values Calculated on the Validation Set:**

The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis provides insights into how each rule contributes to the model's predictions. In the latest iteration, only **Rule 2** appears in the SHAP value outputs for all molecules, with varying SHAP values. The SHAP values for Rule 2 are both positive and negative, indicating that it contributes differently across molecules.

- **Molecules with Low Predicted Loading but High Experimental Loading:**
  - For molecules such as **C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N**, **C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O**, and **C1=CNC(=O)C=C1C(=O)O**, the predicted loading is low while the experimental loading is high.
  - **Rule 2** has a positive SHAP value (**+0.013975**) for these molecules, suggesting that it slightly contributes to predicting a high loading but not sufficiently to correct the misprediction.

- **Molecules with High Predicted Loading but Low Experimental Loading:**
  - For molecules like **C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O** and **C(CCCC(=O)O)CCCN**, the predicted loading is high while the experimental loading is low.
  - **Rule 2** has a negative SHAP value (e.g., **-0.064286**) for these molecules, indicating that it contributes to predicting a low loading, which aligns with the experimental value, but the overall prediction was still incorrect.

- **Molecules Consistently Misclassified:**
  - Some molecules, such as **C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N**, are consistently misclassified across iterations, suggesting that the rules may not adequately capture the features of these molecules.

The SHAP analysis indicates that **Rule 2** is not effectively distinguishing between high and low loading modifiers in certain cases. Its contribution is insufficient to sway the predictions towards the correct class, leading to misclassifications.

**Evaluation of Current Rules:**

1. **Effectiveness of Current Rules:**
   - The decrease in validation accuracy indicates that the current rules may not be effectively capturing the essential features required for accurate predictions.
   - Some rules may be redundant or conflicting, leading to confusion in the model's decision-making process.

2. **Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting:**
   - The consistent decline in validation accuracy suggests potential issues with underfitting, where the model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data.
   - The rules may not be sufficiently comprehensive or may lack the specificity needed to handle the chemical diversity of the modifiers.

3. **Discrepancies Identified Through SHAP Analysis:**
   - **Rule 2** shows both positive and negative SHAP values for incorrectly predicted molecules, indicating that it may not be a reliable predictor across different cases.
   - The molecules with the highest discrepancies are those where **Rule 2**'s contribution does not align with the correct prediction, signifying that this rule may need refinement.

4. **Interpretation of Accuracy Improvements:**
   - Since the accuracy has decreased in the current iteration, it suggests that the probability of improvement with the current set of rules is low.
   - Without modifications, the model may continue to perform poorly, highlighting the need for rule refinement.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis for Rule Improvement:**
   - The SHAP values point towards **Rule 2** as a significant factor in mispredictions.
   - The analysis suggests that **Rule 2** may be too broad or not accurately defined to distinguish between high and low loading modifiers effectively.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

1. **Refine Rule 2:**
   - **Current Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal amino groups and a carbon chain length of five carbons or fewer predict a high yield.*
   - **Issues Identified**:
     - The rule may be too general and not account for other structural factors that influence loading.
     - Molecules adhering to this rule are being misclassified, indicating that the presence of a terminal amino group and chain length alone is insufficient for accurate prediction.
   - **Suggested Refinement**:
     - Incorporate additional structural features into the rule, such as the presence of other functional groups, branching, or stereochemistry.
     - Specify any exceptions where certain substituents may alter the expected outcome despite meeting the chain length and amino group criteria.

2. **Consider Additional Rules or Modify Existing Ones:**
   - Analyze other rules that might be contributing negatively to the predictions, even if they were not highlighted in the SHAP values due to their absence (e.g., rules that never trigger).
   - Introduce new rules that address the shortcomings observed, such as rules that account for steric hindrance, electronic effects, or specific functional group interactions not currently covered.

3. **Enhance Rule Specificity and Generalization:**
   - Ensure that the rules are specific enough to capture key features but general enough to apply across different molecules.
   - Avoid overly broad rules that may include molecules with differing behaviors, leading to misclassifications.

4. **Incorporate Additional Molecular Descriptors:**
   - Utilize other molecular descriptors, such as electronic properties (e.g., pKa values, electron density), steric factors (e.g., molecular volume), and hydrophobicity (e.g., log P values), to enhance the feature matrix.
   - These descriptors can provide more nuanced insights into how different modifiers interact with the catalyst.

5. **Review and Validate Rules with Experimental Data:**
   - Cross-reference the rules with experimental observations to ensure they align with known chemical behavior.
   - Update the rules based on empirical evidence, focusing on modifiers that are consistently mispredicted.

6. **Address Overfitting/Underfitting:**
   - Consider simplifying or removing rules that are not contributing significantly to the model's performance.
   - Ensure that the model is neither too complex (overfitting) nor too simple (underfitting) by balancing the number and complexity of rules.

7. **Iterative Testing and Refinement:**
   - After modifying the rules, retrain the model and evaluate its performance using cross-validation to ensure that changes lead to improvements.
   - Use SHAP analysis in each iteration to monitor the impact of each rule and make data-driven adjustments.

**Conclusion:**

The current set of rules, particularly **Rule 2**, is not effectively capturing the necessary features to accurately predict the modifier loading on the catalyst. By refining **Rule 2**, incorporating additional molecular descriptors, and adjusting other rules based on SHAP analysis and experimental data, we can improve the model's performance. It is crucial to iteratively test these modifications, ensuring that the rules lead to better generalization and higher validation accuracy.

**Summary of Discussions and Recommendations for Optimizing Current Rules:**

The current set of rules used to predict the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction has been analyzed based on their performance metrics and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis.

**Observations:**

1. **Decline in Performance Metrics:**

   - **Confidence and Lift:** There has been a decrease in both the train confidence (from an average of 0.5874 to 0.5405) and the train lift (from an average of 1.1304 to 1.0931).
   - **Support and Leverage:** Train support has decreased from an average of 0.1756 to 0.1010, and train leverage has decreased from 0.0124 to 0.0047.
   - This indicates that the current rules are less effective in predicting high yield outcomes compared to previous iterations.

2. **Validation Accuracy:**

   - The current iteration shows a validation accuracy of 42.86%, which is lower than previous iterations that achieved accuracies exceeding 60%.

3. **SHAP Analysis:**

   - **Rule 2** appears frequently in the SHAP analysis but contributes inconsistently to the predictions.
   - The SHAP values indicate that Rule 2 is not effectively distinguishing between high and low yield modifiers, leading to misclassifications.

**Key Issues Identified:**

- **Rule Implementation Errors:** Some SMARTS patterns used in the rules might not accurately capture the intended molecular features, leading to incorrect matching.

- **Inadequate Rule Coverage:** Certain rules may be too general or too specific, failing to capture the diversity of molecular structures that influence yield.

- **Redundant or Conflicting Rules:** Some rules might overlap or contradict each other, reducing the overall predictive power of the model.

**Suggestions for Improving Current Rules:**

1. **Refine SMARTS Patterns for Accurate Matching:**

   - **Rule 1 (Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Para-Amino Groups):**

     - **Issue:** The current SMARTS pattern does not correctly identify compounds like 4-aminobenzoic acid due to atom ordering and branching in SMILES strings.
     - **Recommendation:** Update the SMARTS pattern to `c1ccc(N)cc1C(=O)O` to accurately match aromatic carboxylic acids with a para-substituted amino group.

   - **Rule 2 (Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids with Terminal Amino Groups):**

     - **Issue:** The current pattern may not enforce the terminal position of the amino group or limit the carbon chain length effectively.
     - **Recommendation:** Modify the pattern to `'^N[C;!R]{0,4}[C;!R][CX3](=O)O'` to specify a terminal amine connected to a chain of up to five carbons ending with a carboxylic acid.

   - **Rule 3 (Polyhydroxy Carboxylic Acids):**

     - **Issue:** The current implementation may match molecules with only one hydroxyl group.
     - **Recommendation:** Implement logic to count the number of hydroxyl groups and ensure that only molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups satisfy the rule.

   - **Rule 4 (Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with EDGs at Para Position):**

     - **Issue:** The pattern may not cover all relevant electron-donating groups and may not ensure they are located at the para position.
     - **Recommendation:** Expand the pattern to include other EDGs like alkyl groups and enforce para substitution, for example, using `c1cc([CX4])ccc1C(=O)O`.

   - **Rule 5 (Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Heteroatoms in the Ring):**

     - **Issue:** The pattern may not detect heterocycles where the heteroatom position varies.
     - **Recommendation:** Generalize the pattern to match any heteroaromatic ring with a carboxylic acid substituent, such as `'[n,o,s]1cccc([CX3](=O)O)1'`.

   - **Rule 8 (Bulky or Sterically Hindered Groups):**

     - **Issue:** Currently only tert-butyl groups are considered, missing other bulky groups.
     - **Recommendation:** Expand the pattern to detect any quaternary carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group, for example, `'[CX3](=O)O[C;X4]([C])([C])[C]'`.

   - **Rule 13 (Amino Acids with Coordinating Side Chains):**

     - **Issue:** The pattern may not correctly identify side chains capable of metal coordination.
     - **Recommendation:** Use recursive SMARTS patterns to match amino acids with side chains containing functional groups like hydroxyl, thiol, or additional carboxyl groups.

   - **Rule 14 (Electron-Withdrawing Groups Attached to Carboxylic Carbon):**

     - **Issue:** The pattern may not cover all relevant EWGs like halogens or nitriles.
     - **Recommendation:** Adjust the pattern to include strong EWGs directly attached to the carboxylic carbon, e.g., `'[CX3]([Cl,F,Br,I,N#C])[CX3](=O)O'`.

2. **Validate and Test Each Rule:**

   - Implement unit tests for each rule using known positive and negative examples to ensure that the SMARTS patterns correctly match the intended structures.
   - Use these tests to identify and correct any mismatches or unintended matches.

3. **Address Overfitting and Underfitting:**

   - Simplify overcomplicated rules that may be overfitting the training data.
   - Ensure that rules are neither too broad (leading to low specificity) nor too narrow (leading to low coverage).

4. **Incorporate Additional Molecular Descriptors:**

   - Use other descriptors such as electronic properties, steric factors, and hydrophobicity to enhance the predictive power of the model.

5. **Consult Domain Experts:**

   - Engage chemists or material scientists to review the rules for chemical validity and relevance.
   - Use expert insights to refine rules based on underlying chemical principles.

6. **Iteratively Refine the Rules:**

   - After implementing changes, retrain the model and evaluate its performance using cross-validation.
   - Use the SHAP analysis to assess the contribution of each rule and make further adjustments as necessary.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting:**

Yes, there is potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. The identified issues stem primarily from inaccuracies in the SMARTS patterns and the implementation of the rules rather than from the inherent limitations of the dataset or an overfitting model.

By refining the patterns, ensuring they accurately capture the intended molecular features, and validating the rules with both computational tests and domain expertise, the model's performance can be improved. This approach focuses on correcting errors and enhancing the model's generalization capabilities.

Additionally, incorporating new descriptors and perhaps considering alternative modeling techniques (e.g., machine learning algorithms capable of capturing non-linear relationships) may further enhance the predictive performance without overfitting.

    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with a para-substituted amino group** predict a **high yield**. The amino group at the para position enhances metal coordination through additional nitrogen coordination sites and increases electron density on the aromatic ring.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Aromatic carboxylic acids without a para-amino group or with electron-withdrawing groups at the para position, such as **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, predict a **low yield** due to decreased electron density and poorer metal coordination.

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal amino groups and a carbon chain length of five carbons or fewer** predict a **high yield**. The proximity of the amino and carboxyl groups facilitates chelation with metal centers.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**, **3-aminopropanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Modifiers with longer carbon chains, such as **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**, predict a **low yield** due to decreased chelation efficiency caused by increased chain flexibility.

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids** predict a **high yield**. Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous coordination sites for metal binding, enhancing catalyst stability and performance.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid), **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Monohydroxy or non-hydroxy carboxylic acids like **octanoic acid** predict a **low yield** due to fewer coordination sites.

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the para position**, such as hydroxyl or methoxy groups, predict a **high yield**. EDGs increase electron density, facilitating stronger metal coordination.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **4-hydroxybenzoic acid**, **4-methoxybenzoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Aromatic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the para position, such as **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, predict a **low yield**.

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with heteroatoms in the ring**, such as pyridine derivatives, predict a **high yield**. The heteroatoms provide additional coordination sites and enhance binding with metal centers.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Aromatic carboxylic acids without ring heteroatoms, like **benzoic acid**, predict a **low yield**.

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with adjacent carboxyl groups**, such as succinic acid, predict a **high yield**. The two carboxyl groups can chelate to the metal center effectively.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid), **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid).
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Monocarboxylic acids like **pentanoic acid** predict a **low yield** due to fewer coordination sites.

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**. Thiol groups act as strong ligands, enhancing metal coordination.

   - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Thiol-containing acids with thiol groups further from the carboxyl group or with steric hindrance predict a **low yield**.

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers with **bulky or sterically hindered groups near coordinating sites** predict a **low yield**. Steric hindrance impedes effective coordination with the metal center.

   - *Low Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine), **4-tert-butylbenzoic acid**.
   - *High Yield Examples*: Modifiers without bulky groups near coordination sites, such as **benzoic acid**, may predict a **high yield** if they meet other criteria.

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups located beta to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**. The beta-hydroxyl facilitates chelation by forming stable five-membered chelate rings.

   - *High Yield Example*: **3-hydroxypropanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Acids without beta-hydroxyl groups or with hydroxyls further away from the carboxyl group predict a **low yield**.

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing **fluorinated alkyl chains** predict a **low yield**. Fluorine's strong electronegativity withdraws electron density, reducing the ability of coordinating atoms to bind metals effectively.

    - *Low Yield Examples*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**, **trifluoroacetic acid**.
    - *High Yield Examples*: Non-fluorinated analogs like **pentanoic acid** predict a **high yield** if they meet other criteria.

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with ortho-dihydroxy groups** (catechols) predict a **high yield**. The two hydroxyl groups can form strong chelating interactions with metal centers.

    - *High Yield Examples*: **2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Examples*: Monohydroxybenzoic acids or those without ortho-dihydroxy groups predict a **low yield**.

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **additional coordinating functional groups such as carbonyls, amides, or imines adjacent to the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**. These groups can participate in metal binding, enhancing complex stability.

    - *High Yield Examples*: **2-oxoacetic acid**, **glyoxylic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Examples*: Acids lacking adjacent coordinating groups predict a **low yield**.

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with side chains capable of metal coordination**, such as carboxylate, hydroxyl, or thiol groups, predict a **high yield**. Side chains enhance metal binding through additional coordination sites.

    - *High Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid), **(2S)-2-amino-3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Cysteine).
    - *Low Yield Examples*: Amino acids with non-coordinating side chains, like **(2S)-2-amino-4-methylpentanoic acid** (Leucine), predict a **low yield**.

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers with **strong electron-withdrawing groups directly attached to the carboxylate-bearing carbon** predict a **low yield**. These groups decrease the nucleophilicity of coordinating atoms, hindering metal binding.

    - *Low Yield Examples*: **Trichloroacetic acid**, **cyanoacetic acid**.
    - *High Yield Examples*: Acids without such electron-withdrawing groups or with electron-donating groups predict a **high yield** if other criteria are met.

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **macrocyclic or polycyclic aromatic compounds with multiple heteroatoms** predict a **high yield** due to the formation of stable chelate complexes with metals.

    - *High Yield Examples*: **1,10-phenanthroline-2-carboxylic acid**, **dipyridylamine derivatives**.
    - *Low Yield Examples*: Non-cyclic or monocyclic compounds lacking multiple heteroatoms predict a **low yield**.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Refine the SMARTS pattern for Rule 1** (aromatic carboxylic acids with a para-substituted amino group) to accurately identify compounds like 4-aminobenzoic acid. Update the SMARTS pattern to `c1ccc(N)cc1C(=O)O` or more generally `c1ccc([NX3H2])cc1C(=O)O` to ensure the amino group is at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid.

- **Advice 2**: **Modify the SMARTS pattern for Rule 2** (aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal amino groups and a carbon chain length of five carbons or fewer) to enforce the terminal position of the amino group and limit chain length. Use a pattern like `NCCCC[CX3](=O)O` for a five-carbon chain, generalized as `N[C;!R]{0,4}[C;!R][CX3](=O)O` to represent chains with up to five carbons.

- **Advice 3**: **Enhance Rule 3 to accurately identify polyhydroxy carboxylic acids** by implementing logic that counts the number of hydroxyl groups. Use a SMARTS pattern that requires at least two hydroxyl groups, such as `[$([CX4][OX2H])](~[CX3](=O)[OX1H0])` with occurrences counted to ensure multiple hydroxyl groups are present.

- **Advice 4**: **Adjust the SMARTS pattern for Rule 4** (aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position) to include a broader range of EDGs like hydroxyl, methoxy, and alkyl groups. Ensure para substitution by using a pattern such as `c1cc([C,c,N,O])[cH]c1C(=O)O`, where `[C,c,N,O]` represents common EDGs.

- **Advice 5**: **Refine the pattern for Rule 5** (aromatic carboxylic acids with heteroatoms in the ring) to match heteroaromatic rings with carboxylic acid substituents regardless of heteroatom position. Use a pattern like `[n,o,s]1cccc([CX3](=O)O)c1` to include various heterocycles like pyridine and pyrrole derivatives.

- **Advice 6**: **Expand the SMARTS pattern for Rule 8** (modifiers with bulky or sterically hindered groups near coordinating sites) to detect bulky groups beyond tert-butyl. Include patterns for isopropyl, phenyl, and cycloalkyl groups near the carboxylate, such as `[CX3](=O)O[CH]([C])[C]` or `[CX3](=O)O[C](C)(C)C`.

- **Advice 7**: **Update the SMARTS pattern for Rule 13** (amino acids with side chains capable of metal coordination) to correctly identify side chains with coordinating groups. Use recursive SMARTS patterns like `[NX3][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H0][CX4][*]([#6])[OX2H,SH,NX3H2]` to capture amino acids with hydroxyl, thiol, or additional carboxyl groups in the side chain.

- **Advice 8**: **Adjust the SMARTS pattern for Rule 14** (modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups attached to the carboxylate carbon) to include various EWGs such as halogens, nitriles, and nitro groups. Use a pattern like `[CX3](A)([CX3](=O)[OX1H0])`, where `A` is `[F,Cl,Br,I,N+](=O)[O-],C#N]`.

- **Advice 9**: **Implement validation tests for each rule** by creating a set of known positive and negative examples. Use these tests to confirm that each SMARTS pattern matches only the intended molecular structures and revise patterns as necessary based on the test results.

- **Advice 10**: **Simplify overcomplicated rules** to prevent overfitting. Analyze each rule for redundancy or excessive specificity, and adjust the scope to ensure they are general enough to cover new examples but specific enough to be meaningful.

- **Advice 11**: **Incorporate additional molecular descriptors** such as electronic properties (e.g., Hammett constants), steric factors (e.g., Taft parameters), and hydrophobicity (e.g., LogP values) into the rules to capture features that SMARTS patterns alone may miss.

- **Advice 12**: **Consult domain experts** (organic chemists or materials scientists) to review and refine the rules for chemical accuracy and relevance. Their insights can help identify overlooked factors and suggest modifications based on chemical principles.

- **Advice 13**: **Iteratively retrain and evaluate the model** after implementing changes. Use cross-validation and SHAP analysis to assess the impact of each rule on the model's performance and make further adjustments as needed to improve accuracy without overfitting.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal amino groups and a carbon chain length of five carbons or fewer** predict a **high yield**. The proximity of the amino and carboxyl groups facilitates chelation with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**. Longer chains reduce chelation efficiency due to increased flexibility and decreased alignment of functional groups.

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids** predict a **high yield**. Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous coordination sites for metal binding, enhancing catalyst stability and performance.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid), **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Monohydroxy acids like **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** predict a **low yield** due to fewer coordination sites and increased distance between functional groups.

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with amino groups**, such as aspartic acid and glutamic acid, predict a **high yield**. The presence of multiple carboxyl and amino groups enhances metal chelation through the formation of stable chelate rings.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid), **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid).
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Amino acids with non-coordinating side chains or steric hindrance, like **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**, predict a **low yield**.

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted groups capable of metal coordination**, such as amino or nitro groups, predict a **high yield**. These substituents can interact with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Aromatic acids with para-substituents that do not facilitate coordination, like **4-methylbenzoic acid**, or those with strong electron-withdrawing groups that hinder coordination, like **4-formylbenzoic acid**, predict a **low yield**.

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids**, such as pyridine derivatives with the carboxyl group adjacent to the heteroatom, predict a **high yield**. The heteroatoms provide additional coordination sites, enhancing metal binding.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid), **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (kynurenic acid).
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Compounds where the carboxyl group is not optimally positioned for coordination, like **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**, predict a **low yield** due to less effective metal interaction.

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**. Thiol groups act as strong ligands, forming stable complexes with metal centers.

   - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Aromatic thiol acids like **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** predict a **low yield** due to reduced accessibility of the thiol group for coordination caused by resonance stabilization in the aromatic ring.

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing **fluorinated alkyl chains** predict a **low yield**. The strong electronegativity of fluorine withdraws electron density from coordinating groups, diminishing their ability to bind metals effectively.

   - *Low Yield Examples*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**, **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**.
   - *High Yield Examples*: Non-fluorinated analogs like **pentanoic acid** may predict a **high yield** if they meet other criteria.

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids of moderate chain length (up to eight carbons) without additional coordinating groups** can predict a **high yield** due to sufficient hydrophobic interactions and potential for metal coordination through the carboxyl group.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **octanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Very long-chain acids without coordinating groups may predict a **low yield** due to decreased solubility and reduced interaction with the metal center.

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups capable of coordinating with metal centers** predict a **high yield**. The key factor is the substituent's ability to participate in metal binding rather than its electronic nature alone.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Substituents that hinder coordination due to steric effects or do not provide additional coordination sites, like **4-methylbenzoic acid**, predict a **low yield**.

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **sterically hindered groups near coordinating sites or side chains lacking coordinating functionality** predict a **low yield** due to impeded metal coordination.

    - *Low Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine), **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (N-acetyl-lysine).
    - *High Yield Examples*: Amino acids with coordinating side chains, like **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan), predict a **high yield**.

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers with **multiple coordinating groups arranged to facilitate chelation** predict a **high yield**. Spatial arrangement allowing simultaneous interaction with the metal enhances binding strength.

    - *High Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid**, **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Examples*: Compounds with coordinating groups too distant to chelate effectively predict a **low yield**.

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with ortho-hydroxyl and aldehyde groups** predict a **low yield**. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding and resonance reduce the availability of coordinating atoms.

    - *Low Yield Examples*: **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**.
    - *High Yield Examples*: Aromatic acids without such competing interactions predict a **high yield** if other criteria are met.

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **ether or polyether chains attached to carboxylic acids** predict a **low yield**. The electron-donating nature of ethers and their steric bulk can hinder effective metal coordination.

    - *Low Yield Examples*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.
    - *High Yield Examples*: Acids without bulky ether chains, allowing better access to the metal center, may predict a **high yield**.

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl or amino groups distant from the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**. The increased flexibility limits effective chelation.

    - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**.
    - *High Yield Examples*: Shorter-chain analogs with functional groups closer to the carboxyl group predict a **high yield**.

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with substituents forming extended conjugation or steric hindrance** predict a **low yield**. Extended conjugation can delocalize electron density away from coordinating atoms, and bulky groups impede metal access.

    - *Low Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid**, **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.
    - *High Yield Examples*: Compounds without such features, or where substituents facilitate metal coordination, predict a **high yield**.

Supported by the low-yield example **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, coverage is limited but sufficient.

- **Comment 14**:

  **Rule 14** is clear in identifying that long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with distant hydroxyl or amino groups predict low yield. The property insight regarding reduced chelation efficiency due to increased flexibility is sound. The rule meets the complexity criterion by combining chain length and functional group position. It is well-supported by low-yield examples like **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, and **8-aminooctanoic acid**, ensuring good coverage.

- **Comment 15**:

  **Rule 15** clearly states that aromatic carboxylic acids with substituents causing extended conjugation or steric hindrance predict low yield. The property insight is strong, explaining how these features affect electron density and metal access. The rule is complex, considering both electronic and steric factors. Supported by low-yield examples such as **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** and **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**, it demonstrates good coverage and balance.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal amino groups and a carbon chain length of five carbons or fewer** predict a **high yield**. The proximity of the amino and carboxyl groups facilitates chelation with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**. Longer chains reduce chelation efficiency due to increased flexibility and decreased alignment of functional groups.

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids** predict a **high yield**. Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous coordination sites for metal binding, enhancing catalyst stability and performance.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid), **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Monohydroxy acids like **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** predict a **low yield** due to fewer coordination sites and increased distance between functional groups.

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with amino groups**, such as aspartic acid and glutamic acid, predict a **high yield**. The presence of multiple carboxyl and amino groups enhances metal chelation through the formation of stable chelate rings.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid), **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid).
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Amino acids with non-coordinating side chains or steric hindrance, like **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**, predict a **low yield**.

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted groups capable of metal coordination**, such as amino or nitro groups, predict a **high yield**. These substituents can interact with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Aromatic acids with para-substituents that do not facilitate coordination, like **4-methylbenzoic acid**, or those with strong electron-withdrawing groups that hinder coordination, like **4-formylbenzoic acid**, predict a **low yield**.

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids**, such as pyridine derivatives with the carboxyl group adjacent to the heteroatom, predict a **high yield**. The heteroatoms provide additional coordination sites, enhancing metal binding.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid), **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (kynurenic acid).
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Compounds where the carboxyl group is not optimally positioned for coordination, like **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**, predict a **low yield** due to less effective metal interaction.

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**. Thiol groups act as strong ligands, forming stable complexes with metal centers.

   - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Aromatic thiol acids like **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** predict a **low yield** due to reduced accessibility of the thiol group for coordination caused by resonance stabilization in the aromatic ring.

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing **fluorinated alkyl chains** predict a **low yield**. The strong electronegativity of fluorine withdraws electron density from coordinating groups, diminishing their ability to bind metals effectively.

   - *Low Yield Examples*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**, **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**.
   - *High Yield Examples*: Non-fluorinated analogs like **pentanoic acid** may predict a **high yield** if they meet other criteria.

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids of moderate chain length (up to eight carbons) without additional coordinating groups** can predict a **high yield** due to sufficient hydrophobic interactions and potential for metal coordination through the carboxyl group.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **octanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Very long-chain acids without coordinating groups may predict a **low yield** due to decreased solubility and reduced interaction with the metal center.

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups capable of coordinating with metal centers** predict a **high yield**. The key factor is the substituent's ability to participate in metal binding rather than its electronic nature alone.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Substituents that hinder coordination due to steric effects or do not provide additional coordination sites, like **4-methylbenzoic acid**, predict a **low yield**.

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **sterically hindered groups near coordinating sites or side chains lacking coordinating functionality** predict a **low yield** due to impeded metal coordination.

    - *Low Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine), **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (N-acetyl-lysine).
    - *High Yield Examples*: Amino acids with coordinating side chains, like **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan), predict a **high yield**.

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers with **multiple coordinating groups arranged to facilitate chelation** predict a **high yield**. Spatial arrangement allowing simultaneous interaction with the metal enhances binding strength.

    - *High Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid**, **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Examples*: Compounds with coordinating groups too distant to chelate effectively predict a **low yield**.

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with ortho-hydroxyl and aldehyde groups** predict a **low yield**. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding and resonance reduce the availability of coordinating atoms.

    - *Low Yield Examples*: **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**.
    - *High Yield Examples*: Aromatic acids without such competing interactions predict a **high yield** if other criteria are met.

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **ether or polyether chains attached to carboxylic acids** predict a **low yield**. The electron-donating nature of ethers and their steric bulk can hinder effective metal coordination.

    - *Low Yield Examples*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.
    - *High Yield Examples*: Acids without bulky ether chains, allowing better access to the metal center, may predict a **high yield**.

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl or amino groups distant from the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**. The increased flexibility limits effective chelation.

    - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**.
    - *High Yield Examples*: Shorter-chain analogs with functional groups closer to the carboxyl group predict a **high yield**.

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with substituents forming extended conjugation or steric hindrance** predict a **low yield**. Extended conjugation can delocalize electron density away from coordinating atoms, and bulky groups impede metal access.

    - *Low Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid**, **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.
    - *High Yield Examples*: Compounds without such features, or where substituents facilitate metal coordination, predict a **high yield**.

Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: **Rule 2** is incorrectly assigning a positive match to every molecule because the SMARTS pattern `'[C](=O)[O;H1]'` matches any carboxylic acid group, which is present in all modifiers in the SMILES list. Additionally, the current code checks for the presence of `[OX2H]` (hydroxyl groups) but does not ensure that there are multiple hydroxyl groups as required by the rule. To fix this, modify the code to check that the molecule contains **multiple** hydroxyl groups. Use `mol.GetSubstructMatches()` to count the number of hydroxyl groups and ensure it is two or more.

- **Suggestion 2**: For **Rule 1**, the SMARTS pattern `'[NX3H2][C;X4H2][C;X4H2][C;X4H2][C;X4H2][C;X3](=O)[O;H1]'` only matches chains of exactly five carbons. However, the natural language rule specifies chains of **five carbons or fewer**. Modify the SMARTS pattern to match chains with up to five carbons by using recursive SMARTS or by adjusting the pattern to allow for variable chain lengths. For example, use `'[NX3H2][C;X4H2]{1,5}[C;X3](=O)[O;H1]'`.

- **Suggestion 3**: In **Rule 4**, the SMARTS pattern `'[c]1ccc([C](=O)[O;H1])c([X,N])[c]1'` may not accurately capture para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with groups capable of metal coordination. The `[X,N]` portion is ambiguous. Refine the pattern to specifically match amino or nitro groups in the para position. For example, use `'c1cc([C](=O)[O;H1])ccc1[NX3;H2,H1,H0]'` to match para-amino benzoic acid or include nitro groups with `'c1cc([C](=O)[O;H1])ccc1[N+](=O)[O-]'`.

- **Suggestion 4**: For **Rule 7**, the SMARTS pattern `'[C](C(F)(F)F)'` only matches a carbon with a trifluoromethyl group. However, the rule refers to **fluorinated alkyl chains** in general. To capture any fluorinated alkyl chain, modify the SMARTS pattern to `'[CX4][CX4](F)'` to match carbons in an alkyl chain bearing fluorine atoms. Alternatively, use a pattern like `'[*][CX4;$([CX4][F])]([F])[F]'` to match carbons connected to at least two fluorines.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Rule 8**'s SMARTS pattern `'[C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C;X4][C](=O)[O;H1]'` matches an aliphatic chain of exactly eight carbons. Since the rule specifies chain lengths **up to eight carbons**, adjust the pattern to allow shorter chains. Use a recursive SMARTS pattern like `'[C;X4]{1,8}[C](=O)[O;H1]'` and use `'max_chain_length': 8` in the code to enforce the maximum chain length.

- **Suggestion 6**: In **Rule 9**, the SMARTS pattern `'[c]1ccc([C](=O)[O;H1])c([!H])[c]1'` may not adequately represent aromatic carboxylic acids with substituents capable of coordinating with metal centers. Modify the pattern to specifically include substituents that can coordinate, such as halogens, amino, or nitro groups. For example, use `'c1cc([C](=O)[O;H1])ccc1[a,N,O,S]'`.

- **Suggestion 7**: For **Rule 10**, the SMARTS pattern `'[C](=O)[O;H1][C][C]([C])[C]'` aims to match sterically hindered groups near coordinating sites. However, this pattern may not accurately reflect the structural complexity described in the rule. Review and refine the SMARTS pattern to encompass various steric hindrance scenarios, possibly by including bulky substituents near the carboxyl group.

- **Suggestion 8**: Modify the code logic to ensure that for rules requiring multiple occurrences of a substructure (e.g., multiple hydroxyl groups in **Rule 2**), the code counts the occurrences rather than just checking for their presence. Implement counting logic using `len(mol.GetSubstructMatches(substructure))` and compare against the required number.

- **Suggestion 9**: Introduce error handling and logging within the code to identify cases where molecules do not match a rule due to specific reasons. This will help in debugging and ensuring that the SMARTS patterns and code logic are functioning as intended.

- **Suggestion 10**: For rules with additional conditions (e.g., chain length, substituent positions), consider using additional properties or functions within RDKit to validate these conditions rather than relying solely on SMARTS patterns.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal amino groups and a carbon chain length of five carbons or fewer** predict a **high yield**. The proximity of the amino and carboxyl groups facilitates chelation with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**. Longer chains reduce chelation efficiency due to increased flexibility and decreased alignment of functional groups.

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids** predict a **high yield**. Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous coordination sites for metal binding, enhancing catalyst stability and performance.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid), **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Monohydroxy acids like **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** predict a **low yield** due to fewer coordination sites and increased distance between functional groups.

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with amino groups**, such as aspartic acid and glutamic acid, predict a **high yield**. The presence of multiple carboxyl and amino groups enhances metal chelation through the formation of stable chelate rings.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid), **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid).
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Amino acids with non-coordinating side chains or steric hindrance, like **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**, predict a **low yield**.

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted groups capable of metal coordination**, such as amino or nitro groups, predict a **high yield**. These substituents can interact with metal centers, enhancing catalyst performance.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Aromatic acids with para-substituents that do not facilitate coordination, like **4-methylbenzoic acid**, or those with strong electron-withdrawing groups that hinder coordination, like **4-formylbenzoic acid**, predict a **low yield**.

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids**, such as pyridine derivatives with the carboxyl group adjacent to the heteroatom, predict a **high yield**. The heteroatoms provide additional coordination sites, enhancing metal binding.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid), **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (kynurenic acid).
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Compounds where the carboxyl group is not optimally positioned for coordination, like **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**, predict a **low yield** due to less effective metal interaction.

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**. Thiol groups act as strong ligands, forming stable complexes with metal centers.

   - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Aromatic thiol acids like **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** predict a **low yield** due to reduced accessibility of the thiol group for coordination caused by resonance stabilization in the aromatic ring.

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers containing **fluorinated alkyl chains** predict a **low yield**. The strong electronegativity of fluorine withdraws electron density from coordinating groups, diminishing their ability to bind metals effectively.

   - *Low Yield Examples*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**, **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**.
   - *High Yield Examples*: Non-fluorinated analogs like **pentanoic acid** may predict a **high yield** if they meet other criteria.

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids of moderate chain length (up to eight carbons) without additional coordinating groups** can predict a **high yield** due to sufficient hydrophobic interactions and potential for metal coordination through the carboxyl group.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **octanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Very long-chain acids without coordinating groups may predict a **low yield** due to decreased solubility and reduced interaction with the metal center.

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups capable of coordinating with metal centers** predict a **high yield**. The key factor is the substituent's ability to participate in metal binding rather than its electronic nature alone.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Substituents that hinder coordination due to steric effects or do not provide additional coordination sites, like **4-methylbenzoic acid**, predict a **low yield**.

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **sterically hindered groups near coordinating sites or side chains lacking coordinating functionality** predict a **low yield** due to impeded metal coordination.

    - *Low Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine), **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (N-acetyl-lysine).
    - *High Yield Examples*: Amino acids with coordinating side chains, like **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan), predict a **high yield**.

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers with **multiple coordinating groups arranged to facilitate chelation** predict a **high yield**. Spatial arrangement allowing simultaneous interaction with the metal enhances binding strength.

    - *High Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid**, **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Examples*: Compounds with coordinating groups too distant to chelate effectively predict a **low yield**.

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with ortho-hydroxyl and aldehyde groups** predict a **low yield**. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding and resonance reduce the availability of coordinating atoms.

    - *Low Yield Examples*: **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**, **4-formylbenzoic acid**.
    - *High Yield Examples*: Aromatic acids without such competing interactions predict a **high yield** if other criteria are met.

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **ether or polyether chains attached to carboxylic acids** predict a **low yield**. The electron-donating nature of ethers and their steric bulk can hinder effective metal coordination.

    - *Low Yield Examples*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.
    - *High Yield Examples*: Acids without bulky ether chains, allowing better access to the metal center, may predict a **high yield**.

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl or amino groups distant from the carboxyl group** predict a **low yield**. The increased flexibility limits effective chelation.

    - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**.
    - *High Yield Examples*: Shorter-chain analogs with functional groups closer to the carboxyl group predict a **high yield**.

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with substituents forming extended conjugation or steric hindrance** predict a **low yield**. Extended conjugation can delocalize electron density away from coordinating atoms, and bulky groups impede metal access.

    - *Low Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid**, **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**.
    - *High Yield Examples*: Compounds without such features, or where substituents facilitate metal coordination, predict a **high yield**.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: In **Rule 1**, the current code does not accurately enforce that the chain connecting the amino group and the carboxyl group is fully **aliphatic** and consists of **five carbons or fewer**. The code checks for aliphatic atoms along the shortest path but does not ensure that **only carbon atoms** are counted in the chain length. To improve this:
  - Modify the chain length calculation to count **only carbon atoms** between the amino nitrogen and the carboxyl carbon, excluding the functional groups themselves.
  - Ensure that the chain does not include any **aromatic atoms** by checking that all atoms along the path have `GetIsAromatic() == False`.
  - Update the chain length condition to `if chain_length <= 5 and all(atom.GetAtomicNum() == 6 for atom in atoms_in_path):`.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: In **Rule 1**, the code incorrectly matches molecules where the amino group is not **terminal** (i.e., not at the end of the chain). The code should enforce that the amino group is a **terminal group**. To fix this:
  - Check that the nitrogen atom of the amino group is only connected to one carbon atom (i.e., it's a primary amine attached to a terminal carbon).
  - Modify the SMARTS pattern for the primary aliphatic amine to ensure it's at the end of a chain: `[NX3H2][CX4H2]`.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: In **Rule 4**, the code does not verify that the amino or nitro group is specifically in the **para position** relative to the carboxyl group on the aromatic ring. To improve this:
  - Define a SMARTS pattern that captures para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with amino or nitro groups: `c1cc([NX3H2,NX3H1,NX3(+)], [NX2]=O)ccc1C(=O)O`.
  - Use `Mol.GetSubstructMatches()` with this SMARTS pattern to check for para substitution.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: In **Rule 5**, the code checks for the presence of a **pyridine ring** and a carboxylic acid but does not ensure that the carboxyl group is **adjacent to the heteroatom** (nitrogen) in the ring. To correct this:
  - Define a SMARTS pattern for pyridine carboxylic acids where the carboxyl group is adjacent to the nitrogen: `n1ccccc1C(=O)O`.
  - Use this pattern to check for the specific substitution pattern required by the rule.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: In **Rule 7**, the SMARTS pattern `[CX4][F]` may not capture all **fluorinated alkyl chains**, especially perfluorinated chains or compounds where multiple fluorines are attached to the same carbon. To address this:
  - Update the pattern to detect any alkyl chain with fluorines: `[CX4][CX4,F]*[F]`.
  - Alternatively, search for **carbon atoms bonded to multiple fluorines**: `[CX4]([F])[F]`.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: In **Rule 8**, the code counts the total number of aliphatic carbons in the molecule but does not ensure that the molecule is a **straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acid without additional coordinating groups**. To improve accuracy:
  - Define a SMARTS pattern for aliphatic carboxylic acids with a specific chain length, e.g., `[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH3]` for a six-carbon chain.
  - Ensure that the molecule does not have other coordinating groups by explicitly checking for their absence.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: In **Rule 2**, the code checks for the presence of at least two hydroxyl groups but does not verify that the molecule is a **polyhydroxy carboxylic acid**. To refine this:
  - Use a pattern that matches carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups attached to adjacent carbons: `[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CX4]([OX2H])[CX4]([OX2H])[CX4]([OX2H])`.
  - Ensure the hydroxyl groups are part of the main chain and contribute to a polyhydroxy structure.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Across all rules, consider using **recursive SMARTS patterns** and **functional group definitions** from cheminformatics libraries like RDKit's FunctionalGroups to improve pattern matching. This can enhance the accuracy of functional group identification and ensure the structural criteria of each rule are met.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: Implement **unit tests** for each rule using known examples of high-yield and low-yield compounds. This will help validate that each rule is correctly implemented and identify any discrepancies in pattern matching.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Improve **error handling** in the code to catch exceptions and provide informative messages. This will aid in debugging and ensure that failures in pattern matching do not silently pass without notice.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Translate Qualitative Rules into Quantifiable Descriptors**

  Reframe the current qualitative rules into quantifiable molecular descriptors that can be directly computed from SMILES strings. For example:

  - Instead of "aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal amino groups and a carbon chain length of five carbons or fewer" (Rule 1), define descriptors such as:
    - Count of amino groups (`NumAminoGroups`)
    - Carbon chain length (`AliphaticChainLength`)
    - Position of amino groups relative to carboxyl group (`TerminalAminoPosition`)
  These descriptors can be numerically calculated and used to create a feature matrix.

- **Advice 2**: **Utilize Molecular Fingerprints and SMARTS Patterns**

  Implement SMARTS patterns for key functional groups and structural motifs described in the rules. This allows automatic detection of features from SMILES strings. For example:

  - Identify polyhydroxy carboxylic acids (Rule 2) by creating a SMARTS pattern that matches multiple hydroxyl groups attached to an aliphatic chain with a terminal carboxyl group.
  - Use molecular fingerprints to represent the presence or absence of specific substructures numerically.

- **Advice 3**: **Incorporate Computable Physicochemical Properties**

  Include physicochemical properties that can be calculated from SMILES strings, such as:

  - Molecular weight (`MolWt`)
  - LogP (octanol-water partition coefficient)
  - Topological polar surface area (`TPSA`)
  - Number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors (`NumHDonors`, `NumHAcceptors`)
  - These properties can capture effects like hydrophobic interactions (Rule 8) and steric hindrance (Rule 10).

- **Advice 4**: **Define Numerical Thresholds for Key Parameters**

  Where the rules mention qualitative thresholds (e.g., "chain length of five carbons or fewer"), define numerical cutoffs that can be directly applied. For instance:

  - `AliphaticChainLength ≤ 5` for high yield prediction.
  - `NumHydroxylGroups ≥ 2` for polyhydroxy acids predicting high yield.

- **Advice 5**: **Quantify Steric and Electronic Effects**

  Calculate descriptors that reflect steric hindrance and electronic properties:

  - Steric hindrance can be approximated by the `Balaban's J index` or `Molecular refractivity`.
  - Electronic properties can be captured by partial charges, `Electrotopological State Indices`, or `Hammett sigma constants` for substituents on aromatic rings.

- **Advice 6**: **Automate Feature Extraction with Cheminformatics Tools**

  Use cheminformatics libraries (e.g., RDKit) to automate the extraction of descriptors from SMILES:

  - Write scripts to parse SMILES strings and compute all relevant descriptors.
  - This ensures consistency and scalability when generating the feature matrix.

- **Advice 7**: **Simplify and Consolidate Overlapping Rules**

  Identify and merge overlapping or similar rules to reduce complexity:

  - Combine rules that predict high yield based on multiple coordinating groups (Rules 3 and 11).
  - Simplify rules about substituent effects on aromatic rings by focusing on their ability to coordinate metals, regardless of being electron-donating or -withdrawing (Rules 4 and 9).

- **Advice 8**: **Create a Standardized Descriptor Set**

  Develop a standardized set of descriptors that cover all relevant features:

  - This set can include counts of functional groups (e.g., carboxyl, amino, hydroxyl, thiol).
  - Spatial arrangement descriptors, such as distance between functional groups, can be approximated using graph distances in the molecular structure.

- **Advice 9**: **Model Chelation Potential Numerically**

  Since chelation is a key factor, create a descriptor that estimates chelation potential:

  - Calculate the shortest path between coordinating atoms (e.g., amino and carboxyl groups).
  - Use descriptors like `Cyclizable Chains` or `Possible Chelation Rings` count.

- **Advice 10**: **Validate Descriptors with the Existing Dataset**

  Test the proposed descriptors on the provided dataset to ensure they correlate with the yield:

  - Perform statistical analyses to identify which descriptors are most predictive.
  - Refine the descriptor set based on this validation.

** End of Advice **
---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic dicarboxylic amino acids** predict a **high yield**. The presence of two carboxyl groups and an amino group on adjacent carbons allows for effective chelation with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid), **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid).
   - *Low Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine), which has only one carboxyl group, predicts a **low yield** due to less effective metal coordination.

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **short-chain aliphatic amino acids with terminal amino groups within five carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**. The close proximity facilitates chelation to metal centers.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**. The increased chain length reduces chelation efficiency due to flexibility and decreased alignment of functional groups.

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids** predict a **high yield**. Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous coordination sites for metal binding, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid).
   - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, where the hydroxyl group is distant from the carboxyl group, predicts a **low yield** due to less effective coordination.

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted amino or nitro groups** predict a **high yield**. These substituents can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**, where the methyl group does not facilitate coordination, predicts a **low yield**.

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms capable of coordination** predict a **high yield**. Nitrogen atoms in the ring provide additional sites for metal binding.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid).
   - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**, where the pyridine ring is further from the carboxyl group, predicts a **low yield** due to reduced metal interaction.

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers with **fluorinated alkyl chains** predict a **low yield**. The strong electronegativity of fluorine withdraws electron density from coordinating groups, diminishing their ability to bind metals effectively.

   - *Low Yield Examples*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**, **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**.
   - *High Yield Examples*: Non-fluorinated analogs like **pentanoic acid** may predict a **high yield** if they meet other criteria.

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups and chain lengths up to eight carbons** predict a **high yield**. The carboxyl group can effectively coordinate with metal centers, and moderate hydrophobicity enhances interactions.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **octanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Very long-chain acids or those with interfering substituents may predict a **low yield** due to decreased solubility and reduced metal interaction.

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **polyether chains attached to carboxylic acids** predict a **low yield**. The steric bulk and electron-donating nature of ethers can hinder effective metal coordination.

   - *Low Yield Examples*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.
   - *High Yield Examples*: Acids without bulky ether chains, allowing better access to the metal center, may predict a **high yield**.

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde or formyl groups** predict a **low yield**. These groups can engage in intramolecular interactions or resonance structures that reduce the availability of coordinating atoms.

   - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
   - *High Yield Examples*: Aromatic acids without such electron-withdrawing groups, or with substituents that facilitate coordination, predict a **high yield**.

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **thiol groups within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**. Thiol groups are strong ligands that form stable complexes with metal centers.

    - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**, where the thiol is less accessible due to aromatic resonance, predicts a **low yield**.

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted bromomethyl groups** predict a **high yield**. The bromomethyl group can participate in metal coordination or activate the aromatic ring for binding.

    - *High Yield Example*: **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Examples*: Aromatic acids without coordinating substituents or with deactivating groups predict a **low yield**.

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **long aliphatic chains containing hydroxyl or amino groups distant from the carboxyl group (beyond the fifth carbon)** predict a **low yield**. Increased chain length diminishes chelation efficiency due to flexibility.

    - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**.
    - *High Yield Examples*: Shorter-chain analogs with functional groups closer to the carboxyl group predict a **high yield**.

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **bulky substituents near coordinating sites or side chains lacking coordinating functionality** predict a **low yield**. Steric hindrance impedes metal access, reducing catalyst effectiveness.

    - *Low Yield Examples*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (N-acetyl-lysine), where acetamido groups hinder coordination.
    - *High Yield Examples*: Amino acids with side chains that facilitate metal binding, like **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan), predict a **high yield**.

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy-substituted aromatic rings** predict a **high yield**. Methoxy groups can donate electron density, enhancing metal coordination.

    - *High Yield Example*: **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Examples*: Aromatic acids lacking electron-donating groups or with steric hindrance predict a **low yield**.

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers with **coordinating groups properly positioned for chelation**, such as adjacent amino and carboxyl groups or multiple hydroxyl groups, predict a **high yield**. Effective spatial arrangement enhances metal binding.

    - *High Yield Examples*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan), **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Examples*: Compounds where coordinating groups are too distant or obstructed predict a **low yield**.

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is strong and well-supported. The criteria are clear, allowing one to easily determine if a modifier fits. The property insight regarding chelation through adjacent amino and two carboxyl groups is well-explained. The rule considers combinations of functional groups, and it is supported by at least three data points—entries 0, 2 (high yield), and 13 (low yield when not meeting criteria).

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is robust with clear criteria about chain length and functional group positioning. The property insight on how proximity of amino groups to carboxyl groups enhances chelation is sound. It accounts for the complexity of molecular structure and is supported by at least three data points—entries 3 (high yield), 31, and 34 (low yields due to longer chains).

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is acceptable but has limited coverage with only two data points—entry 9 (high yield) and entry 29 (low yield). The criteria are clear, and the property insight about multiple hydroxyl groups enhancing coordination is valid. Additional data points would strengthen this rule.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is well-formulated with clear criteria involving aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted amino or nitro groups. The property insight is solid, explaining how these substituents enhance metal coordination. It effectively combines structural features and is supported by at least three data points—entries 4, 20 (high yields), and 22 (low yield when not matching criteria).

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 requires refinement for clarity. While it has property insight about nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings aiding coordination, inconsistencies in the data—such as entry 24 (high yield)—suggest the rule doesn't fully capture all relevant factors. Adjusting the criteria to account for exceptions or further specifying the structural requirements would improve the rule.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is acceptable but would benefit from additional data. The criteria are clear regarding fluorinated alkyl chains leading to low yield due to electron-withdrawing effects. It is supported by two data points—entries 14 and 28—but more examples would enhance coverage.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 lacks sufficient coverage and may be too general. It is mainly supported by entry 5 (high yield with octanoic acid). The rule's clarity is acceptable, but conflicting data or lack of additional supporting examples suggest it needs refinement or more data points to validate its effectiveness.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is sound with clear criteria about polyether chains hindering coordination due to steric effects. The property insight is logical, and the rule is supported by at least two data points predicting low yield—entries 11 and 32. Complexity is appropriate as it considers the impact of bulky groups.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is well-established with clear criteria relating to aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde or formyl groups predicting low yield. The property insight about reduced availability of coordinating atoms is valid. It is supported by two data points—entries 18 and 19—providing adequate coverage.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is strong and supported by two data points—entry 17 (high yield) and entry 10 (low yield when the thiol group is less accessible). The criteria are clear, and the property insight on thiol groups enhancing metal complex stability is well-articulated.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 currently lacks sufficient coverage, with only one supporting data point—entry 1. While the criteria are clear and the property insight is reasonable, additional data points are necessary to validate this rule fully.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is robust, with clear criteria about long-chain aliphatic acids with distant hydroxyl or amino groups predicting low yield. The property insight is solid, focusing on reduced chelation efficiency due to flexibility. It is well-supported by at least three data points—entries 29, 31, and 34.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 could be improved for clarity. The description of "bulky substituents near coordinating sites" is somewhat vague. More precise criteria or examples would enhance understanding. It is supported by entries 33 (low yield) and 15 (high yield when criteria are met), but refining the rule would strengthen its application.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 has limited coverage with only one supporting data point—entry 25. While the criteria regarding methoxy-substituted aromatic rings are clear, adding more examples would improve the rule's robustness. The property insight is acceptable, focusing on electron-donating effects enhancing coordination.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 is broad and could be made more precise for greater clarity. It is supported by entries 15 and 7 (high yields when coordinating groups are properly positioned). The property insight is logical, but specifying the positional requirements more clearly would improve the rule. Additional data points would enhance coverage.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic dicarboxylic amino acids** predict a **high yield**. The presence of two carboxyl groups and an amino group on adjacent carbons allows for effective chelation with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (aspartic acid), **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (glutamic acid).
   - *Low Yield Examples*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (phenylalanine), which has only one carboxyl group, predicts a **low yield** due to less effective metal coordination.

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **short-chain aliphatic amino acids with terminal amino groups within five carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**. The close proximity facilitates chelation to metal centers.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **5-aminopentanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**. The increased chain length reduces chelation efficiency due to flexibility and decreased alignment of functional groups.

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **polyhydroxy carboxylic acids** predict a **high yield**. Multiple hydroxyl groups provide numerous coordination sites for metal binding, enhancing catalyst stability and reactivity.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (gluconic acid).
   - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, where the hydroxyl group is distant from the carboxyl group, predicts a **low yield** due to less effective coordination.

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted amino or nitro groups** predict a **high yield**. These substituents can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalytic activity.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **4-aminobenzoic acid**, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-methylbenzoic acid**, where the methyl group does not facilitate coordination, predicts a **low yield**.

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms capable of coordination** predict a **high yield**. Nitrogen atoms in the ring provide additional sites for metal binding.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (nicotinic acid).
   - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**, where the pyridine ring is further from the carboxyl group, predicts a **low yield** due to reduced metal interaction.

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers with **fluorinated alkyl chains** predict a **low yield**. The strong electronegativity of fluorine withdraws electron density from coordinating groups, diminishing their ability to bind metals effectively.

   - *Low Yield Examples*: **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**, **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**.
   - *High Yield Examples*: Non-fluorinated analogs like **pentanoic acid** may predict a **high yield** if they meet other criteria.

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups and chain lengths up to eight carbons** predict a **high yield**. The carboxyl group can effectively coordinate with metal centers, and moderate hydrophobicity enhances interactions.

   - *High Yield Examples*: **octanoic acid**.
   - *Low Yield Examples*: Very long-chain acids or those with interfering substituents may predict a **low yield** due to decreased solubility and reduced metal interaction.

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **polyether chains attached to carboxylic acids** predict a **low yield**. The steric bulk and electron-donating nature of ethers can hinder effective metal coordination.

   - *Low Yield Examples*: **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**.
   - *High Yield Examples*: Acids without bulky ether chains, allowing better access to the metal center, may predict a **high yield**.

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde or formyl groups** predict a **low yield**. These groups can engage in intramolecular interactions or resonance structures that reduce the availability of coordinating atoms.

   - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-formylbenzoic acid**, **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**.
   - *High Yield Examples*: Aromatic acids without such electron-withdrawing groups, or with substituents that facilitate coordination, predict a **high yield**.

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **thiol groups within three carbons of the carboxyl group** predict a **high yield**. Thiol groups are strong ligands that form stable complexes with metal centers.

    - *High Yield Example*: **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Examples*: **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**, where the thiol is less accessible due to aromatic resonance, predicts a **low yield**.

11. **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted bromomethyl groups** predict a **high yield**. The bromomethyl group can participate in metal coordination or activate the aromatic ring for binding.

    - *High Yield Example*: **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Examples*: Aromatic acids without coordinating substituents or with deactivating groups predict a **low yield**.

12. **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **long aliphatic chains containing hydroxyl or amino groups distant from the carboxyl group (beyond the fifth carbon)** predict a **low yield**. Increased chain length diminishes chelation efficiency due to flexibility.

    - *Low Yield Examples*: **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**, **7-aminoheptanoic acid**, **8-aminooctanoic acid**.
    - *High Yield Examples*: Shorter-chain analogs with functional groups closer to the carboxyl group predict a **high yield**.

13. **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **bulky substituents near coordinating sites or side chains lacking coordinating functionality** predict a **low yield**. Steric hindrance impedes metal access, reducing catalyst effectiveness.

    - *Low Yield Examples*: **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (N-acetyl-lysine), where acetamido groups hinder coordination.
    - *High Yield Examples*: Amino acids with side chains that facilitate metal binding, like **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan), predict a **high yield**.

14. **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy-substituted aromatic rings** predict a **high yield**. Methoxy groups can donate electron density, enhancing metal coordination.

    - *High Yield Example*: **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Examples*: Aromatic acids lacking electron-donating groups or with steric hindrance predict a **low yield**.

15. **Rule 15**: Modifiers with **coordinating groups properly positioned for chelation**, such as adjacent amino and carboxyl groups or multiple hydroxyl groups, predict a **high yield**. Effective spatial arrangement enhances metal binding.

    - *High Yield Examples*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan), **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**.
    - *Low Yield Examples*: Compounds where coordinating groups are too distant or obstructed predict a **low yield**.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: In Rule 1, modify the code to ensure that the amino group and the two carboxylic acid groups are on adjacent carbons. The current code checks for the presence of two carboxylic acids and an amino group anywhere in the molecule, which may not satisfy the specificity of the rule. Use a SMARTS pattern that represents aliphatic dicarboxylic amino acids with adjacent functional groups. For example, the pattern '[NX3;H2][CX4;!$(C([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1])[!#6])][CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]' can ensure the amino group is adjacent to a carbon bearing a carboxylic acid.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: For Rule 1, update the 'count_threshold' mechanism in the code. The keys in 'count_threshold' use the SMARTS strings, but when matching, 'pat.GetSmarts()' may not return the exact string due to canonicalization or representation differences. Instead, consider using identifiers or indices for patterns or use the original pattern strings as keys consistently.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: In Rule 1, the 'exclude_patterns' use '[a]' to exclude aromatic atoms, but this may not effectively exclude all aromatic systems, especially if the molecule contains aromatic rings elsewhere. Instead, modify the exclusion to ensure the main backbone is aliphatic. Use a recursive SMARTS or specify that the amino acid part must be aliphatic without adjacent aromatic atoms.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: In Rule 2, verify that the 'distance' calculation correctly measures the shortest path between the amino group and the carboxylic acid group through the carbon chain. The current code might not account for branching or rings properly. Implement a method to calculate the number of carbon atoms between the amino group and the carboxyl group, ensuring they are within five carbons as per the rule.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: For Rule 3, ensure that the code accurately counts the number of hydroxyl groups attached to the molecule. The current pattern may match molecules with any number of hydroxyl groups. Update the 'count_threshold' for the hydroxyl group to require multiple occurrences, reflecting 'polyhydroxy' compounds. Also, adjust the patterns to match hydroxyl groups attached to carbons, excluding other possibilities.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: In Rule 4, the SMARTS patterns provided may be too specific and might miss valid compounds that fit the rule. Broaden the patterns to include other para-substituted amino or nitro groups on aromatic carboxylic acids. For example, use a pattern like 'c1ccc(cc1)[NX3;H2]' to match para-substituted amino groups, and ensure the carboxylic acid is meta to the amino group.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: For Rule 5, the code uses the pyridine ring pattern 'n1ccccc1' and the carboxylic acid pattern separately, but it doesn't ensure that the carboxylic acid is attached to the heteroaromatic ring. Modify the patterns to match heteroaromatic rings with attached carboxylic acid groups, ensuring nitrogen atoms capable of coordination are present. Consider using a pattern like '[nH]1cccc1C(=O)O'.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: The current code only implements Rules 1 to 6. To fully evaluate the effectiveness of the transformation, implement the remaining rules (Rules 7 to 15) in the code. This will allow for a comprehensive feature matrix that considers all the specified rules.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: When using 'count_threshold' in the code, ensure that the matching of pattern counts corresponds accurately to the intended functional groups. Avoid relying solely on SMARTS strings as keys, and consider mapping patterns to descriptive identifiers to prevent mismatches due to differences in SMARTS representations.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: For complex rules that involve specific spatial arrangements or steric considerations (e.g., adjacency, proper positioning for chelation), consider writing custom functions or utilizing molecule descriptors rather than relying solely on SMARTS patterns. This can improve accuracy in matching and better reflect the nuances of the chemical rules.

**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

**Comparison with Previous Metrics**

Upon examining the provided metrics, we can make the following observations:

1. **Train Confidence**:
   - **Previous Metrics**: The train confidence ranged from **0.5396** to **0.6352**, with an average around **0.5874**.
   - **Current Metric**: The train confidence has increased to **0.725**.
   - **Interpretation**: This signifies a notable improvement in the confidence level of the rules. Higher confidence indicates that, given the rule conditions, the rule predictions are more frequently correct.

2. **Train Lift**:
   - **Previous Metrics**: The train lift values were **1.0559** and **1.2048**, averaging approximately **1.1304**.
   - **Current Metric**: The train lift has increased to **1.4638**.
   - **Interpretation**: An increase in lift indicates that the rules are more effective at identifying true positives beyond what would be expected by random chance. A lift substantially greater than 1 suggests the rule is significant and impactful.

3. **Train Support**:
   - **Previous Metrics**: The train support ranged from **0.1667** to **0.1845**.
   - **Current Metric**: The train support is **0.0429**.
   - **Interpretation**: The support has decreased, meaning that the rules cover a smaller portion of the dataset. While high confidence and lift are desirable, low support can indicate that the rules may be too specific.

**Evaluation of Iterative Improvement**

Throughout the iterations, the metrics have shown fluctuations:

- **Train Confidence** ranged from **0.5254** to **0.6756** before reaching **0.725**. The consistent upward trend suggests that the rules are becoming more reliable predictors.
- **Train Lift** increased from values around **1.04** to **1.35**, culminating at **1.4638**. This indicates growing effectiveness in identifying true positives.
- **Train Support** varied, with some iterations yielding higher support but lower confidence and lift.

**Assessment of Local Minimum and Iteration Sufficiency**

- The increase in both confidence and lift suggests that the optimization has not yet reached a local minimum. Instead, the metrics indicate that the model is progressing toward better performance.
- However, the decrease in support implies that the model may be overfitting—capturing noise or specific patterns that do not generalize well.
- With only **11 iterations**, and metrics still improving, it would be prudent to continue refining the rules. Further iterations may help balance the trade-off between confidence, lift, and support.

**Recommendations for Rule Improvement**

1. **Balance Specificity and Generality**:
   - **Issue**: The current rules may be too specific, as indicated by the low support.
   - **Solution**: Generalize some rules to cover a broader portion of the dataset without sacrificing too much confidence. This can be achieved by identifying common structural features among high-yield modifiers and incorporating them into more inclusive rules.

2. **Evaluate Redundant or Overlapping Rules**:
   - **Issue**: Overlapping rules may not contribute additional predictive power and can complicate the model.
   - **Solution**: Analyze the rules for redundancy. Combine similar rules or eliminate those with minimal unique contributions to improve simplicity and clarity.

3. **Incorporate Test Data Evaluation**:
   - **Issue**: All metrics are based on training data, risking overfitting.
   - **Solution**: Assess the performance of the rules on test data. This will provide insight into how well the rules generalize to unseen data.

4. **Increase Rule Support**:
   - **Issue**: Low support indicates that the rules apply to a small subset of data.
   - **Solution**: Modify rules to include more data points. For example, relax certain conditions that are too restrictive or explore common substructures that exist in more compounds.

5. **Regularization Techniques**:
   - **Issue**: High confidence and lift with low support can be symptomatic of overfitting.
   - **Solution**: Apply regularization methods to penalize overly complex rules. This encourages the development of simpler, more generalizable rules.

6. **Feature Engineering**:
   - **Issue**: The current features may not capture all relevant chemical properties.
   - **Solution**: Engineer new features that may better predict yield, such as electronic properties, steric factors, or reactivity indices.

7. **Continuous Monitoring of Metrics**:
   - Implement monitoring of both training and testing metrics in future iterations to better assess convergence and generalization performance.

**Conclusion**

The current rules show significant improvements in confidence and lift compared to previous iterations, indicating enhanced predictive capability. However, the decrease in support and the exclusive reliance on training data suggest a need for cautious refinement to prevent overfitting.

By balancing specificity with generality, evaluating rules on test data, and adjusting the rules to increase support, we can further improve the model's performance. Continued iterations, coupled with these strategies, are recommended to achieve a robust and generalizable set of rules.

Traditional Commenter Message:
**Comments on Validation and Training Accuracies:**

The current 5-fold validation accuracy obtained using the classification model is **45.71%**, as indicated by an accuracy of **0.4571**. This marks a decrease compared to previous iterations, where validation accuracies ranged from **51.43%** up to **68.57%**, with occasional peaks at **71.43%**. The decline in accuracy suggests that the current set of rules may not be effectively capturing the patterns in the data, potentially leading to underfitting. The model's performance seems to have plateaued or even deteriorated, indicating that the current rules might not generalize well to unseen data.

**Analysis Based on SHAP Values:**

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values provide insights into how each rule contributes to the model's predictions for each molecule. By examining the SHAP values for instances where the model's predictions do not align with the experimental values, we can identify which rules may be contributing to mispredictions.

1. **Underpredicted High Loadings (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**

   For molecules where the model predicts a low loading but experimentally a high loading is observed, the rules with the most negative SHAP values are likely problematic. The following molecules fall into this category:

   - **C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N**
   - **C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O**
   - **C1=CNC(=O)C=C1C(=O)O**
   - **C1=CN=CC=C1CCCC(=O)O**
   - **C([C@@H](C(=O)O)N)C(=O)O**
   - **C(CS)C(=O)O**
   - **C(C(=O)O)NC(CO)(CO)CO**
   - **C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)[N+](=O)[O-]**
   - **C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)O)N**
   - **C(CCN)CC(=O)O**
   - **CCCCCCCC(=O)O**
   - **C1=CC=C2C(=C1)C(=CN2)C[C@H](C(=O)O)N**

   For these molecules, **Rule 4** and **Rule 5** consistently exhibit negative SHAP values, detracting from the prediction of high loading:

   - **Rule 4** SHAP values range from approximately **-0.0097** to **-0.0219**, negatively influencing the prediction.
   - **Rule 5** SHAP values range from approximately **-0.0019** to **-0.0615**, further contributing to underprediction.

   **Rule 6**, conversely, provides positive SHAP values, attempting to correct the prediction toward high loading but insufficiently overcoming the negative impact of Rules 4 and 5.

2. **Overpredicted Low Loadings (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**

   For molecules where the model predicts a high loading but experimentally a low loading is observed, the rules with the most positive SHAP values are likely problematic. The following molecules are in this category:

   - **C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N**
   - **C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O**
   - **C(CCCC(=O)O)CCCN**
   - **C(CC(=O)O)CNC(=O)C(F)(F)F**
   - **C1=CC(=CC=C1C=O)C(=O)O**
   - **COCCOCCOCC(=O)O**
   - **C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)NCC(=O)O)O**
   - **CSCC[C@@H](C(=O)NCC(=O)O)N**
   - **C1=CC(=CC=C1CCC(=O)O)O**

   In these cases, **Rule 4** and **Rule 6** have positive SHAP values, contributing to overestimation:

   - **Rule 4** SHAP values are **0** in some cases where the prediction is high, indicating it isn't contributing negatively, but not positively influencing the prediction either.
   - **Rule 6** SHAP values range from approximately **0.0160** to **0.0387**, positively influencing the prediction toward high loading.

**Insights and Problematic Rules:**

- **Rule 4** seems to be consistently contributing negative SHAP values in instances where the model underpredicts the loading (i.e., predicts low when it should be high). This suggests that **Rule 4** may be too restrictive or not accurately capturing the characteristics of molecules that should predict high loading.
  
- **Rule 5** also contributes negative SHAP values in underpredicted instances, indicating it may be misclassifying molecules that should lead to high loading due to over-penalization.

- **Rule 6** contributes positive SHAP values in overpredicted instances, suggesting it may be overestimating the contribution of certain molecular features, leading to incorrect high loading predictions.

- There is an indication of **underfitting** due to the low accuracy and inability of the current rules to capture the complexities within the dataset. The rules may be too simplistic or not adequately defined to generalize across the diverse set of molecules.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

1. **Refine Problematic Rules:**

   - **Rule 4 (Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Para-Substituted Amino or Nitro Groups):**
     - **Issue Identified:** The rule seems to contribute negative SHAP values in underpredictions. It may be too broad or not accounting for specific molecular contexts.
     - **Recommendation:** Re-express Rule 4 to be more specific. Consider incorporating additional molecular descriptors such as electronic effects, steric hindrance, or positional isomerism. For example, distinguish between different substituent positions (ortho, meta, para) and their impact on metal coordination.
     - **Adjustments:** Incorporate the effect of electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups on the aromatic ring's ability to coordinate with metals.

   - **Rule 5 (Heteroaromatic Carboxylic Acids with Coordinating Nitrogen Atoms):**
     - **Issue Identified:** Negative SHAP values in underpredictions suggest the rule may not be capturing all relevant heteroaromatic systems.
     - **Recommendation:** Expand Rule 5 to include heteroaromatic rings with multiple nitrogen atoms or other heteroatoms (like oxygen or sulfur) that can participate in coordination. Also, consider the influence of ring size and substitution patterns on coordination ability.
     - **Adjustments:** Include pyrimidine, imidazole, and other nitrogen-containing heterocycles known for strong metal coordination.

   - **Rule 6 (Modifiers with Fluorinated Alkyl Chains):**
     - **Issue Identified:** Positive SHAP values in overpredictions indicate the rule may be overestimating the negative impact of fluorination.
     - **Recommendation:** Refine Rule 6 to consider the degree of fluorination and the position of fluorine atoms relative to coordinating groups. Not all fluorinated compounds may hinder metal coordination equally.
     - **Adjustments:** Specify thresholds for fluorination levels that significantly impact coordination, and consider exceptions where fluorination does not impede metal binding.

2. **Enhance Rule Specificity and Coverage:**

   - **Generalization Improvement:** Modify existing rules to cover exceptions and include additional molecular features that influence metal coordination. Incorporate more nuanced chemical insights, such as chelation angles, bite distances, and the role of specific functional group orientations.

   - **New Rules Development:** Consider adding new rules that capture patterns not addressed by current rules. For example, introduce rules for compounds with multiple coordinating groups separated by specific chain lengths or rules that account for molecules capable of forming chelate rings of optimal size with metal centers.

3. **Use Insights from SHAP Analysis:**

   - **Identify Key Molecular Features:** Utilize SHAP analysis to determine which molecular features consistently contribute to mispredictions. For molecules frequently misclassified, analyze their structural characteristics and determine if current rules fail to account for these features.

   - **Iterative Rule Refinement:** Apply an iterative process to adjust the rules, reassess their impact using SHAP values, and continue refining until the rules align better with experimental observations.

4. **Address Overfitting and Underfitting:**

   - **Overfitting Prevention:** Ensure that rules are not overly tailored to specific molecules in the training set. Avoid adding overly complex conditions that only apply to a small number of cases.

   - **Underfitting Correction:** Increase the complexity of rules where necessary to capture the essential variations in the data. This may involve combining multiple rules or adding new ones to better represent the diversity of molecular structures.

5. **Validation and Testing:**

   - **Re-evaluate Model Performance:** After refining the rules, retrain the model and assess whether there is an improvement in validation accuracy. Monitor changes in SHAP values to verify that adjustments have the intended effect.

   - **Cross-Validation:** Continue using k-fold cross-validation to ensure that improvements generalize across different subsets of data and are not due to random chance.

**Conclusion:**

The current rules show limitations in accurately predicting the loading of modifiers on catalysts, as evidenced by the decreased validation accuracy and the SHAP analysis. By refining problematic rules, enhancing specificity, and incorporating additional chemical insights, the model's performance can potentially be improved. It is crucial to balance rule complexity to capture necessary details without overfitting, ensuring that the model generalizes well to new data. Iterative refinement guided by SHAP analysis will help in developing more effective rules for predicting catalyst behavior.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

The primary goal is to extract rules from SMILES representations to describe the catalytic action of modified catalysts, specifically to optimize and control the yield of a radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. The current set of rules (Rules 1–15) aims to predict whether a molecular modifier will result in a high or low yield based on its structural features.

**Key Observations from Rule Metrics and Model Performance:**

1. **Improved Confidence and Lift but Decreased Support:**
   - **Train Confidence** increased to **72.5%**, indicating that when the conditions of the rules are met, the prediction of high yield is more likely to be correct.
   - **Train Lift** increased to **1.46**, suggesting that the rules are effective at identifying high-yield cases beyond random chance.
   - **Train Support** decreased to **4.29%**, meaning the rules are applicable to a smaller portion of the dataset, which may indicate overfitting or overly specific rules.

2. **Validation Accuracy Fluctuations:**
   - The 5-fold validation accuracy varies, with the current model achieving **45.71%**, a decrease from previous iterations. This suggests the model may not generalize well to unseen data.

3. **SHAP Analysis Insights:**
   - Certain rules contribute negatively to correct predictions of high yield, while others may be overestimating the impact of specific features, leading to incorrect predictions.
   - For example, **Rule 4** and **Rule 5** often have negative SHAP values when high yield is underpredicted, indicating these rules may need refinement.

**Suggestions to Improve Current Rules:**

1. **Refine Rule Definitions and SMARTS Patterns:**
   - **Rule 1 (Aliphatic Dicarboxylic Amino Acids):**
     - **Issue:** The current code may not ensure adjacency of functional groups.
     - **Action:** Modify the SMARTS patterns to ensure that the amino group and the two carboxylic acid groups are on adjacent carbons. Use more specific patterns that represent the exact spatial arrangement required.

   - **Rule 2 (Short-Chain Aliphatic Amino Acids):**
     - **Issue:** The distance calculation between amino and carboxylic groups may be inaccurate.
     - **Action:** Implement a method to accurately calculate the number of carbon atoms between functional groups, accounting for branching and rings.

   - **Rule 3 (Polyhydroxy Carboxylic Acids):**
     - **Issue:** The code might not correctly identify polyhydroxy compounds.
     - **Action:** Adjust patterns to count multiple hydroxyl groups attached to carbons and set appropriate thresholds in `count_threshold`.

   - **Rule 4 (Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Para-Substituted Amino or Nitro Groups):**
     - **Issue:** Patterns may be too specific or not capturing all relevant compounds.
     - **Action:** Broaden SMARTS patterns to include various para-substituted groups and ensure correct positioning relative to the carboxyl group.

   - **Rule 5 (Heteroaromatic Carboxylic Acids with Coordinating Nitrogen Atoms):**
     - **Issue:** The current patterns may not ensure the carboxylic acid is attached to the heteroaromatic ring.
     - **Action:** Modify patterns to specifically match heteroaromatic rings with attached carboxylic acids, ensuring coordination-capable nitrogen atoms are present.

2. **Implement Remaining Rules (Rules 7–15):**
   - **Issue:** Only Rules 1–6 are currently implemented in the code.
   - **Action:** Develop and incorporate code for Rules 7–15 to capture additional structural features that influence yield.

3. **Improve Code Robustness and Accuracy:**
   - **Ensure Consistent Use of Patterns:** Avoid mismatches in `count_threshold` by using consistent identifiers or original SMARTS strings as keys.
   - **Exclude Unwanted Structures More Effectively:** Modify exclusion patterns to prevent unintended matches, especially for aromatic systems.
   - **Utilize Custom Functions for Complex Rules:** For rules involving spatial arrangements or steric effects, consider writing custom functions instead of relying solely on SMARTS patterns.

4. **Balance Rule Specificity and Generality:**
   - **Issue:** Low support indicates that rules may be too specific.
   - **Action:** Generalize rules where possible to increase coverage without significantly reducing confidence. This may involve relaxing certain conditions or incorporating common substructures seen in high-yield modifiers.

5. **Evaluate and Refine Problematic Rules Based on SHAP Analysis:**
   - **Rule 4 and Rule 5:** Adjust the rules to minimize their negative impact on high-yield predictions, possibly by redefining the structural features they capture.
   - **Rule 6:** Reassess the influence of fluorination on yield and adjust the rule to reflect cases where fluorination does not impede metal binding.

6. **Incorporate Additional Molecular Features:**
   - **Electronic Effects:** Consider the electron-donating or withdrawing nature of substituents and their positions.
   - **Steric Factors:** Account for steric hindrance that may affect metal coordination.
   - **Chemo-physical Properties:** Include descriptors such as hydrophobicity, molecular weight, and flexibility.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

Yes, there is a possibility for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting:

- **Increase Rule Support:** By refining the rules to be more inclusive, we can cover a larger portion of the dataset, reducing the risk of overfitting.

- **Monitor Model Performance on Validation Data:** Continuously evaluate the model using cross-validation to ensure that changes improve generalization performance.

- **Prevent Overfitting through Regularization:** Apply techniques such as penalizing overly complex rules or setting minimum support thresholds.

- **Iterative Refinement:** Use the insights from SHAP analysis to iteratively refine the rules, ensuring they contribute positively to accurate predictions.

- **Comprehensive Implementation of Rules:** By implementing all the proposed rules and ensuring they are correctly capturing the intended molecular features, we can enhance the model's predictive power.

**Conclusion**

The current rules have room for improvement, and further optimization is possible and necessary to enhance prediction accuracy and generalizability. By implementing the suggestions above, we can refine the rules to better capture the relationship between molecular structures and catalytic performance.
