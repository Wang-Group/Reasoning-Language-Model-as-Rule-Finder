**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are linear aliphatic monocarboxylic acids with chain lengths up to eight carbons result in high yield. Terminal amino or hydroxy groups are acceptable on chains with five carbons or fewer; however, if the chain is six carbons or longer, terminal amino or hydroxy groups lead to low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Unbranched aliphatic acids can efficiently interact with the catalyst without steric hindrance. Terminal functional groups on longer chains may interfere with catalyst interaction or the reaction mechanism.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **Octanoic acid**
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are Î±-amino dicarboxylic acids (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) result in high yield, while amino acids with hydrophobic or bulky aromatic side chains result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Polar side chains enhance interactions with the catalyst, promoting high yield. Hydrophobic or bulky side chains may cause steric hindrance or reduce catalyst compatibility.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with polar substituents (e.g., amino, nitro groups) at the para position result in high yield, whereas those with non-polar substituents (e.g., methyl groups) or electron-withdrawing aldehyde groups at the para position result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Polar substituents can enhance the electronic interaction with the catalyst, improving reactivity. Non-polar or electron-withdrawing groups may decrease reactivity or hinder catalyst interaction.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers where the carboxylic acid group is directly attached to a nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring result in high yield; those where the heteroaromatic ring is connected through an additional aromatic ring result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Direct attachment allows effective coordination with metal centers in the catalyst. Additional aromatic rings can introduce steric hindrance and reduce effective interaction.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups on short chains (three carbons) result in high yield, whereas those with thiol groups attached directly to an aromatic ring result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**
  - *Rationale*: Thiol groups on short aliphatic chains can act as ligands enhancing catalyst activity. Thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings can strongly bind to metal centers, deactivating the catalyst.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain result in high yield, while those with a single hydroxyl group on longer chains result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and interaction with the catalyst. A single hydroxyl group on a long chain may not offer these benefits and can introduce unfavorable steric effects.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing polyether chains ending with a carboxylic acid group result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Polyether chains can increase flexibility and steric bulk, reducing the ability of the modifier to interact effectively with the catalyst.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with perfluoroalkyl groups attached to the carboxylic acid result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Perfluoroalkyl groups are highly electron-withdrawing and hydrophobic, which can hinder interactions with the catalyst and reduce solubility in the reaction medium.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups attached to aromatic rings result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde and ketone groups can react with active sites or coordinate with metal centers in the catalyst, disrupting its activity.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with electron-rich heteroaromatic side chains result in high yield, whereas those with simple hydrophobic aromatic side chains result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Electron-rich heteroaromatic rings can enhance interactions with the catalyst, while simple hydrophobic rings may not provide the necessary interaction for high yield.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing functional groups that strongly coordinate to metals (e.g., trifluoroacetyl groups) result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation.**
  - *Rationale*: Strongly coordinating groups can bind to metal centers in the catalyst, reducing its availability and activity.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy or hydroxy-substituted phenyl groups connected via a short aliphatic chain result in high yield, while those with these substituents directly attached to the benzene ring result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: The aliphatic chain can provide flexibility and optimal positioning of functional groups for better catalyst interaction. Direct substitution on the aromatic ring may hinder effective binding due to steric factors.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**
