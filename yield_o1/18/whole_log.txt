- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear and supported by data (entries 19 and 22), providing insight into the negative impact of para-substituted formyl or methyl groups on yield. However, it partially overlaps with Rule 11 regarding formyl groups, which may reduce overall clarity. Consolidating overlapping rules could improve clarity and effectiveness.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear and supported by multiple data points (entries 5, 29, 31, and 34), effectively distinguishing between modifiers with and without terminal functional groups. It offers good property insight and balances complexity with coverage, satisfying all the criteria.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear and supported by data (entries 16 and 21), highlighting the positive effect of heteroaromatic rings directly attached to carboxylic acid groups on yield. It meets the criteria for clarity, property insight, complexity, and coverage.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear and well-supported (entries 13 and 15), providing insight into how the size and electron richness of aromatic side chains in amino acids affect yield. It effectively balances complexity with sufficient coverage, satisfying all criteria.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is clear, with good property insight into the positional effects of thiol groups on yield. It is supported by data (entries 10 and 17), satisfying the criteria for clarity, property insight, complexity, and coverage.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 lacks sufficient coverage, being supported by only one data point (entry 9). While it provides property insight into the positive effect of aliphatic polyhydroxy acids on yield, the low coverage affects its robustness and effectiveness.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is supported by only one data point (entry 14), limiting its coverage. Although it offers property insight into the negative impact of electron-withdrawing perfluoroalkyl chains on yield, more data points are needed to strengthen the rule and meet the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is complex but clear, considering combinations of substituents and their electronic properties on aromatic carboxylic acids. Supported by data (entries 25, 26, and 28), it provides good property insight and has adequate coverage, satisfying the criteria.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 partially overlaps with Rule 3, both addressing modifiers with formyl groups leading to low yield. This redundancy may reduce clarity. It is supported by data (entries 18 and 19), but consolidating overlapping rules would improve clarity and adherence to the criteria.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is somewhat vague regarding "extensive ether linkages," but examples help clarify its scope. It is supported by data (entries 11 and 32), providing property insight into how flexible ether-containing chains negatively affect yield. Clarity could be improved by specifying the extent of ether linkages.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 has limited coverage, being supported by only one data point (entry 33). Additionally, the existence of a counterexample (entry 3: 5-aminopentanoic acid with high yield) suggests exceptions, reducing clarity and property insight. Expanding coverage or refining the rule could enhance its effectiveness.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 is redundant with Rule 4, as both address modifiers with terminal hydroxyl groups resulting in low yield. It is supported by only one data point (entry 29). Consolidating this rule with Rule 4 would improve clarity and coverage.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 is supported by only one data point (entry 27), providing limited coverage. While it offers property insight into the negative effect of internal ketone groups on yield, the low coverage and specificity reduce its overall effectiveness according to the criteria.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Consolidate overlapping rules to enhance clarity and reduce redundancy**. Specifically, merge **Rule 3** and **Rule 11** since both address modifiers with formyl (aldehyde) groups on aromatic rings leading to low yields. A unified rule could state: "Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with formyl groups on the ring result in low yield."

- **Advice 2**: **Combine Rule 14 with Rule 4** because both deal with aliphatic carboxylic acids having terminal hydroxyl or amino groups resulting in low yield. The consolidated rule can be: "Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids without terminal functional groups result in high yield, whereas those with terminal hydroxyl or amino groups result in low yield."

- **Advice 3**: **Refine rules with limited data support to improve coverage or consider merging them with related rules**. For instance, **Rule 8** (polyhydroxy acids leading to high yield) and **Rule 15** (internal ketone groups leading to low yield) are each supported by a single data point. Evaluate additional data or integrate these into broader rules encompassing similar functional groups affecting yield.

- **Advice 4**: **Clarify vague terms in rules to enhance understanding**. In **Rule 12**, specify what constitutes "extensive ether linkages" by defining the number of ether groups or chain length that negatively impact yield. This will make the rule more precise and easier to apply.

- **Advice 5**: **Broaden rules to include similar functional groups affecting yield**. For example, expand **Rule 9** to include other strong electron-withdrawing groups beyond perfluoroalkyl chains. The revised rule could be: "Modifiers containing strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., perfluoroalkyl chains, trifluoromethyl groups) attached to a carboxylic acid result in low yield."

- **Advice 6**: **Reassess rules with limited coverage and potential exceptions**. **Rule 13** has limited support and exceptions (e.g., entry 3: 5-aminopentanoic acid results in high yield). Refine this rule to specify conditions under which long aliphatic chains with terminal amino groups result in low yield or consider integrating it into a broader rule about terminal functional groups.

- **Advice 7**: **Ensure that each rule is supported by multiple data points to enhance robustness**. For rules currently supported by a single data point (e.g., Rules 8, 9, 15), seek additional data or literature examples to either reinforce these rules or decide if they should be omitted or restructured.

- **Advice 8**: **Simplify and generalize rules where possible to cover more cases while maintaining clarity**. For instance, create a general rule about the effect of electron-donating versus electron-withdrawing substituents on aromatic carboxylic acids. This can encompass insights from **Rules 2**, **3**, **10**, and **11**.

- **Advice 9**: **Maintain a balance between rule complexity and coverage**. Avoid overly specific rules that apply to very few cases. Instead, strive for rules that are broad enough to cover multiple examples but specific enough to provide clear guidance on yield outcomes.

- **Advice 10**: **Use consistent terminology and structure across all rules**. This includes uniform use of chemical nomenclature, specifying positions of substituents, and clearly indicating whether they lead to high or low yield. Consistency will improve readability and application of the rules.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**
- **Comment 1**: **Rule 1** is clear and allows us to determine whether a modifier will result in high yield based on the presence of an amino group and two carboxylic acid groups on an aliphatic chain. It combines multiple functional groups, offering good complexity. The rule is supported by at least two data points ((2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid and (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid), satisfying the coverage criterion. The rule also reflects the chemical reasoning of how such groups might interact with the catalyst, providing adequate property insight.

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 2** is clear in specifying that modifiers are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (amino or methoxy) at the para position, resulting in high yield. It effectively combines sub-structures (aromatic ring, carboxylic acid, para electron-donating substituents), meeting the complexity criterion. The rule is supported by multiple data points (e.g., 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid), satisfying coverage. It also provides chemical insight into the effect of electron-donating groups on reactivity.

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 3** clearly states that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (formyl or methyl) at the para position result in low yield, which is easy to apply. It considers combinations of structural features, satisfying complexity. The rule is supported by data points (4-formylbenzoic acid, 4-methylbenzoic acid), satisfying coverage. The rule provides chemical insight into how electron-withdrawing groups affect the yield.

- **Comment 4**: **Rule 4** is clear and allows us to distinguish modifiers based on the presence or absence of terminal functional groups on straight-chain aliphatic monocarboxylic acids. It effectively considers combinations of sub-structures, addressing complexity. The rule is well-supported with multiple data points for both high yield (octanoic acid) and low yield (7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid), satisfying coverage. There's adequate chemical insight into how terminal functional groups affect yield.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** attempts to define when modifiers containing heteroaromatic rings result in high yield based on the position of nitrogen and direct attachment of the carboxylic acid. While the rule is detailed, its clarity is diminished due to complexity and inconsistencies with data points. For instance, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid results in high yield despite not meeting the rule's criteria, suggesting a need for refinement. The rule lacks sufficient coverage and clarity.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** provides a clear distinction between amino acids with electron-rich heterocyclic aromatic side chains and those with simpler aromatic side chains regarding yield. It offers chemical insight and adequate complexity. However, the rule is supported by only one high-yield data point (Tryptophan) and one low-yield data point (Phenylalanine), which may not satisfy the coverage criterion fully. Additional data points would strengthen the rule's validity.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** clearly distinguishes between modifiers with thiol groups on aliphatic chains resulting in high yield and those on aromatic rings resulting in low yield. It provides chemical insight and has acceptable complexity. However, the rule is based on only one high-yield data point (3-sulfanylpropanoic acid) and one low-yield data point (4-sulfanylbenzoic acid), which may not fully satisfy the coverage criterion. Additional data points would enhance the rule's reliability.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** effectively differentiates between aliphatic polyhydroxy acids and monohydroxy acids in terms of yield. It offers reasonable chemical insight and acceptable complexity by considering the number of hydroxyl groups. However, with only one data point for high yield (Gluconic acid) and one for low yield (7-hydroxyheptanoic acid), the rule falls short on the coverage criterion. More data points are needed to strengthen this rule.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** is clear but may be overly specific, focusing on perfluoroalkyl chains attached to carboxylic acids resulting in low yield. While it provides property insight regarding electron-withdrawing effects, the rule lacks complexity and is supported by only one data point, failing to meet the coverage criterion. Additional examples are needed to validate this rule.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** is clear but perhaps too narrow, focusing on amino acids with long aliphatic side chains modified with acetamido groups resulting in low yield. The rule shows complexity but lacks coverage, being supported by only one data point. It needs more data to confirm its validity.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** is clear and precisely defines modifiers resulting in low yield based on the presence of aldehyde groups adjacent to carboxylic acids on aromatic rings. It meets the complexity and coverage criteria, being supported by at least two data points. The rule also provides reasonable chemical insight into how such groups might lower yield.

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** adequately describes modifiers that result in low yield due to the presence of extensive ether linkages leading to a carboxylic acid. It offers acceptable complexity and is supported by at least two data points, satisfying the coverage criterion. It provides some property insight into how flexible ether chains may negatively affect yield.

- **Comment 13**: **Rule 13** identifies modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating methoxy groups, resulting in high yield. While the rule is clear and provides property insight into the role of electron-donating groups, it lacks coverage, being supported by only one data point. It may overlap with **Rule 2**, which also considers electron-donating groups, suggesting redundancy.

- **Comment 14**: **Rule 14** lacks clarity and may be counterintuitive, as nitro groups are electron-withdrawing yet are stated to result in high yield. The rule is only supported by one data point for each case, not fulfilling the coverage criterion. The property insight is limited, and the rule may need further investigation and clarification.

- **Comment 15**: **Rule 15** is clear but perhaps overly specific, focusing on modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with internal ketone groups resulting in low yield. It lacks coverage, being supported by only one data point. Additional data points are needed to confirm this rule's validity.
**End of Comments**
---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Consolidate Overlapping Rules for Clarity**

  Combine **Rule 3** and **Rule 11**, as both address modifiers with formyl groups on aromatic rings resulting in low yield. The consolidated rule could state:

  - *New Rule*: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (formyl or methyl) at the para position or adjacent to the carboxylic acid group result in low yield**.

  This improves clarity by eliminating redundancy and enhancing coverage.

- **Advice 2**: **Refine Rule 5 to Align with Data**

  Modify **Rule 5** to account for exceptions and improve consistency with the data. The current rule does not explain why **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** results in high yield despite not fitting the criteria. Adjust the rule as follows:

  - *Revised Rule*: **Modifiers containing heteroaromatic rings (such as pyridine or pyrazole) directly attached to a carboxylic acid group result in high yield. If the heteroaromatic ring is connected via an aliphatic linker (e.g., butanoic acid) and the nitrogen atom is not directly adjacent to the carboxyl group, high yield can still result**.

  This revision accounts for data points like **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** (entry 24) and improves the rule's applicability.

- **Advice 3**: **Enhance Rules with Limited Coverage**

  For rules supported by only one or two data points (e.g., **Rules 8, 9, 10, and 15**), consider the following actions:

  - **Expand Data**: Seek additional data points to strengthen these rules' validity.
  - **Merge with Related Rules**: Integrate these rules with others that address similar structural features to enhance coverage.

  For example, merge **Rule 8** with **Rule 4** by noting the effect of hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains:

  - *Combined Rule*: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids without terminal functional groups result in high yield, whereas those with terminal or multiple hydroxyl groups result in low yield unless they are polyhydroxy acids, which may result in high yield**.

- **Advice 4**: **Clarify and Simplify Rule 14**

  **Rule 14** is counterintuitive as nitro groups are electron-withdrawing yet are associated with high yield. Reevaluate this rule for accuracy. Consider merging it with **Rule 2**, which focuses on electron-donating groups, and provide clarification:

  - *Revised Rule*: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong activating groups (such as amino) or certain electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro) at the para position result in high yield**.

  Provide chemical insight into why nitro groups might lead to high yield in this specific reaction, possibly due to their ability to participate in specific interactions or stabilization.

- **Advice 5**: **Integrate Rules Based on Electronic Effects**

  Combine **Rules 2, 3, and 13** to create a comprehensive rule centered on electronic effects of substituents:

  - *Integrated Rule*: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (amino, methoxy) at the para position result in high yield, while those with electron-withdrawing groups (formyl, methyl, trifluoroacetylamino) result in low yield**.

  This integration simplifies the rule set and makes it easier to predict outcomes based on substituent electronics.

- **Advice 6**: **Specify Criteria in Rule 12**

  Improve **Rule 12** by defining what constitutes "extensive ether linkages" and "flexible ether chains." For example:

  - *Revised Rule*: **Modifiers containing three or more ether linkages in a linear chain ending with a carboxylic acid result in low yield**.

  This specificity enhances clarity and helps users apply the rule more effectively.

- **Advice 7**: **Reevaluate or Remove Weak Rules**

  If certain rules cannot be strengthened due to limited data (e.g., **Rules 9, 10, and 15**), consider removing them to maintain rule quality. Alternatively, incorporate their insights into other rules where appropriate.

- **Advice 8**: **Account for Exceptions in Rules**

  Include exceptions or notes within rules to handle outliers. For **Rule 5**, acknowledge that some modifiers not fitting the initial criteria can still result in high yield:

  - *Addition to Rule 5*: **Note that modifiers where the heteroaromatic ring is connected via an aliphatic linker may still result in high yield if other favorable interactions are present**.

- **Advice 9**: **Merge Similar Rules for Broader Coverage**

  Identify rules that address similar features and combine them. For instance, merge aspects of **Rules 4, 8, and 14** that deal with hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains:

  - *Merged Rule*: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups result in high yield, whereas those with hydroxyl groups—especially monohydroxy acids—result in low yield, unless they are polyhydroxy acids like gluconic acid, which result in high yield**.

- **Advice 10**: **Enhance Property Insight in Rules**

  Provide brief explanations within each rule to convey the chemical reasoning behind the observed effects. For example:

  - *Addition to Rule 4*: **The absence of terminal functional groups in aliphatic carboxylic acids may reduce steric hindrance and unfavorable interactions with the catalyst, leading to higher yield**.

  This approach enhances understanding and aids in the practical application of the rules.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and allows for easy determination of expected yield based on the modifier structure. It provides good physicochemical insight into how terminal amino or hydroxyl groups on longer chains negatively affect the reaction. The rule appropriately considers combinations of substructures and is well-supported by multiple data points, offering a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 is clear and enables straightforward predictions for α-amino dicarboxylic acids resulting in high yield. It provides adequate physicochemical insight into how the presence of both amino and dicarboxylic groups can positively influence the reaction. The rule incorporates multiple substructures and is supported by at least two examples, representing a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 is clear, allowing for precise predictions based on the position and nature of substituents on aromatic carboxylic acids. It offers good physicochemical insight into the effects of electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups. The rule combines considerations of functional group type and position and is well-supported by multiple data points, achieving a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 presents a contradiction with Rule 3 regarding the effect of electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups at the para position on yield. While the rule is clear in its description, the lack of consistent physicochemical insight undermines its validity. This inconsistency needs to be addressed to prevent confusion.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is clear in its structural requirements and provides physicochemical insight into how the position of heteroatoms can influence the reaction yield. It considers complex substructures and is well-supported by multiple data points, achieving a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 is clear and provides insight into how electron-rich heterocycles in side chains enhance yield. It considers combinations of substructures and is supported by two examples, though additional data points could strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 clearly differentiates between the impact of sulfanyl groups on aliphatic versus aromatic systems. It offers physicochemical insight into how the position affects yield and is supported by data, although more examples could enhance coverage.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 effectively distinguishes the impact of multiple hydroxyl groups versus a single terminal hydroxyl group on yield, providing good physicochemical insight. It balances complexity and is supported by sufficient data.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is clear but lacks coverage, being supported by only one data point. While the physicochemical insight is plausible, additional examples are needed to strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 clearly identifies modifiers with long ether chains as resulting in low yield. It provides reasonable physicochemical insight and is supported by two examples, though more data points could enhance coverage.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 effectively differentiates the impact of functional group positioning on yield, offering physicochemical reasoning. It achieves a balance between complexity and coverage, though more data points would strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 12**: While Rule 12 is clear, it is supported by only one data point, limiting its coverage. Additional examples are needed to confirm the rule and enhance its reliability.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is clear but lacks coverage, being based on a single data point. While the physicochemical insight is plausible, more examples are necessary to validate the rule.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 is clear but has limited coverage, being supported by only one example. While it offers physicochemical insight, additional data points are needed for validation.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 is clear but lacks coverage, with only one supporting data point. The physicochemical reasoning is sound, but more examples are required to confirm the rule's validity.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Address the inconsistency between Rule 3 and Rule 4 regarding electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**. Nitro groups are strong electron-withdrawing groups, yet in Rule 4 they are associated with high yield, while in Rule 3, electron-withdrawing groups like formyl are associated with low yield. Re-express these rules to reflect that not all electron-withdrawing groups have the same effect. Consider the role of resonance stabilization and how nitro groups can participate differently compared to other electron-withdrawing substituents. You might categorize substituents based on their electronic and resonance effects rather than just their electron-withdrawing or donating nature.

- **Advice 2**: **Combine rules with limited coverage or similar themes to strengthen them**. Rules 9, 12, 13, 14, and 15 each have limited coverage, often based on a single data point. To improve their robustness:

  - Merge Rules 9 and 15 by creating a broader rule about modifiers containing strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., perfluoroalkyl, trifluoroacetylamino) resulting in low yield.
  
  - Combine Rules 12 and 13 by formulating a rule about aliphatic modifiers with internal functional groups (e.g., ketones, acetamido groups) leading to low yield.

  - Integrate Rule 14 with Rule 11 to encompass modifiers where methoxy or hydroxy groups are present, specifying the positions and their impact on yield.

- **Advice 3**: **Increase coverage for rules supported by few data points by seeking additional examples**. For Rules 6, 7, and 8:

  - **Rule 6**: Identify more amino acids or modifiers with electron-rich heterocycles to confirm that this structural feature consistently results in high yield.
  
  - **Rule 7**: Find additional modifiers with sulfanyl groups on aliphatic and aromatic systems to validate the rule's applicability.
  
  - **Rule 8**: Include more examples of polyhydroxy acids and monohydroxy acids to strengthen the distinction in their effects on yield.

- **Advice 4**: **Refine Rule 5 to account for exceptions and improve clarity**. The current rule does not explain why 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid results in high yield despite the heteroaromatic ring not being directly attached to the carboxylic acid. Adjust the rule to:

  - Include modifiers where the heteroaromatic ring is connected via a short aliphatic chain, provided the overall molecule allows for interaction that enhances yield.
  
  - Specify that certain structural arrangements, even if not directly attached, can still result in high yield due to spatial or electronic factors.

- **Advice 5**: **Consolidate Rules 11 and 14 to eliminate overlap and clarify the impact of methoxy and hydroxy groups**. Develop a single rule that:

  - Differentiates between modifiers with methoxy or hydroxy groups on extended aliphatic chains versus those directly on the aromatic ring.
  
  - Explains how the position of these groups affects resonance and electron density, influencing the yield.

- **Advice 6**: **Broaden Rule 10 to improve coverage and utility**. Since the current rule focuses on long ether chains ending with a carboxylic acid group, consider:

  - Expanding the rule to include modifiers with flexible ether linkages in general, which might hinder effective interaction with the catalyst.
  
  - Providing additional examples to reinforce the rule or integrating it with other rules addressing modifiers with flexible or bulky substituents.

- **Advice 7**: **Ensure consistent application of electronic and steric principles across all rules**. Review the physicochemical reasoning behind each rule to:

  - Apply concepts like resonance, inductive effects, and steric hindrance uniformly.
  
  - Avoid contradictions and enhance the predictive power of the rules by grounding them in well-established chemical principles.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Adjust Rule 1 High-Yield SMARTS Pattern**  
  The current pattern `C(=O)O` in Rule 1 matches any carboxylic acid group, which is too general and results in every SMILES string matching this rule. Update the SMARTS pattern to specifically match unbranched aliphatic monocarboxylic acids without additional functional groups. For example, use a pattern like `C([CH2]){1,}C(=O)O` while ensuring that there are no branching points or additional functional groups in the molecule.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Revise Rule 2 SMARTS Pattern for α-Amino Dicarboxylic Acids**  
  The current pattern for Rule 2 does not accurately capture amino acids with two carboxyl groups (α-amino dicarboxylic acids). Modify the SMARTS pattern to specifically identify molecules where an amino group is attached to the alpha carbon, and the side chain contains a second carboxylic acid group. A possible pattern could be `[NX3][CH]([CX3](=O)[OX1H])[CH2][CX3](=O)[OX1H]`.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Correct Rule 3 Low-Yield SMARTS Pattern for Electron-Withdrawing Groups**  
  The current low-yield pattern in Rule 3 (`c1ccc[C](=O)[H]cc1C(=O)O`) is not accurately representing aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups like formyl at the para position. Adjust the pattern to correctly represent the formyl group attached to the aromatic ring. A revised pattern could be `c1ccc(C=O)cc1C(=O)O`.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Enhance Specificity of All SMARTS Patterns to Match Natural Language Rules**  
  Review and refine the SMARTS patterns for all rules to ensure they precisely match the structural descriptions provided. This includes specifying chain lengths, ensuring correct placement of functional groups, and preventing overgeneralization that leads to false positives. Use recursive SMARTS or additional constraints where necessary to improve specificity.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Re-evaluate the Feature Matrix After Updating SMARTS Patterns**  
  Once the SMARTS patterns are corrected, generate the feature matrix again and verify that the 1s and -1s accurately correspond to the modifiers as per the rules. Ensure that modifiers matching high-yield criteria are marked with 1, those matching low-yield criteria are marked with -1, and modifiers not matching any rule are correctly marked with 0.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: **Adjust the SMARTS pattern for Rule 1 (High Yield)**. The current pattern `'[CH3][CH2]{3,}[C](=O)[OH]'` may not match unbranched aliphatic monocarboxylic acids of varying chain lengths, such as octanoic acid (`CCCCCCCC(=O)O`). Modify the pattern to match any unbranched alkyl chain ending with a carboxylic acid group, regardless of length. A revised pattern could be `'C(=O)OCC[C,C][C,C][C,C][C,C][C,C][C,C]'` or more generally `'C(=O)OCCCCCCCC'` with variable chain length.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: **Refine the SMARTS pattern for Rule 2 (High Yield)**. The current pattern `'[NH2][CH](C(=O)[OH])[CH2]{1,2}[C](=O)[OH]'` may not correctly match α-amino dicarboxylic acids like glutamic acid (`C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N`). Update the pattern to accommodate different chain lengths and stereochemistry, such as `'[NH2][CH](C(=O)O)[CH2][CH2]C(=O)O'` for glutamic acid and `'[NH2][CH](C(=O)O)CC(=O)O'` for aspartic acid.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: **Refine the SMARTS patterns for Rule 3 (High Yield) and Rule 3.1 (Low Yield)**. The current patterns may be too specific or not specific enough, leading to incorrect matches like phthalic anhydride. Use atomic mapping to ensure substituents are at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid. For Rule 3 (High Yield), use `'c1ccc(cc1)C(=O)O'` with an amino group at the para position: `'c1cc(N)ccc1C(=O)O'`. For Rule 3.1 (Low Yield), use a pattern for electron-withdrawing groups at the para position: `'c1cc(C=O)ccc1C(=O)O'`.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: **Refine the SMARTS patterns for Rule 4 (High Yield) and Rule 4.1 (Low Yield)**. Similar to Suggestion 3, ensure that substituents are correctly positioned. For Rule 4 (High Yield), match aromatic carboxylic acids with a nitro group at the para position: `'c1cc([N+](=O)[O-])ccc1C(=O)O'`. For Rule 4.1 (Low Yield), match those with a methyl group at the para position: `'c1cc(C)ccc1C(=O)O'`.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: **Generalize the SMARTS pattern for Rule 5 (High Yield)**. The current pattern `'[nH0]1cccc1C(=O)O'` may not capture all heteroaromatic carboxylic acids where the heteroaromatic ring is directly attached to the carboxylic acid. Expand the pattern to include different heteroaromatic rings and positions, such as pyridine, pyrazole, and pyridone derivatives. Consider using patterns like `'[nH0]1[n,c]ccc1C(=O)O'` or include multiple patterns for different ring systems.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: **Adjust the SMARTS patterns for Rule 6 (High Yield and Low Yield)**. Ensure the pattern for high yield matches amino acids with electron-rich aromatic heterocycles, like tryptophan. Update the pattern to `'[NH2][CH](C(=O)O)CC1=CNC2=CC=CC=C12'` for tryptophan. For low yield (simple aromatic side chains), use `'[NH2][CH](C(=O)O)CC1=CC=CC=C1'` for phenylalanine.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: **Generalize the SMARTS pattern for Rule 7 (High Yield)**. The current pattern `'[SH][CH2][CH2]C(=O)O'` is too specific. Modify it to match any aliphatic chain with a thiol group, such as `'[SH][CX4][CX4]C(=O)O'` or more generally `'[SH][C][C][C](=O)O'`.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: **Expand the SMARTS pattern for Rule 8 (High Yield)**. The current pattern may not match all aliphatic polyhydroxy acids. Use a pattern that allows for multiple hydroxyl groups along the chain, such as `'C(=O)O[CH2][CH](O)[CH](O)[CH](O)[CH2]O'` or use recursive SMARTS to match multiple hydroxyls: `'C(=O)O[CH2][CH](O)[CH2][CH](O)[CH2]O'`.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: **Adjust the SMARTS pattern for Rule 9 (Low Yield)**. The pattern `'C(=O)O[CX4](F)(F)F'` matches only trifluoromethyl groups. To match perfluoroalkyl chains of varying lengths, use a pattern like `'C(=O)O[CX4](F)(F)[CX4](F)(F)F'` or more generally `'C(=O)O[CX4](F)(F)[CX2](F)(F)[CX2](F)(F)F'`.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: **Generalize the SMARTS pattern for Rule 10 (Low Yield)**. The current pattern `'C(=O)O[CH2][O][CH2][O][CH2][O][CH2]'` is specific to three ether units. Use a pattern that matches long ether chains of varying lengths, such as `'C(=O)O([CH2][O]){2,}[CH2]'`.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: **Refine the SMARTS patterns for Rule 11 (High Yield and Low Yield)**. Ensure that the high yield pattern matches methoxy or hydroxy groups on an extended aliphatic chain attached to the aromatic ring, and the low yield pattern matches those directly on the ring. Adjust the high yield pattern to `'C(=O)O[CH2][CH2][CH2]c1ccc(O)cc1'` and the low yield pattern to `'c1cc(O)ccc1[CH2][CH2]C(=O)O'`.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: **Adjust the SMARTS pattern for Rule 12 (Low Yield)**. The current pattern `'C(=O)[CH2][CH2]C(=O)O'` may not capture internal ketone groups in dicarboxylic acids. Modify it to include a ketone group within the chain: `'C(=O)O[CH2][CX3](=O)[CH2]C(=O)O'`.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: **Refine the SMARTS pattern for Rule 13 (Low Yield)**. Update the pattern to accurately match amino acids with long aliphatic side chains modified with acetamido groups. Use a pattern like `'[NH2][CH](C(=O)O)[CH2]{4}[NH][C](=O)C'` to match molecules like (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: **Review and test all SMARTS patterns against example compounds**. Implement unit tests using the provided examples to ensure each pattern correctly matches or doesn't match the intended structures. Adjust patterns based on test results to improve accuracy.

- ** Suggestion 15 **: **Consider using multiple SMARTS patterns for complex rules**. Some rules may require several patterns to capture all variations. For example, Rule 5 could use separate patterns for pyridine, pyridone, and pyrazole carboxylic acids.

- ** Suggestion 16 **: **Include stereochemistry and tautomer considerations**. Some molecules may have different stereochemistry or exist in tautomeric forms. Ensure SMARTS patterns account for these variations where relevant.

- ** Suggestion 17 **: **Use wildcard atoms or recursive SMARTS where appropriate**. This can increase flexibility in matching patterns without being too general. For example, use `'C(=O)O[CH2][O][CH2][O][CH2][O][CH2]'` with recursive patterns for Rule 10.

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: For **Rule 1** (High Yield), the code uses the pattern `[CH3][CH2]{3,}[C](=O)[OH]` which matches unbranched aliphatic monocarboxylic acids with at least **four** carbons (since `{3,}` means three or more CH₂ units). However, the rule does not specify a minimum chain length. To include shorter unbranched aliphatic monocarboxylic acids (e.g., propanoic acid, butanoic acid), adjust the pattern to `[CH3][CH2]{0,}[C](=O)[OH]` to match any chain length.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: For **Rule 1** (Low Yield), the patterns for terminal amino or hydroxyl groups on longer chains are `[NH2][CH2]{5,}[C](=O)[OH]` and `[OH][CH2]{5,}[C](=O)[OH]`, requiring at least seven carbons in the chain. However, the rule specifies "longer chains (7 or more carbons)" **including the terminal functional group and carboxylic acid carbon**. To ensure accurate matching, adjust the patterns to `[NH2][CH2]{4,}[C](=O)[OH]` and `[OH][CH2]{4,}[C](=O)[OH]` so the total carbon count is seven or more.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For **Rule 2** (High Yield), the pattern `[NH2][CH](C(=O)O)[CH2]{1,3}C(=O)O` may not match molecules with stereochemistry or alternative representations. To ensure all α-amino dicarboxylic acids are matched, regardless of stereochemistry, modify the pattern to `[N][CH](C(=O)O)[CH2]{1,3}C(=O)O`, removing hydrogen counts and allowing for different nitrogen representations.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: For **Rule 3** (High Yield), the pattern `c1cc(N)ccc1C(=O)O` may not capture all para-amino benzoic acid derivatives due to specific atom ordering. To match any aromatic carboxylic acid with an amino group at the para position, use a more general pattern like `c1ccc(cc1[NH2])C(=O)O` or implement recursive SMARTS to define para-substitution, such as `[$(c1ccc(cc1)C(=O)O),$([cH]1ccc([NH2])cc1C(=O)O)]`.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: For **Rule 3.1** (Low Yield), the pattern `c1cc(C=O)ccc1C(=O)O` may not account for other electron-withdrawing groups at the para position. To capture a broader range of electron-withdrawing substituents, generalize the pattern to `c1ccc(cc1C(=O)O)[CX3]=[OX1]`, which looks for an aldehyde group attached to the aromatic ring, or include substituents like nitro groups.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: For **Rule 4** (High Yield), the pattern `c1cc([N+](=O)[O-])ccc1C(=O)O` may be too specific. To match any nitro-substituted aromatic carboxylic acid with the nitro group at the para position, use a pattern like `c1ccc(cc1[N+](=O)[O-])C(=O)O`.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: For **Rule 4.1** (Low Yield), the pattern `c1cc(C)ccc1C(=O)O` may unintentionally match molecules without methyl substitution at the para position due to atom ordering. Use a more flexible pattern like `c1ccc(cc1C(=O)O)C` to ensure accurate matching of methyl groups at the para position.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: For **Rule 5** (High Yield), include tautomers and different representations of heteroaromatic rings. Use patterns that account for heteroatoms at various positions. For example, use a pattern like `[n,c]1cccc1C(=O)O` to match any five-membered heteroaromatic ring directly attached to a carboxylic acid group.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: For **Rule 6** (High Yield), the pattern `[NH2][CH](C(=O)[OH])[CH2][c]1c[nH]c2ccccc12` specifically matches tryptophan. To include other amino acids with electron-rich aromatic heterocycles (e.g., histidine), generalize the pattern to `[NH2][CH](C(=O)[OH])[CH2][c]1[n][c][c][c]1`.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: For **Rule 6.1** (Low Yield), the pattern `[NH2][CH](C(=O)[OH])[CH2][c]1ccccc1` matches phenylalanine. To ensure accurate matching, consider stereochemistry and alternative representations by using `[NH2][CH](C(=O)[OH])[CH2][c]1[cH][cH][cH][cH][cH]1`.

- ** Suggestion 11 **: For **Rule 8** (High Yield), the pattern `C(=O)O[CH2][CH](O)[CH](O)[CH](O)[CH2]O` is specific to gluconic acid. To match aliphatic polyhydroxy acids in general, use a more general pattern like `C(=O)O[CH2][CH](O)[CH](O)[CH2][OH]`, allowing for variability in the number of hydroxyl groups.

- ** Suggestion 12 **: For all patterns, consider removing explicit hydrogens (`[H]`) and variable atom counts where possible. Use wildcard characters (e.g., `*`) and variable repetitions (`{n,m}`) to make patterns more flexible and inclusive.

- ** Suggestion 13 **: Incorporate stereochemistry considerations by using `Chem.MolFromSmiles` with `sanitize=False` and then calling `Chem.Kekulize(mol, clearAromaticFlags=True)` to prevent stereo information from affecting substructure matching unintentionally.

- ** Suggestion 14 **: Include explicit aromaticity in patterns by using lowercase letters for aromatic atoms (e.g., `c`, `n`) and uppercase for aliphatic atoms (e.g., `C`, `N`) to improve matching of aromatic compounds.

- ** Suggestion 15 **: Test each SMARTS pattern individually against known examples of both matching and non-matching compounds to ensure the patterns are accurately capturing the intended structures.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Performance**

Upon reviewing the current rule metrics in comparison to the previous metrics, several observations can be made, particularly focusing on **confidence** and **lift**:

---

### **1. Confidence**

- **Previous Train Confidence**: Approximately **0.54 to 0.64**
  - *Values*: [0.5396, 0.6352]
- **Current Train Confidence**: **0.6528**

**Comment**:
- The current confidence is slightly higher than the previous average.
- **Interpretation**: This increase indicates that when the current rules' conditions are met, there is a higher probability (65.28%) that the rule prediction is correct.
- **Implication**: The rules have become more reliable in predicting the outcome when they apply.

---

### **2. Lift**

- **Previous Train Lift**: Approximately **1.05 to 1.20**
  - *Values*: [1.0559, 1.2048]
- **Current Train Lift**: **1.3069**

**Comment**:
- The current lift is higher than the previous values.
- **Interpretation**: A lift of 1.3069 means that the probability of the prediction when the condition is met is about 30.69% higher than the baseline probability.
- **Implication**: The association between the rule conditions and the predictions has strengthened, making the rules more interesting and valuable.

---

### **3. Support**

- **Previous Train Support**: Approximately **0.167 to 0.185**
  - *Values*: [0.1667, 0.1845]
- **Current Train Support**: **0.0119**

**Comment**:
- The current support has significantly decreased compared to previous values.
- **Interpretation**: Only 1.19% of the training data records satisfy both the rule conditions and predictions.
- **Implication**: The rules are now applicable to a much smaller portion of the dataset, which may limit their practical usefulness.

---

### **4. Leverage**

- **Previous Train Leverage**: **0.0289** and **-0.0041**
- **Current Train Leverage**: **0.00534**

**Comment**:
- The current leverage is positive but lower than the previous positive value.
- **Interpretation**: A small positive leverage indicates a slight improvement over chance but suggests a weak association.
- **Implication**: While there is some additional support over what would be expected by chance, it is minimal.

---

### **5. Absence of Test Metrics**

- **Note**: The current metrics only provide training data performance.
- **Implication**: Without test metrics, it's challenging to assess the generalizability of the rules and determine if overfitting has occurred.

---

**Overall Performance Assessment**

- **Strengths**:
  - **Increased Confidence and Lift**: The current rules are more reliable when they apply, and the association between conditions and predictions is stronger.
- **Weaknesses**:
  - **Decreased Support**: The rules cover a much smaller fraction of the data, indicating reduced applicability.
  - **Low Leverage**: Suggests that the association, while positive, is weak.
  - **Lack of Test Data Evaluation**: Limits the ability to assess rule performance on unseen data.

**Local Minimum and Iterations**

- **Local Minimum**: The increase in confidence and lift, alongside the decrease in support, suggests that the optimization may be focusing too narrowly, potentially leading to a local minimum where improvements in one metric adversely affect others.
- **Iterations**: Given the current metrics, further iterations are warranted to balance the trade-off between rule reliability (confidence and lift) and applicability (support).

---

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

1. **Balance Precision and Coverage**:
   - **Objective**: Increase support without significantly reducing confidence and lift.
   - **Approach**:
     - **Generalize Rule Conditions**: Broaden some overly specific conditions to apply to more records.
     - **Combine Similar Rules**: Merge rules that have overlapping conditions or outcomes.

2. **Review Rule Specificity**:
   - **Objective**: Avoid overfitting by preventing rules from becoming too narrowly defined.
   - **Approach**:
     - **Analyze Rules with Very Low Support**: Identify if they can be generalized.
     - **Simplify Complex Rules**: Remove unnecessary conditions that limit applicability.

3. **Include Test Metrics**:
   - **Objective**: Evaluate rule performance on unseen data to ensure generalizability.
   - **Approach**:
     - **Split Data into Training and Testing Sets**: Use cross-validation.
     - **Monitor Test Confidence and Lift**: Ensure they are comparable to training metrics.

4. **Optimize Rule Discovery Process**:
   - **Objective**: Prevent the algorithm from overly optimizing one metric at the expense of others.
   - **Approach**:
     - **Set Minimum Support Thresholds**: To ensure rules are applicable to a reasonable portion of the data.
     - **Use Multi-objective Optimization**: Balance between confidence, lift, and support during rule generation.

5. **Explore Additional Features**:
   - **Objective**: Enrich the dataset to discover more robust rules.
   - **Approach**:
     - **Incorporate New Descriptors**: Chemical properties, functional groups, or molecular fingerprints.
     - **Feature Engineering**: Create composite features that may capture relevant patterns.

6. **Prune Redundant and Irrelevant Rules**:
   - **Objective**: Simplify the rule set for better interpretability and performance.
   - **Approach**:
     - **Remove Rules with Negligible Leverage**: Focus on rules that contribute meaningful associations.
     - **Eliminate Contradictory Rules**: Ensure consistency within the rule set.

7. **Continuous Monitoring and Validation**:
   - **Objective**: Ensure that improvements lead to genuine performance gains.
   - **Approach**:
     - **Regularly Update Metrics**: After each iteration, compare metrics to previous ones.
     - **Perform Statistical Tests**: Verify that changes in metrics are significant.

---

**Conclusion**

While the current rules exhibit higher confidence and lift, indicating stronger and more reliable associations when they apply, the significant drop in support is a concern. The rules have become too specialized, applying to a minimal portion of the dataset and potentially overfitting the training data.

To enhance the performance of the current rules:

- **Aim for a balanced rule set** that maintains high confidence and lift while also achieving acceptable support levels.
- **Ensure that rules are evaluated on both training and testing data** to confirm their generalizability.
- **Iteratively refine and optimize the rules**, focusing on both predictive power and applicability.

By implementing these improvements, the rules can become more robust, useful, and effective in predicting high and low yields within the catalytic problem being studied.

**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

1. **Comparison of Accuracies:**

   - **Previous Accuracies:**
     - Validation Accuracies were consistently at or above **0.68**, with most at **0.76**.
     - Test Accuracies ranged from **0.625 to 0.75**.
   - **Current Accuracy:**
     - The classification model achieved an accuracy of **0.5714**.

   The significant drop in validation accuracy from the previous averages of **0.76** to the current **0.5714** indicates that the current set of rules is less effective than before. This suggests that the modifications made to the rules or model have led to decreased predictive performance.

2. **Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting:**

   - The decrease in both training and validation accuracies suggests that the model may be **underfitting**. This means the current rules are too simplistic or not capturing the underlying patterns in the data effectively.
   - Overfitting is less likely since the model is not performing well even on the training data.

3. **Analysis of Discrepancies Using SHAP Values:**

   - **Underestimated Loadings (Predicted Low, Experimental High):**
     - Several molecules have a **predicted low loading** while the **experimental value is high**.
     - For these molecules, **Rule 5** and **Rule 11** consistently have **negative SHAP values**, indicating they contribute negatively toward predicting a high loading.
     - The most negative SHAP value is associated with **Rule 5** (`-0.0428`), followed by **Rule 11** (`-0.0214`), suggesting these rules may be problematic.

   - **Overestimated Loadings (Predicted High, Experimental Low):**
     - There are fewer instances of overestimated loadings in the provided data.
     - For molecules where the predicted loading is high and the experimental value is low, we would need to identify rules with high positive SHAP values, but such instances are limited or not provided.

4. **Interpretation of Accuracy Metrics:**

   - The decline in accuracy metrics suggests that the probability of improvement using the current rules is low.
   - The model does not generalize well to unseen data, indicating that the rules may need significant refinement.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis:**

   - **Rule 5** and **Rule 11** are contributing to underprediction of high loading in several cases.
   - The negative SHAP values for these rules in cases where the experimental loading is high imply that these rules are incorrectly penalizing molecules that should be predicted as high loading.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

1. **Refine Rule 5:**

   - **Current Rule 5:**
     - *Modifiers containing heteroaromatic rings directly attached to the carboxylic acid group result in high yield...*
   - **Issue Identified:**
     - The rule seems too restrictive or not capturing all relevant functional groups leading to high loading.
   - **Suggested Refinements:**
     - Expand the rule to include additional heteroaromatic systems that may influence loading positively.
     - Re-express the rule to capture variations where the heteroaromatic ring influence is significant but perhaps not directly attached.
     - Consider the position and type of heteroatoms in the ring and their electronic effects.

2. **Refine Rule 11:**

   - **Current Rule 11:**
     - *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy or hydroxy groups on an extended aliphatic side chain result in high yield...*
   - **Issue Identified:**
     - The rule may not account for molecules where methoxy or hydroxy groups are present but do not contribute to high loading as expected.
   - **Suggested Refinements:**
     - Adjust the rule to consider the position of methoxy or hydroxy groups relative to the carboxylic acid.
     - Include exceptions where these groups may not lead to high loading due to steric hindrance or electronic effects.
     - Analyze molecules in the dataset that contradict this rule to understand the underlying reasons.

3. **Improve Generalization:**

   - **Address Underfitting:**
     - Introduce additional rules that capture missing patterns in the data.
     - Use statistical analysis to identify features that are strongly correlated with high loading but are not currently represented in the rules.
   - **Data Augmentation:**
     - Increase the diversity of training data to cover more chemical space.
     - Include more examples of molecules that are exceptions to the current rules to improve model robustness.

4. **Iterative Refinement Using SHAP Insights:**

   - **Focus on High Negative SHAP Values:**
     - Prioritize refining rules that have high negative SHAP values in cases of underprediction.
     - For example, re-evaluate **Rule 5** and **Rule 11** in the context of the specific molecules that are mispredicted.
   - **Analyze Specific Molecules:**
     - For each molecule where the model underperforms, examine its structure in detail.
     - Determine why the current rules assign it a low loading prediction and adjust the rules accordingly.

5. **Consider Additional Features:**

   - Incorporate new molecular descriptors that may improve prediction accuracy, such as:
     - Electronic effects (e.g., Hammett sigma constants).
     - Steric parameters (e.g., Taft steric factors).
     - Hydrogen bonding capacity.
   - Use machine learning feature selection methods to identify important features not currently included.

6. **Model Enhancement:**

   - Evaluate the possibility of using more sophisticated models that can capture non-linear relationships.
   - Implement cross-validation to ensure that the model's performance is consistent across different subsets of data.
   - Consider ensemble methods to combine the strengths of multiple models.

7. **Address Potential Data Issues:**

   - Check for any inconsistencies or errors in the experimental data that could affect model training.
   - Ensure that the dataset is balanced with respect to classes (high and low loading) to prevent bias.

**Conclusion**

The current rules are not adequately capturing the patterns necessary to accurately predict the loading of modifiers on catalysts, as evidenced by the decreased accuracy and SHAP analysis. Revising **Rule 5** and **Rule 11** should be a priority, as they are contributing significantly to underprediction. Expanding the rules to cover more chemical variations and incorporating additional molecular features can improve model performance. An iterative approach, guided by SHAP insights and thorough analysis of mispredicted molecules, will help refine the rules and enhance the predictive capability of the model.

**Summary and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

The current rules for predicting the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction have been evaluated based on performance metrics and SHAP analysis. The key findings and suggestions for optimizing the rules are as follows:

1. **Performance Metrics Analysis:**

   - **Confidence and Lift:**
     - The current rules exhibit increased **confidence** (65.28%) and **lift** (1.3069) compared to previous iterations, indicating stronger and more reliable associations when the rules apply.
   - **Support:**
     - There is a significant decrease in **support** (1.19%), meaning the rules apply to a much smaller fraction of the dataset, limiting their practical usefulness.
   - **Accuracy:**
     - The validation accuracy has decreased from approximately 76% to **57.14%**, suggesting that the current rules are less effective overall.
   - **SHAP Analysis:**
     - Rules **5** and **11** are contributing to incorrect predictions, as indicated by consistent negative SHAP values for molecules where the experimental yield is high but predicted yield is low.

2. **Directions to Optimize Current Rules:**

   - **Generalize Overly Specific Patterns:**

     - **Rule 1 (High Yield):**
       - **Issue:** The pattern `[CH3][CH2]{3,}[C](=O)[OH]` matches unbranched aliphatic monocarboxylic acids with at least four carbons, excluding shorter chains.
       - **Suggestion:** Adjust the pattern to `[CH3][CH2]{0,}[C](=O)[OH]` to include shorter chains like propanoic and butanoic acids.

     - **Rule 1 (Low Yield):**
       - **Issue:** The patterns `[NH2][CH2]{5,}[C](=O)[OH]` and `[OH][CH2]{5,}[C](=O)[OH]` may not accurately represent the intended chain length.
       - **Suggestion:** Modify the patterns to `[NH2][CH2]{4,}[C](=O)[OH]` and `[OH][CH2]{4,}[C](=O)[OH]` to include chains with seven or more carbons, counting all carbons.

     - **Rule 2 (High Yield):**
       - **Issue:** The pattern `[NH2][CH](C(=O)O)[CH2]{1,3}C(=O)O` may not match all α-amino dicarboxylic acids due to stereochemistry variations.
       - **Suggestion:** Use a more general pattern like `[N][CH](C(=O)O)[CH2]{1,3}C(=O)O`, removing specific hydrogen counts to include all relevant compounds.

     - **Rule 3 (High Yield):**
       - **Issue:** The pattern `c1cc(N)ccc1C(=O)O` may miss compounds due to specific atom ordering.
       - **Suggestion:** Use a general pattern like `c1ccc(cc1[NH2])C(=O)O` or recursive SMARTS to capture para-substituted amino groups on aromatic rings.

     - **Rule 4 (High Yield):**
       - **Issue:** The pattern `c1cc([N+](=O)[O-])ccc1C(=O)O` may be too specific.
       - **Suggestion:** Use a more flexible pattern like `c1ccc(cc1[N+](=O)[O-])C(=O)O` to capture all para-nitrobenzoic acids.

     - **Rule 5 (High Yield):**
       - **Issue:** The current pattern may not capture all heteroaromatic rings or consider tautomeric forms.
       - **Suggestion:** Expand the pattern to `[n,c]1cccc1C(=O)O` to include various heteroaromatic systems directly attached to the carboxylic acid group.

     - **Rule 6 (High Yield):**
       - **Issue:** The pattern specifically matches tryptophan.
       - **Suggestion:** Generalize the pattern to `[NH2][CH](C(=O)O)[CH2][c]1[n][c][c][c]1` to include other amino acids with electron-rich aromatic heterocycles, such as histidine.

     - **Rule 8 (High Yield):**
       - **Issue:** The pattern is too specific to gluconic acid.
       - **Suggestion:** Use a generalized pattern like `C(=O)O[CH2][CH](O)[CH](O)[CH2][OH]` to match a broader range of aliphatic polyhydroxy acids.

   - **Refine Rules Based on SHAP Analysis:**

     - **Rule 5:**
       - **Issue:** Negative SHAP values indicate the rule may incorrectly predict low yield for certain high-yielding molecules.
       - **Suggestion:** Re-evaluate and adjust the rule to better capture heteroaromatic compounds that lead to high yield, possibly by including additional heteroatoms or ring systems.

     - **Rule 11:**
       - **Issue:** The rule may penalize molecules with methoxy or hydroxy groups that should result in high yield.
       - **Suggestion:** Modify the rule to account for the position and influence of these groups, ensuring they contribute positively when appropriate.

   - **Balance Precision and Coverage:**

     - **Objective:** Increase the applicability of the rules without significantly reducing their predictive power.
     - **Approach:**
       - **Generalize Specific Conditions:** Broaden the scope of rules that are too narrow.
       - **Combine Overlapping Rules:** Merge similar rules to reduce redundancy and increase support.

   - **Include Additional Molecular Features:**

     - **Suggestion:** Incorporate descriptors like electronic properties, steric factors, and hydrogen bonding capacity to enhance the rules' predictive capabilities.

   - **Enhance Rule Evaluation Process:**

     - **Regular Testing and Validation:**
       - Use cross-validation to assess rule performance on unseen data.
       - Monitor both training and test metrics to ensure the rules generalize well.

     - **Set Minimum Support Thresholds:**
       - Establish thresholds to prevent rules from becoming too specialized.

     - **Multi-objective Optimization:**
       - Balance confidence, lift, and support during rule refinement to avoid overfitting.

3. **Judgment on Further Optimization Possibility:**

   There is considerable potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. By generalizing overly specific patterns, refining rules that contribute to incorrect predictions (as identified by SHAP analysis), and incorporating additional molecular features, the rules can become more robust and applicable to a larger portion of the dataset. Careful iterative refinement and validation will help improve predictive accuracy while maintaining generalizability.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: *Generalize Rule 1 (High Yield) to include shorter unbranched aliphatic monocarboxylic acids.* Modify the pattern from `[CH3][CH2]{3,}[C](=O)[OH]` to `[CH3][CH2]{0,}[C](=O)[OH]` to include compounds like propanoic and butanoic acids.

- **Advice 2**: *Adjust Rule 1 (Low Yield) patterns to accurately reflect chain length by counting all carbons.* Change the patterns from `[NH2][CH2]{5,}[C](=O)[OH]` and `[OH][CH2]{5,}[C](=O)[OH]` to `[NH2][CH2]{4,}[C](=O)[OH]` and `[OH][CH2]{4,}[C](=O)[OH]` to include chains with seven or more carbons.

- **Advice 3**: *Generalize Rule 2 (High Yield) to encompass all α-amino dicarboxylic acids regardless of stereochemistry.* Modify the pattern from `[NH2][CH](C(=O)O)[CH2]{1,3}C(=O)O` to `[N][CH](C(=O)O)[CH2]{1,3}C(=O)O` to include all relevant compounds.

- **Advice 4**: *Modify Rule 3 (High Yield) to capture all para-substituted amino groups on aromatic rings.* Replace the pattern `c1cc(N)ccc1C(=O)O` with a more general pattern like `c1ccc(cc1[NH2])C(=O)O` to include various compounds with amino groups at the para position.

- **Advice 5**: *Generalize Rule 4 (High Yield) to include all para-nitrobenzoic acids.* Change the pattern from `c1cc([N+](=O)[O-])ccc1C(=O)O` to a broader pattern such as `c1ccc(cc1[N+](=O)[O-])C(=O)O`.

- **Advice 6**: *Expand Rule 5 (High Yield) to better capture heteroaromatic carboxylic acids.* Use a more inclusive pattern like `[n,c]1cccc1C(=O)O` to include various heteroaromatic rings directly attached to the carboxylic acid group.

- **Advice 7**: *Generalize Rule 6 (High Yield) to include amino acids with electron-rich aromatic heterocycles in their side chains.* Modify the pattern to `[NH2][CH](C(=O)O)[CH2][c]1[n][c][c][c]1` to include compounds like histidine in addition to tryptophan.

- **Advice 8**: *Broaden Rule 8 (High Yield) to include a wider range of aliphatic polyhydroxy acids.* Replace the specific pattern with a general one like `C(=O)O[CH2][CH](O)[CH](O)[CH2][OH]` to capture various polyhydroxy compounds.

- **Advice 9**: *Refine Rule 5 based on SHAP analysis to prevent incorrect low-yield predictions for high-yielding heteroaromatic compounds.* Re-evaluate the rule and consider including additional heteroatoms or ring systems to accurately reflect the compounds' reactivity.

- **Advice 10**: *Adjust Rule 11 to account for the position and influence of methoxy or hydroxy groups on aromatic rings and side chains.* Ensure that the rule positively contributes to the prediction when these groups are on extended aliphatic chains but not when directly on the aromatic ring.

- **Advice 11**: *Balance the specificity and coverage of all rules to increase their applicability without compromising predictive power.* Generalize overly specific patterns and combine overlapping rules to enhance support and overall accuracy.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear and well-supported by multiple data points.

**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Reformulate Rules Using Quantifiable Molecular Descriptors**  
  Modify the current rules to be based on quantifiable molecular descriptors that can be directly calculated from SMILES strings. Instead of descriptive terms like "unbranched aliphatic monocarboxylic acids," define features such as "number of carbon atoms in the longest aliphatic chain," "number of carboxylic acid groups," and "degree of branching." This approach facilitates the creation of a numeric feature matrix for machine learning models.

- **Advice 2**: **Define Specific Functional Group Counts and Presence Indicators**  
  For each rule, specify the exact functional groups involved and create binary indicators or counts for their presence. For example, count the number of hydroxyl groups, amino groups, carboxyl groups, sulfhydryl groups, and aromatic rings. This will make it easier to quantify the structural features influencing the reaction yield.

- **Advice 3**: **Use SMARTS Patterns for Substructure Identification**  
  Integrate SMARTS (SMILES Arbitrary Target Specification) patterns corresponding to the functional groups and substructures mentioned in the rules. This allows for programmatic identification of these features within the SMILES strings, enabling automated feature extraction.

- **Advice 4**: **Incorporate Electronic and Steric Properties**  
  Since electron-donating and electron-withdrawing effects are significant, compute electronic descriptors such as Hammett sigma constants, partial charges, or electrophilicity indices. Include steric parameters like molecular volume or solvent-accessible surface area to account for size-related effects.

- **Advice 5**: **Standardize Aromaticity and Ring Features**  
  Define features that capture the presence of aromatic systems, heteroaromatic rings, and their substitution patterns. For example, include counts of aromatic rings, heterocycles, and substituents at specific positions (e.g., para, meta, ortho) on the ring.

- **Advice 6**: **Differentiate Between Chain Lengths and Branching**  
  For aliphatic chains, include features that specify the length of carbon chains and the degree of branching. For instance, "Longest aliphatic chain length" and "Number of branching points in aliphatic chains" can be useful descriptors.

- **Advice 7**: **Quantify Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Balance**  
  Calculate logP (octanol-water partition coefficient) values or other hydrophobicity indices to capture the balance between hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions in the modifiers. This may correlate with their interaction with the catalyst and the reaction medium.

- **Advice 8**: **Include Topological and Connectivity Descriptors**  
  Utilize topological indices such as the Wiener index, connectivity indices, or molecular fingerprints that encode the molecule's topology and can be derived from the SMILES strings.

- **Advice 9**: **Address Stereochemistry Where Relevant**  
  For chiral compounds like amino acids, include stereochemical descriptors, such as chirality centers and specific configurations (R/S), as they may influence the reaction outcome.

- **Advice 10**: **Create a Unified Descriptor Matrix for All Rules**  
  Compile all identified descriptors into a single feature matrix applicable to all modifiers, ensuring consistency and enabling direct comparison between different molecules.

- **Advice 11**: **Perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or Feature Selection**  
  After computing the descriptors, use PCA or feature selection methods to identify the most significant features influencing the yield. This can help refine the rules further and focus on the most impactful molecular properties.

- **Advice 12**: **Validate and Refine Rules with Expanded Dataset**  
  Test the new descriptors against the provided dataset to ensure they accurately distinguish between high and low yield modifiers. Adjust the rules based on the validation results to improve their predictive power.

- **Advice 13**: **Automate Feature Extraction Process**  
  Develop or utilize existing cheminformatics software tools to automate the extraction of the proposed features from SMILES strings. This will streamline the data processing and make the rules more practical for large datasets.

- **Advice 14**: **Incorporate Descriptor Interactions if Relevant**  
  Consider interaction terms between descriptors if combinations of features influence the yield (e.g., the presence of both an amino group and a long aliphatic chain).

- **Advice 15**: **Document and Standardize Descriptor Definitions**  
  Clearly define each descriptor and ensure they are standardized across all modifiers. Provide documentation or a glossary that explains how each feature is calculated and its relevance to the reaction yield.

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: Simplify the current rules by focusing on molecular descriptors that can be directly computed from SMILES strings. Instead of qualitative descriptions like "electron-withdrawing groups" or "bulky side chains," use quantifiable features such as the count of specific functional groups (e.g., number of hydroxyl, amino, carboxyl groups), molecular weight, or the number of carbon atoms in the longest aliphatic chain. This will facilitate the generation of a numeric feature matrix.

- **Advice 2**: Consolidate overlapping rules to reduce complexity and improve clarity. For example, several rules involve the effect of chain length and functional groups on yield. Combine these into a generalized rule that relates the number of carbon atoms and the presence of specific substituents (e.g., hydroxyl, amino groups) to the yield, making it easier to encode numerically.

- **Advice 3**: Replace subjective terms like "bulky" or "electron-rich" with specific, quantifiable parameters. For instance, use steric parameters such as the Verloop steric parameters or calculated molar refractivity to quantify "bulky" groups, and use electronic parameters like Hammett sigma constants or calculated partial charges to quantify electronic effects.

- **Advice 4**: Introduce binary features for the presence or absence of key functional groups or structural motifs identified in the rules. For example, create binary descriptors for the presence of aromatic rings, heteroatoms (N, O, S), carboxylic acid groups directly attached to aromatic systems, or aliphatic chains with specific substituents.

- **Advice 5**: Utilize molecular fingerprints (e.g., MACCS keys, Morgan fingerprints) to encode the molecular structures into numeric vectors that capture the presence of various substructures. This method translates the structural information within SMILES into a format suitable for machine learning models.

- **Advice 6**: Incorporate topological and geometrical descriptors that can be calculated from SMILES, such as the number of rotatable bonds, topological polar surface area (TPSA), and molecular flexibility indices. These descriptors can capture aspects of molecular shape and flexibility that may influence yield.

- **Advice 7**: Implement quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling techniques to derive relationships between the molecular descriptors and the yield. By using regression or classification models, you can let the data reveal patterns and important features, potentially uncovering new rules.

- **Advice 8**: Include electronic descriptors like calculated LogP (octanol-water partition coefficient) to represent hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity, which may impact modifier interaction with the catalyst. Also, consider using HOMO-LUMO gap energies or other quantum chemical descriptors if computational resources permit.

- **Advice 9**: Calculate and include metal-binding affinity descriptors for modifiers, especially those that may coordinate with the Fe ion in the catalyst. Use computational chemistry tools to estimate the binding energies or coordination numbers, which can help explain catalyst poisoning effects mentioned in the rules.

- **Advice 10**: Develop a standardized feature set that is consistently applicable to all modifiers in the dataset. Ensure that each compound is represented by the same set of descriptors to create a uniform feature matrix, which is crucial for statistical modeling and machine learning.

- **Advice 11**: Use cheminformatics software to automate the descriptor calculation process from SMILES. Tools like RDKit can compute a wide range of molecular descriptors and fingerprints directly from SMILES strings, streamlining data preparation.

- **Advice 12**: For modifiers involving stereochemistry (e.g., specific amino acid enantiomers), consider including stereochemical descriptors or use 2D representations if 3D conformations are not critical to the yield outcome.

- **Advice 13**: Re-evaluate the dataset to identify any additional patterns or correlations not currently captured by the existing rules. Use statistical analysis or clustering techniques to uncover hidden relationships that could inform new or refined rules.

- **Advice 14**: Update the rules to be more generalizable by focusing on core structural features affecting the yield rather than specific compound names. This approach can improve the predictive power of the rules when applied to new, untested modifiers.

- **Advice 15**: Consider potential interactions between different descriptors by including combination features (e.g., interaction terms between chain length and presence of hydroxyl groups) in your feature matrix. This can capture more complex relationships influencing the yield.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are unbranched aliphatic monocarboxylic acids with chain lengths up to eight carbons result in high yield, provided they do not have terminal amino or hydroxy groups on chains longer than six carbons.**
  - *Rationale*: Unbranched aliphatic acids can efficiently interact with the catalyst's active sites without steric hindrance. Terminal amino or hydroxy groups on longer chains may interfere with the catalyst or the reaction mechanism.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **Octanoic acid**
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids or amino acids with polar side chains result in high yield, whereas those with hydrophobic or bulky aromatic side chains result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Polar side chains can enhance interactions with the catalyst, promoting high yield. Hydrophobic or bulky side chains may cause steric hindrance or reduce catalyst compatibility.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups can enhance the π-electron density of the aromatic ring, improving interactions with the catalyst. Electron-withdrawing groups can decrease reactivity or interfere with the catalyst.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**

  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain result in high yield, while those with a single hydroxyl group on longer chains result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups can increase solubility and interaction with the catalyst. A single hydroxyl group on a long chain may not offer these benefits and can introduce unfavorable steric effects.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with perfluoroalkyl groups attached to the carboxylic acid result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Perfluoroalkyl groups are highly electron-withdrawing and hydrophobic, which can hinder interactions with the catalyst and reduce solubility in the reaction medium.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing polyether chains ending with a carboxylic acid group result in low yield.**

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy or hydroxy-substituted phenyl groups connected via an aliphatic chain result in high yield, whereas those with these substituents directly attached to the benzene ring result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: The aliphatic chain can provide flexibility and optimal positioning of functional groups for better catalyst interaction. Direct substitution on the aromatic ring may hinder effective binding due to steric factors.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*:

    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic amino acids with bulky acetamido or modified side chains result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Bulky side chains can create steric hindrance, reducing the modifier's ability to interact effectively with the catalyst.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing terminal amino groups on long aliphatic chains (seven carbons or more) result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Terminal amino groups on long chains may interfere with the catalyst, possibly through coordination that leads to catalyst deactivation.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with electron-rich heteroaromatic side chains result in high yield, whereas those with simple hydrophobic aromatic side chains result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Electron-rich heteroaromatic rings can enhance interactions with the catalyst, while simple hydrophobic rings may not provide the necessary interaction for high yield.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

The rule effectively considers combinations of functional groups and positions, and it is supported by relevant data points, demonstrating good coverage.

- **Comment 6**: *Rule 6* specifies that multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain result in high yield, while a single hydroxyl group on longer chains results in low yield. The rationale provides adequate insight into solubility and interaction factors. The rule considers combinations of substructures and is supported by data points for both outcomes, showing good coverage.

- **Comment 7**: *Rule 7* is clear in stating that modifiers with perfluoroalkyl groups attached to the carboxylic acid result in low yield. The rationale addresses the electron-withdrawing and hydrophobic nature of these groups. However, the rule is supported by only one data point, limiting its coverage. While the clarity and property insight are adequate, broader data support would enhance the rule.

- **Comment 8**: *Rule 8* effectively communicates that modifiers containing polyether chains ending with a carboxylic acid group lead to low yield. The rationale discusses increased flexibility and steric bulk affecting catalyst interaction. The rule considers complex substructures and is supported by multiple data points, ensuring good coverage.

- **Comment 9**: *Rule 9* distinguishes between modifiers with methoxy or hydroxy-substituted phenyl groups connected via an aliphatic chain (high yield) and those directly attached to the benzene ring (low yield). The rationale provides insight into the benefits of chain flexibility for catalyst interaction. The rule is complex and supported by several data points, demonstrating good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 10**: *Rule 10* clearly states that modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups attached to aromatic or aliphatic chains result in low yield. The rationale addresses potential interference with the catalyst. The rule is simple yet considers critical functional groups, and multiple data points support it, ensuring good coverage.

- **Comment 11**: *Rule 11* specifies that modifiers with electron-withdrawing trifluoroacetyl groups result in low yield. The rationale is sound, but the rule is supported by only one data point, limiting coverage. While clarity and property insight are satisfactory, additional supporting data would strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 12**: *Rule 12* indicates that long-chain aliphatic amino acids with bulky acetamido or modified side chains result in low yield. The rationale highlights steric hindrance. The rule's complexity is appropriate, but it is supported by only one data point, limiting coverage. Broader data support would enhance its reliability.

- **Comment 13**: *Rule 13* is clear in stating that terminal amino groups on long aliphatic chains (seven carbons or more) result in low yield. The rationale addresses catalyst interference through coordination. The rule considers substructure combinations and is supported by multiple data points, ensuring good coverage.

- **Comment 14**: *Rule 14* effectively differentiates modifiers based on their side chains—electron-rich heteroaromatic side chains lead to high yield, while simple hydrophobic aromatic side chains result in low yield. The rationale provides adequate insight into catalyst interactions. The rule considers substructural complexity and is well-supported by data points, demonstrating good coverage.

- **Comment 15**: *Rule 15* identifies that modifiers containing groups which strongly coordinate to metals (e.g., thiol groups on aromatic rings) may cause catalyst poisoning, leading to low yield. The rationale is sound, but the rule is supported by only one data point, limiting coverage. Additional examples would increase its robustness.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are unbranched aliphatic monocarboxylic acids with chain lengths up to eight carbons result in high yield, provided they do not have terminal amino or hydroxy groups on chains longer than six carbons.**
  - *Rationale*: Unbranched aliphatic acids can efficiently interact with the catalyst's active sites without steric hindrance. Terminal amino or hydroxy groups on longer chains may interfere with the catalyst or the reaction mechanism.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **Octanoic acid**
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids or amino acids with polar side chains result in high yield, whereas those with hydrophobic or bulky aromatic side chains result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Polar side chains can enhance interactions with the catalyst, promoting high yield. Hydrophobic or bulky side chains may cause steric hindrance or reduce catalyst compatibility.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating para-substituents (e.g., amino or hydroxy groups) result in high yield, while those with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., aldehyde, trifluoromethyl, or methyl groups) at the para position result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups can enhance the π-electron density of the aromatic ring, improving interactions with the catalyst. Electron-withdrawing groups can decrease reactivity or interfere with the catalyst.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers where the carboxylic acid group is directly attached to a nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring result in high yield; those where the heteroaromatic ring is connected through an additional aromatic ring result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Direct attachment allows for effective coordination with metal centers in the catalyst. Additional aromatic rings can introduce steric hindrance and reduce effective interaction.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups on short chains result in high yield, whereas those with thiol groups attached directly to an aromatic ring result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**
  - *Rationale*: Thiol groups on short aliphatic chains can act as ligands enhancing catalyst activity. Thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings can strongly bind to metal centers, deactivating the catalyst.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (3-mercaptopropionic acid)
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain result in high yield, while those with a single hydroxyl group on longer chains result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups can increase solubility and interaction with the catalyst. A single hydroxyl group on a long chain may not offer these benefits and can introduce unfavorable steric effects.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with perfluoroalkyl groups attached to the carboxylic acid result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Perfluoroalkyl groups are highly electron-withdrawing and hydrophobic, which can hinder interactions with the catalyst and reduce solubility in the reaction medium.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing polyether chains ending with a carboxylic acid group result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Polyether chains can increase flexibility and steric bulk, reducing the ability of the modifier to interact effectively with the catalyst.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy or hydroxy-substituted phenyl groups connected via an aliphatic chain result in high yield, whereas those with these substituents directly attached to the benzene ring result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: The aliphatic chain can provide flexibility and optimal positioning of functional groups for better catalyst interaction. Direct substitution on the aromatic ring may hinder effective binding due to steric factors.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups attached to aromatic or aliphatic chains result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde and ketone groups can react with amino or hydroxyl groups in the system or coordinate with metal centers, disrupting catalyst activity.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with electron-withdrawing trifluoroacetyl groups result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Strong electron-withdrawing groups can decrease the electron density of the modifier, hindering interactions with the catalyst and possibly deactivating it.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic amino acids with bulky acetamido or modified side chains result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Bulky side chains can create steric hindrance, reducing the modifier's ability to interact effectively with the catalyst.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing terminal amino groups on long aliphatic chains (seven carbons or more) result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Terminal amino groups on long chains may interfere with the catalyst, possibly through coordination that leads to catalyst deactivation.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with electron-rich heteroaromatic side chains result in high yield, whereas those with simple hydrophobic aromatic side chains result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Electron-rich heteroaromatic rings can enhance interactions with the catalyst, while simple hydrophobic rings may not provide the necessary interaction for high yield.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing groups that strongly coordinate to metals (e.g., thiol groups attached directly to an aromatic ring) may result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**
  - *Rationale*: Strongly coordinating groups can bind irreversibly to metal centers in the catalyst, reducing its availability and activity.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: For **Rule 1**, update the SMARTS pattern to correctly match unbranched aliphatic monocarboxylic acids with chain lengths up to eight carbons, and ensure that terminal amino or hydroxyl groups on chains longer than six carbons are excluded. The current pattern `[{unbranched_aliphatic_chain}][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` may not be correctly matching due to the use of brackets inside the f-string. Modify the pattern to `f'{unbranched_aliphatic_chain}[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'` (without the extra square brackets around `{unbranched_aliphatic_chain}`), and include checks to exclude chains with terminal amino or hydroxyl groups on chains longer than six carbons.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: For **Rule 2 High**, the current code is using patterns `[OX2H]`, `[SX2H]`, `[NX3H2]`, `[NX3H1]`, which match any molecule containing hydroxyl, thiol, or amino groups, leading to overly broad matching. Instead, constrain the pattern to match amino acids with polar side chains specifically. Consider using SMARTS patterns that match amino acids with side chains containing polar groups, linked via standard amino acid structures.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For **Rule 2 Low**, ensure that the pattern accurately matches amino acids with hydrophobic or bulky aromatic side chains. The current pattern `'[CX4H]([NX3])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1][C][c]'` may not be specific enough to match only those amino acids. Adjust the pattern to correctly capture amino acids with hydrophobic or bulky aromatic side chains.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Review and adjust the patterns for other rules to ensure they correctly reflect the natural language rules. For example, **Rule 3** involves aromatic carboxylic acids with specific para-substituents. Ensure that the SMARTS patterns accurately reflect electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups at the para position.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: Implement more precise patterns that include the structural context necessary for each rule. For example, in **Rule 5**, distinguish between thiol groups on aliphatic chains and thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings by incorporating the ring aromaticity and proximity in the SMARTS patterns.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Add detailed pattern matching that addresses the chain length and branching requirements explicitly as per the rules. Use SMARTS syntax to specify exact chain lengths where necessary.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: For rules that involve exceptions or additional conditions (like in **Rule 1** regarding terminal amino or hydroxyl groups on longer chains), include additional code logic to enforce these conditions, potentially by performing multiple substructure searches and combining the results appropriately.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Test each SMARTS pattern independently against a set of known molecules (both positive and negative examples) to ensure that it matches only the intended structures.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: Consider integrating functional group definitions from standard chemical libraries or databases to improve pattern accuracy, ensuring they align with IUPAC definitions.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Ensure that the code for processing patterns into the 'patterns' dictionary is correctly formatted and does not introduce unintended syntax errors, such as extra brackets or incorrect variable references.

**Analysis of Current Rule Performance Based on Metrics**

---

**1. Comparison of Current Metrics to Previous Metrics**

*Previous Rule Metrics for Reference:*

- **Train Support**: 0.1667, 0.1845
- **Test Support**: 0.0833, 0.1354
- **Train Confidence**: 0.6352, 0.5396
- **Test Confidence**: 0.3333, 0.4639
- **Train Lift**: 1.2048, 1.0559
- **Test Lift**: 0.6889, 0.9137
- **Train Leverage**: 0.0289, -0.0041
- **Test Leverage**: -0.0313, -0.0339

*Current Metrics:*

- **Train Support**: 0.03896
- **Train Confidence**: 0.5689
- **Train Lift**: 1.1301
- **Train Leverage**: 0.00286

---

**2. Analysis of Metrics with Emphasis on Confidence and Lift**

**Support:**

- **Decrease in Support**: The current **train support** of **0.03896** is significantly lower than the previous values (**0.1667** and **0.1845**). This indicates that the current set of rules covers a smaller portion of the training dataset.
- **Implication**: A lower support suggests that while the rules are becoming more specific, they may be too narrow, potentially missing out on a significant portion of relevant data.

**Confidence:**

- **Slight Decrease in Confidence**: The current **train confidence** is **0.5689**, which is slightly lower than the highest previous confidence of **0.6352** but higher than **0.5396**.
- **Interpretation**: The rules predict the outcome correctly about 56.89% of the time when the conditions are met, which is moderately high but not an improvement over the highest previous confidence.
- **Focus on Confidence**: Since confidence measures the reliability of the rules when their conditions are satisfied, maintaining or improving this metric is crucial for the effectiveness of the rules.

**Lift:**

- **Moderate Lift Value**: The current **train lift** is **1.1301**, which is lower than the highest previous lift of **1.2048** but higher than **1.0559**.
- **Understanding Lift**: Lift quantifies how much more likely the rule's prediction is to occur given the condition, compared to its occurrence in the general dataset.
- **Implication**: A lift greater than 1 indicates a positive association between the condition and prediction. However, the current lift shows a moderate association, not as strong as the previous best.

**Leverage:**

- **Decrease in Leverage**: The current **train leverage** of **0.00286** is lower than the previous positive leverage of **0.0289** but an improvement over the negative leverage (**-0.0041**).
- **Interpretation**: Positive leverage indicates that the condition and prediction co-occur more often than expected by chance, but the small value suggests a weak association.

---

**3. Determining if a Local Minimum Has Been Reached**

- **Stagnation in Improvement**: The current metrics show that while some aspects (like lift) are moderately positive, overall, there is no significant improvement over previous metrics.
- **Trade-Off Between Support and Confidence**: The decrease in support has not been compensated by an increase in confidence or lift, suggesting diminishing returns from further specificity.
- **Potential Local Minimum**: The metrics indicate that the current rules may have reached a local minimum where further iterations with the same approach yield minimal improvements.

---

**4. Recommendations for Improving Current Rules**

**A. Enhance Rule Generality to Increase Support**

- **Broaden Rule Conditions**: Re-evaluate the conditions in the rules that may be overly restrictive. Generalizing some conditions could increase the rules' applicability, thereby increasing support.
- **Example**: If a rule specifies modifiers with chain lengths up to eight carbons, consider extending the chain length if it does not significantly reduce confidence.

**B. Focus on High-Impact Features**

- **Identify Key Predictors**: Analyze which conditions contribute most to high confidence and lift. Emphasize these in the rules while minimizing less impactful conditions.
- **Refine Rule Rationale**: Ensure that the rationale behind each rule aligns with observed data trends, possibly adjusting or removing rules that do not contribute significantly to performance.

**C. Balance Between Specificity and Coverage**

- **Avoid Overfitting**: Extremely specific rules may not generalize well. Aim for a balance where the rules are specific enough to be effective but general enough to apply to a larger dataset.
- **Test on Validation Data**: Use a validation set to test the rules' performance, ensuring that they maintain confidence and lift outside the training data.

**D. Re-Assess Low-Yield Examples**

- **Investigate Misclassifications**: Examine cases where the rules predict low yield incorrectly. Understanding these exceptions can lead to more accurate rule adjustments.
- **Incorporate Additional Data**: If possible, include more features or data points that could help distinguish between high and low yield more effectively.

**E. Optimize Lift and Confidence Together**

- **Prioritize Lift Improvement**: Since lift measures the effectiveness of the rule beyond random chance, focus on conditions that significantly increase lift.
- **Maintain or Improve Confidence**: Ensure that any changes aimed at improving lift do not negatively impact confidence.

**F. Iterate with Targeted Adjustments**

- **Set Iteration Goals**: Define clear objectives for each iteration, such as increasing support by a certain percentage without reducing confidence below a threshold.
- **Monitor Metrics Closely**: Continuously compare new metrics with previous ones to assess whether iterations are moving toward the desired improvement.

---

**5. Conclusion**

The current rules, while moderately effective, indicate a potential plateau in performance improvements. With **confidence** and **lift** not showing significant gains, and **support** decreasing, it's essential to adjust the approach:

- **Rebalance the Rules**: Modify the rules to be less restrictive, increasing support while striving to maintain or improve confidence and lift.
- **Strategic Iterations**: Adopt a more strategic iteration process, focusing on impactful changes rather than minor tweaks.
- **Holistic Evaluation**: Consider incorporating test metrics and qualitative assessments of the rules' applicability and rationale.

By implementing these recommendations, the rules can be improved to achieve better performance, covering a larger portion of the dataset with reliable predictions.

---

**Next Steps**

- **Review and Revise Rules**: Go through each rule to identify opportunities for generalization and simplification.
- **Data Analysis**: Perform further analysis on the dataset to uncover patterns or correlations not previously considered.
- **Collaborative Discussion**: Engage with other team members to gather insights and different perspectives on rule adjustments.
- **Continue Monitoring**: Keep tracking the metrics in subsequent iterations to ensure that changes lead to tangible improvements.

---

By focusing on these areas, the performance of the rules can be enhanced, leading to better outcomes in the catalytic problem being researched.

**Analysis of Accuracies:**

The performance of the current classification model has decreased compared to previous iterations. Previously, the validation accuracies were consistently around **0.76**, with test accuracies of **0.75** and **0.625**:

- **Previous Validation Accuracies**:
  - [0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]; Test Accuracy: 0.75
  - [0.76, 0.68, 0.72, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]; Test Accuracy: 0.75
  - [0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]; Test Accuracy: 0.625
  - [0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76, 0.76]; Test Accuracy: 0.625

In the current iteration, the 5-fold cross-validation accuracy has dropped to **0.4857**:

- **Current Validation Accuracy**:
  - An accuracy of **0.4857** was obtained using the classification model.

This significant decrease in accuracy indicates that the current set of rules is less effective in predicting the loading of modifiers on catalysts compared to previous iterations. The model's performance is below random chance for a binary classification task, suggesting potential issues with the model's ability to generalize from the training data.

**Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting:**

Given that both the training and validation accuracies are low, the model appears to be **underfitting**. This scenario suggests that the model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data. The current rules may not be adequately representing the relationships between molecular features and catalyst loading, or they may be too generalized, leading to poor model performance.

**SHAP Analysis and Identification of Problematic Rules:**

The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis provides insights into which rules are contributing most to the model's predictions, both correctly and incorrectly. By examining cases where the model's predictions do not match the experimental values, we can identify rules that may be contributing to misclassifications.

1. **Overestimated Loadings** (Predicted High, Experimental Low):
   - **Molecules with Overestimated Loadings**:
     - **C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N**
     - **COCCOCCOCC(=O)O**
     - **C1=CC(=CC=C1C2=CC=NC=C2)C(=O)O**
     - **C(=O)(C(C(C(C(F)(F)F)(F)F)(F)F)(F)F)O**
     - **CC1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=O)O**
     - **C(COCCOCCN)C(=O)O**
     - **CC(=O)NCCCC[C@@H](C(=O)O)N**
     - **C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)NCC(=O)O)O**
   - **Contributing Rules**:
     - **Rule 16**: SHAP values range from **0.0172** to **0.0399**.
     - **Rule 19**: SHAP values range from **0.0186** to **0.0200**.

   **Interpretation**:
   - **Rule 16** is consistently contributing a positive SHAP value towards the prediction of high loading in molecules where the experimental loading is low. This suggests that **Rule 16 may be overly general or mischaracterizing certain molecular features**, leading to overestimation.
   - **Rule 19** also contributes but to a lesser extent compared to Rule 16.

2. **Underestimated Loadings** (Predicted Low, Experimental High):
   - **Molecules with Underestimated Loadings**:
     - **C([C@@H](C(=O)O)N)C(=O)O**
     - **C1=C(C=NN1)C(=O)O**
     - **C(CS)C(=O)O**
     - **C1=CC(=CN=C1)C(=O)O**
   - **Contributing Rules**:
     - **Rule 16**: SHAP values are positive but smaller (**0.0172**), yet the model predicts low loading.
     - **Rule 19**: SHAP values are **0.0**, indicating no contribution.

   **Interpretation**:
   - The positive SHAP values for **Rule 16** suggest it should contribute to a high loading prediction, yet the model still predicts low loading. This inconsistency indicates potential issues with the model's weighting of rules or interactions between rules that might be overriding the positive contribution of Rule 16.
   - The lack of contribution from **Rule 19** suggests it is not influencing these misclassifications, and attention should be focused on Rule 16 and possibly other rules not listed in this SHAP analysis.

**Evaluation of Rule Effectiveness:**

The decrease in accuracy and the observations from the SHAP analysis suggest that the current rules, particularly **Rule 16** and **Rule 19**, are not effective enough. They might be too broad, leading to overgeneralizations, or they might be conflicting with other rules, resulting in incorrect predictions. Additionally, the model might be underfitting due to inadequate representation of the data's complexity.

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules:**

1. **Refine Rule 16**:
   - **Issue**: Rule 16 contributes significantly to overestimating loading in molecules where the experimental value is low.
   - **Action**:
     - **Review the Specificity**: Examine the conditions defined in Rule 16 to ensure they are not too broad and inadvertently include molecules that should not result in high loading.
     - **Adjust Criteria**: Introduce additional criteria or modify existing ones to better discriminate between high and low loading modifiers.
     - **Chemical Rationale**: Ensure that the chemical rationale behind Rule 16 aligns with observed experimental data, possibly incorporating exceptions or clarifications.

2. **Adjust Rule 19**:
   - **Issue**: Rule 19 contributes to overestimating loading but to a lesser extent than Rule 16.
   - **Action**:
     - **Evaluate Interactions**: Consider how Rule 19 interacts with other rules, particularly if it reinforces the effects of problematic rules like Rule 16.
     - **Modify Thresholds**: Reassess any thresholds or parameters within Rule 19 that may be causing misclassifications.
     - **Increase Rule Precision**: Add specificity to Rule 19 to target only those molecules where the rule is applicable without overgeneralizing.

3. **Improve Generalization**:
   - **Issue**: The model appears to be underfitting, suggesting that the rules are not capturing the necessary complexity.
   - **Action**:
     - **Expand Feature Representation**: Incorporate additional molecular descriptors or features that may improve the model's ability to differentiate between high and low loading modifiers.
     - **Balance Rule Complexity**: Ensure that rules are neither too simplistic nor overly complex. Strive for a set of rules that capture essential patterns without introducing unnecessary noise.
     - **Cross-Validation**: Use cross-validation techniques to assess the generalizability of the rules and prevent overfitting to specific subsets of the data.

4. **Leverage SHAP Insights**:
   - **Issue**: SHAP analysis highlights the impact of specific rules on model predictions.
   - **Action**:
     - **Identify Conflicting Rules**: Look for rules that may be conflicting with each other, causing the model to make incorrect predictions despite positive contributions from certain rules.
     - **Prioritize Rule Modifications**: Focus on adjusting rules that have the highest SHAP values for misclassified instances, as they have the most significant impact on the model's output.
     - **Iterative Refinement**: Continuously refine the rules based on SHAP analysis feedback, followed by retraining and evaluating the model to assess improvements.

5. **Incorporate Experimental Anomalies**:
   - **Issue**: Some molecules may not conform to the general patterns captured by the rules.
   - **Action**:
     - **Analyze Outliers**: Investigate molecules that are consistently misclassified to determine if they represent exceptions that require special consideration.
     - **Update Rules Accordingly**: Add exceptions or new rules that specifically address these outliers without negatively impacting the overall model performance.

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Chemical Expertise**: Collaborate with chemists or domain experts to validate the chemical rationale behind each rule. This collaboration can help ensure that the rules are scientifically sound and aligned with experimental observations.
- **Data Quality**: Verify the quality and consistency of the experimental data used for training. Inaccurate or noisy data can adversely affect model performance and rule effectiveness.
- **Rule Hierarchy and Weighting**: Consider implementing a hierarchy or weighting scheme for the rules. Rules with stronger scientific justification or higher predictive power could be given more influence in the model's predictions.

**Conclusion:**

The current set of rules, particularly **Rule 16** and **Rule 19**, are contributing to decreased model performance and misclassifications. By refining these rules, enhancing generalization, and leveraging insights from the SHAP analysis, we can improve the effectiveness of the rules and, consequently, the accuracy of the model. Iterative refinement and validation against experimental data will be crucial in developing a robust set of rules that accurately predict the loading of modifiers on catalysts.

**Summary of Discussions**

The current set of rules aims to predict the yield of a radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction by classifying modifiers based on their SMILES representations. Recent analysis of these rules has revealed several issues impacting their effectiveness:

- **Metric Performance**: The train support has decreased, indicating that the current rules cover a smaller portion of the dataset. Confidence and lift values have not improved significantly, suggesting that the rules may have reached a local minimum in performance.

- **Accuracy Decline**: The validation accuracy has dropped from previous consistent values around 76% to approximately 48.57%. This decrease indicates that the model is underfitting and failing to capture underlying patterns in the data.

- **SHAP Analysis Findings**: Specific rules, particularly **Rule 16** and **Rule 19**, are contributing to misclassifications. Rule 16 is causing overestimation of high loading in some molecules where the experimental loading is low, while failing to predict high loading for certain molecules where the experimental value is high.

- **Rule Implementation Issues**: Problems have been identified in the SMARTS patterns used for matching, such as incorrect syntax, overly broad patterns, and lack of specificity in capturing the intended molecular features.

**Directions to Optimize Current Rules**

To address these issues and improve the current rules, the following suggestions are proposed:

1. **Correct SMARTS Patterns Syntax**:
   - **Rule 1**: Adjust the SMARTS pattern to remove unnecessary brackets and correctly represent unbranched aliphatic monocarboxylic acids. Ensure terminal amino or hydroxyl groups on chains longer than six carbons are excluded. For example, modify the pattern to `f'{unbranched_aliphatic_chain}[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'`.

2. **Increase Specificity in Functional Group Matching**:
   - **Rule 2 High Yield**: Refine the patterns to match amino acids with polar side chains specifically. Use SMARTS patterns that represent side chains containing polar groups within standard amino acid structures.
   - **Rule 2 Low Yield**: Adjust the pattern to accurately capture amino acids with hydrophobic or bulky aromatic side chains, ensuring only the intended molecules are matched.

3. **Refine Aromatic Substituent Patterns**:
   - **Rule 3**: Ensure the SMARTS patterns differentiate between electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids. Incorporate specific patterns for substituents like amino, hydroxy, aldehyde, trifluoromethyl, and methyl groups.

4. **Improve Structural Context in Patterns**:
   - **Rule 4**: Distinguish between modifiers where the carboxylic acid is directly attached to a nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring and those connected through an additional aromatic ring by incorporating ring connectivity into the patterns.

5. **Differentiate Thiol Group Positions**:
   - **Rule 5**: Modify SMARTS patterns to distinguish between thiol groups on short aliphatic chains and those attached directly to aromatic rings. Include ring aromaticity and positional information to prevent misclassification.

6. **Explicit Chain Length and Branching Specifications**:
   - **Rule 6 and Rule 7**: Use SMARTS syntax to specify exact chain lengths and branching requirements. For example, define unbranched chains with a specific number of carbons to match the intended molecular structures.

7. **Address Exceptions and Additional Conditions**:
   - Incorporate additional logic to enforce conditions like exclusions of certain functional groups on longer chains. Perform multiple substructure searches and combine results to accurately reflect the rules.

8. **Test Patterns Against Known Molecules**:
   - Validate each SMARTS pattern against a curated set of positive and negative examples to ensure they match only the intended molecules. Adjust patterns based on testing outcomes.

9. **Leverage Standard Chemical Definitions**:
   - Use definitions from standard chemical libraries or databases to improve pattern accuracy and alignment with IUPAC nomenclature, enhancing the reliability of the rules.

10. **Review Code for Formatting Errors**:
    - Check the code that processes patterns into the 'patterns' dictionary for any syntax errors or incorrect variable references. Ensure that patterns are correctly implemented in the codebase.

11. **Reassess Problematic Rules**:
    - **Rule 16 and Rule 19**: Given their significant contribution to misclassifications, review these rules thoroughly. Ensure that their conditions are neither too broad nor conflicting with other rules. Adjust or refine them to improve prediction accuracy.

12. **Enhance Model Generalization**:
    - Incorporate additional molecular descriptors or features that might improve the model's ability to differentiate between high and low yield modifiers. Balance rule complexity to avoid overfitting while capturing necessary data patterns.

**Possibility for Further Optimization**

Based on the analysis, there is a clear possibility for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. The decline in model performance and identified issues with specific rules indicate that improvements can be made to enhance accuracy and reliability. By refining the SMARTS patterns, increasing specificity, and thoroughly testing the rules, we can develop a more effective model that generalizes well to new data.

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are unbranched aliphatic monocarboxylic acids with chain lengths up to eight carbons result in high yield, provided they do not have terminal amino or hydroxy groups on chains longer than six carbons.**
  - *Rationale*: Unbranched aliphatic acids can efficiently interact with the catalyst's active sites without steric hindrance. Terminal amino or hydroxy groups on longer chains may interfere with the catalyst or the reaction mechanism.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **Octanoic acid**
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids or amino acids with polar side chains result in high yield, whereas those with hydrophobic or bulky aromatic side chains result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Polar side chains can enhance interactions with the catalyst, promoting high yield. Hydrophobic or bulky side chains may cause steric hindrance or reduce catalyst compatibility.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
  - *Low Yield Examples*:

    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating para-substituents (e.g., amino or hydroxy groups) result in high yield, while those with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., aldehyde, trifluoromethyl, or methyl groups) at the para position result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups can enhance the π-electron density of the aromatic ring, improving interactions with the catalyst. Electron-withdrawing groups can decrease reactivity or interfere with the catalyst.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers where the carboxylic acid group is directly attached to a nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring result in high yield; those where the heteroaromatic ring is connected through an additional aromatic ring result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Direct attachment allows for effective coordination with metal centers in the catalyst. Additional aromatic rings can introduce steric hindrance and reduce effective interaction.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
    - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups on short chains result in high yield, whereas those with thiol groups attached directly to an aromatic ring result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**
  - *Rationale*: Thiol groups on short aliphatic chains can act as ligands enhancing catalyst activity. Thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings can strongly bind to metal centers, deactivating the catalyst.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (3-mercaptopropionic acid)
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain result in high yield, while those with a single hydroxyl group on longer chains result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups can increase solubility and interaction with the catalyst. A single hydroxyl group on a long chain may not offer these benefits and can introduce unfavorable steric effects.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with perfluoroalkyl groups attached to the carboxylic acid result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Perfluoroalkyl groups are highly electron-withdrawing and hydrophobic, which can hinder interactions with the catalyst and reduce solubility in the reaction medium.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing polyether chains ending with a carboxylic acid group result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Polyether chains can increase flexibility and steric bulk, reducing the ability of the modifier to interact effectively with the catalyst.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy or hydroxy-substituted phenyl groups connected via an aliphatic chain result in high yield, whereas those with these substituents directly attached to the benzene ring result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: The aliphatic chain can provide flexibility and optimal positioning of functional groups for better catalyst interaction. Direct substitution on the aromatic ring may hinder effective binding due to steric factors.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups attached to aromatic or aliphatic chains result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde and ketone groups can react with amino or hydroxyl groups in the system or coordinate with metal centers, disrupting catalyst activity.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with electron-withdrawing trifluoroacetyl groups result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Strong electron-withdrawing groups can decrease the electron density of the modifier, hindering interactions with the catalyst and possibly deactivating it.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic amino acids with bulky acetamido or modified side chains result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Bulky side chains can create steric hindrance, reducing the modifier's ability to interact effectively with the catalyst.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing terminal amino groups on long aliphatic chains (seven carbons or more) result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Terminal amino groups on long chains may interfere with the catalyst, possibly through coordination that leads to catalyst deactivation.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with electron-rich heteroaromatic side chains result in high yield, whereas those with simple hydrophobic aromatic side chains result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Electron-rich heteroaromatic rings can enhance interactions with the catalyst, while simple hydrophobic rings may not provide the necessary interaction for high yield.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing groups that strongly coordinate to metals (e.g., thiol groups attached directly to an aromatic ring) may result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**
  - *Rationale*: Strongly coordinating groups can bind irreversibly to metal centers in the catalyst, reducing its availability and activity.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Correct the SMARTS patterns syntax in the rules to accurately represent the intended molecular structures.** For example, in **Rule 1**, adjust the SMARTS pattern to properly represent unbranched aliphatic monocarboxylic acids. Remove unnecessary brackets and ensure correct use of wildcard characters. Exclude terminal amino or hydroxy groups on chains longer than six carbons by incorporating chain length specifications and functional group positions. For instance, use a pattern like `C(CCCCCCC)C(=O)O` for octanoic acid.

- **Advice 2**: **Increase specificity in functional group matching for amino acids with polar side chains.** In **Rule 2**, refine the SMARTS patterns to specifically match α-amino acids with polar side chains, such as carboxylic acid or hydroxyl groups. Exclude amino acids with hydrophobic or bulky aromatic side chains. Utilize patterns that capture the side chain functionality, like `[NX3][CX3](=O)[OX1]` for the amino acid backbone and append specific side chain patterns.

- **Advice 3**: **Refine aromatic substituent patterns to differentiate between electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups at the para position.** In **Rule 3**, ensure that the SMARTS patterns accurately capture modifiers with electron-donating substituents (e.g., amino `[NH2]`, hydroxy `[OH]`) at the para position of benzoic acid derivatives. Exclude those with electron-withdrawing groups by specifying the absence of such groups using negation logic in the patterns.

- **Advice 4**: **Improve structural context in patterns by incorporating connectivity and ring specifications.** For **Rule 4**, distinguish modifiers where the carboxylic acid is directly attached to a nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring. Use SMARTS patterns that define the carboxylic acid group connected directly to a heteroaromatic ring, such as `c[n][c]C(=O)O`. Ensure that patterns exclude additional aromatic rings between the heteroaromatic ring and the carboxylic acid.

- **Advice 5**: **Differentiate thiol group positions by specifying their attachment to aliphatic chains versus aromatic rings.** In **Rule 5**, adjust the SMARTS patterns to match thiol groups (`[SH]`) connected to short aliphatic chains, and exclude thiol groups attached to aromatic carbons. Use patterns like `CC[SH]` for aliphatic thiols and explicitly negate aromatic attachments.

- **Advice 6**: **Specify exact chain lengths and branching in the SMARTS patterns.** For rules involving chain lengths, such as **Rules 1 and 6**, use explicit representations like `[CH2]n` where `n` is the number of repeats corresponding to the desired chain length. For example, `[CH3][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2]C(=O)O` for octanoic acid.

- **Advice 7**: **Address exceptions and additional conditions by incorporating logical operators in SMARTS patterns.** Use combination of patterns to exclude molecules with undesirable functional groups on longer chains. For instance, in **Rule 1**, use logical AND/OR operators to exclude chains longer than six carbons with terminal amino or hydroxy groups.

- **Advice 8**: **Test SMARTS patterns against known high yield and low yield examples to validate their accuracy.** Use the provided dataset to verify that each pattern correctly matches all intended high-yield modifiers and excludes low-yield ones. Adjust patterns based on any mismatches found during testing.

- **Advice 9**: **Leverage standard chemical definitions and databases for accurate pattern development.** Utilize resources like the SMARTSviewer or chemical informatics toolkits (e.g., RDKit) to construct and visualize SMARTS patterns, ensuring they align with standard chemical nomenclature and structures.

- **Advice 10**: **Review the code implementation for formatting and logical errors.** Ensure that all variables used in the patterns are correctly defined and referenced in the code. Check for syntax errors that might prevent patterns from being recognized or applied properly.

- **Advice 11**: **Reassess and refine problematic rules, particularly Rule 2 and Rule 14, to reduce misclassifications.** Analyze the molecules incorrectly classified due to these rules and adjust the patterns to be more selective. For example, in **Rule 2**, ensure that the pattern excludes amino acids like phenylalanine by incorporating side chain specificity.

- **Advice 12**: **Enhance model generalization by incorporating additional molecular descriptors.** Consider features such as hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, rotatable bonds, or topological polar surface area to improve differentiation between high and low yield modifiers.

- **Advice 13**: **Simplify overlapping rules to reduce complexity and avoid conflicts.** Identify rules that may cover similar structural features and consolidate them where possible. Clarify distinctions between rules to ensure that each targets a specific set of modifiers without overlap.

- **Advice 14**: **Standardize the methodology for deriving SMARTS patterns from chemical rationale.** Develop a consistent approach for translating chemical concepts into SMARTS syntax, documenting the rationale and ensuring reproducibility in pattern creation.

- **Advice 15**: **Standardize the order and logic of rule evaluation to maintain consistency.** Decide whether rules are to be applied in a sequential manner with priority or simultaneously with combined logic. Implement the necessary code structure to reflect this decision.

    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups on short chains (three carbons) result in high yield, whereas those with thiol groups attached directly to an aromatic ring result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**
  - *Rationale*: Thiol groups on short aliphatic chains can act as ligands enhancing catalyst activity. Thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings can strongly bind to metal centers, deactivating the catalyst.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain result in high yield, while those with a single hydroxyl group on longer chains result in low yield.**

  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing polyether chains ending with a carboxylic acid group result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Polyether chains can increase flexibility and steric bulk, reducing the ability of the modifier to interact effectively with the catalyst.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with perfluoroalkyl groups attached to the carboxylic acid result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Perfluoroalkyl groups are highly electron-withdrawing and hydrophobic, which can hinder interactions with the catalyst and reduce solubility in the reaction medium.

    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups attached to aromatic rings result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde and ketone groups can react with active sites or coordinate with metal centers in the catalyst, disrupting its activity.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with electron-rich heteroaromatic side chains result in high yield, whereas those with simple hydrophobic aromatic side chains result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Electron-rich heteroaromatic rings can enhance interactions with the catalyst, while simple hydrophobic rings may not provide the necessary interaction for high yield.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing functional groups that strongly coordinate to metals (e.g., trifluoroacetyl groups) result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation.**
  - *Rationale*: Strongly coordinating groups can bind to metal centers in the catalyst, reducing its availability and activity.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy or hydroxy-substituted phenyl groups connected via a short aliphatic chain result in high yield, while those with these substituents directly attached to the benzene ring result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: The aliphatic chain can provide flexibility and optimal positioning of functional groups for better catalyst interaction. Direct substitution on the aromatic ring may hinder effective binding due to steric factors.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are linear aliphatic monocarboxylic acids with chain lengths up to eight carbons result in high yield. Terminal amino or hydroxy groups are acceptable on chains with five carbons or fewer; however, if the chain is six carbons or longer, terminal amino or hydroxy groups lead to low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Unbranched aliphatic acids can efficiently interact with the catalyst without steric hindrance. Terminal functional groups on longer chains may interfere with catalyst interaction or the reaction mechanism.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **Octanoic acid**
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) result in high yield, while amino acids with hydrophobic or bulky aromatic side chains result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Polar side chains enhance interactions with the catalyst, promoting high yield. Hydrophobic or bulky side chains may cause steric hindrance or reduce catalyst compatibility.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with polar substituents (e.g., amino, nitro groups) at the para position result in high yield, whereas those with non-polar substituents (e.g., methyl groups) or electron-withdrawing aldehyde groups at the para position result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Polar substituents can enhance the electronic interaction with the catalyst, improving reactivity. Non-polar or electron-withdrawing groups may decrease reactivity or hinder catalyst interaction.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers where the carboxylic acid group is directly attached to a nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring result in high yield; those where the heteroaromatic ring is connected through an additional aromatic ring result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Direct attachment allows effective coordination with metal centers in the catalyst. Additional aromatic rings can introduce steric hindrance and reduce effective interaction.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups on short chains (three carbons) result in high yield, whereas those with thiol groups attached directly to an aromatic ring result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**
  - *Rationale*: Thiol groups on short aliphatic chains can act as ligands enhancing catalyst activity. Thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings can strongly bind to metal centers, deactivating the catalyst.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain result in high yield, while those with a single hydroxyl group on longer chains result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and interaction with the catalyst. A single hydroxyl group on a long chain may not offer these benefits and can introduce unfavorable steric effects.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing polyether chains ending with a carboxylic acid group result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Polyether chains can increase flexibility and steric bulk, reducing the ability of the modifier to interact effectively with the catalyst.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with perfluoroalkyl groups attached to the carboxylic acid result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Perfluoroalkyl groups are highly electron-withdrawing and hydrophobic, which can hinder interactions with the catalyst and reduce solubility in the reaction medium.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups attached to aromatic rings result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde and ketone groups can react with active sites or coordinate with metal centers in the catalyst, disrupting its activity.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with electron-rich heteroaromatic side chains result in high yield, whereas those with simple hydrophobic aromatic side chains result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Electron-rich heteroaromatic rings can enhance interactions with the catalyst, while simple hydrophobic rings may not provide the necessary interaction for high yield.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing functional groups that strongly coordinate to metals (e.g., trifluoroacetyl groups) result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation.**
  - *Rationale*: Strongly coordinating groups can bind to metal centers in the catalyst, reducing its availability and activity.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy or hydroxy-substituted phenyl groups connected via a short aliphatic chain result in high yield, while those with these substituents directly attached to the benzene ring result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: The aliphatic chain can provide flexibility and optimal positioning of functional groups for better catalyst interaction. Direct substitution on the aromatic ring may hinder effective binding due to steric factors.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: In **Rule 1**, the function `check_rule1(mol)` is returning `1` for all molecules, indicating that it matches all SMILES in the list, which is incorrect. The issue lies in the way the aliphatic chain is traversed. The code currently breaks after finding the first carbon neighbor of the carboxylic acid carbon:

  ```python
  for nbr in ca_c.GetNeighbors():
      if nbr.GetAtomicNum() == 6:
          queue.append((nbr.GetIdx(), 1))
          break
  ```

  This means it only considers one possible chain and ignores others, potentially missing branching or selecting incorrect chains. To fix this, remove the `break` statement so that all carbon neighbors are added to the queue for traversal:

  ```python
  for nbr in ca_c.GetNeighbors():
      if nbr.GetAtomicNum() == 6:
          queue.append((nbr.GetIdx(), 1))
  ```

  Additionally, ensure that the code correctly identifies linear (unbranched) chains by checking that each carbon in the chain is connected to at most two carbons (excluding the carboxylic carbon). If branching is detected, the molecule should not match **Rule 1**.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: In **Rule 2**, the SMARTS pattern for high yield modifiers may be too restrictive and fails to match α-amino dicarboxylic acids like aspartic acid and glutamic acid, possibly due to chiral centers or hydrogen counts. The current pattern is:

  ```python
  pattern_high = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[NX3][CHX4][CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CH2][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]')
  ```

  To make the pattern more general and inclusive, modify it to:

  ```python
  pattern_high = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[NX3][CX4H][CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CH2][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]')
  ```

  This change uses `[CX4H]` to match any tetrahedral carbon with one hydrogen (allowing for chiral centers without specifying stereochemistry). Also, ensure that hydrogen atoms are explicitly added to the molecule before substructure matching:

  ```python
  mol = Chem.AddHs(mol)
  ```

- ** Suggestion 3 **: For the low yield pattern in **Rule 2**, the current SMARTS:

  ```python
  pattern_low = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[NX3][CHX4][CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CHX4][c]')
  ```

  Only matches amino acids with side chains directly attached to an aromatic carbon. However, amino acids like phenylalanine have a CH₂ group between the α-carbon and the aromatic ring. Update the pattern to include this CH₂ spacer:

  ```python
  pattern_low = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[NX3][CX4H][CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CH2][c]')
  ```

- ** Suggestion 4 **: In **Rule 3**, the SMARTS patterns might be too specific and miss molecules that should match. For example, the patterns require substituents to be exactly at the para position. Update the patterns to ensure correct positional matching by labeling atoms in the aromatic ring:

  ```python
  # High yield patterns
  pattern_amino = Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1cc([NX3H2,NX3H1,NX3+0,NX4+])ccc1C(=O)[OX2H1]')
  pattern_nitro = Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1cc([NX3+](=O)[O-])ccc1C(=O)[OX2H1]')
  # Low yield patterns
  pattern_methyl = Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1cc([CH3])ccc1C(=O)[OX2H1]')
  pattern_formyl = Chem.MolFromSmarts('c1cc([CX3H=O])ccc1C(=O)[OX2H1]')
  ```

  This modification allows matching of substituents at any position on the aromatic ring and can be refined by adding constraints if necessary.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: Ensure that all molecules are sanitized and have explicit hydrogens added before substructure searching. This can prevent mismatches due to implicit hydrogens or valence issues:

  ```python
  mol = Chem.AddHs(mol)
  Chem.SanitizeMol(mol)
  ```

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Add detailed logging or print statements within each rule function to output which molecules are being matched and which are not. This will help identify where patterns are failing:

  ```python
  if mol.HasSubstructMatch(pattern_high):
      print(f"Rule 2 High Yield matched for SMILES: {smi}")
      return 1
  elif mol.HasSubstructMatch(pattern_low):
      print(f"Rule 2 Low Yield matched for SMILES: {smi}")
      return -1
  else:
      return 0
  ```

- ** Suggestion 7 **: Expand the SMARTS patterns to account for tautomers, resonance structures, and different protonation states. You may need to generate tautomers or use MolStandardize to normalize molecules before matching.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Review the molecules in the SMILES list and manually verify which rules they should match. Use this as a benchmark to adjust SMARTS patterns until the code's output aligns with expected results.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: Remove the broad exception handling (`except:`) in each rule function. Instead, catch specific exceptions and provide informative error messages or logs. This will prevent the code from silently failing and returning incorrect zeros.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Implement unit tests for each rule with known molecules that should match or not match. This will ensure that any future changes to the code do not break the existing functionality.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are linear aliphatic monocarboxylic acids with chain lengths up to eight carbons result in high yield. Terminal amino or hydroxy groups are acceptable on chains with five carbons or fewer; however, if the chain is six carbons or longer, terminal amino or hydroxy groups lead to low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Unbranched aliphatic acids can efficiently interact with the catalyst without steric hindrance. Terminal functional groups on longer chains may interfere with catalyst interaction or the reaction mechanism.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **Octanoic acid**
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) result in high yield, while amino acids with hydrophobic or bulky aromatic side chains result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Polar side chains enhance interactions with the catalyst, promoting high yield. Hydrophobic or bulky side chains may cause steric hindrance or reduce catalyst compatibility.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with polar substituents (e.g., amino, nitro groups) at the para position result in high yield, whereas those with non-polar substituents (e.g., methyl groups) or electron-withdrawing aldehyde groups at the para position result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Polar substituents can enhance the electronic interaction with the catalyst, improving reactivity. Non-polar or electron-withdrawing groups may decrease reactivity or hinder catalyst interaction.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers where the carboxylic acid group is directly attached to a nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring result in high yield; those where the heteroaromatic ring is connected through an additional aromatic ring result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Direct attachment allows effective coordination with metal centers in the catalyst. Additional aromatic rings can introduce steric hindrance and reduce effective interaction.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups on short chains (three carbons) result in high yield, whereas those with thiol groups attached directly to an aromatic ring result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**
  - *Rationale*: Thiol groups on short aliphatic chains can act as ligands enhancing catalyst activity. Thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings can strongly bind to metal centers, deactivating the catalyst.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain result in high yield, while those with a single hydroxyl group on longer chains result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and interaction with the catalyst. A single hydroxyl group on a long chain may not offer these benefits and can introduce unfavorable steric effects.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing polyether chains ending with a carboxylic acid group result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Polyether chains can increase flexibility and steric bulk, reducing the ability of the modifier to interact effectively with the catalyst.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with perfluoroalkyl groups attached to the carboxylic acid result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Perfluoroalkyl groups are highly electron-withdrawing and hydrophobic, which can hinder interactions with the catalyst and reduce solubility in the reaction medium.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups attached to aromatic rings result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde and ketone groups can react with active sites or coordinate with metal centers in the catalyst, disrupting its activity.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with electron-rich heteroaromatic side chains result in high yield, whereas those with simple hydrophobic aromatic side chains result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Electron-rich heteroaromatic rings can enhance interactions with the catalyst, while simple hydrophobic rings may not provide the necessary interaction for high yield.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing functional groups that strongly coordinate to metals (e.g., trifluoroacetyl groups) result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation.**
  - *Rationale*: Strongly coordinating groups can bind to metal centers in the catalyst, reducing its availability and activity.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy or hydroxy-substituted phenyl groups connected via a short aliphatic chain result in high yield, while those with these substituents directly attached to the benzene ring result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: The aliphatic chain can provide flexibility and optimal positioning of functional groups for better catalyst interaction. Direct substitution on the aromatic ring may hinder effective binding due to steric factors.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Revise the SMARTS pattern for Rule 2 to accurately detect α-amino dicarboxylic acids.** The current pattern in the code (`'[NX3][CX4H][CX3](=O)[OX2H1][CH2][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'`) may not match compounds like aspartic acid (`'N[C@@H](C(=O)O)CC(=O)O'`) in the SMILES list. Consider simplifying the pattern to capture amino acids with an additional carboxylic acid on the side chain. For example, use a pattern like `'[NX3][CX4H]([#6])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'` to detect α-amino acids, and then check for the presence of a second carboxylic acid (`'[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]'`) connected via a carbon chain. This adjustment should help the code identify α-amino dicarboxylic acids correctly.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Modify the SMARTS pattern for Rule 4 to correctly match modifiers where the carboxylic acid group is directly attached to a nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring.** The current pattern (`'[nX2]:c(:c):c(:c):c[C](=O)[O][H]'`) is overly specific and may not match valid compounds in the SMILES list. A more general pattern like `'[n][c](:[cH]):[cH]:[cH][C](=O)[O][H]'` could be used to match any nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring directly bonded to a carboxylic acid group. Additionally, ensure that the pattern accounts for various positions of the nitrogen atom within the ring and includes aromatic rings of different sizes.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Improve Rule 6 by incorporating chain length considerations and refining the hydroxyl group detection.** The current implementation counts multiple hydroxyl groups but may incorrectly assign a single hydroxyl group on longer chains as low yield without considering the actual chain length. Adjust the code to check for multiple hydroxyl groups on short aliphatic chains (e.g., chains with fewer than six carbons) for high yield, and single hydroxyl groups on longer chains (more than six carbons) for low yield. This refinement aligns more closely with the rationale provided in the rule.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Expand the SMARTS patterns in Rule 3 to include all relevant polar substituents and electron-withdrawing groups at the para position.** The current patterns focus on amino and nitro groups for high yield and methyl and aldehyde groups for low yield. Modify the high-yield patterns to include other polar substituents like hydroxyl (`-OH`) and methoxy (`-OCH3`) groups. Similarly, extend the low-yield patterns to capture other non-polar substituents and electron-withdrawing groups like cyano (`-CN`) or halogens (`-F`, `-Cl`, `-Br`, `-I`) at the para position. For example, use patterns like `'c1ccc([OX2H,OX2][CH3])cc1C(=O)[OX2H1]'` for high yield and `'c1ccc([CX3](=O)[CX4H])cc1C(=O)[OX2H1]'` for low yield.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Generalize the SMARTS pattern in Rule 8 to accurately detect perfluoroalkyl groups attached to carboxylic acids.** The current pattern (`'[C][C]([F,Cl,Br,I])([F,Cl,Br,I])[C](=O)[OX2H1]'`) may be too specific and miss some perfluoroalkyl-containing compounds. Consider using a more inclusive pattern like `'[CX4]([CX4](F)(F)F)(F)(F)C(=O)[OX2H1]'` or `'[CX4][CX4](F)(F)F'` connected to a carboxylic acid group. This adjustment ensures that any perfluoroalkyl chain, regardless of its length, attached to a carboxylic acid is correctly identified.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Review and test all SMARTS patterns for rules that result in zero matches across the dataset.** For rules like Rule 2 and Rule 4, which have zero entries in the feature matrix, re-evaluate the SMARTS patterns to ensure they align with the chemical structures described in the natural language rules. Use sample compounds from the dataset to validate and refine the patterns. Additionally, consider using cheminformatics tools to visualize and test the SMARTS patterns against known examples to confirm their accuracy.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are linear aliphatic monocarboxylic acids with chain lengths up to eight carbons result in high yield. Terminal amino or hydroxy groups are acceptable on chains with five carbons or fewer; however, if the chain is six carbons or longer, terminal amino or hydroxy groups lead to low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Unbranched aliphatic acids can efficiently interact with the catalyst without steric hindrance. Terminal functional groups on longer chains may interfere with catalyst interaction or the reaction mechanism.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **Octanoic acid**
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) result in high yield, while amino acids with hydrophobic or bulky aromatic side chains result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Polar side chains enhance interactions with the catalyst, promoting high yield. Hydrophobic or bulky side chains may cause steric hindrance or reduce catalyst compatibility.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with polar substituents (e.g., amino, nitro groups) at the para position result in high yield, whereas those with non-polar substituents (e.g., methyl groups) or electron-withdrawing aldehyde groups at the para position result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Polar substituents can enhance the electronic interaction with the catalyst, improving reactivity. Non-polar or electron-withdrawing groups may decrease reactivity or hinder catalyst interaction.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers where the carboxylic acid group is directly attached to a nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring result in high yield; those where the heteroaromatic ring is connected through an additional aromatic ring result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Direct attachment allows effective coordination with metal centers in the catalyst. Additional aromatic rings can introduce steric hindrance and reduce effective interaction.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups on short chains (three carbons) result in high yield, whereas those with thiol groups attached directly to an aromatic ring result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**
  - *Rationale*: Thiol groups on short aliphatic chains can act as ligands enhancing catalyst activity. Thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings can strongly bind to metal centers, deactivating the catalyst.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain result in high yield, while those with a single hydroxyl group on longer chains result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and interaction with the catalyst. A single hydroxyl group on a long chain may not offer these benefits and can introduce unfavorable steric effects.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing polyether chains ending with a carboxylic acid group result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Polyether chains can increase flexibility and steric bulk, reducing the ability of the modifier to interact effectively with the catalyst.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with perfluoroalkyl groups attached to the carboxylic acid result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Perfluoroalkyl groups are highly electron-withdrawing and hydrophobic, which can hinder interactions with the catalyst and reduce solubility in the reaction medium.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups attached to aromatic rings result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde and ketone groups can react with active sites or coordinate with metal centers in the catalyst, disrupting its activity.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with electron-rich heteroaromatic side chains result in high yield, whereas those with simple hydrophobic aromatic side chains result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Electron-rich heteroaromatic rings can enhance interactions with the catalyst, while simple hydrophobic rings may not provide the necessary interaction for high yield.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing functional groups that strongly coordinate to metals (e.g., trifluoroacetyl groups) result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation.**
  - *Rationale*: Strongly coordinating groups can bind to metal centers in the catalyst, reducing its availability and activity.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy or hydroxy-substituted phenyl groups connected via a short aliphatic chain result in high yield, while those with these substituents directly attached to the benzene ring result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: The aliphatic chain can provide flexibility and optimal positioning of functional groups for better catalyst interaction. Direct substitution on the aromatic ring may hinder effective binding due to steric factors.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: *Rule 1* is intended for **monocarboxylic acids**, but the current code does not check for the presence of only one carboxylic acid group. For example, aspartic acid (a dicarboxylic acid) is incorrectly identified as matching Rule 1. **Modify the code to ensure that it only matches molecules with a single carboxylic acid group** by counting the number of carboxylic acid functionalities and excluding dicarboxylic acids.

- **Suggestion 2**: In *Rule 2*, the code's SMARTS pattern for α-amino dicarboxylic acids is too specific and does not match molecules like aspartic acid and glutamic acid. **Update the SMARTS pattern to more generally represent α-amino dicarboxylic acids**. The pattern should allow for variation in the side chain length and accept any molecule where an amino group is on the alpha carbon of a dicarboxylic acid.

- **Suggestion 3**: For *Rule 3*, the SMARTS patterns may not comprehensively cover all polar substituents at the para position. **Expand the high-yield SMARTS patterns to include all relevant polar groups mentioned in the rule**, such as hydroxyl and methoxy groups, and ensure that electron-withdrawing groups like aldehydes are correctly identified in the low-yield patterns.

- **Suggestion 4**: In *Rule 4*, the code may not accurately distinguish between carboxylic acids directly attached to nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic rings and those connected via an additional aromatic ring. **Refine the SMARTS patterns to precisely match the desired structures**, perhaps by explicitly defining the absence or presence of additional aromatic rings between the heterocycle and the carboxylic acid group.

- **Suggestion 5**: For *Rule 5*, the code should ensure that the thiol group is on an aliphatic chain of exactly three carbons in length. **Adjust the SMARTS pattern to match aliphatic chains with three carbons bearing a thiol group** and verify that aromatic thiols are correctly identified and flagged as low yield.

- **Suggestion 6**: In *Rule 6*, the code may not correctly handle molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups. **Implement a method to count the number of hydroxyl groups on aliphatic carbons**, and consider the chain length when there is only one hydroxyl group to determine if it should result in a low yield.

- **Suggestion 7**: For *Rule 7*, the current SMARTS pattern might not capture all types of polyether chains ending with a carboxylic acid group. **Generalize the SMARTS pattern to identify any polyether chain (multiple ether linkages) terminating with a carboxylic acid**, regardless of the specific chain length or substituents.

- **Suggestion 8**: In *Rule 8*, the detection of perfluoroalkyl groups may be too specific. **Modify the SMARTS pattern to match any perfluoroalkyl chain attached to the carboxylic acid group**, not just specific examples. The pattern should account for varying chain lengths and degrees of fluorination.

- **Suggestion 9**: For *Rule 9*, ensure that all aldehyde and ketone groups attached to aromatic rings are identified. **Broaden the SMARTS patterns to include various positions of the carbonyl group on the aromatic ring** and consider both aldehydes and ketones in ortho, meta, and para positions.

- **Suggestion 10**: In *Rule 10*, the code may not effectively differentiate between electron-rich heteroaromatic side chains and simple hydrophobic aromatic side chains. **Revise the SMARTS patterns to accurately represent amino acids like tryptophan (high yield) and phenylalanine (low yield)**, accounting for different heteroaromatic systems and ensuring hydrophobic aromatic rings are correctly identified.

- **Suggestion 11**: For *Rule 11*, the code should detect any functional groups that strongly coordinate to metals, such as trifluoroacetyl and similar groups. **Expand the SMARTS patterns to include other metal-coordinating functional groups** mentioned in the rationale or commonly known to deactivate catalysts.

- **Suggestion 12**: In *Rule 12*, the distinction between methoxy or hydroxy-substituted phenyl groups connected via a short aliphatic chain versus those directly attached may not be precise. **Adjust the SMARTS patterns to ensure that the aliphatic linker is accounted for** in the high-yield patterns and that direct attachment without the linker is correctly marked as low yield.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Performance Analysis of Current Rules Based on Metrics**

After analyzing the current metrics in comparison with the reference metrics, the following observations can be made:

---

**Comparison with Reference Metrics:**

1. **Train Support:**
   - **Current:** 0.0643
   - **Reference Mean:** Approximately 0.1756
   - **Observation:** The current train support is significantly lower than the reference mean. This indicates that the current set of rules applies to a smaller portion of the dataset.

2. **Train Confidence:**
   - **Current:** 0.7257
   - **Reference Mean:** Approximately 0.5874
   - **Observation:** The current train confidence is higher than the reference mean. This suggests that when the rule conditions are met, there is a higher probability that the predicted outcome will occur.

3. **Train Lift:**
   - **Current:** 1.4529
   - **Reference Mean:** Approximately 1.1304
   - **Observation:** The current train lift is significantly higher than the reference mean. A lift greater than 1 indicates that the rule is better at predicting the outcome than random chance, and a higher lift signifies a stronger association between the rule conditions and predictions.

4. **Train Leverage:**
   - **Current:** 0.0173
   - **Reference Mean:** Approximately 0.0124
   - **Observation:** The current train leverage is higher than the reference mean. Positive leverage values suggest a stronger association between the items than expected by chance.

---

**Interpretation of the Metrics:**

- **Improved Confidence and Lift:** The increased confidence and lift indicate that the current rules are more effective in predicting high yield when the rule conditions are met. This shows a stronger and more reliable association between the modifiers described in the rules and the catalytic performance.

- **Reduced Support:** The decrease in train support implies that the current rules cover a smaller subset of the dataset. While the predictions are more accurate when the rules apply, they are applicable to fewer cases.

- **Trade-off Between Precision and Coverage:** There is a noticeable trade-off where enhancements in precision (confidence and lift) are accompanied by a reduction in coverage (support). This suggests that the rules have become more specific, possibly excluding broader cases that were previously included.

---

**Assessment of Local Minimum and Iteration Sufficiency:**

- **Approaching Local Optimum:** The significant improvements in confidence and lift, coupled with the diminishing returns in support, suggest that the current rules are approaching a local optimum in terms of specificity and predictive strength.

- **Iteration Analysis:** Given that previous iterations have not concurrently improved support alongside confidence and lift, and considering the current metrics' trends, it may indicate that further iterations may yield minimal improvements or could potentially overfit the model.

---

**Recommendations for Improving Current Rules:**

1. **Balance Between Support and Confidence:**
   - **Action:** Re-evaluate the rules to find a balance between generality and specificity.
   - **Approach:** Slightly relax some stringent conditions in the rules to increase support without substantially compromising confidence and lift.

2. **Rule Generalization:**
   - **Action:** Analyze the possibility of combining similar rules or identifying common patterns.
   - **Approach:** Merge rules that have overlapping conditions or outcomes to create broader rules that cover more data points.

3. **Incorporate Additional Data Insights:**
   - **Action:** Utilize any available data to understand why certain modifiers are excluded.
   - **Approach:** Investigate the cases not covered by the current rules to identify potential modifiers or conditions that could be included.

4. **Evaluate Rule Conditions for Over-Specificity:**
   - **Action:** Check if any conditions in the rules are too restrictive.
   - **Approach:** For example, in Rule 12, consider if modifiers with methoxy or hydroxy groups directly attached to the benzene ring can sometimes result in high yield under certain conditions.

5. **Consider Alternative Metrics:**
   - **Action:** Incorporate additional metrics like F-score or ROC curves.
   - **Approach:** These metrics can provide a more nuanced understanding of the trade-off between precision and recall (support).

6. **Cross-Validation:**
   - **Action:** Use cross-validation techniques to assess the robustness of the rules.
   - **Approach:** This can help ensure that the high confidence and lift are not due to overfitting and that the rules generalize well to unseen data.

7. **Incremental Adjustments:**
   - **Action:** Make small, systematic adjustments to rules rather than broad changes.
   - **Approach:** Modify one aspect of a rule at a time to monitor its impact on the metrics closely.

8. **Engage Domain Expertise:**
   - **Action:** Consult with domain experts to validate the practical relevance of the rules.
   - **Approach:** Experts may provide insights into chemical behaviors that can guide the refinement of rules.

---

**Specific Suggestions for Rule Improvement:**

- **Rule 1:** Consider expanding the acceptable chain lengths or functional groups slightly to increase support.

- **Rule 2:** Re-examine amino acids with hydrophobic side chains to see if any subsets may still result in high yield under certain conditions.

- **Rule 6:** Investigate if modifiers with single hydroxyl groups on medium-length chains could be included without significantly lowering confidence.

- **Rule 10:** Analyze the impact of modifiers with moderately electron-rich aromatic side chains, as they might contribute to increased support.

---

**Conclusion:**

While the current rules demonstrate strong predictive capabilities (high confidence and lift), the reduced support indicates limited applicability across the dataset. A balanced approach aiming to slightly broaden the rules could enhance support while maintaining acceptable levels of confidence and lift. Carefully managed iterations focusing on incremental adjustments and informed by domain expertise are recommended to improve the rules further. This strategy may help avoid local minima and achieve a model that generalizes better to a wider range of cases.

ML Commenter Message:
**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

Based on the latest training results, there is a noticeable decline in model performance compared to the reference metrics provided. The key observations are as follows:

- **Reference Metrics**:
  - **Validation Accuracies**: Consistently around **0.76**.
  - **Test Accuracies**: Ranging from **0.625** to **0.75**.

- **Current Iteration Metrics**:
  - **First 5-Fold Validation Performance**: Accuracy of **0.5714**.
  - **Second 5-Fold Validation Performance**: Accuracy of **0.4857**.
  - **Latest 5-Fold Validation Performance**: Accuracy of **0.5143**.

The decrease in validation accuracy from approximately **0.76** to **0.51** suggests that the current set of rules is less effective than previous iterations. This decline indicates that the model's predictive capability has diminished, and the current rules are not capturing the underlying patterns in the data as effectively.

**Evaluating Effectiveness**

The current rules are **not effective enough** based on:

- **Reduced Validation Accuracy**: A drop from **0.76** to **0.51** indicates the model is less accurate in predicting the correct catalyst loading classifications.
- **Inconsistent Predictions**: The SHAP analysis shows several instances where the model's predictions do not align with the experimental values.

**Assessing Overfitting/Underfitting**

The model appears to be experiencing **underfitting**:

- **Underfitting Indicators**:
  - **Low Model Complexity**: The rules may be too simplistic to capture the complexity of the data.
  - **Poor Training Performance**: The training accuracy is not significantly higher than the validation accuracy, suggesting the model isn't fitting the training data well.

Underfitting implies that the model does not capture the underlying structure of the data, leading to poor predictive performance on both training and unseen data.

**Analyzing Discrepancies Using SHAP Values**

The SHAP analysis highlights several discrepancies between predicted and experimental values:

- **Underestimated Loadings** (Predicted Low, Experimental High):
  - **Molecules**:
    - *C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N*
    - *C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O*
    - *C1=CNC(=O)C=C1C(=O)O*
    - *C1=CN=CC=C1CCCC(=O)O*
    - *C([C@@H](C(=O)O)N)C(=O)O*
    - *C1=C(C=NN1)C(=O)O*
    - *C(CS)C(=O)O*
    - *C1=CC(=CN=C1)C(=O)O*
  - **Problematic Rules**:
    - **Rule 3**: Shows significant negative SHAP values for these molecules, indicating it's heavily contributing to underestimation.
    - **Rule 6**: Also exhibits negative SHAP values, contributing to low predictions.
    - **Rule 5**: In some cases, adds to the negative impact.

- **Overestimated Loadings** (Predicted High, Experimental Low):
  - **Molecules**:
    - *C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N*
    - *COCCOCCOCC(=O)O*
    - *C1=CC(=CC=C1C2=CC=NC=C2)C(=O)O*
    - *C(=O)(C(C(C(C(F)(F)F)(F)F)(F)F)(F)F)O*
    - *C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)NCC(=O)O)O*
    - *CC1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=O)O*
  - **Problematic Rules**:
    - **Rule 3**: Shows positive SHAP values, incorrectly pushing the prediction towards high loading.
    - **Rule 5** and **Rule 6**: Contribute to the overestimation in certain cases.

**Interpreting Accuracy Improvements**

The current decrease in validation accuracy indicates that:

- **No Improvement**: The adjustments made to the rules did not enhance the model's predictive performance.
- **Local Minimum**: The model may have reached a plateau where further minor adjustments to the current rules are insufficient to improve accuracy.
- **Need for Significant Changes**: To achieve better performance, revisiting and refining the rules is necessary.

**Deriving Insights from SHAP Analysis**

The SHAP analysis suggests several opportunities for improving the current rules:

- **Rule 3** is frequently associated with high negative SHAP values in cases of underestimated loadings, indicating it may be too restrictive or incorrectly defined.
- **Rule 6** also shows negative SHAP values in underestimated cases, suggesting it may not accurately capture the effects of hydroxyl groups in certain molecular contexts.
- **Rule 5** occasionally contributes negatively, highlighting potential issues with how thiol groups are considered.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations aim to improve the current rules and enhance model performance:

1. **Refine Rule 3 (Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Polar Substituents)**:

   - **Issue**: Rule 3 negatively impacts predictions for molecules where the experimental loading is high, but the model predicts low loading.
   - **Improvement Suggestions**:
     - **Expand Substituent Definitions**: Consider including additional polar substituents that may contribute to high yield, such as halogens (e.g., bromine in *C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O*).
     - **Reassess Electron-Withdrawing Groups**: Some electron-withdrawing groups may, in certain contexts, enhance catalyst interaction. Modify the rule to account for these subtleties.
     - **Incorporate Position Effects**: Evaluate the impact of substituent positions other than the para position and adjust the rule to include ortho and meta positions if they positively affect yield.

2. **Adjust Rule 6 (Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups)**:

   - **Issue**: Rule 6 may be overly general, leading to misclassification of certain molecules.
   - **Improvement Suggestions**:
     - **Account for Chain Length and Hydroxyl Position**: Investigate how the position and number of hydroxyl groups relative to the carboxylic acid affect yield.
     - **Include Exceptions**: Identify cases where single hydroxyl groups on shorter chains contribute to high yield and adjust the rule accordingly.
     - **Examine Steric Factors**: Consider the impact of steric hindrance due to multiple hydroxyl groups and modify the rule to balance these effects.

3. **Revise Rule 5 (Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids with Thiol Groups)**:

   - **Issue**: Negative SHAP values indicate that Rule 5 may not accurately predict the impact of thiol groups in certain molecular contexts.
   - **Improvement Suggestions**:
     - **Broaden the Chain Length Consideration**: Examine thiol-containing modifiers with varying chain lengths to determine if high yield occurs beyond short chains.
     - **Evaluate Aromatic Thiols**: Reassess the assumption that thiol groups attached to aromatic rings always result in low yield; there may be exceptions.
     - **Include Metal Ion Interactions**: Consider the potential for thiol groups to form beneficial interactions with catalyst metals in certain scenarios.

4. **Incorporate Additional Molecular Features**:

   - **Suggestion**: Introduce new descriptors or modify existing rules to account for factors such as:
     - **Electronic Properties**: Evaluate electron density, resonance effects, and how they influence catalyst interaction.
     - **Steric Hindrance**: Consider the three-dimensional structure of molecules and how bulky groups may affect access to the catalyst site.
     - **Hydrogen Bonding**: Include rules that account for the potential of molecules to form hydrogen bonds with the catalyst or substrate.

5. **Enhance Model Complexity to Reduce Underfitting**:

   - **Suggestion**: Increase the complexity of the model by:
     - **Adding More Detailed Rules**: Develop sub-rules or conditional statements that capture nuanced relationships.
     - **Using Machine Learning Algorithms**: Supplement rule-based methods with algorithms that can learn complex patterns from data (e.g., decision trees, random forests).
     - **Feature Engineering**: Create new features or combinations of features that better represent the underlying chemistry.

6. **Iteratively Validate Adjustments**:

   - **Suggestion**: After making adjustments to the rules:
     - **Re-train the Model**: Use the updated rules to generate new features and retrain the model.
     - **Assess Performance**: Compare validation accuracies to previous iterations to evaluate improvement.
     - **Analyze SHAP Values Again**: Ensure that the adjustments have mitigated the issues identified without introducing new problems.

7. **Collaborate with Domain Experts**:

   - **Suggestion**: Engage chemists or material scientists to:
     - **Validate Rule Changes**: Confirm that proposed adjustments align with chemical knowledge and experimental observations.
     - **Provide Insights**: Offer perspectives on molecular interactions and reaction mechanisms that may not be apparent from data alone.

**Conclusion**

The current set of rules is not adequately capturing the complexities of the molecular features that influence catalyst loading, leading to reduced model performance. By refining problematic rules, particularly **Rule 3**, **Rule 5**, and **Rule 6**, and incorporating additional molecular insights, we can enhance the model's predictive accuracy. It is crucial to iteratively test these changes and collaborate with domain experts to ensure that the modifications are scientifically sound and lead to meaningful improvements.

**Next Steps**

- **Implement Rule Adjustments**: Modify the rules as per the recommendations and update the feature matrix accordingly.
- **Re-evaluate Model Performance**: Conduct new training and validation cycles to assess the impact of changes.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Keep track of validation accuracies and SHAP values over successive iterations to identify trends.
- **Expand Dataset if Possible**: Incorporate additional experimental data to provide a more comprehensive training set.

By following these steps, we aim to develop a more robust model that accurately predicts catalyst loading, thereby contributing to the success of the research program.

**Summary of Discussions**

The analysis of the current rules for predicting the yield of the remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction has revealed several areas for improvement:

- **Performance Metrics**: The current rules exhibit high confidence and lift but low support, indicating they apply to a small subset of the data with high accuracy. However, the overall validation accuracy has decreased from approximately 76% in previous iterations to around 51%, suggesting the rules are not capturing the data's underlying patterns effectively.

- **Underfitting**: The model appears to be underfitting, as it does not capture the complexity of the data. The low validation accuracy and consistent discrepancies in predictions indicate that the rules are too simplistic or not accurately defined.

- **SHAP Analysis**: The SHAP values highlight specific rules contributing to incorrect predictions. For instance, Rule 3 often has significant negative SHAP values for molecules where the experimental yield is high but the model predicts low yield.

- **Rule Specific Issues**: Certain rules, such as Rule 3, Rule 5, and Rule 6, may be overly restrictive or not accurately capturing the relevant chemical features, leading to incorrect predictions.

**Directions to Optimize Current Rules**

To improve the current rules, the following directions are recommended:

1. **Refine SMARTS Patterns**: Adjust the SMARTS patterns used in the rules to more accurately represent the chemical structures associated with high or low yields. This includes making patterns more general where necessary and more specific where overgeneralization leads to incorrect predictions.

2. **Balance Specificity and Generality**: Ensure that rules are neither too specific (which reduces support) nor too general (which reduces confidence). Aim for a balance that maximizes both support and confidence.

3. **Incorporate Additional Chemical Insights**: Utilize domain knowledge to understand the underlying chemical interactions and adjust the rules accordingly. This may involve considering electronic effects, steric hindrance, and other molecular properties.

4. **Iterative Testing and Validation**: After modifying the rules, re-evaluate their performance using cross-validation and SHAP analysis to ensure improvements are achieved without overfitting.

**Suggestions to Improve Current Rules**

1. **Rule 1 (Monocarboxylic Acids)**:
   - **Issue**: Currently, the rule does not check for the presence of only one carboxylic acid group.
   - **Improvement**: Modify the SMARTS pattern to ensure that only monocarboxylic acids are matched by counting the number of carboxylic acid groups and excluding dicarboxylic acids.

2. **Rule 2 (α-Amino Dicarboxylic Acids)**:
   - **Issue**: The SMARTS pattern is too specific and fails to match molecules like aspartic acid and glutamic acid.
   - **Improvement**: Update the SMARTS pattern to more generally represent α-amino dicarboxylic acids, allowing for variation in side-chain length.

3. **Rule 3 (Aromatic Carboxylic Acids with Polar Substituents)**:
   - **Issue**: The patterns may not encompass all relevant polar substituents and may incorrectly classify some molecules.
   - **Improvement**: Expand the SMARTS patterns to include all polar groups mentioned, such as halogens, and ensure electron-withdrawing groups like aldehydes are correctly identified.

4. **Rule 4 (Heteroaromatic Carboxylic Acids)**:
   - **Issue**: The rule may not accurately distinguish between direct attachment and connection via an additional aromatic ring.
   - **Improvement**: Refine the SMARTS patterns to precisely match structures where the carboxylic acid is directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring.

5. **Rule 5 (Aliphatic Thiol Carboxylic Acids)**:
   - **Issue**: The chain length and placement of the thiol group may not be correctly specified.
   - **Improvement**: Adjust the SMARTS pattern to match aliphatic chains with specific lengths (e.g., three carbons) bearing a thiol group and ensure aromatic thiols are correctly identified as low yield.

6. **Rule 6 (Modifiers with Multiple Hydroxyl Groups)**:
   - **Issue**: The rule may not correctly handle molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups or single hydroxyl groups on longer chains.
   - **Improvement**: Implement a method to count hydroxyl groups on aliphatic carbons and consider chain length effects for molecules with single hydroxyl groups.

7. **Rule 7 (Polyether Chains Ending with Carboxylic Acid)**:
   - **Issue**: The SMARTS pattern may not capture all types of polyether chains.
   - **Improvement**: Generalize the SMARTS pattern to identify any polyether chain terminating with a carboxylic acid, regardless of chain length or substituents.

8. **Rule 8 (Perfluoroalkyl Groups)**:
   - **Issue**: Detection of perfluoroalkyl groups may be too specific.
   - **Improvement**: Modify the SMARTS pattern to match any perfluoroalkyl chain attached to the carboxylic acid group, accounting for varying chain lengths and degrees of fluorination.

9. **Rule 9 (Aldehyde or Ketone Groups on Aromatic Rings)**:
   - **Issue**: Not all carbonyl group positions may be identified.
   - **Improvement**: Broaden the SMARTS patterns to include various positions of the carbonyl group on the aromatic ring, considering both aldehydes and ketones.

10. **Rule 10 (Amino Acids with Aromatic Side Chains)**:
    - **Issue**: The rule may not effectively differentiate between electron-rich heteroaromatic side chains and hydrophobic aromatic ones.
    - **Improvement**: Revise the SMARTS patterns to accurately represent amino acids like tryptophan and distinguish them from hydrophobic aromatic side chains like phenylalanine.

11. **Rule 11 (Metal-Coordinating Functional Groups)**:
    - **Issue**: The detection of strongly coordinating groups may be incomplete.
    - **Improvement**: Expand the SMARTS patterns to include other metal-coordinating functional groups known to deactivate catalysts.

12. **Rule 12 (Substituted Phenyl Groups with Aliphatic Linkers)**:
    - **Issue**: The distinction between direct attachment and linkage via an aliphatic chain may not be precise.
    - **Improvement**: Adjust the SMARTS patterns to ensure the aliphatic linker is accounted for in high-yield patterns and that direct attachment is correctly marked as low yield.

**Possibility for Further Optimization**

There is a clear possibility for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. By refining the SMARTS patterns, incorporating additional chemical insights, and balancing the specificity and generality of the rules, the model's performance can be improved. Iterative testing and validation will help avoid overfitting while enhancing predictive accuracy.

**Please Optimize Rules**

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are linear aliphatic monocarboxylic acids with chain lengths up to eight carbons result in high yield. Terminal amino or hydroxy groups are acceptable on chains with five carbons or fewer; however, if the chain is six carbons or longer, terminal amino or hydroxy groups lead to low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Unbranched aliphatic acids can efficiently interact with the catalyst without steric hindrance. Terminal functional groups on longer chains may interfere with catalyst interaction or the reaction mechanism.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **Octanoic acid**
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) result in high yield, while amino acids with hydrophobic or bulky aromatic side chains result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Polar side chains enhance interactions with the catalyst, promoting high yield. Hydrophobic or bulky side chains may cause steric hindrance or reduce catalyst compatibility.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with polar substituents (e.g., amino, nitro groups) at the para position result in high yield, whereas those with non-polar substituents (e.g., methyl groups) or electron-withdrawing aldehyde groups at the para position result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Polar substituents can enhance the electronic interaction with the catalyst, improving reactivity. Non-polar or electron-withdrawing groups may decrease reactivity or hinder catalyst interaction.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers where the carboxylic acid group is directly attached to a nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring result in high yield; those where the heteroaromatic ring is connected through an additional aromatic ring result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Direct attachment allows effective coordination with metal centers in the catalyst. Additional aromatic rings can introduce steric hindrance and reduce effective interaction.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups on short chains (three carbons) result in high yield, whereas those with thiol groups attached directly to an aromatic ring result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**
  - *Rationale*: Thiol groups on short aliphatic chains can act as ligands enhancing catalyst activity. Thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings can strongly bind to metal centers, deactivating the catalyst.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain result in high yield, while those with a single hydroxyl group on longer chains result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and interaction with the catalyst. A single hydroxyl group on a long chain may not offer these benefits and can introduce unfavorable steric effects.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing polyether chains ending with a carboxylic acid group result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Polyether chains can increase flexibility and steric bulk, reducing the ability of the modifier to interact effectively with the catalyst.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with perfluoroalkyl groups attached to the carboxylic acid result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Perfluoroalkyl groups are highly electron-withdrawing and hydrophobic, which can hinder interactions with the catalyst and reduce solubility in the reaction medium.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups attached to aromatic rings result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde and ketone groups can react with active sites or coordinate with metal centers in the catalyst, disrupting its activity.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with electron-rich heteroaromatic side chains result in high yield, whereas those with simple hydrophobic aromatic side chains result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Electron-rich heteroaromatic rings can enhance interactions with the catalyst, while simple hydrophobic rings may not provide the necessary interaction for high yield.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers containing functional groups that strongly coordinate to metals (e.g., trifluoroacetyl groups) result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation.**
  - *Rationale*: Strongly coordinating groups can bind to metal centers in the catalyst, reducing its availability and activity.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy or hydroxy-substituted phenyl groups connected via a short aliphatic chain result in high yield, while those with these substituents directly attached to the benzene ring result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: The aliphatic chain can provide flexibility and optimal positioning of functional groups for better catalyst interaction. Direct substitution on the aromatic ring may hinder effective binding due to steric factors.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **
- ** Advice 1 **: **Modify Rule 1** to ensure only monocarboxylic acids are matched. Update the SMARTS pattern to count the number of carboxylic acid groups in the molecule and exclude dicarboxylic acids. This will prevent molecules with multiple carboxylic acid groups from being incorrectly classified as high yield.

- ** Advice 2 **: **Refine Rule 2** by updating the SMARTS pattern to more generally represent α-amino dicarboxylic acids. Allow for variation in the side-chain length to include both aspartic acid and glutamic acid. The pattern should capture the α-amino group and two carboxylic acid groups attached to the backbone.

- ** Advice 3 **: **Expand Rule 3** to include all relevant polar substituents at the para position on the aromatic ring. Modify the SMARTS patterns to encompass polar groups such as amino, nitro, and halogen substitutions. Ensure electron-withdrawing groups like aldehydes are correctly identified and classified as low yield.

- ** Advice 4 **: **Refine Rule 4** by adjusting the SMARTS patterns to accurately distinguish between carboxylic acids directly attached to nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic rings and those connected via additional aromatic rings. Ensure the pattern precisely matches high yield modifiers with direct attachment and excludes those with extended conjugation.

- ** Advice 5 **: **Adjust Rule 5** to specify chain length and thiol group placement. Modify the SMARTS pattern to match aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups on short chains (e.g., three carbons). Ensure that thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings are correctly classified as low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.

- ** Advice 6 **: **Improve Rule 6** by implementing a method to count hydroxyl groups on aliphatic carbons. Adjust the SMARTS pattern to classify modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain as high yield and those with a single hydroxyl group on longer chains as low yield. Consider chain length in relation to the number of hydroxyl groups.

- ** Advice 7 **: **Generalize Rule 7** by modifying the SMARTS pattern to identify any polyether chain ending with a carboxylic acid group. Remove limitations on chain length or specific substituents to ensure all relevant polyether modifiers are correctly classified as low yield.

- ** Advice 8 **: **Modify Rule 8** to match perfluoroalkyl chains of varying lengths attached to carboxylic acid groups. Update the SMARTS pattern to detect any degree of fluorination on the alkyl chain, ensuring all perfluoroalkyl-containing modifiers are classified as low yield.

- ** Advice 9 **: **Broaden Rule 9** by adjusting the SMARTS patterns to include aldehyde or ketone groups at various positions on the aromatic ring. Ensure both ortho-, meta-, and para-substituted carbonyl groups are detected and classified as low yield due to their potential to interfere with the catalyst.

- ** Advice 10 **: **Revise Rule 10** to effectively differentiate between amino acids with electron-rich heteroaromatic side chains and those with hydrophobic aromatic side chains. Adjust the SMARTS patterns to recognize electron-rich groups (e.g., indole in tryptophan) as high yield modifiers and hydrophobic phenyl groups (e.g., in phenylalanine) as low yield.

- ** Advice 11 **: **Expand Rule 11** by including additional strongly coordinating functional groups that can deactivate the catalyst. Modify the SMARTS patterns to detect groups such as phosphines, thiols, or nitriles, ensuring modifiers with these groups are classified as low yield.

- ** Advice 12 **: **Refine Rule 12** by adjusting the SMARTS patterns to ensure that modifiers with methoxy or hydroxy-substituted phenyl groups connected via a short aliphatic chain are classified as high yield. Ensure that when these substituents are directly attached to the benzene ring without an aliphatic linker, the modifiers are classified as low yield due to steric hindrance or unfavorable interactions.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are linear aliphatic monocarboxylic acids with chain lengths up to eight carbons result in high yield. Terminal amino groups on chains with five carbons or fewer result in high yield; however, if the chain is six carbons or longer, terminal amino or hydroxy groups lead to low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Short-chain aliphatic acids can effectively coordinate with the catalyst's active sites without significant steric hindrance. Terminal amino groups on shorter chains enhance solubility and interaction with the catalyst. In longer chains, terminal amino or hydroxy groups introduce steric bulk and can interfere with catalyst binding or the reaction mechanism, leading to lower yields.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **Octanoic acid**
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) result in high yield. Modifiers that are α-amino acids with hydrophobic or bulky aromatic side chains (e.g., phenylalanine) result in low yield, whereas those with heteroaromatic side chains (e.g., tryptophan) result in high yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Polar side chains in α-amino dicarboxylic acids enhance hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst, promoting high yield. Hydrophobic or bulky aromatic side chains can cause steric hindrance and reduce effective interaction with the catalyst. Heteroaromatic side chains can provide favorable electronic interactions and facilitate coordination.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
    - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents (e.g., amino, hydroxy) at the para position result in high yield, while those with electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., formyl, trifluoroacetyl) at the para position result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups increase electron density on the aromatic ring, enhancing interactions with the catalyst and facilitating the reaction. Electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density, potentially interfering with catalyst binding and reducing reactivity.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers where the carboxylic acid group is directly attached to a nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring result in high yield; those where the heteroaromatic ring is connected through an additional aromatic ring result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Direct attachment allows effective coordination between the nitrogen in the heteroaromatic ring and the catalyst. Additional aromatic rings introduce steric hindrance and reduce the efficiency of catalyst interaction.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups on short chains (three carbons) result in high yield, whereas those with thiol groups attached directly to an aromatic ring result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**
  - *Rationale*: Short-chain thiol groups can act as flexible ligands, enhancing catalyst activity by forming favorable interactions. Thiol groups on aromatic rings can strongly bind to metal centers, deactivating the catalyst through irreversible coordination.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups along an aliphatic chain result in high yield, while those with a single hydroxyl group on longer chains result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and the ability to form hydrogen bonds with the catalyst, enhancing reactivity. Single hydroxyl groups on long chains may not sufficiently interact with the catalyst and can introduce steric hindrance.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
    - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing flexible polyether chains ending with a carboxylic acid group result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Polyether chains introduce flexibility and steric bulk, which can hinder effective interaction with the catalyst's active sites and reduce overall reactivity.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with perfluoroalkyl groups attached to the carboxylic acid result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Perfluoroalkyl groups are highly hydrophobic and strongly electron-withdrawing, which can decrease solubility in the reaction medium and reduce the modifier's ability to interact with the catalyst.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups attached to aromatic rings result in low yield due to potential side reactions or catalyst deactivation.**
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde and ketone groups can coordinate with metal centers in the catalyst or undergo side reactions, disrupting catalyst activity and decreasing yield.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy-substituted phenyl groups connected via a short aliphatic chain result in high yield, while those with these substituents directly attached to the aromatic ring result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: The aliphatic chain provides flexibility, allowing optimal positioning of functional groups for effective catalyst interaction. Direct substitution on the aromatic ring may hinder binding due to steric effects.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
    - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal amino groups on chains of six carbons or more result in low yield due to increased steric hindrance and decreased catalyst interaction.**
  - *Rationale*: Long-chain amino acids may not effectively interact with the catalyst and can introduce steric bulk that hinders the approach of reactants to the active sites.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are dicarboxylic acids with ketone groups result in low yield, possibly due to chelation with the catalyst and reduction of its activity.**
  - *Rationale*: Ketone groups in dicarboxylic acids can coordinate with metal centers more strongly, potentially deactivating the catalyst by forming stable chelate complexes.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with acylated amino groups result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Acylation of the amino group reduces the ability of the modifier to coordinate with the catalyst through the amino group, decreasing effective interaction and yield.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with bulky, hydrophobic side chains attached to the carboxylic acid result in low yield due to steric hindrance and decreased solubility.**
  - *Rationale*: Bulky hydrophobic groups can inhibit effective access to the catalyst's active sites and reduce solubility in the reaction solvent, both of which negatively impact yield.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers with halogen substituents on aromatic rings, such as bromomethyl groups, result in high yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Halogen substituents can enhance interactions with the catalyst through halogen bonding or induction effects, potentially increasing reactivity.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Review and revise Rule 3 to resolve inconsistencies between the rule and the examples.** Specifically, the current rule states that electron-donating substituents at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids result in high yield, while electron-withdrawing groups lead to low yield. However, **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, an electron-withdrawing group, is listed as a high-yield example, which contradicts the rule. Adjust the rule to accurately reflect the observed data—consider that certain electron-withdrawing groups like nitro may enhance yield due to specific electronic or resonance effects. Ensure that the rule and examples are consistent and the rationale aligns with the data.

- **Advice 2**: **Consolidate redundant rules to improve clarity and efficiency.** For instance:
  - **Merge Rule 11 with Rule 1**, as both address the impact of terminal amino groups on long aliphatic chains resulting in low yield. This consolidation will eliminate duplication and make the rules more streamlined.
  - **Combine Rule 14 with Rule 2**, since both discuss how modifiers with bulky hydrophobic side chains (like phenylalanine) result in low yield. This will enhance coherence and avoid repetition.

- **Advice 3**: **Strengthen rules supported by minimal data points by either expanding their data coverage or integrating them into broader rules.** For rules such as:
  - **Rule 5 (thiol groups causing catalyst poisoning)** and **Rule 15 (strongly coordinating groups leading to low yield)**: Consider merging these into a single rule that encompasses modifiers with functional groups that can bind strongly to the catalyst, deactivating it.
  - **Rule 8 (perfluoroalkyl groups)** and **Rule 12 (dicarboxylic acids with ketone groups)**: Expand these rules by incorporating additional examples or merge them into wider rules that cover electron-withdrawing groups or chelating agents, respectively.

- **Advice 4**: **Simplify complex rules to enhance clarity and applicability.** For example:
  - **Revise Rule 10** to focus on the key structural features affecting yield without unnecessary complexity. Clarify the distinction between modifiers with substituents connected via an aliphatic chain versus those directly attached to the aromatic ring. Provide additional examples for both high and low yields to improve understanding and application.

- **Advice 5**: **Ensure that all rationales are accurate, consistent, and aligned with chemical principles and observed data.** Reread each rule's rationale to confirm it does not contradict the examples or known chemistry. This will improve the credibility of the rules and make them more scientifically sound.

- **Advice 6**: **Enhance coverage by incorporating more data points and examples into each rule.** Where possible, add additional high and low-yield examples to support each rule. This will increase the robustness of the rules and provide a stronger basis for predicting outcomes.

- **Advice 7**: **Eliminate redundancies by merging rules that cover similar concepts.**
  - **Combine Rules 5 and 15**, as both address modifiers that potentially cause catalyst poisoning through strong metal coordination (e.g., thiol groups on aromatic rings). A unified rule will provide a clearer guideline on functional groups that deactivate the catalyst.

- **Advice 8**: **Verify and standardize chemical nomenclature and terminology throughout the rules.** Ensure that all chemical names, terms, and structures are correct and consistently presented. This will prevent confusion and improve the precision of the rules.

- **Advice 9**: **Incorporate specific structural descriptors or SMILES notations where appropriate.** Providing exact structural representations will make the rules more precise and facilitate their application, especially in computational analyses or when sharing with colleagues.

- **Advice 10**: **Align the rules with the Project Manager's priority for optimization by addressing critical issues identified in the comments.** Focus on refining the rules for clarity, accuracy, and practical applicability. Ensure that the rules are optimized to be as informative and user-friendly as possible, meeting the project's objectives.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (chain lengths up to eight carbons) without bulky side groups result in high yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Short-chain aliphatic acids can effectively coordinate with the catalyst's active sites without significant steric hindrance, enhancing the reaction efficiency.
  - *High Yield Examples*:

  - *High Yield Example*:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups on short chains result in high yield, whereas those with thiol groups attached directly to an aromatic ring result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**
  - *Rationale*: Short-chain thiol groups can act as flexible ligands, enhancing catalyst activity by forming favorable interactions. Thiol groups on aromatic rings can strongly bind to metal centers, potentially deactivating the catalyst through irreversible coordination.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with perfluoroalkyl groups attached to the carboxylic acid result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Perfluoroalkyl groups are highly hydrophobic and strongly electron-withdrawing, which can decrease solubility in the reaction medium and reduce the modifier's ability to interact with the catalyst.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing flexible polyether chains ending with a carboxylic acid group result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Polyether chains introduce flexibility and steric bulk, which can hinder effective interaction with the catalyst's active sites and reduce overall reactivity.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups attached directly to an aromatic ring result in low yield due to potential side reactions or catalyst deactivation.**
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde and ketone groups can coordinate with metal centers in the catalyst or undergo side reactions, disrupting catalyst activity and decreasing yield.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with acylated amino groups result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Acylation of the amino group reduces the ability of the modifier to coordinate with the catalyst through the amino group, decreasing effective interaction and yield.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy-substituted phenyl groups connected via a short aliphatic chain result in high yield.**
  - *Rationale*: The aliphatic chain provides flexibility, allowing optimal positioning of functional groups for effective catalyst interaction.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal amino groups on chains longer than six carbons result in low yield due to increased steric hindrance and decreased catalyst interaction.**
  - *Rationale*: Long-chain amino acids may not effectively interact with the catalyst and can introduce steric bulk that hinders the approach of reactants to the active sites.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: **Rule 1** meets all the criteria. It is clear and allows us to determine yield based on the structural description of short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids without bulky side groups. The property insight is sound, explaining steric factors affecting catalyst interaction. The rule balances complexity and coverage well, supported by multiple data points (e.g., octanoic acid and 5-aminopentanoic acid show high yield, while 7-aminoheptanoic acid and 8-aminooctanoic acid show low yield).

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 2** lacks clarity and contains inconsistencies. The rule states that electron-donating groups at the para position on aromatic carboxylic acids lead to high yield, while electron-withdrawing groups result in low yield. However, the high yield example includes **4-nitrobenzoic acid**, which has a nitro group, an electron-withdrawing group. This contradicts the rule's rationale. Additionally, **4-methylbenzoic acid**, which has an electron-donating methyl group, results in low yield (as per the dataset). This inconsistency indicates the rule needs revision to accurately reflect the observed outcomes.

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 3** is clear and well-supported by data, allowing us to predict yield based on the presence of polar side chains in α-amino acids. The property insight about the effect of side chain polarity on catalyst interaction is appropriate. This rule effectively balances complexity and coverage, with multiple data points supporting it (e.g., aspartic acid and glutamic acid show high yield, while phenylalanine shows low yield).

- **Comment 4**: **Rule 4** is clear and provides adequate property insight about the coordination abilities of heteroaromatic carboxylic acids directly attached to the ring. It is supported by multiple data points, such as pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid exhibiting high yield, while 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid shows low yield. The rule effectively balances complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** is clear and based on sound property insight regarding the impact of multiple hydroxyl groups on catalyst interaction and solubility. It is supported by data points like gluconic acid (high yield) and 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid (low yield). Although the coverage is limited to fewer data points, it adequately supports the rule.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** is clear and provides good property insight about thiol groups' interaction with the catalyst. The rule is supported by data, with 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid yielding high results and 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid yielding low results. The rule balances complexity and coverage appropriately.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** is clear but has limited coverage, as it is based on a single data point: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid resulting in low yield. While the property insight about perfluoroalkyl groups affecting solubility and interaction is valid, additional data points would strengthen the rule's coverage.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** is clear and supported by data (e.g., 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid and 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid both result in low yield). The property insight regarding the impact of flexible polyether chains on steric hindrance is sound. The rule effectively balances complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 9**: **Rule 9** is clear, with appropriate property insight about the potential side reactions of aldehyde and ketone groups attached directly to aromatic rings. The rule is supported by data points such as 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid, both resulting in low yield.

- **Comment 10**: **Rule 10** is clear, and the property insight about acylation reducing coordination ability is appropriate. The rule is supported by data, with examples like (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid resulting in low yield. However, coverage is somewhat limited, and additional supporting examples would strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 11**: **Rule 11** is somewhat narrow in scope but clear. The property insight is acceptable, explaining how methoxy-substituted phenyl groups improve interaction with the catalyst. The rule is supported by a high yield in 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid. However, coverage is limited to a single data point, which reduces its robustness.

- **Comment 12**: **Rule 12** is clear and supported by data, with long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal amino groups (e.g., 7-aminoheptanoic acid and 8-aminooctanoic acid) resulting in low yield. The property insight regarding steric hindrance is sound, and the rule effectively balances complexity and coverage.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (chain lengths up to eight carbons) without bulky side groups result in high yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Short-chain aliphatic acids can effectively coordinate with the catalyst's active sites without significant steric hindrance, enhancing the reaction efficiency.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **Octanoic acid**
    - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups (e.g., amino, hydroxy) at the para position result in high yield, while those with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., formyl, trifluoroacetyl) at the para position result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Electron-donating groups increase electron density on the aromatic ring, enhancing interactions with the catalyst and facilitating the reaction. Electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density, potentially interfering with catalyst binding and reducing reactivity.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
    - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are α-amino acids with polar side chains (e.g., carboxylic acid groups, hydroxyl groups) result in high yield, while those with hydrophobic or bulky aromatic side chains result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Polar side chains enhance solubility and interaction with the catalyst, promoting the reaction. Hydrophobic or bulky side chains can cause steric hindrance and reduce effective interaction with the catalyst.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
    - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring result in high yield; those where the heteroaromatic ring is connected via an additional aromatic ring result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Direct attachment allows effective coordination between the heteroatom in the aromatic ring and the catalyst. Additional aromatic rings introduce steric hindrance and reduce the efficiency of catalyst interaction.
  - *High Yield Examples*:
    - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
    - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups along an aliphatic chain result in high yield, while those with a single hydroxyl group on longer chains (more than six carbons) result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and the ability to form hydrogen bonds with the catalyst, enhancing reactivity. Single hydroxyl groups on long chains may not sufficiently interact with the catalyst and can introduce steric hindrance.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups on short chains result in high yield, whereas those with thiol groups attached directly to an aromatic ring result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**
  - *Rationale*: Short-chain thiol groups can act as flexible ligands, enhancing catalyst activity by forming favorable interactions. Thiol groups on aromatic rings can strongly bind to metal centers, potentially deactivating the catalyst through irreversible coordination.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with perfluoroalkyl groups attached to the carboxylic acid result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Perfluoroalkyl groups are highly hydrophobic and strongly electron-withdrawing, which can decrease solubility in the reaction medium and reduce the modifier's ability to interact with the catalyst.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing flexible polyether chains ending with a carboxylic acid group result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Polyether chains introduce flexibility and steric bulk, which can hinder effective interaction with the catalyst's active sites and reduce overall reactivity.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
    - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups attached directly to an aromatic ring result in low yield due to potential side reactions or catalyst deactivation.**
  - *Rationale*: Aldehyde and ketone groups can coordinate with metal centers in the catalyst or undergo side reactions, disrupting catalyst activity and decreasing yield.
  - *Low Yield Examples*:
    - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
    - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with acylated amino groups result in low yield.**
  - *Rationale*: Acylation of the amino group reduces the ability of the modifier to coordinate with the catalyst through the amino group, decreasing effective interaction and yield.
  - *Low Yield Example*:
    - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy-substituted phenyl groups connected via a short aliphatic chain result in high yield.**
  - *Rationale*: The aliphatic chain provides flexibility, allowing optimal positioning of functional groups for effective catalyst interaction.
  - *High Yield Example*:
    - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal amino groups on chains longer than six carbons result in low yield due to increased steric hindrance and decreased catalyst interaction.**
  - *Rationale*: Long-chain amino acids may not effectively interact with the catalyst and can introduce steric bulk that hinders the approach of reactants to the active sites.

    - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
    - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: Implement proper chain length calculation in **Rule 1**. The current code includes a `'max_chain_length'` parameter but does not correctly compute the chain length of aliphatic chains. Instead of checking for rings using `Chem.rdmolops.GetSymmSSSR(mol)`, you should calculate the length of the longest continuous aliphatic (non-ring) carbon chain. Consider using `Chem.GetShortestPath` or `Chem.FindAllPathsOfLengthN` functions to determine the chain lengths and ensure they do not exceed eight carbons.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Add position-specific matching logic for **Rule 2**. The code includes a placeholder for position-specific logic with `'positions': {'para': True}`, but it doesn't implement the actual functionality. To check for substituents at the para position on an aromatic ring, you need to create SMARTS patterns that specifically match para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups. Use atom mapping or define SMARTS that represent the para relationship explicitly.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: Refine the SMARTS patterns for electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups in **Rule 2**. The current patterns may not accurately represent all relevant functional groups. Expand and correct the SMARTS definitions for electron-donating groups (e.g., amino `[NH2]`, hydroxy `[OH]` groups) and electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., formyl `[CH=O]`, trifluoroacetyl `[C](=O)[C](F)(F)F`) to ensure comprehensive matching.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Ensure side chains are connected to the α-carbon in **Rule 3**. The current code checks for α-amino acid patterns and polar or hydrophobic side chains independently. Modify the SMARTS patterns to confirm that the side chains are directly attached to the α-carbon of the amino acid, ensuring correct structural matching.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: Implement hierarchical pattern matching in **Rule 4**. Confirm that the carboxyl group is directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring and that additional aromatic rings are absent or present as specified. Adjust the SMARTS patterns to represent the direct attachment and include or exclude additional rings appropriately.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Correctly implement chain length and hydroxyl group count in **Rule 5**. Implement logic to check for multiple hydroxyl groups along an aliphatic chain for high yield, and a single hydroxyl group on chains longer than six carbons for low yield. Use functions to count hydroxyl groups and measure chain lengths accurately in the code.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: Adjust SMARTS patterns for thiol groups in **Rule 6**. Ensure that the thiol group is identified on short aliphatic chains for high yield and attached directly to aromatic rings for low yield. Refine the patterns to distinguish between aliphatic and aromatic attachments accurately.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Enhance the SMARTS patterns and logic for **Rules 7 to 12**. Review each rule's SMARTS patterns to ensure they accurately capture the described structures. For example, verify that perfluoroalkyl chains in **Rule 7** and polyether chains in **Rule 8** are correctly matched using appropriate SMARTS.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: Implement comprehensive error handling for invalid SMILES inputs. Currently, invalid molecules result in rows of zeros. Include error messages or logging to identify problematic SMILES strings, aiding in debugging and data integrity.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Review and test each rule individually with known examples. For each rule, create test cases using the provided high and low yield examples to verify that the code correctly assigns the intended predictions. This will help ensure that the code accurately reflects the natural language rules.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Reformulate the rules to focus on quantifiable molecular features that can be directly extracted from SMILES strings.** Instead of qualitative descriptions like "short-chain" or "bulky side groups," specify exact parameters such as the number of carbons in the aliphatic chain or the presence of specific functional groups. This will allow for numerical representation in the feature matrix.

- **Advice 2**: **Translate functional group presence into binary or count features.** For each modifier, generate numerical features indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of key functional groups (e.g., carboxylic acid, amino group, hydroxyl group, thiol group). Counts of specific groups (e.g., number of hydroxyl groups) can also be included as numerical data.

- **Advice 3**: **Quantify steric factors using molecular descriptors.** Replace qualitative terms like "bulky" with quantifiable descriptors such as molecular volume, van der Waals surface area, or the number of heavy atoms attached to a specific site. Software tools like RDKit can calculate these descriptors from SMILES.

- **Advice 4**: **Introduce numerical thresholds in rules.** Instead of subjective terms (e.g., "chain lengths up to eight carbons"), use specific numerical limits. For example, modify Rule 1 to "Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with carbon chain lengths of 2 to 8 result in high yield."

- **Advice 5**: **Utilize calculated electronic properties as features.** Incorporate descriptors like Hammett sigma constants to numerically represent electron-donating or electron-withdrawing effects of substituents. This quantifies Rules 2 and 9, which deal with electronic effects on aromatic rings.

- **Advice 6**: **Include topological and physicochemical descriptors.** Features like molecular weight, logP (octanol-water partition coefficient), topological polar surface area (TPSA), and hydrogen bond donor/acceptor counts can capture properties related to solubility and interaction with the catalyst.

- **Advice 7**: **Implement substructure matching with SMARTS patterns.** Use SMARTS queries to identify and count specific substructures within the SMILES strings. For example, detect the presence of aromatic rings, heterocycles, or specific side chains relevant to the reaction outcome.

- **Advice 8**: **Convert Rules into a feature matrix template.** For each rule, define corresponding numerical features. For instance:
  - Rule 1: Aliphatic chain length (integer value)
  - Rule 2: Electron-donating group count on aromatic ring (integer)
  - Rule 3: Side chain polarity (categorical, converted to numerical codes)
  - This structured approach facilitates automatic feature extraction.

- **Advice 9**: **Use machine learning to identify key features.** After translating the rules into numerical descriptors, apply feature selection methods to determine which features most strongly correlate with high yield. Adjust the rules accordingly to focus on these critical features.

- **Advice 10**: **Simplify and consolidate overlapping rules.** Identify common factors among the modifiers that lead to high or low yields. For example, both Rules 3 and 6 involve polar functional groups enhancing yield. Combine these into a generalized rule focusing on modifiers with a certain range of polar surface area or hydrogen bonding capacity.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer and containing an amino group result in high yield; those with longer chains may result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Short aliphatic chains with amino groups can effectively interact with the catalyst without significant steric hindrance, enhancing coordination and reactivity.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

2. **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids where the carboxyl group is directly attached to an aromatic ring, and the ring has substituents capable of coordination (e.g., amino, hydroxy, nitro) at the ortho or para position result in high yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Functional groups that can engage in coordination with metal centers enhance catalyst interaction and activity. Electron-donating or withdrawing nature is less significant than the ability to coordinate.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**

3. **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxyl groups (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) result in high yield, while those with nonpolar aromatic side chains result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Additional carboxyl groups enhance coordination with the catalyst's metal centers, increasing reactivity. Nonpolar aromatic side chains may not effectively interact with the catalyst.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

4. **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms in the ring, and the carboxyl group is directly attached to the ring, result in high yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst interaction and facilitating electron transfer.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

5. **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing sulfur groups (thiols) attached to short aliphatic chains result in high yield; those with sulfur groups directly attached to aromatic rings result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**
   - *Rationale*: Thiol groups on short chains act as flexible ligands, enhancing catalyst activity. Thiol groups on aromatic rings can bind strongly and irreversibly to metal centers, deactivating the catalyst.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

6. **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on a short aliphatic chain result in high yield; those with only one hydroxyl group on longer chains result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance solubility and enable hydrogen bonding with the catalyst, promoting reactivity. Single hydroxyl groups on long chains may not interact effectively.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

7. **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length chains (around eight carbons) without additional polar groups result in high yield; similar acids with additional polar end groups result in low yield due to steric and electronic effects.**
   - *Rationale*: Medium-length chains can balance hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, optimizing catalyst interaction. Additional polar groups may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorable interactions.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **Octanoic acid**
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

8. **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing flexible polyether chains ending with a carboxylic acid group result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Polyether chains introduce flexibility and steric bulk, hindering effective coordination with the catalyst's active sites and reducing reactivity.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

9. **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde or ketone substituents at the ortho or para position result in low yield due to potential side reactions or catalyst deactivation.**
   - *Rationale*: Aldehyde and ketone groups can coordinate with metal centers or undergo side reactions, disrupting catalyst activity and decreasing yield.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

10. **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids result in low yield.**
    - *Rationale*: Perfluoroalkyl groups are highly hydrophobic and electron-withdrawing, decreasing solubility in the reaction medium and reducing interaction with the catalyst.
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

11. **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy-substituted phenyl groups connected via a short aliphatic chain result in high yield.**
    - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups increase electron density and can enhance interactions with the catalyst through electron donation and optimal positioning.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**

12. **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with N-acetylated amino groups result in low yield due to reduced coordination ability.**
    - *Rationale*: Acetylation blocks the amino group's ability to coordinate with the catalyst, decreasing effective interaction and yield.
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

13. **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with indole side chains result in high yield.**
    - *Rationale*: The indole nitrogen can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing interaction with the catalyst.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

14. **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with bromomethyl groups on aromatic carboxylic acids result in high yield.**
    - *Rationale*: The bromomethyl group may participate in halogen bonding or enhance the reactivity of the modifier, promoting catalyst activity.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

15. **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with ketone groups result in low yield due to potential side reactions or interference with catalyst coordination.**
    - *Rationale*: Ketone groups may interact unfavorably with the catalyst or participate in side reactions, reducing yield.
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Revise Rule 2 to resolve inconsistencies and accurately reflect the data.** The current Rule 2 states that aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating groups at the para position result in high yield, while those with electron-withdrawing groups result in low yield. However, examples such as **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (an electron-withdrawing nitro group resulting in high yield) and **4-methylbenzoic acid** (an electron-donating methyl group resulting in low yield) contradict this rule.

  **Action**: Adjust Rule 2 to focus on the ability of substituents to coordinate with the catalyst rather than their electron-donating or electron-withdrawing nature. A revised rule could be:

  - **Revised Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with substituents capable of strong coordination (e.g., amino, nitro) at the para position result in high yield; substituents that lack coordination ability (e.g., methyl) result in low yield.**

  **Rationale**: The key factor is the substituent's ability to coordinate with the catalyst's active sites, enhancing interaction and catalytic activity, regardless of their electronic properties.

- **Advice 2**: **Consolidate overlapping rules to simplify the rule set and eliminate redundancies.**

  **Action**: Merge Rules 1 and 12, as both address the effect of chain length and terminal amino groups on yield. The combined rule can state:

  - **Combined Rule**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with terminal amino groups result in high yield when the chain length is five carbons or fewer; longer chains result in low yield due to steric hindrance and decreased catalyst interaction.**

  **Rationale**: This consolidation simplifies the rules and provides a clear guideline on how chain length and terminal functional groups affect the reaction yield.

- **Advice 3**: **Enhance rules with limited data support by collecting additional data or integrating them with related rules.** Rules such as 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 are based on single data points, reducing their reliability.

  **Action**:

  - For **Rule 10** (perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids resulting in low yield): Consider combining it with Rule 7, as both involve modifiers with hydrophobic groups leading to low yield due to decreased solubility and interaction with the catalyst.
  - For **Rules 11 to 15**: Evaluate the possibility of merging them with existing rules that share similar structural features or chemical rationales. If merging is not feasible, prioritize experimental efforts to obtain more data supporting these rules.

- **Advice 4**: **Ensure all examples align accurately with their respective rules to improve clarity and avoid confusion.**

  **Action**: Review each rule and its examples to confirm consistency:

  - Replace the high-yield example **4-nitrobenzoic acid** in the original Rule 2 if the rule focuses on electron-donating substituents.
  - Verify that all high-yield and low-yield examples provided truly exemplify the rule's criteria.

- **Advice 5**: **Simplify overly complex rules to improve ease of application and understanding.**

  **Action**: Reassess rules that may be too detailed or specific:

  - For **Rule 10** (aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy-substituted phenyl groups connected via a short aliphatic chain resulting in high yield): Simplify by focusing on key structural elements, such as the presence of methoxy groups and an aliphatic linker, without overcomplicating the description.

- **Advice 6**: **Strengthen the rationale for each rule by providing deeper chemical insights into how structural features affect the reaction.**

  **Action**: Expand the rationale sections to include:

  - Specific interactions between functional groups and the catalyst (e.g., hydrogen bonding, coordination bonds).
  - How steric factors hinder or promote access to the catalyst's active sites.
  - The impact of electronic effects on catalyst-modifier interactions.

- **Advice 7**: **Address contradictory data points by reevaluating the rules and modifying them to reflect accurate trends.**

  **Action**: For rules where the data contradicts the rule's statement:

  - Reexamine the dataset to identify any patterns or exceptions.
  - Adjust the rule to accommodate these findings or specify any exceptions explicitly.

- **Advice 8**: **Integrate rules with limited coverage into broader rules where appropriate to enhance their applicability.**

  **Action**:

  - Merge **Rule 13** (modifiers that are amino acids with indole side chains result in high yield) with **Rule 3**, as both involve amino acids and the importance of side-chain interactions with the catalyst.
  - Combine **Rule 14** (modifiers with bromomethyl groups on aromatic carboxylic acids result in high yield) with **Rule 2** if the bromomethyl group acts similarly to other coordinating substituents.

- **Advice 9**: **Prioritize data collection for underrepresented modifier types to strengthen the rule set and validate existing rules.**

  **Action**:

  - Design and conduct experiments using modifiers that fit the criteria of under-supported rules.
  - Use the new data to confirm, refute, or refine these rules, thereby enhancing their reliability and coverage.

- **Advice 10**: **Reorganize the rules logically to group similar concepts together, making the rule set more user-friendly.**

  **Action**:

  - Group rules based on modifier types (e.g., aliphatic acids, aromatic acids, amino acids) or by the functional groups involved.
  - This organization will help users navigate the rule set more efficiently and apply the rules more effectively.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer and containing an amino group result in high yield; those with longer chains may result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Short aliphatic chains with amino groups can effectively interact with the catalyst without significant steric hindrance, enhancing coordination and reactivity.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

2. **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids where the carboxyl group is directly attached to an aromatic ring, and the ring has substituents capable of coordination (e.g., amino, hydroxy, nitro) at the ortho or para position result in high yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Functional groups that can engage in coordination with metal centers enhance catalyst interaction and activity. Electron-donating or withdrawing nature is less significant than the ability to coordinate.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**

3. **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxyl groups (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) result in high yield, while those with nonpolar aromatic side chains result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Additional carboxyl groups enhance coordination with the catalyst's metal centers, increasing reactivity. Nonpolar aromatic side chains may not effectively interact with the catalyst.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

4. **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms in the ring, and the carboxyl group is directly attached to the ring, result in high yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst interaction and facilitating electron transfer.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

5. **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing sulfur groups (thiols) attached to short aliphatic chains result in high yield; those with sulfur groups directly attached to aromatic rings result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**
   - *Rationale*: Thiol groups on short chains act as flexible ligands, enhancing catalyst activity. Thiol groups on aromatic rings can bind strongly and irreversibly to metal centers, deactivating the catalyst.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

6. **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on a short aliphatic chain result in high yield; those with only one hydroxyl group on longer chains result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance solubility and enable hydrogen bonding with the catalyst, promoting reactivity. Single hydroxyl groups on long chains may not interact effectively.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

7. **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length chains (around eight carbons) without additional polar groups result in high yield; similar acids with additional polar end groups result in low yield due to steric and electronic effects.**
   - *Rationale*: Medium-length chains can balance hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, optimizing catalyst interaction. Additional polar groups may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorable interactions.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **Octanoic acid**
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

8. **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing flexible polyether chains ending with a carboxylic acid group result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Polyether chains introduce flexibility and steric bulk, hindering effective coordination with the catalyst's active sites and reducing reactivity.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

9. **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde or ketone substituents at the ortho or para position result in low yield due to potential side reactions or catalyst deactivation.**
   - *Rationale*: Aldehyde and ketone groups can coordinate with metal centers or undergo side reactions, disrupting catalyst activity and decreasing yield.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

10. **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids result in low yield.**
    - *Rationale*: Perfluoroalkyl groups are highly hydrophobic and electron-withdrawing, decreasing solubility in the reaction medium and reducing interaction with the catalyst.
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

11. **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy-substituted phenyl groups connected via a short aliphatic chain result in high yield.**
    - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups increase electron density and can enhance interactions with the catalyst through electron donation and optimal positioning.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**

12. **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with N-acetylated amino groups result in low yield due to reduced coordination ability.**
    - *Rationale*: Acetylation blocks the amino group's ability to coordinate with the catalyst, decreasing effective interaction and yield.
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

13. **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with indole side chains result in high yield.**
    - *Rationale*: The indole nitrogen can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing interaction with the catalyst.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

14. **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with bromomethyl groups on aromatic carboxylic acids result in high yield.**
    - *Rationale*: The bromomethyl group may participate in halogen bonding or enhance the reactivity of the modifier, promoting catalyst activity.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

15. **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with ketone groups result in low yield due to potential side reactions or interference with catalyst coordination.**
    - *Rationale*: Ketone groups may interact unfavorably with the catalyst or participate in side reactions, reducing yield.
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: **Correct the Implementation of Rule 1**  
  The current code for Rule 1 does not correctly identify molecules that match the rule criteria. Specifically, the calculation of the chain length between the amino group and the carboxylic acid group is incorrect. The code counts the number of carbon atoms along the shortest path between the amino nitrogen atom and the carbonyl carbon atom of the carboxylic acid group, which does not accurately reflect the chain length.

  **Improvement**: Modify the code to calculate the number of carbon atoms in the longest continuous carbon chain that includes both the amino group and the carboxylic acid group. This can be done by identifying all paths between the amino nitrogen atom and the carboxylic acid carbonyl carbon atom and selecting the path that represents an aliphatic chain. Additionally, ensure that ring systems are excluded to enforce the aliphatic criterion.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Enhance the Pattern Matching for Rule 2**  
  The placeholder pattern `[c][c](X)[c][c](Y)[c][c](Z)` used in Rule 2 does not effectively match aromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating substituents at the ortho or para positions. Furthermore, the code does not implement logic to check the positions of the substituents relative to the carboxylic acid group.

  **Improvement**: Develop a more precise SMARTS pattern that matches an aromatic ring with a carboxylic acid directly attached and substituents capable of coordination at the ortho or para positions. Create a function to identify the positions of substituents relative to the carboxylic acid group by analyzing the atom indices and the connectivity of the ring system. Incorporate this function into the rule to ensure that only molecules with the correct substituent positions are considered a match.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Fix the Matching for Rule 5**  
  The current implementation for Rule 5 does not correctly identify molecules where the thiol group is attached to a short aliphatic chain. The code checks if the shortest path between the thiol sulfur atom and the carboxylic acid group has a length less than or equal to 7, but it counts the number of atoms in the path rather than the number of bonds or chain length.

  **Improvement**: Adjust the chain length calculation to count the number of bonds (edges) between the thiol group and the carboxylic acid group, subtracting one to represent the number of bonds rather than atoms. Ensure that the chain is indeed aliphatic by verifying that all atoms in the path are carbons (excluding the thiol sulfur and the carboxylic acid atoms) and that there are no ring structures involved.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Revise the SMARTS Pattern for Rule 10**  
  The SMARTS pattern used to identify perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids in Rule 10 is too restrictive and does not match the intended structures. The pattern `[CX4]([F,Cl,Br,I])[CX4]([F,Cl,Br,I])[CX3](=O)[OX1H1]` only matches a very specific substructure and misses molecules with longer perfluoroalkyl chains.

  **Improvement**: Create a more general SMARTS pattern that captures any perfluoroalkyl chain ending with a carboxylic acid group. This can be achieved by using recursive SMARTS to define a chain of carbon atoms each fully substituted with fluorine atoms, e.g., `[$([CX4](F)(F)(F))]-*[$([CX4](F)(F)(F))]-[CX3](=O)[OX1H1]`. Additionally, ensure that the pattern accounts for varying chain lengths by incorporating repetition where appropriate.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Expand the Rules to Include Both High and Low Yield Predictions**  
  In some cases, the rules only define the conditions for high yield and do not specify the outcome for molecules that partially match the criteria or fail certain conditions. For example, Rule 1 does not assign a prediction for molecules with chain lengths greater than five carbons.

  **Improvement**: Modify the rules to include both high and low yield predictions explicitly. Update the code to assign a `-1` prediction when the conditions for low yield are met, such as when the chain length exceeds the specified limit in Rule 1. This will provide a more accurate and comprehensive feature matrix.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Implement Position-Specific Substituent Matching in Rule 2**  
  The current code does not check whether the coordinating substituents in Rule 2 are located at the ortho or para positions relative to the carboxylic acid group.

  **Improvement**: Write a function to determine the relative positions of substituents on the aromatic ring. This can be done by identifying the carboxylic acid carbon atom attached to the ring and calculating the shortest path to the substituent atoms, then determining the position based on the number of bonds. Incorporate this positional analysis into the pattern matching for Rule 2.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Debug and Test the Code with Known Examples**  
  The code should be tested using molecules with known outcomes to verify that the rules are implemented correctly.

  **Improvement**: Create test cases using the high yield and low yield examples provided in the rules. Run these examples through the code to ensure that they are correctly classified. If discrepancies are found, adjust the code accordingly.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Include Error Handling for Molecule Parsing**  
  The code currently checks for `None` when parsing SMILES strings but does not provide detailed error messages.

  **Improvement**: Implement error handling that logs or prints informative messages when a molecule cannot be parsed. This will aid in troubleshooting and ensure that data issues are identified promptly.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Optimize Substructure Searches for Efficiency**  
  The code performs multiple substructure searches, which can be time-consuming for large datasets.

  **Improvement**: Cache the compiled SMARTS patterns to avoid recompilation during each iteration. Use `Chem.MolFromSmarts` only once per pattern during the initialization phase. Additionally, consider using `mol.HasSubstructMatch` with the `useChirality` parameter set to `True` or `False` as appropriate.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Document the Code for Clarity**  
  The code lacks detailed comments explaining the logic behind each step.

  **Improvement**: Add comments throughout the code to explain the purpose of each section, the reasoning behind certain decisions, and how the patterns relate to the chemical rules. This will make the code more maintainable and easier for collaborators to understand and modify.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rule Performance**

Upon reviewing the current rule metrics in comparison to both the reference metrics and the metrics from previous iterations, it is evident that the performance of the current rules has declined. Below is a detailed analysis focused on the key metrics of **confidence** and **lift**, along with suggestions for improvement.

---

**1. Comparison of Current Metrics with Reference Metrics**

**a. Train Support**

- **Current Train Support**: **0.0**
- **Previous Iterations**:
  - Iteration 1: **0.0119**
  - Iteration 2: **0.03896**
  - Iteration 3: **0.06429**
- **Reference Metrics**: **[0.1667, 0.1845]**

*Analysis*: The train support has decreased to **0.0**, indicating that none of the records in the training dataset satisfy the conditions and predictions of the current rules simultaneously. This is a significant decline from previous iterations and is substantially lower than the reference metrics. A support of zero means the rules are either too restrictive or not aligned with the data.

---

**b. Train Confidence**

- **Current Train Confidence**: **0.5**
- **Previous Iterations**:
  - Iteration 1: **0.65278**
  - Iteration 2: **0.56887**
  - Iteration 3: **0.72569**
- **Reference Metrics**: **[0.6352, 0.5396]**

*Analysis*: The train confidence is at **0.5**, which is lower than in previous iterations and slightly below the reference metrics. A confidence of 0.5 implies that the rule prediction is correct half the time when the rule conditions are met. Given that support is zero, this confidence level may not be reliable. The decrease in confidence suggests that the rules are less effective at making accurate predictions.

---

**c. Train Lift**

- **Current Train Lift**: **1.0**
- **Previous Iterations**:
  - Iteration 1: **1.30687**
  - Iteration 2: **1.13012**
  - Iteration 3: **1.45297**
- **Reference Metrics**: **[1.2048, 1.0559]**

*Analysis*: A lift of **1.0** indicates that the rule does not provide any additional predictive power over random chance. In previous iterations and reference metrics, the lift was consistently above 1, suggesting that earlier rules were more effective in increasing the likelihood of correctly predicting the outcome.

---

**d. Train Leverage**

- **Current Train Leverage**: **0.0**
- **Previous Iterations**:
  - Iteration 1: **0.00534**
  - Iteration 2: **0.00286**
  - Iteration 3: **0.01735**
- **Reference Metrics**: **[0.0289, -0.0041]**

*Analysis*: A leverage of **0.0** means there is no difference between the observed support and the expected support if the rule conditions and predictions were independent. This signifies that the current rules do not capture any meaningful association beyond random chance.

---

**2. Determining if a Local Minimum Has Been Reached**

The decline in all key metrics, particularly the train support dropping to zero and the train lift reducing to 1.0, indicates that the optimization process has possibly reached a **local minimum**. The rules no longer improve the predictive performance and may have become too specialized or misaligned with the underlying data patterns.

Given that further iterations have led to diminishing performance and the current metrics are poorer compared to both previous iterations and reference metrics, it is reasonable to conclude that sufficient iterations have been performed. Continuing without significant changes is unlikely to yield better results.

---

**3. Recommendations for Improving the Current Rules**

To enhance the performance of the rules, consider the following strategies:

**a. Re-evaluate Rule Conditions**

- **Simplify Overly Complex Rules**: Rules that are too specific may not generalize well. Review the current rules to identify and simplify overly restrictive conditions.
- **Ensure Alignment with Data**: Cross-reference the rules with actual data patterns to ensure they reflect real associations.

**b. Increase Rule Coverage**

- **Expand Support**: Aim to create rules that apply to a larger portion of the dataset. This can be achieved by generalizing certain conditions or combining similar rules.
- **Balance Specificity and Generality**: Avoid making rules so broad that they lose predictive power, but not so narrow that they fail to capture sufficient data instances.

**c. Enhance Predictive Power**

- **Focus on High Lift and Confidence**: Prioritize rules that demonstrate both high confidence and lift to ensure meaningful predictions.
- **Identify Strong Predictors**: Utilize statistical analysis to identify modifiers or features that have a strong correlation with high yield.

**d. Address Redundant or Conflicting Rules**

- **Eliminate Redundancies**: Remove rules that overlap significantly or provide no additional value.
- **Resolve Conflicts**: Ensure that rules do not contradict each other, which can confuse the prediction outcomes.

**e. Incorporate Domain Expertise**

- **Leverage Scientific Knowledge**: Consult with subject matter experts to align rules with known chemical principles and mechanisms.
- **Update Rationale**: Reassess the rationale behind each rule to ensure it is scientifically sound and reflects current understanding.

**f. Data-Driven Iterations**

- **Use Cross-Validation**: Implement cross-validation techniques to test the rules on different subsets of the data, enhancing generalizability.
- **Monitor Metrics Continuously**: Set threshold goals for metrics like confidence and lift, and iteratively adjust rules to meet these targets.

---

**4. Potential Rule Adjustments**

Based on the analysis, specific adjustments to the current rules could include:

- **Rule Consolidation**: Combine rules that cover similar chemical families or functional groups to increase support.
- **Rule Expansion**: Modify rules to include additional examples that may have been previously excluded due to overly strict conditions.
- **Rule Refinement**: Adjust the conditions of rules that currently lead to low yield predictions to better discriminate between high and low yield modifiers.

---

**Conclusion**

The current rules exhibit a decline in performance metrics, with train support at zero and lift at 1.0, indicating no predictive advantage. It appears that a local minimum has been reached, and further iterations without strategic changes are unlikely to improve outcomes.

By re-evaluating and refining the rules based on the above recommendations, it's possible to enhance the predictive power and relevance of the rules. Emphasizing rules with higher confidence and lift, increasing support, and ensuring alignment with both data patterns and chemical principles will lead to more effective and reliable predictions in the research program.

ML Commenter Message:
**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

1. **Accuracy Analysis:**

   - **Previous Validation Accuracies:** The validation accuracies in previous iterations ranged from **0.68 to 0.76**, with test accuracies of **0.625 to 0.75**. These values indicate a moderately good performance of the model in earlier stages.

   - **Current Validation Accuracy:** In the latest iteration, the **5-fold validation accuracy is 0.514**. This represents a **significant decrease in accuracy** compared to previous iterations.

   - **Interpretation:**

     - The **drop in validation accuracy** suggests that the **current set of rules is not effectively capturing the relationship** between the features and the target variable (loading of the modifier on the catalyst).

     - The model may be **underfitting**, as it fails to capture the complexity of the data, leading to low predictive performance on both the training and validation sets.

2. **SHAP Analysis Insights:**

   - **General Observation:**

     - In the latest SHAP analysis, only **Rule 4** is present, and its **SHAP values for high loading are all zero** for every molecule in the validation set.

     - The predicted loading is **'low' for all molecules**, regardless of their experimental values. This uniform prediction leads to a low accuracy of **51.4%**, which is close to random guessing for a binary classification problem.

   - **Implications:**

     - **Rule 4 is not contributing to the model's predictions**, as indicated by the zero SHAP values. It neither increases nor decreases the probability of predicting high loading.

     - The absence of other rules in the SHAP analysis indicates that **only Rule 4 is being considered** by the model in this iteration, which severely limits the model's ability to differentiate between high and low loading modifiers.

3. **Comparison with Previous Iterations:**

   - In earlier iterations, multiple rules (e.g., **Rules 3, 5, 6, 11, 16, 19**) contributed to the model's predictions, as evidenced by their SHAP values.

   - The SHAP values for these rules showed both positive and negative contributions, allowing the model to make more nuanced predictions.

   - The elimination or modification of these rules in the current iteration appears to have **negatively impacted the model's performance**, resulting in a decreased ability to generalize.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

1. **Reintroduce and Refine Effective Rules:**

   - **Reincorporate Previously Impactful Rules:**

     - Reintroduce rules that previously contributed meaningfully to the model, such as **Rules 3, 5, 6, 11, 16, and 19**.

     - These rules had non-zero SHAP values and influenced the model's predictions, indicating that they captured relevant features.

   - **Refine Rules with High Negative SHAP Values:**

     - **Underestimated Loadings:** Examine rules that had high negative SHAP values in cases where the model underestimated the loading (predicted 'low' but experimental value is 'high').

     - **Example Rules to Adjust:**

       - **Rule 5:** Contributed negative SHAP values in multiple instances of underprediction. Consider modifying the specificity of Rule 5 to better capture modifiers that should result in high loading.

       - **Rule 6:** Also had negative SHAP values in underpredicted cases. Refining this rule to account for exceptions or additional functional groups may improve model accuracy.

2. **Adjust Rules Associated with Overestimated Loadings:**

   - **Overestimated Loadings:** For cases where the model predicted 'high' loading but the experimental value was 'low', identify rules with high positive SHAP values.

   - **Rule to Refine:**

     - **Rule 16:** Showed high positive SHAP values in instances where the model overpredicted the loading. Consider tightening the criteria of Rule 16 to reduce false positives.

3. **Enhance Rule Coverage and Specificity:**

   - **Address Underfitting:**

     - The current model appears to be underfitting due to the reliance on a single rule with no impact. Expand the rule set to cover a broader range of chemical features influencing the modifier loading.

   - **Improve Generalization:**

     - Introduce rules that capture the relationships between structural features and catalyst interactions more effectively.

     - Ensure that the rules are neither too broad (causing false positives/negatives) nor too narrow (missing relevant cases).

4. **Utilize SHAP Analysis for Rule Refinement:**

   - **Leverage SHAP Values:**

     - Use the SHAP values from previous iterations to identify which rules consistently contribute to incorrect predictions.

     - Focus on rules that frequently have high magnitude SHAP values (either positive or negative) in mispredicted cases.

   - **Iterative Rule Evaluation:**

     - After making adjustments, reassess the model's performance and SHAP values to determine if the changes have improved accuracy.

     - Continue this iterative process to fine-tune the rules.

5. **Consider Additional Features and Interactions:**

   - **Incorporate New Rules:**

     - Based on the chemical knowledge and observed mispredictions, consider adding new rules that capture overlooked features.

     - For example, **rules accounting for steric hindrance, electronic effects, or specific functional group interactions** could enhance model performance.

   - **Analyze Misclassified Molecules:**

     - Examine molecules that are consistently misclassified to identify common structural features not covered by existing rules.

     - Develop rules that address these gaps.

6. **Balance Between Rule Complexity and Overfitting:**

   - **Avoid Overcomplicating Rules:**

     - Ensure that the rules remain interpretable and based on sound chemical principles.

     - Overly complex rules may lead to overfitting, reducing the model's ability to generalize to new data.

   - **Validate with External Data:**

     - If possible, test the refined rules on an external dataset to evaluate their generalizability.

**Specific Rule Adjustments**

1. **Refinement of Rule 5:**

   - **Issue Identified:**

     - Rule 5 contributed negative SHAP values in cases where the model underestimated loading for molecules with high experimental loadings.

     - This suggests that Rule 5 may be too restrictive or incorrectly formulated.

   - **Suggested Adjustment:**

     - **Original Rule 5:**

       - *Modifiers containing sulfur groups (thiols) attached to short aliphatic chains result in high yield; those with sulfur groups directly attached to aromatic rings result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.*

   - **Modification Proposal:**

     - Expand the rule to include sulfur-containing modifiers where the sulfur is part of other functional groups (e.g., sulfides, sulfoxides) that may enhance catalyst interaction.

     - Reevaluate the assumption that sulfur on aromatic rings always leads to low yield, as some aromatic thiols may not poison the catalyst.

2. **Refinement of Rule 6:**

   - **Issue Identified:**

     - Rule 6 led to negative SHAP values in underpredicted cases, indicating it may be causing the model to incorrectly predict low loading.

   - **Suggested Adjustment:**

     - **Original Rule 6:**

       - *Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on a short aliphatic chain result in high yield; those with only one hydroxyl group on longer chains result in low yield.*

   - **Modification Proposal:**

     - Consider the **position and configuration of hydroxyl groups**. Stereochemistry may play a role in interaction with the catalyst.

     - Include exceptions where single hydroxyl groups on medium-length chains contribute to high loading due to favorable interactions.

3. **Refinement of Rule 16 (if applicable):**

   - **Note:**

     - Rule 16 was referenced in the SHAP analysis but not listed in the current set of rules. If Rule 16 exists, adjustments may be necessary.

   - **Action Item:**

     - Ensure all active rules are included in the ruleset.

     - Adjust Rule 16 to reduce overpredictions, possibly by adding additional constraints or clarifying its scope.

4. **Reevaluation of Rule 4:**

   - **Issue Identified:**

     - Rule 4 currently has **zero SHAP values**, indicating it does not influence the model's predictions.

   - **Suggested Adjustment:**

     - **Original Rule 4:**

       - *Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms in the ring, and the carboxyl group is directly attached to the ring, result in high yield.*

   - **Modification Proposal:**

     - Investigate why Rule 4 is not impacting the model. Possible reasons include:

       - The rule may be too general or too rarely applicable to the dataset.

       - The encoding of Rule 4 in the feature matrix may be incorrect or ineffective.

     - Refine the rule by specifying the position of the nitrogen atoms or the presence of additional substituents that enhance activity.

**Conclusion**

The current decrease in model performance suggests that the **current rules are insufficient** to accurately predict the loading of modifiers on the catalyst. By **reintroducing and refining previously effective rules**, and **adjusting rules that contribute to mispredictions**, we can improve the model's accuracy. **Utilizing SHAP analysis** as a diagnostic tool allows us to identify problematic rules and guide the refinement process. Iterative adjustments, grounded in chemical understanding, will help in developing a more robust model with better generalization capabilities.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

The recent analysis of the rules used to predict the catalytic action of modified catalysts has identified several issues impacting their effectiveness. The key points from the discussions are:

1. **Decline in Performance Metrics**:
   - The **train support has dropped to 0.0**, indicating that none of the training data satisfies the current rule conditions.
   - **Train confidence is at 0.5**, suggesting that when the rules do apply, they are correct only half the time.
   - **Train lift is 1.0**, meaning the rules provide no predictive advantage over random chance.
   - **Validation accuracy has decreased to 51.4%**, significantly lower than previous iterations where accuracies ranged from 68% to 76%.

2. **Ineffectiveness of Current Rules**:
   - **Rule 4** is the only rule present in the model, with SHAP values of zero for all molecules, indicating it does not influence predictions.
   - The model is **predicting 'low' loading for all molecules**, regardless of the experimental values, leading to poor accuracy.

3. **Implementation Errors and Misalignments**:
   - **Rule 1** has incorrect chain length calculations between amino and carboxylic acid groups.
   - **Rule 2** does not effectively match aromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating substituents at the desired positions due to inadequate pattern matching.
   - **Rule 5** incorrectly computes the chain length between sulfur groups and carboxylic acids and may not accurately reflect aliphatic chains.
   - **Rule 10** uses an overly restrictive SMARTS pattern, failing to identify perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids as intended.

4. **Underfitting and Overfitting Concerns**:
   - The model appears to be **underfitting**, as it fails to capture the complexity of the data and makes uniform predictions.
   - There is potential for **overfitting** if rules become too specific or are overly optimized to the training data without generalizability.

**Suggestions to Improve Current Rules**

1. **Correct Implementation Errors**:
   - **Rule 1**: Revise the chain length calculation to accurately count the number of carbon atoms in the longest continuous chain between the amino group and the carboxylic acid, excluding rings.
   - **Rule 2**: Develop precise SMARTS patterns to match aromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating substituents at the ortho or para positions. Implement logic to determine substituent positions relative to the carboxylic acid group.
   - **Rule 5**: Adjust the chain length calculation between thiol groups and carboxylic acids to count bonds rather than atoms. Ensure the chain is aliphatic, consisting only of carbons (excluding functional groups) and without rings.
   - **Rule 10**: Create a more general SMARTS pattern to capture perfluoroalkyl chains of varying lengths ending with a carboxylic acid group.

2. **Reintroduce and Refine Effective Rules**:
   - **Reincorporate Previously Impactful Rules**: Bring back rules that previously contributed positively to the model, such as **Rules 3, 5, 6, 11, 16, and 19**.
   - **Refine Rules with Negative SHAP Contributions**: Adjust rules that frequently led to underpredictions or overpredictions. For instance:
     - **Rule 5**: Broaden the scope to include other sulfur-containing functional groups and reassess assumptions about catalyst poisoning.
     - **Rule 6**: Consider the positioning and stereochemistry of hydroxyl groups and include exceptions for single hydroxyl groups on certain chain lengths.

3. **Enhance Rule Coverage and Specificity**:
   - **Balance Generality and Specificity**: Modify rules to be specific enough to provide predictive power without being so narrow that they cover too few data points.
   - **Include Explicit Predictions for Low Yield**: Update rules to account for conditions leading to both high and low yields, improving the model's ability to discriminate between outcomes.

4. **Implement Position-Specific Substituent Matching**:
   - Develop functions to accurately determine the relative positions of substituents on aromatic rings. This is crucial for rules involving ortho, meta, and para positions, such as **Rule 2**.

5. **Debug and Validate Rules with Known Examples**:
   - Test the rules using molecules with known outcomes to ensure correct classification.
   - Adjust rules based on discrepancies between predicted and experimental values.

6. **Leverage Domain Expertise**:
   - Consult with chemists to ensure the rules align with chemical principles and reaction mechanisms.
   - Update rule rationales to reflect accurate scientific reasoning.

7. **Utilize SHAP Analysis for Rule Refinement**:
   - Use SHAP values to identify rules contributing to misclassifications.
   - Iteratively adjust rules based on their SHAP value impacts on predictions.

8. **Improve Substructure Search Efficiency**:
   - Cache SMARTS patterns to avoid recompilation.
   - Optimize substructure search methods to handle larger datasets efficiently.

9. **Include Error Handling and Documentation**:
   - Implement informative error messages for molecule parsing failures.
   - Document code with comments explaining logic and reasoning.

10. **Consider Additional Features and Interactions**:
    - Introduce new rules to capture overlooked structural features or interactions influencing catalyst-modifier behavior.
    - Account for factors like steric hindrance, electronic effects, and specific functional group interactions.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting**

There is ample opportunity for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. By addressing the identified implementation errors, refining existing rules, and incorporating additional relevant rules, the model's performance can be significantly improved. Ensuring that rules are based on sound chemical principles and are validated against experimental data will enhance their generalizability and predictive accuracy.

    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer and containing an amino group result in high yield; those with longer chains may result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Short aliphatic chains with amino groups can effectively interact with the catalyst without significant steric hindrance, enhancing coordination and reactivity.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

2. **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids where the carboxyl group is directly attached to an aromatic ring, and the ring has substituents capable of coordination (e.g., amino, hydroxy, nitro) at the ortho or para position result in high yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Functional groups that can engage in coordination with metal centers enhance catalyst interaction and activity. Electron-donating or withdrawing nature is less significant than the ability to coordinate.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**

3. **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxyl groups (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) result in high yield, while those with nonpolar aromatic side chains result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Additional carboxyl groups enhance coordination with the catalyst's metal centers, increasing reactivity. Nonpolar aromatic side chains may not effectively interact with the catalyst.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

4. **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms in the ring, and the carboxyl group is directly attached to the ring, result in high yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst interaction and facilitating electron transfer.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

5. **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing sulfur groups (thiols) attached to short aliphatic chains result in high yield; those with sulfur groups directly attached to aromatic rings result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**
   - *Rationale*: Thiol groups on short chains act as flexible ligands, enhancing catalyst activity. Thiol groups on aromatic rings can bind strongly and irreversibly to metal centers, deactivating the catalyst.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

6. **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on a short aliphatic chain result in high yield; those with only one hydroxyl group on longer chains result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance solubility and enable hydrogen bonding with the catalyst, promoting reactivity. Single hydroxyl groups on long chains may not interact effectively.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

7. **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium-length chains (around eight carbons) without additional polar groups result in high yield; similar acids with additional polar end groups result in low yield due to steric and electronic effects.**
   - *Rationale*: Medium-length chains can balance hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, optimizing catalyst interaction. Additional polar groups may introduce steric hindrance or unfavorable interactions.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **Octanoic acid**
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

8. **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing flexible polyether chains ending with a carboxylic acid group result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Polyether chains introduce flexibility and steric bulk, hindering effective coordination with the catalyst's active sites and reducing reactivity.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

9. **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde or ketone substituents at the ortho or para position result in low yield due to potential side reactions or catalyst deactivation.**
   - *Rationale*: Aldehyde and ketone groups can coordinate with metal centers or undergo side reactions, disrupting catalyst activity and decreasing yield.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

10. **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids result in low yield.**
    - *Rationale*: Perfluoroalkyl groups are highly hydrophobic and electron-withdrawing, decreasing solubility in the reaction medium and reducing interaction with the catalyst.
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

11. **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with methoxy-substituted phenyl groups connected via a short aliphatic chain result in high yield.**
    - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups increase electron density and can enhance interactions with the catalyst through electron donation and optimal positioning.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**

12. **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with N-acetylated amino groups result in low yield due to reduced coordination ability.**
    - *Rationale*: Acetylation blocks the amino group's ability to coordinate with the catalyst, decreasing effective interaction and yield.
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

13. **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with indole side chains result in high yield.**
    - *Rationale*: The indole nitrogen can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing interaction with the catalyst.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

14. **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with bromomethyl groups on aromatic carboxylic acids result in high yield.**
    - *Rationale*: The bromomethyl group may participate in halogen bonding or enhance the reactivity of the modifier, promoting catalyst activity.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**

15. **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with ketone groups result in low yield due to potential side reactions or interference with catalyst coordination.**
    - *Rationale*: Ketone groups may interact unfavorably with the catalyst or participate in side reactions, reducing yield.
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: Correct the chain length calculation in **Rule 1** to accurately count the number of carbon atoms in the longest continuous aliphatic chain between the amino group and the carboxylic acid group, excluding rings and branching groups. Ensure that this chain length is five carbons or fewer for high yield predictions.

- **Advice 2**: In **Rule 2**, develop precise SMARTS patterns that match aromatic carboxylic acids where the carboxyl group is directly attached to the aromatic ring, and the ring has substituents capable of coordination (e.g., amino, hydroxy, nitro) at the ortho or para positions relative to the carboxyl group. Implement logic to determine the relative positions of substituents on the aromatic ring.

- **Advice 3**: Adjust the chain length calculation in **Rule 5** to correctly count the number of bonds between the thiol (sulfanyl) group and the carboxylic acid group in the aliphatic chain. Ensure that the chain is short (e.g., three carbons) and aliphatic, without rings or branching, for high yield predictions.

- **Advice 4**: Modify **Rule 10** by creating a more general SMARTS pattern that captures various perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids, regardless of chain length. The pattern should identify molecules with perfluoroalkyl chains (fully fluorinated alkyl chains) attached to a carboxylic acid group.

- **Advice 5**: Reintroduce previously effective rules such as **Rule 3** (amino acids with side chains containing additional carboxyl groups leading to high yield), **Rule 6** (modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on a short aliphatic chain leading to high yield), **Rule 11** (methoxy-substituted phenyl groups connected via a short aliphatic chain leading to high yield), **Rule 13** (amino acids with indole side chains leading to high yield), and **Rule 14** (aromatic carboxylic acids with bromomethyl groups leading to high yield), ensuring they are correctly implemented.

- **Advice 6**: Refine rules that have led to misclassifications or have negative SHAP contributions by reviewing their SMARTS patterns and conditions. For example, adjust **Rule 5** to more precisely define when sulfur-containing modifiers result in high or low yield, considering potential catalyst poisoning.

- **Advice 7**: Implement functions or algorithms to accurately determine the relative positions (ortho, meta, para) of substituents on aromatic rings with respect to the carboxyl group. This will improve the specificity and accuracy of rules like **Rule 2** that depend on substituent positions.

- **Advice 8**: Validate each rule by testing them against the dataset, using molecules with known high or low yield outcomes. Adjust the rules based on any discrepancies between predicted results and experimental data.

- **Advice 9**: Introduce new rules to capture additional structural features or interactions that may influence catalyst-modifier behavior. Consider including rules that account for steric hindrance, electronic effects, and specific functional group interactions not currently covered.

- **Advice 10**: Consult with chemists or domain experts to ensure that all rules align with established chemical principles and reaction mechanisms. Update rule rationales to reflect accurate scientific reasoning, and ensure that rules are grounded in sound chemistry.

- **Advice 11**: Utilize SHAP analysis to identify which rules contribute to misclassifications. Use this feedback to iteratively adjust the rules, enhancing their predictive performance and reducing misclassifications.

- **Advice 12**: Optimize the substructure search methods and SMARTS pattern matching process to improve efficiency and accuracy. Cache compiled SMARTS patterns where possible to avoid recompilation and increase performance.

- **Advice 13**: Include error handling and detailed documentation in the code, particularly for molecule parsing and SMARTS matching functions. This will facilitate debugging and future modifications to the rule set.

- **Advice 14**: Ensure that the rules are balanced in terms of generality and specificity. Rules should be specific enough to provide predictive power but not so narrow that they cover too few data points. Aim for rules that cover a broad range of relevant molecules while maintaining accuracy.

- **Advice 15**: Include explicit predictions for low yield as well as high yield outcomes within the rules. This will improve the model's ability to discriminate between different results and avoid defaulting to a single prediction.

**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains capable of coordination (e.g., containing amino, carboxyl, hydroxyl, or indole groups) result in high yield; amino acids with nonpolar aromatic side chains result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Side chains with functional groups capable of coordinating with metal centers enhance interaction with the catalyst, increasing yield.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

2. **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl) at the para position result in high yield; those with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl) result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups can enhance catalyst interaction through increased acidity or coordination ability.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**

3. **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms in the ring, directly attached to the carboxyl group, result in high yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Nitrogen heterocycles can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

4. **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer and containing an amino or thiol group result in high yield; those with longer chains and these groups result in low yield due to steric hindrance.**
   - *Rationale*: Short chains with functional groups can effectively coordinate with the catalyst without steric hindrance.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

5. **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with long aliphatic chains (more than six carbons) without additional polar groups result in high yield; similar acids with polar groups at terminal positions result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Nonpolar chains can favorably interact with the hydrophobic regions of the catalyst, while polar end groups may interfere.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **Octanoic acid**
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

6. **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing flexible polyether chains ending with a carboxylic acid group result in low yield due to steric hindrance and reduced coordination efficiency.**
   - *Rationale*: Flexible and bulky chains reduce effective interaction with the catalyst.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

7. **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde or ketone substituents at the ortho or para position result in low yield due to possible side reactions or catalyst deactivation.**
   - *Rationale*: Aldehyde and ketone groups may undergo side reactions or bind the metal catalyst, decreasing its activity.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

8. **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on short aliphatic chains result in high yield; those with single hydroxyl groups on longer chains result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance coordination and solubility, whereas a single hydroxyl on a long chain may not promote effective interaction.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

9. **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids result in low yield due to extreme hydrophobicity and electron-withdrawing effects impeding effective catalyst interaction.**
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

10. **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with N-acetylated amino groups result in low yield due to reduced availability of coordination sites.**
    - *Rationale*: Acetylation blocks the amino group's ability to coordinate with the catalyst.
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

11. **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are arylalkanoic acids with methoxy-substituted phenyl groups connected via a short aliphatic chain result in high yield.**
    - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups can act as electron donors, enhancing interaction with the catalyst.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**

12. **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with a thiol group directly attached to the aromatic ring result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning; whereas those with thiol groups on short aliphatic chains result in high yield.**
    - *Rationale*: Thiol groups on aromatic rings can strongly bind to and deactivate metal centers, while aliphatic thiols can act as effective ligands.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

- **Comment 1**: **Rule 1** is clear and allows us to determine yield based on specific amino acid side chains. The property insight is solid, explaining that functional groups capable of coordinating enhance catalyst interaction. The rule considers combinations of functional groups in amino acids, adding appropriate complexity. It is supported by multiple data points, including both high and low yield examples, fulfilling the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 2**: **Rule 2** is clearly defined, specifying the influence of electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids on yield. The property insight is adequate, explaining the role of increased acidity and coordination ability due to electron-withdrawing groups. The rule considers combinations of substructures (aromatic ring, carboxylic acid group, substituents at specific positions), adding complexity. It is supported by multiple data points with high and low yield examples, satisfying the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 3**: **Rule 3** is clear, specifying heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms in the ring directly attached to the carboxyl group result in high yield. The property insight is appropriate, highlighting the ability of nitrogen heterocycles to coordinate with metal centers. The rule combines structural features (heteroaromatic ring, carboxyl group position), adding complexity. Supported by multiple data points with high yield, the rule meets the coverage criterion.

- **Comment 4**: **Rule 4** clearly delineates the effect of chain length and functional groups on yield for aliphatic carboxylic acids. The property insight is sound, attributing low yield in longer chains to steric hindrance. The rule combines considerations of chain length and functional group presence, adding appropriate complexity. Supported by multiple high and low yield examples, it satisfies the coverage requirement.

- **Comment 5**: **Rule 5** is clear in defining that long aliphatic chains without polar groups yield high yield, while similar acids with terminal polar groups yield low yield. The property insight is acceptable, explaining the influence of hydrophobic interactions and interference by polar end groups. The rule considers both chain length and functional group presence, adding complexity. With supporting data points for both high and low yield, the rule meets the coverage criteria.

- **Comment 6**: **Rule 6** clearly identifies modifiers with flexible polyether chains ending with a carboxylic acid group resulting in low yield. The property insight is appropriate, discussing steric hindrance and reduced coordination. The rule involves the combination of polyether chains and carboxylic acid groups, adding complexity. Supported by at least two data points, the rule satisfies the minimum coverage criterion.

- **Comment 7**: **Rule 7** is clear in stating that aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde or ketone groups at ortho or para positions result in low yield. The property insight appropriately points out potential side reactions or catalyst deactivation. The rule combines structural features and substituent positions, adding complexity. With two data points supporting the rule, it meets the minimum coverage requirement.

- **Comment 8**: **Rule 8** clearly contrasts the effect of multiple hydroxyl groups on short chains versus single hydroxyl groups on longer chains.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains capable of coordination (e.g., containing amino, carboxyl, hydroxyl, or indole groups) result in high yield; amino acids with nonpolar aromatic side chains result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Side chains with functional groups capable of coordinating with metal centers enhance interaction with the catalyst, increasing yield.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

2. **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., amino, nitro, bromomethyl) at the para position result in high yield; those with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl) result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups can enhance catalyst interaction through increased acidity or coordination ability.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**

3. **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms in the ring, directly attached to the carboxyl group, result in high yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Nitrogen heterocycles can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

4. **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of five carbons or fewer and containing an amino or thiol group result in high yield; those with longer chains and these groups result in low yield due to steric hindrance.**
   - *Rationale*: Short chains with functional groups can effectively coordinate with the catalyst without steric hindrance.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

5. **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with long aliphatic chains (more than six carbons) without additional polar groups result in high yield; similar acids with polar groups at terminal positions result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Nonpolar chains can favorably interact with the hydrophobic regions of the catalyst, while polar end groups may interfere.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **Octanoic acid**
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

6. **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing flexible polyether chains ending with a carboxylic acid group result in low yield due to steric hindrance and reduced coordination efficiency.**
   - *Rationale*: Flexible and bulky chains reduce effective interaction with the catalyst.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**

7. **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde or ketone substituents at the ortho or para position result in low yield due to possible side reactions or catalyst deactivation.**
   - *Rationale*: Aldehyde and ketone groups may undergo side reactions or bind the metal catalyst, decreasing its activity.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

8. **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on short aliphatic chains result in high yield; those with single hydroxyl groups on longer chains result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance coordination and solubility, whereas a single hydroxyl on a long chain may not promote effective interaction.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

9. **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids result in low yield due to extreme hydrophobicity and electron-withdrawing effects impeding effective catalyst interaction.**
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

10. **Rule 10**: **Modifiers with N-acetylated amino groups result in low yield due to reduced availability of coordination sites.**
    - *Rationale*: Acetylation blocks the amino group's ability to coordinate with the catalyst.
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

11. **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are arylalkanoic acids with methoxy-substituted phenyl groups connected via a short aliphatic chain result in high yield.**
    - *Rationale*: Methoxy groups can act as electron donors, enhancing interaction with the catalyst.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**

12. **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with a thiol group directly attached to the aromatic ring result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning; whereas those with thiol groups on short aliphatic chains result in high yield.**
    - *Rationale*: Thiol groups on aromatic rings can strongly bind to and deactivate metal centers, while aliphatic thiols can act as effective ligands.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Revise the SMARTS patterns for Rule 1 to accurately capture amino acids with coordinating side chains.**

  - **Issue**: The current SMARTS patterns for high-yield modifiers in Rule 1 may not correctly identify amino acids with side chains containing amino, carboxyl, hydroxyl, or indole groups. The patterns seem to focus on specific examples rather than general functional groups.
  
  - **Recommendation**: Modify the SMARTS patterns to more generally detect amino acids with side chains containing the desired functional groups. For example:

    - **Amino acids with hydroxyl side chains**: `'[NX3][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX1H])[CX4][CX4][OX2H]'` (e.g., serine)
    - **Amino acids with carboxyl side chains**: `'[NX3][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX1H])[CX4][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H]'` (e.g., aspartic acid)
    - **Amino acids with amino side chains**: `'[NX3][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX1H])[CX4][CX4][NX3H2]'` (e.g., lysine)
    - **Amino acids with indole side chains**: `'[NX3][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX1H])[CX4]c1c[nH]c2c1cccc2'` (tryptophan)

  - **Action**: Update the `high_yield_patterns` for Rule 1 with these more general SMARTS patterns to improve detection.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Improve the differentiation between electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups in Rule 2.**

  - **Issue**: The current SMARTS pattern for high-yield modifiers in Rule 2, `'O=C(O)c1ccc([N,O,S,F,Cl,Br,I])cc1'`, broadly matches any substituent containing N, O, S, or halogens at the para position, which might include electron-donating groups such as amino groups.

  - **Recommendation**: 

    - **High Yield (EWG at para position)**: Use specific patterns for common electron-withdrawing groups:

      - Nitro group: `'O=C(O)c1ccc([NX3](=O)=O)cc1'`
      - Halogens: `'O=C(O)c1ccc([F,Cl,Br,I])cc1'`
      - Cyano group: `'O=C(O)c1ccc(C#N)cc1'`

    - **Low Yield (EDG at para position)**: Use patterns for electron-donating groups:

      - Alkyl groups: `'O=C(O)c1ccc([CX4H3,CX4H2C,CX4H(C)C])cc1'` (methyl, ethyl groups)
      - Methoxy group: `'O=C(O)c1ccc(OC)cc1'`
      - Amino group: `'O=C(O)c1ccc(N)cc1'`

  - **Action**: Update the `high_yield_patterns` and `low_yield_patterns` in Rule 2 with these more specific SMARTS patterns to accurately reflect electron-withdrawing and electron-donating substituents.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Refine the SMARTS patterns in Rule 3 to accurately detect heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms directly attached to the carboxyl group.**

  - **Issue**: The current patterns may not exclusively match compounds where the nitrogen atom in the heteroaromatic ring is directly bonded to the carboxyl group.

  - **Recommendation**:

    - Use a pattern that ensures the carboxylic acid group is directly attached to a nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring:

      - `'[nH]1[nH,c][nH,c][nH,c][nH,c]1C(=O)O'` (General pattern for N-heteroaromatic carboxylic acids)

    - Alternatively, specify positions for common rings:

      - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid: `'n1cc(C(=O)O)ccc1'`
      - Pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid: `'n1c(C(=O)O)cnn1'`

  - **Action**: Adjust the `high_yield_patterns` to include these refined SMARTS patterns for accurate matching.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Generalize the SMARTS patterns in Rule 4 to account for variations in chain length and positions of amino or thiol groups.**

  - **Issue**: The current patterns are specific to certain chain lengths and may not match all applicable compounds.

  - **Recommendation**:

    - **High Yield (short chains with amino or thiol groups)**:

      - General pattern for carboxylic acids with chain lengths of 2–5 carbons containing amino or thiol groups:

        - Amino group: `'[CX3](=O)[OX1H][CX4;D2][CX4;D2][CX4;D2][NX3H2]'` (up to 5 carbons)
        - Thiol group: `'[CX3](=O)[OX1H][CX4;D2][CX4;D2][SX2H]'`

    - **Low Yield (long chains with amino or thiol groups)**:

      - General pattern for chains longer than 5 carbons:

        - `'[CX3](=O)[OX1H][CX4]~[CX4]~[CX4]~[CX4]~[CX4]~[CX4,](~[NX3H2,$([SX2H])])'`

  - **Action**: Update `high_yield_patterns` and `low_yield_patterns` to use these generalized patterns.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Modify the SMARTS patterns in Rule 5 to generalize detection of long aliphatic chains without polar groups.**

  - **Issue**: The current pattern only matches octanoic acid and may miss other long-chain acids.

  - **Recommendation**:

    - **High Yield**:

      - Use a pattern that matches carboxylic acids with aliphatic chains longer than 6 carbons without polar groups:

        - `'[CX3](=O)[OX1H][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4,$(C([CX4])[CX4])]'`

    - **Low Yield**:

      - Match similar acids with polar groups at terminal positions:

        - Hydroxyl group: `'[CX3](=O)[OX1H][CX4]~[CX4]{$([CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][OX2H])}'`
        - Amino group: `'[CX3](=O)[OX1H][CX4]~[CX4]{$([CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][NX3H2])}'`

  - **Action**: Generalize `high_yield_patterns` and `low_yield_patterns` to match any long aliphatic carboxylic acids as per the rule.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Use more generic SMARTS patterns in Rule 6 to detect flexible polyether chains ending with a carboxylic acid group.**

  - **Issue**: The current pattern is too specific and may not match all relevant compounds.

  - **Recommendation**:

    - Use a recursive pattern to match polyether chains:

      - `'[OX2H][CX4]([OX2][CX4]){2,}[CX3](=O)[OX1H]'`

    - This pattern matches compounds with two or more ether-linked carbons ending with a carboxylic acid.

  - **Action**: Update the `low_yield_patterns` for Rule 6 with this more general pattern.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Ensure that SMARTS patterns for Rule 7 correctly identify ortho- and para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde or ketone groups.**

  - **Issue**: The current patterns might not capture all positional isomers with aldehyde or ketone substituents.

  - **Recommendation**:

    - Use patterns that specify ortho (1,2-) and para (1,4-) substitution:

      - Ortho: `'O=C(O)c1cc([#6](=O))ccc1'`
      - Para: `'O=C(O)c1ccc([#6](=O))cc1'`

    - Ensure that both aldehyde (`C=O`) and ketone (`C(=O)C`) groups are included.

  - **Action**: Expand the `low_yield_patterns` to include these patterns.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Generalize SMARTS patterns in Rule 8 to detect multiple hydroxyl groups on short aliphatic chains.**

  - **Issue**: The current pattern may not match all modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups.

  - **Recommendation**:

    - **High Yield**:

      - Match carboxylic acids with short chains (up to 6 carbons) having multiple hydroxyl groups:

        - `'[CX3](=O)[OX1H][CX4][$([CX4][OX2H])]{2,}'`

    - **Low Yield**:

      - Match longer chains with a single hydroxyl group:

        - `'[CX3](=O)[OX1H][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][OX2H]'`

  - **Action**: Update patterns to cover a broader range of compounds.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Generalize the pattern for perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids in Rule 9.**

  - **Issue**: The current pattern may only match specific compounds and not all perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids.

  - **Recommendation**:

    - Use a pattern that matches any perfluoroalkyl chain attached to a carboxylic acid:

      - `'[CX3](=O)[OX1H][CX4]([CX4,F]){2,}[F]'`

    - This pattern ensures that all carbons in the chain (except the one attached to the carboxyl group) are fully fluorinated.

  - **Action**: Replace the existing pattern with this generalized pattern in `low_yield_patterns`.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Adjust the SMARTS pattern in Rule 10 to accurately identify N-acetylated amino groups.**

  - **Issue**: The pattern `'C(=O)N[CX3](=O)[OX1H]'` may not capture all N-acetylated amino acids.

  - **Recommendation**:

    - Use a pattern that matches N-acetyl groups attached to nitrogen:

      - `'[NX3][CX3](=O)[CX4H,NX3][CX3](=O)[OX1H]'`

    - This pattern ensures the acetyl group is attached to the nitrogen of an amino acid.

  - **Action**: Update the `low_yield_patterns` with this more accurate pattern.

- **Suggestion 11**: **Generalize the pattern in Rule 11 to match arylalkanoic acids with methoxy-substituted phenyl groups connected via short aliphatic chains.**

  - **Issue**: The current pattern might be too specific, missing compounds with different positions or numbers of methoxy groups.

  - **Recommendation**:

    - Use a more flexible pattern:

      - `'[CX3](=O)[OX1H][CX4][CX3](=O)c1cc(OC)c(OC)cc1'`

      - Alternatively, generalize methoxy substitution:

        - `'[CX3](=O)[OX1H][CX4][CX3](=O)c1cc([OX2][CX4H3])cc([OX2][CX4H3])c1'`

    - This allows for variations in methoxy group positions.

  - **Action**: Update the `high_yield_patterns` accordingly.

- **Suggestion 12**: **Refine the SMARTS patterns in Rule 12 to distinguish between aromatic thiols and aliphatic thiols connected to carboxylic acids.**

  - **Issue**: The current patterns may not clearly differentiate the position of the thiol group.

  - **Recommendation**:

    - **High Yield (aliphatic thiol)**:

      - `'[CX3](=O)[OX1H][CX4][$([CX4][SX2H])]'`

    - **Low Yield (aromatic thiol)**:

      - `'[OX1H][CX3]=O][c][c][c][c][c][c][SX2H]'` or `'O=C(O)c1ccc([SX2H])cc1'`

  - **Action**: Update `high_yield_patterns` and `low_yield_patterns` for accurate detection.

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**
- **Advice 1**: **Simplify the rules by focusing on quantifiable molecular descriptors that can be numerically represented.** Instead of relying on specific functional groups or structural motifs that are difficult to encode numerically, utilize descriptors such as molecular weight, logP (octanol-water partition coefficient), topological polar surface area (TPSA), number of hydrogen bond donors (HBD) and acceptors (HBA), and rotatable bond count. These descriptors can be directly calculated from the SMILES representations and used to generate a numeric feature matrix.

- **Advice 2**: **Consolidate overlapping rules and reduce redundancy to create a more generalized rule set.** Review the current rules to identify and merge similar rules. For instance, rules concerning electron-withdrawing or donating groups can be unified under a single rule that considers the Hammett sigma constants or other electronic parameters, which can be quantified and included in the feature matrix.

- **Advice 3**: **Incorporate molecular fingerprinting methods to capture structural features numerically.** Use techniques like MACCS keys or ECFP (Extended Connectivity Fingerprints) to convert the presence of specific substructures and functional groups into binary vectors. This allows for a comprehensive numerical representation of the modifiers' chemical features.

- **Advice 4**: **Employ quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling to relate molecular descriptors to yield outcomes.** Develop models that correlate the calculated molecular descriptors with the observed yields. This approach facilitates the prediction of yield based on numerical data, aiding in the optimization of modifiers.

- **Advice 5**: **Standardize the definition of steric and electronic effects using numerical scales.** Parameters such as Taft steric parameters and electronic parameters can be assigned to substituents, allowing for a numerical assessment of steric hindrance and electronic influence on the catalyst interaction.

- **Advice 6**: **Consider the use of multivariate statistical analysis to identify key factors influencing yield.** Techniques like principal component analysis (PCA) can help in reducing dimensionality and highlighting the most significant molecular features impacting the reaction outcome.

- **Advice 7**: **Update the rules to include easily quantifiable properties related to coordination ability.** Properties such as ligand donor numbers, charges on coordinating atoms, and coordination numbers can be calculated and used to assess the modifiers' ability to interact with the catalyst.

- **Advice 8**: **Introduce rules based on the modifiers' solubility parameters.** Parameters like solubility in the reaction solvent (acetonitrile) can influence the reaction yield and can be quantified using Hansen solubility parameters or calculated logS values.

- **Advice 9**: **Develop a scoring system that numerically ranks modifiers based on their overall potential to enhance yield.** Assign scores to specific features (e.g., presence of coordinating groups, chain length, steric factors) and sum them to predict the modifier's effectiveness.

- **Advice 10**: **Ensure the updated rules are compatible with machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling.** Structure the rules and data in a way that allows for easy integration into machine learning workflows, facilitating the development of predictive models for reaction optimization.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halogens) at the para position result in high yield; those with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy) result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with the metal center of the catalyst.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

2. **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino groups on chains of five carbons or fewer result in high yield; those with amino groups on longer chains result in low yield due to steric hindrance.**
   - *Rationale*: Short-chain amino acids can effectively coordinate with the catalyst without being hindered by steric effects.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

3. **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains capable of coordination (e.g., carboxyl, hydroxyl, indole groups) result in high yield; amino acids with nonpolar aromatic side chains result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Side chains with functional groups enhance coordination with the metal center, improving catalyst activity.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

4. **Rule 4**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde or ketone groups directly attached to an aromatic ring result in low yield due to potential catalyst inhibition or side reactions.**
   - *Rationale*: Aldehyde and ketone groups can bind to the metal center, possibly deactivating the catalyst or leading to side reactions.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
     - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

5. **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids result in low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects and hydrophobicity interfering with catalyst coordination.**
   - *Rationale*: Extreme electron-withdrawing nature and poor solubility limit effective interaction with the catalyst.
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

6. **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on short aliphatic chains result in high yield due to enhanced coordination and solubility.**
   - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites and improve solubility in the reaction medium.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

7. **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing polyether chains ending with a carboxylic acid group result in low yield due to steric hindrance reducing coordination efficiency.**
   - *Rationale*: Flexible and bulky polyether chains impede effective interaction with the catalyst's active site.
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

8. **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with thiol groups on short aliphatic chains result in high yield; those with thiol groups directly attached to an aromatic ring result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**
   - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols can coordinate without deactivating the catalyst, whereas aromatic thiols may bind too strongly and inhibit catalytic activity.
   - *High Yield Example*:

    - *High Yield Examples*:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
      - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

11. **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are arylalkanoic acids with electron-rich aromatic rings connected via short aliphatic chains result in high yield; those with electron-poor aromatic rings or insufficient chain length result in low yield.**
    - *Rationale*: Electron-rich aromatics enhance interactions, while optimal chain length ensures proper positioning for coordination.
    - *High Yield Examples*:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
      - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

12. **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing flexible bulky side chains, such as long polyether chains or long aliphatic chains with polar end groups, result in low yield due to steric hindrance impeding effective coordination.**
    - *Rationale*: Bulky groups can prevent the modifier from appropriately interacting with the catalyst.
    - *Low Yield Examples*:
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: Rephrase the rules to be based on quantitative molecular descriptors that can be directly calculated from SMILES strings. This will facilitate the generation of a numeric feature matrix. For instance, instead of stating "electron-withdrawing groups," specify the Hammett sigma constants or the number of electron-withdrawing substituents.

- **Advice 2**: Simplify functional group categorizations by using standard functional group counts and types. For example, count the number of carboxylic acid groups, amino groups, hydroxyl groups, and aromatic rings in each modifier molecule.

- **Advice 3**: Incorporate numerical descriptors such as molecular weight, topological polar surface area (TPSA), LogP (octanol-water partition coefficient), number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, and rotatable bond counts. These descriptors are calculable from SMILES and can be directly used in modeling.

- **Advice 4**: Quantify steric hindrance by calculating the Van der Waals volume or using other steric parameters like the Taft steric parameter (Es). This will allow for a numerical assessment of steric effects mentioned in the rules.

- **Advice 5**: For chain length considerations, introduce a numerical variable representing the length of aliphatic chains or the distance between functional groups. This replaces qualitative terms like "short chains" and allows for precise modeling.

- **Advice 6**: Replace descriptors like "electron-rich" or "electron-poor" aromatic rings with quantitative electronic parameters such as the total electron density, HOMO/LUMO energies, or the sum of substituent Hammett sigma constants.

- **Advice 7**: Reframe rules involving steric bulk of side chains by introducing parameters like the number of heavy atoms in side chains or the presence of bulky substituents, quantified using molecular descriptors.

- **Advice 8**: Include counts of specific heteroatoms (e.g., total number of nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur atoms) and their positions (e.g., heteroatoms in aromatic rings vs. aliphatic chains) to capture coordination abilities numerically.

- **Advice 9**: For rules concerning coordination sites, define the number of potential coordination sites per molecule, considering lone pairs on nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms. This provides a direct numerical measure of coordination potential.

- **Advice 10**: Utilize cheminformatics tools to generate molecular fingerprints (e.g., MACCS keys, ECFP) from SMILES, which convert structural information into binary or numerical vectors suitable for machine learning models.

- **Advice 11**: Introduce quantitative thresholds in the rules. For example, "Modifiers with a LogP value less than 2.5 tend to result in high yield," instead of qualitative descriptions of hydrophobicity.

- **Advice 12**: Apply multivariate statistical analysis or machine learning techniques to correlate the calculated molecular descriptors with the observed yields. This can help refine the rules based on predictive models rather than solely qualitative assessments.

These rules have been carefully crafted to reflect the relationships between the structural features of the molecular modifiers and the observed yields in the reaction. By focusing on combinations of functional groups and considering underlying physicochemical properties, the rules aim to:

- **Maximize Coverage**: Prioritize rules that apply to a broader range of the dataset.
- **Balance Complexity**: Maintain a suitable balance between simple rules with higher coverage and complex rules with lower coverage.
- **Enhance Predictive Power**: Ensure each rule clearly predicts whether the yield will be high or low for any modifier fitting its description.
- **Provide Clear Rationale**: Include underlying reasons based on chemical principles to explain why certain structural features influence the yield.

These rules can be used as guidelines for selecting or designing new modifiers to optimize the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains capable of chelation (e.g., carboxylate, hydroxyl, indole groups) result in high yield; amino acids with non-coordinating side chains (e.g., phenyl groups) result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Side chains with chelating groups enhance coordination with the metal center of the catalyst, improving its activity.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

2. **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., nitro, bromo, amino) at the para position result in high yield; those with electron-donating substituents (e.g., methyl) result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxylate group, enhancing interaction with the catalyst.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**

3. **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with coordinating functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxy, thiol) on short aliphatic chains (five carbons or fewer) result in high yield; those with longer chains result in low yield due to steric hindrance.**
   - *Rationale*: Short chains with functional groups effectively coordinate with the catalyst; longer chains introduce steric bulk that hinders interaction.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
     - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

4. **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains result in high yield due to enhanced coordination and solubility; those with bulky protective groups result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites and improve solubility, while bulky groups hinder interaction.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
     - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

5. **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms capable of coordination (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole rings) result in high yield; those with additional aromatic rings or steric hindrance result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles coordinate effectively with the catalyst unless steric factors interfere.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

6. **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde or ketone groups directly attached to an aromatic ring result in low yield due to potential catalyst inhibition.**
   - *Rationale*: Aldehyde and ketone groups can bind strongly to the metal center, potentially deactivating the catalyst or leading to side reactions.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
     - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

7. **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with perfluoroalkyl chains result in low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects and hydrophobicity interfering with catalyst coordination.**
   - *Rationale*: Perfluoroalkyl groups decrease the electron density and solubility, hindering effective interaction with the catalyst.
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

8. **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing flexible bulky side chains, such as polyether chains or long aliphatic chains with polar end groups, result in low yield due to steric hindrance reducing coordination efficiency.**
   - *Rationale*: Bulky and flexible chains impede the modifier's ability to interact properly with the catalyst's active site.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

9. **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with thiol groups on short aliphatic chains result in high yield; those with thiol groups directly attached to an aromatic ring result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**
   - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols can coordinate effectively without deactivating the catalyst, whereas aromatic thiols may bind too strongly and inhibit catalytic activity.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

10. **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups result in high yield due to minimal steric hindrance and sufficient flexibility for coordination.**
    - *Rationale*: Simple structures allow easy access to the catalyst without interference.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - **Octanoic acid**

11. **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic rings connected via short aliphatic chains (four carbons or more) result in high yield; those with shorter chains or additional steric bulk result in low yield.**
    - *Rationale*: Optimal chain length positions the aromatic ring for effective coordination without steric hindrance.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

12. **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing multiple aromatic rings directly attached (e.g., biphenyl structures) result in low yield due to increased steric hindrance and reduced flexibility.**
    - *Rationale*: Multiple rings increase steric bulk, hindering the modifier's ability to coordinate with the catalyst.
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been carefully crafted to reflect the relationships between the structural features of the molecular modifiers and the observed yields in the reaction. By focusing on combinations of functional groups and considering underlying physicochemical properties, the rules aim to:

- **Maximize Coverage**: Prioritize rules that apply to a broader range of the dataset.
- **Balance Complexity**: Maintain a suitable balance between simple rules with higher coverage and complex rules with lower coverage.
- **Enhance Predictive Power**: Ensure each rule clearly predicts whether the yield will be high or low for any modifier fitting its description.
- **Provide Clear Rationale**: Include underlying reasons based on chemical principles to explain why certain structural features influence the yield.

These rules can be used as guidelines for selecting or designing new modifiers to optimize the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: **Revise the SMARTS pattern for the indole group in Rule 1 to ensure it correctly matches indole-containing side chains like tryptophan.** The current pattern `'c1ccc2[cH][nH]c2c1'` may not match the indole ring in tryptophan due to differences in aromatic bonding representations. Consider using a more general pattern like `'c1c[cH]c2c1[cH][nH]c2'` or `'c1c2cc[nH]c2cc1'` to capture indole rings accurately.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: **Adjust the SMARTS patterns for electron-withdrawing groups in Rule 2 to correctly match nitro groups and aromatic amino groups.** The current nitro group pattern `'[NX3](=O)=O'` does not match the nitro group's common representation `'[N+](=O)[O-]'`. Update the nitro group pattern to `'[N+](=O)[O-]'` to ensure proper matching. For aromatic amino groups, modify the amino group pattern to include aromatic contexts, such as `'[NX3;H2,H1][c]'` to match amino groups attached directly to aromatic rings.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: **Review and correct the SMARTS patterns for other functional groups to ensure they represent the chemical structures described in the rules accurately.** For example, the bromine pattern `'[Br]'` in Rule 2 may incorrectly match any bromine atom, including those not in the desired position. Modify the pattern to `'[c][Br]'` to specify bromine attached to an aromatic carbon. Similarly, refine patterns for electron-donating groups and other functionalities to improve specificity.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: **Incorporate positional specificity into the SMARTS patterns where necessary, especially for substituents on aromatic rings in Rules 2 and 5.** Modify the patterns to reflect substitutions at the para position, such as using `'c1cc([NX3;H2,H1][c])ccc1[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'` for para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids. This will ensure the patterns match compounds where the substituents are in the correct positions influencing the reactivity.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: **Test and validate each SMARTS pattern against known examples before applying them to the full dataset.** Use a set of test SMILES strings for compounds that are expected to match or not match each rule's patterns. This step will help identify mismatches or unintended matches, allowing for adjustments to the patterns to improve accuracy.

  - **Train Lift:** (1.2048 + 1.0559) / 2 ≈ **1.1304**
  - **Train Leverage:** (0.0289 + (-0.0041)) / 2 ≈ **0.0124**

- **Current Rule Metrics:**
  - **Train Support:** **0.0321**
  - **Train Confidence:** **0.6432**
  - **Train Lift:** **1.2802**
  - **Train Leverage:** **0.0095**

---

**2. Detailed Analysis:**

**a. Support:**

- **Observation:** The current train support is **0.0321**, a significant decrease from the previous average of **0.1756**.
- **Interpretation:** The current rules are applicable to only about **3.21%** of the training data compared to **17.56%** previously.
- **Implications:** A lower support means the rules cover fewer instances, potentially limiting their practical usefulness and generalizability.

**b. Confidence:**

- **Observation:** The current train confidence is **0.6432**, an improvement over the previous average of **0.5874**.
- **Interpretation:** When the rule conditions are met, there's a **64.32%** probability that the predicted outcome occurs, indicating better reliability.
- **Implications:** Higher confidence suggests the rules are more precise in predicting high yield when applicable.

**c. Lift:**

- **Observation:** The current train lift is **1.2802**, higher than the previous average of **1.1304**.
- **Interpretation:** Lift values greater than **1** indicate that the rule is better at predicting the outcome than random chance. The higher lift means the current rules are more effective at identifying true positives.
- **Implications:** Increased lift enhances the practical significance of the rules in highlighting meaningful associations.

**d. Leverage:**

- **Observation:** The current train leverage is **0.0095**, slightly lower than the previous average of **0.0124**.
- **Interpretation:** Positive leverage indicates that the rule's condition and prediction co-occur more frequently than expected by chance, though the magnitude is modest.
- **Implications:** A slight decrease suggests a minor reduction in the strength of the association beyond chance, but it remains positive.

---

**3. Performance Commentary:**

- **Trade-off Between Support and Confidence/Lift:**
  - The **increase in confidence and lift** demonstrates that the current rules are more accurate and have a stronger association with high yield when they apply.
  - However, the **significant decrease in support** indicates that these rules apply to a much smaller portion of the data, potentially overlooking many relevant cases.

- **Potential Overfitting:**
  - The drop in support may suggest that the current rules are too specialized or **overfitted** to specific instances in the training data.
  - Overfitting reduces the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data, limiting its practical applicability.

- **Local Minimum Assessment:**
  - The marginal gains in confidence and lift, coupled with the substantial loss in support, hint that we've reached a **local minimum**.
  - Further iterations focusing solely on improving confidence and lift might continue to reduce support, offering diminishing returns.

---

**4. Recommendations for Improving the Current Rules:**

**a. Increase Support Without Sacrificing Too Much Confidence/Lift:**

- **Broaden Rule Applicability:**
  - Review the current rules to identify overly restrictive conditions.
  - Simplify or relax specific constraints to make the rules apply to a larger subset of data.
  - For example, instead of specifying exact functional groups, consider broader categories that encapsulate similar properties.

- **Combine Similar Rules:**
  - Merge rules that have overlapping conditions or predictions.
  - This can increase support by unifying rules that individually cover small portions of data but collectively cover more.

**b. Balance Complexity and Generalizability:**

- **Simplify Complex Rules:**
  - Assess if some rules are too complex, limiting their applicability.
  - Aim for a balance where rules are detailed enough to be accurate but general enough to cover more instances.

- **Eliminate Redundant or Ineffective Rules:**
  - Identify rules that contribute minimally to overall performance, especially those with very low support and minimal impact on confidence/lift.
  - Removing such rules can streamline the rule set, making it more efficient.

**c. Re-evaluate Chemical Rationale:**

- **Ensure Chemical Relevance:**
  - Cross-check the chemical rationale behind each rule to confirm it aligns with known chemical principles.
  - Adjust rules where the theoretical basis doesn't hold up, possibly leading to more generalizable rules.

- **Identify Key Structural Features:**
  - Focus on the most influential molecular features that consistently correlate with high yields.
  - Emphasize these features in the rules to enhance both support and predictive power.

**d. Incorporate Test Data Metrics:**

- **Evaluate on Test Set:**
  - Use a test dataset to assess how well the current rules generalize beyond the training data.
  - If performance on the test set is poor, it indicates overfitting, necessitating adjustments to the rules.

**e. Iterate with Adjusted Parameters:**

- **Adjust Rule Generation Thresholds:**
  - Modify parameters in the rule generation process, such as lowering the minimum confidence or lift thresholds slightly to allow for broader rules with acceptable performance.
  - Monitor how these adjustments affect support, confidence, and lift.

**f. Explore Alternative Approaches:**

- **Incorporate Statistical or Machine Learning Models:**
  - Consider using decision trees, random forests, or other models that can handle complex interactions and may offer better generalization.
  - These models can help identify patterns not captured by the current rule-based approach.

- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Develop new features that better capture the properties influencing yield, such as molecular descriptors or computationally derived properties.

---

**5. Conclusion:**

The current rules have improved in terms of confidence and lift, suggesting better precision and stronger associations when they apply. However, the significant reduction in support indicates that they cover a much smaller portion of the dataset. To enhance the performance of the rules:

- **Aim for a Balanced Rule Set:** Strive for rules that maintain high confidence and lift while significantly improving support.
- **Adjust and Simplify Rules:** Simplify overly specific rules and broaden conditions where appropriate to increase applicability.
- **Validate and Iterate:** Continuously validate the rules against test data and iterate the rule generation process, adjusting parameters as needed.
- **Ground in Chemical Knowledge:** Ensure all rules are based on sound chemical principles to enhance their relevance and generalizability.

By implementing these recommendations, the rules can become more robust, practical, and effective in predicting high yields, ultimately contributing more value to the research program.

ML Commenter Message:
**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

After analyzing the latest training results and comparing them with the reference metrics, the following observations and insights can be made regarding the performance of the current rules:

1. **Evaluation of Effectiveness**

   - **Decrease in Validation Accuracy**: The previous validation accuracies were consistently high at approximately 76%, with test accuracies ranging from 62.5% to 75%. In contrast, the current iteration shows a 5-fold cross-validation accuracy of **60%**, which is a noticeable decrease from the baseline.

   - **Effectiveness of Current Rules**: The reduction in accuracy suggests that the current rules are **less effective** in capturing the relationship between the molecular features and the catalyst loading compared to previous rules.

2. **Assessment of Overfitting/Underfitting**

   - **Underfitting Indication**: The consistent decrease in both training and validation accuracies implies that the model may be **underfitting**. The current rules might be too simplistic or not sufficiently capturing the complexity of the data.

   - **Iteration Trend**: Despite several iterations aiming to refine the rules, the validation accuracy has fluctuated without significant improvement, indicating that the model has potentially reached a local minimum.

3. **Analysis of Discrepancies Using SHAP Values**

   - **Overestimated Loadings (False Positives)**:
     - **Issue with Rule 8**: For molecules where the predicted loading is **high** but the experimental value is **low**, such as:
       - *C1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N*
       - *C(CC(=O)O)C(=O)CCC(=O)O*
       - *C(CCCC(=O)O)CCCN*
     - **SHAP Analysis**: **Rule 8** shows a high positive SHAP value for high loading (≈0.077 to 0.060), suggesting that it is contributing significantly to the overestimation.

   - **Underestimated Loadings (False Negatives)**:
     - **Less Prominent in Current Data**: There are no clear instances in the current SHAP analysis where the predicted loading is **low** and the experimental value is **high** with a significantly negative SHAP value from any rule.

4. **Interpretation of Accuracy Improvements**

   - **Slight Improvement in Latest Iteration**: The accuracy increased from approximately 51% in previous iterations to **60%** in the current one. However, it still remains below the baseline accuracy of 76%.

   - **Probability of Further Improvement**: Given the plateauing of accuracy over several iterations and the current accuracy being significantly lower than the baseline, the probability of substantial improvement without revising the rules seems low.

5. **Insights from SHAP Analysis**

   - **Dominance of Rule 8**: The SHAP values indicate that **Rule 8** is a dominant contributor to the model’s predictions. Its high positive SHAP values in cases of overestimation suggest that the rule may be too broadly defined or not accurately capturing the modifiers that truly lead to high loading.

   - **Lack of Influence from Other Rules**: Only **Rule 8** is contributing significantly in the current iteration, as per the SHAP values. This suggests that other rules may not be effectively influencing the predictions, potentially due to being too narrow or lacking relevance.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

1. **Refine Rule 8 to Reduce Overestimation**

   - **Issue Identified**: Rule 8 is contributing to high predicted loadings even for modifiers that experimentally result in low loading.

   - **Suggested Action**:
     - **Review and Modify Rule 8**: Examine the structural features and rationale of Rule 8 to identify why it is overestimating loading.
     - **Add Specificity**: Incorporate additional criteria to Rule 8 to distinguish between modifiers that actually lead to high loading and those that do not.
     - **Possible Adjustments**:
       - Introduce exceptions for certain functional groups or chain lengths that may interfere with coordination despite the presence of flexible bulky side chains.
       - Specify the types of polar end groups or chain lengths that are detrimental versus those that are beneficial.

2. **Reassess and Strengthen Other Rules**

   - **Increase Influence of Other Rules**: Given that other rules are not significantly contributing to predictions, they may need to be broadened or revised to have a meaningful impact.

   - **Suggested Action**:
     - **Broaden Coverage**: Modify rules to cover more molecules by relaxing overly strict criteria.
     - **Enhance Relevance**: Ensure that each rule is grounded in strong chemical rationale that correlates with the observed data.

3. **Address Underfitting by Introducing New Features**

   - **Enrich Feature Matrix**: Incorporate additional molecular descriptors that may capture relevant properties not currently accounted for.

   - **Suggested Action**:
     - **Add Physicochemical Properties**: Include features like molecular weight, polarity, hydrogen bonding capacity, or electronic properties.
     - **Use Substructure Analysis**: Identify common substructures in high-performing modifiers and create rules based on these patterns.

4. **Iterative Testing and Validation**

   - **Implement Changes Gradually**: Adjust one rule at a time and observe the impact on model performance to isolate the effects.

   - **Suggested Action**:
     - **Monitor SHAP Values**: After each modification, analyze SHAP values to ensure that changes are having the intended effect.
     - **Cross-Validation**: Continue using cross-validation to assess the generalizability of the model.

5. **Incorporate Domain Knowledge**

   - **Consult Experimental Data**: Re-examine the experimental observations to identify any overlooked patterns or anomalies.

   - **Suggested Action**:
     - **Engage with Chemists**: Collaborate with domain experts to refine rules based on practical insights.
     - **Update Rationales**: Amend the rationales of the rules to reflect new understandings gained from data and expert input.

6. **Consider Rule Interactions**

   - **Assess Synergistic Effects**: Investigate whether combinations of rules may better predict outcomes than individual rules alone.

   - **Suggested Action**:
     - **Create Composite Features**: Develop new rules that consider interactions between different molecular features.
     - **Machine Learning Techniques**: Use techniques like feature interaction networks to identify significant interactions.

**Conclusion**

The current set of rules, particularly **Rule 8**, is not effectively capturing the complexity of the dataset, leading to decreased accuracy and prediction discrepancies. By refining Rule 8, reassessing other rules, and introducing additional relevant features, we can aim to improve the model's performance. Iterative testing and incorporating domain expertise will be crucial in developing more accurate and generalizable rules.

**Next Steps**

- **Refine Rule 8**: Modify the rule to reduce its overestimation tendency, possibly by adding more specific criteria or exceptions.

- **Broaden Other Rules**: Re-evaluate and adjust the other rules to increase their influence on the model's predictions.

- **Enhance Feature Set**: Consider adding new molecular descriptors to capture additional relevant information.

- **Iterative Refinement**: Continue the process of iterative testing, validation, and refinement of the rules.

- **Collaborate with Experts**: Engage with chemists and domain experts to gain deeper insights and validate the proposed changes.

By implementing these recommendations, we can work towards improving the model's predictive accuracy and better understand the factors influencing catalyst loading.

**Appendix: Potential Refinements to Rule 8**

- **Original Rule 8**:

  **Modifiers containing flexible bulky side chains, such as polyether chains or long aliphatic chains with polar end groups, result in low yield due to steric hindrance reducing coordination efficiency.**

- **Suggested Refinement**:

  **Modifiers containing flexible bulky side chains (e.g., polyether chains longer than three units or aliphatic chains longer than six carbons) with polar end groups result in low yield due to steric hindrance. However, shorter chains or those terminating with strong coordinating groups (e.g., amino, carboxylate) may result in high yield by balancing flexibility and coordination efficiency.**

- **Rationale for Refinement**:

  - **Add Specificity**: By specifying chain lengths and types of end groups, the rule becomes more precise.
  - **Address Exceptions**: Acknowledge that not all bulky side chains have the same effect, and some may enhance coordination if properly balanced.
  - **Improve Prediction Accuracy**: Provides a clearer guideline that may reduce overestimation in cases where modifiers do not actually hinder coordination.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimization**

**1. Summary of Discussions:**

The recent analysis of the rules governing the catalytic action of modified catalysts in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction has revealed several key observations:

- **Decrease in Model Performance:** The validation accuracy has decreased from previous levels (~76%) to around **60%**, indicating that the current rules are less effective at predicting yields compared to earlier iterations.

- **Overreliance on Rule 8:** SHAP analysis indicates that **Rule 8** is disproportionately influencing the model's predictions by assigning high yield predictions even when experimental results show low yield. This suggests that Rule 8 may be too broad or not accurately capturing the modifiers that lead to high yields, resulting in false positives.

- **Underutilization of Other Rules:** Other rules are contributing minimally to the predictions, as evidenced by low or zero SHAP values. This suggests that these rules may be too narrow, overly specific, or not adequately capturing key structural features influencing yield.

- **Low Rule Support:** The current rules have low train support (3.21%), meaning they apply to a small fraction of the data, limiting their practical utility and generalizability.

- **Potential Overfitting:** The increase in confidence and lift has come at the expense of reduced support, indicating a possible overfitting where the rules are too specialized to the training data and may not generalize well to new data.

**2. Directions to Optimize Current Rules:**

To enhance the performance of the rules and improve model accuracy, the following strategies are recommended:

- **Refine Rule 8 to Increase Specificity:**

  - **Issue Identified:** Rule 8 is overestimating yields by predicting high yield for modifiers that experimentally result in low yield.

  - **Actions to Take:**

    - **Add Specific Criteria:** Specify chain length thresholds or the nature of the polar end groups. For example, define "long aliphatic chains" as those longer than six carbons and specify which polar end groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino) contribute to steric hindrance.

    - **Introduce Exceptions:** Identify and exclude functional groups that might mitigate steric hindrance or enhance coordination despite bulky side chains.

    - **Revise Rule Wording:** Modify Rule 8 to reflect these changes, enhancing its precision and reducing false positives.

- **Broaden and Strengthen Other Rules:**

  - **Increase Rule Applicability:**

    - **Relax Overly Strict Conditions:** Adjust the SMARTS patterns and criteria to include a broader range of molecules without compromising the rule's integrity.

    - **Combine Similar Rules:** Merge rules with overlapping features to increase support and coverage.

  - **Enhance Rule Influence:**

    - **Ensure Chemical Relevance:** Re-evaluate the chemical rationales behind the rules and adjust them to align with known chemical principles and experimental data.

    - **Incorporate Key Structural Features:** Include additional functional groups or molecular characteristics that have shown to influence yield significantly.

- **Revise and Validate SMARTS Patterns:**

  - **Correct Pattern Matching Issues:**

    - **Adjust Patterns for Functional Groups:** Modify SMARTS patterns to accurately represent groups like nitro (`[N+](=O)[O-]`) and aromatic amino groups, ensuring correct matching.

    - **Add Positional Specificity:** Include positional information in patterns to target substituents at specific positions (e.g., para-substituted aromatics).

  - **Test Patterns with Known Compounds:**

    - **Validate Against Examples:** Use known compounds to test the patterns, ensuring they match the intended structures and exclude unintended ones.

- **Increase Rule Support Without Sacrificing Confidence:**

  - **Simplify Overly Complex Rules:** Remove unnecessary constraints that limit the applicability of rules.

  - **Balance Specificity and Generality:** Aim for rules that are neither too broad (leading to low confidence) nor too narrow (resulting in low support).

- **Incorporate Additional Molecular Descriptors:**

  - **Feature Engineering:**

    - **Add Physicochemical Properties:** Include descriptors such as molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, and polar surface area.

    - **Use Computational Descriptors:** Employ quantum chemical calculations or molecular simulations to derive properties that may correlate with yield.

- **Iterative Testing and Validation:**

  - **Monitor SHAP Values Continuously:** After modifying rules, analyze the SHAP values to ensure the changes positively impact the model's predictions.

  - **Employ Cross-validation:** Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to assess model performance and generalizability.

- **Consult Domain Experts:**

  - **Engage with Chemists:** Collaborate with experts to gain insights into reaction mechanisms and modifier-catalyst interactions.

  - **Update Rationales and Rules Accordingly:** Integrate expert knowledge into the rules to enhance their chemical validity and predictive power.

**3. Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting:**

Yes, there is a possibility for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. By refining the rules to improve specificity and coverage, correcting SMARTS patterns, and incorporating additional relevant features, we can enhance model performance while maintaining generalizability. It is crucial to strike a balance between rule complexity and applicability to avoid overfitting.

    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains capable of chelation (e.g., carboxylate, hydroxyl, indole groups) result in high yield; amino acids with non-coordinating side chains (e.g., phenyl groups) result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Side chains with chelating groups enhance coordination with the metal center of the catalyst, improving its activity.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

2. **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., nitro, bromo, amino) at the para position result in high yield; those with electron-donating substituents (e.g., methyl) result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxylate group, enhancing interaction with the catalyst.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid**
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid**

3. **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with coordinating functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxy, thiol) on short aliphatic chains (five carbons or fewer) result in high yield; those with longer chains result in low yield due to steric hindrance.**
   - *Rationale*: Short chains with functional groups effectively coordinate with the catalyst; longer chains introduce steric bulk that hinders interaction.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid**
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
     - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

4. **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains result in high yield due to enhanced coordination and solubility; those with bulky protective groups result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups provide additional coordination sites and improve solubility, while bulky groups hinder interaction.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
     - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

5. **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms capable of coordination (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole rings) result in high yield; those with additional aromatic rings or steric hindrance result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles coordinate effectively with the catalyst unless steric factors interfere.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

6. **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde or ketone groups directly attached to an aromatic ring result in low yield due to potential catalyst inhibition.**
   - *Rationale*: Aldehyde and ketone groups can bind strongly to the metal center, potentially deactivating the catalyst or leading to side reactions.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
     - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**

7. **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with perfluoroalkyl chains result in low yield due to strong electron-withdrawing effects and hydrophobicity interfering with catalyst coordination.**
   - *Rationale*: Perfluoroalkyl groups decrease the electron density and solubility, hindering effective interaction with the catalyst.
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

8. **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing flexible bulky side chains, such as polyether chains or long aliphatic chains with polar end groups, result in low yield due to steric hindrance reducing coordination efficiency.**
   - *Rationale*: Bulky and flexible chains impede the modifier's ability to interact properly with the catalyst's active site.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**

9. **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with thiol groups on short aliphatic chains result in high yield; those with thiol groups directly attached to an aromatic ring result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**
   - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols can coordinate effectively without deactivating the catalyst, whereas aromatic thiols may bind too strongly and inhibit catalytic activity.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

10. **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups result in high yield due to minimal steric hindrance and sufficient flexibility for coordination.**
    - *Rationale*: Simple structures allow easy access to the catalyst without interference.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - **Octanoic acid**

11. **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic rings connected via short aliphatic chains (four carbons or more) result in high yield; those with shorter chains or additional steric bulk result in low yield.**
    - *Rationale*: Optimal chain length positions the aromatic ring for effective coordination without steric hindrance.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

12. **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing multiple aromatic rings directly attached (e.g., biphenyl structures) result in low yield due to increased steric hindrance and reduced flexibility.**
    - *Rationale*: Multiple rings increase steric bulk, hindering the modifier's ability to coordinate with the catalyst.
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Refine Rule 8 to Increase Specificity**

  - **Issue**: Rule 8 is over-predicting high yields for modifiers that experimentally result in low yields due to being too broad.
  
  - **Action**:
    - **Specify Chain Length**: Modify Rule 8 to include a specific cutoff for what constitutes a "long aliphatic chain." For example, define long chains as those with more than **six carbon atoms**.
    - **Detail Polar End Groups**: Specify which polar end groups contribute to steric hindrance (e.g., bulky polyether chains like triethylene glycol units).
    - **Revised Rule 8**:

      **Rule 8**: *Modifiers containing flexible bulky side chains, such as polyether chains (e.g., chains with more than two ethylene glycol units) or long aliphatic chains (more than six carbons) with polar end groups, result in low yield due to steric hindrance reducing coordination efficiency.*

- **Advice 2**: **Revise SMARTS Patterns for Rule 8**

  - **Issue**: The current SMARTS patterns may not accurately capture the intended modifiers, leading to misclassification.
  
  - **Action**:
    - **Adjust Patterns for Chain Length**: Include a substructure pattern that specifies chain lengths (e.g., aliphatic chains with more than six carbons).
    - **Specify Polar End Groups**: Use SMARTS patterns that target specific bulky polar groups like polyethers.

  - **Example SMARTS Pattern**:
    - `[*]-[#6]-[#6]-[#6]-[#6]-[#6]-[#6]-[#6]-[#6]-[#6]-[#6]-[*]` (Represents chains longer than six carbons)
    - `[OX2H][CX4][CX4][OX2][CX4][CX4][OX2][CX4][CX3](=O)[OX1H]` (Represents triethylene glycol units)

- **Advice 3**: **Broaden Rule 2 to Increase Applicability**

  - **Issue**: Rule 2 is limited to para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids, reducing its coverage.
  
  - **Action**:
    - **Include Ortho and Meta Positions**: Expand the rule to include electron-withdrawing groups at ortho and meta positions.
    - **Revised Rule 2**:

      **Rule 2**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., nitro, bromo, amino) at the **ortho, meta, or para** positions result in high yield; those with electron-donating substituents (e.g., methyl) result in low yield.*

- **Advice 4**: **Enhance Rule 1 by Including Additional Coordinating Side Chains**

  - **Issue**: Rule 1 may be too narrow by focusing only on certain side chains.
  
  - **Action**:
    - **Include Sulfhydryl Groups**: Add amino acids with thiol-containing side chains (e.g., cysteine) that can coordinate with the metal center.
    - **Revised Rule 1**:

      **Rule 1**: *Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains capable of chelation (e.g., carboxylate, hydroxyl, indole, **sulfhydryl** groups) result in high yield; amino acids with non-coordinating side chains result in low yield.*

- **Advice 5**: **Merge Rules 3 and 10 to Increase Support**

  - **Issue**: Both rules address aliphatic carboxylic acids but separately, which limits their individual support.
  
  - **Action**:
    - **Combine Rules for Simplicity**: Create a unified rule for aliphatic carboxylic acids with or without additional coordinating groups.
    - **New Combined Rule**:

      **Rule**: *Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids, with or without small coordinating functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxy, thiol) on short aliphatic chains (up to five carbons), result in high yield due to minimal steric hindrance and effective coordination.*

- **Advice 6**: **Correct and Validate SMARTS Patterns for Functional Groups**

  - **Issue**: Incorrect SMARTS patterns may lead to misclassification of modifiers.
  
  - **Action**:
    - **Nitro Groups**: Use `[N+](=O)[O-]` to represent nitro groups accurately.
    - **Carboxylic Acids**: Ensure carboxylic acid groups are represented as `[CX3](=O)[OX1H]`.
    - **Aromatic Amines**: Represent aromatic amino groups as `[NX3][a]`.

  - **Example**:
    - **Corrected Nitro Group Pattern**: `[N+](=O)[O-]`
    - **Corrected Carboxylic Acid Pattern**: `[#6][CX3](=O)[OX1H]`

- **Advice 7**: **Simplify Overly Complex Rules to Increase Support**

  - **Issue**: Some rules are too specific, reducing their applicability.
  
  - **Action**:
    - **Adjust Rule 5**: Remove the exclusion of modifiers with additional aromatic rings if steric hindrance is minimal.
    - **Revised Rule 5**:

      **Rule 5**: *Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms capable of coordination (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole rings) result in high yield, provided steric hindrance does not significantly impede interaction.*

- **Advice 8**: **Introduce a New Rule for Hydroxyl-Containing Aromatic Modifiers**

  - **Rationale**: Hydroxyl groups on aromatic rings can enhance coordination due to their electron-donating nature.
  
  - **New Rule**:

    **Rule**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl groups on the aromatic ring result in high yield due to enhanced coordination and electron-donating effects facilitating interaction with the catalyst.*

  - **Example**:
    - **High Yield Example**:
      - **Salicylic Acid** (2-hydroxybenzoic acid)

- **Advice 9**: **Include Electron-Donating Groups in Aromatic Modifiers**

  - **Issue**: Electron-donating groups can also influence yield by affecting coordination dynamics.
  
  - **Action**:
    - **Expand Rules to Include Such Groups**: Adjust rules to consider modifiers with groups like methoxy or alkylamino that may enhance yield.
    - **Revised Rule**:

      **Rule**: *Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-donating substituents (e.g., hydroxyl, methoxy) ortho to the carboxyl group can result in high yield due to intramolecular hydrogen bonding enhancing coordination.*

- **Advice 10**: **Validate and Iterate Rules Using Cross-Validation**

  - **Issue**: Changes need to be tested for effectiveness.
  
  - **Action**:
    - **Monitor Model Metrics**: After revising the rules, assess the impact on model accuracy, support, confidence, and lift.
    - **Use Cross-Validation**: Employ k-fold cross-validation to evaluate the generalizability of the rules.
    - **Iterate as Necessary**: Refine the rules based on validation results to achieve optimal performance without overfitting.

2. **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted functional groups capable of coordination (e.g., amino, nitro, hydroxy) result in high yield; those with non-coordinating or electron-donating substituents (e.g., methyl) result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Coordination-capable groups at the para position enhance interaction with the catalyst, while non-coordinating groups do not contribute to catalysis and may not position the molecule favorably.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Entry 4)
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Entry 20)
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Entry 1)
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 22)
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19)

3. **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of coordination (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole rings) result in high yield; those with additional aromatic rings or steric hindrance result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings can coordinate with the metal center, but additional rings or bulk reduce accessibility.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid, Entry 21)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 16)

     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Entry 29)

5. **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing thiol groups on short aliphatic chains result in high yield; those with thiol groups directly attached to an aromatic ring result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**
   - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols coordinate effectively without deactivating the catalyst, whereas aromatic thiols may bind too strongly and inhibit catalytic activity.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 17)
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Entry 10)

6. **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups beyond six carbons result in high yield; longer chains without coordinating groups result in low yield due to increased hydrophobicity and steric hindrance.**
   - *Rationale*: Short to medium aliphatic chains provide flexibility and access to the catalyst, while overly long chains hinder interaction.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **Octanoic acid** (Entry 5)
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Entry 34)
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Entry 31)

7. **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with ether linkages in aliphatic chains result in low yield due to increased flexibility and reduced ability to coordinate effectively with the catalyst.**
   - *Rationale*: Ether linkages introduce flexibility, which can prevent proper alignment and coordination with the active site.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 11)
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32)

8. **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing electron-withdrawing perfluoroalkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups result in low yield due to decreased electron density on coordinating atoms and increased hydrophobicity.**
   - *Rationale*: Strong electron-withdrawing groups reduce the ability of coordinating atoms to interact with the metal center, and hydrophobicity reduces solubility.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Entry 14)
     - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** (Entry 28)

9. **Rule 9**: **Modifiers featuring aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the aromatic ring or coordination site result in low yield due to potential deactivation of the catalyst.**
   - *Rationale*: Aldehydes and ketones can strongly bind to the metal center, inhibiting catalysis or leading to side reactions.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19)
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 18)
     - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Entry 27)

10. **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing heteroatoms capable of coordination (e.g., indole, carboxylate) result in high yield; those with hydrophobic or non-coordinating side chains result in low yield.**
    - *Rationale*: Heteroatoms in side chains enhance coordination with the catalyst, while hydrophobic side chains do not contribute to catalysis.

      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine, Entry 13)
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 33)

11. **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with multiple aromatic rings directly attached (e.g., biphenyl structures) result in low yield due to increased steric hindrance and reduced flexibility.**
    - *Rationale*: Larger aromatic systems hinder the ability of the modifier to interact with the catalyst's active site.
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 12)

12. **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic rings connected via short aliphatic chains (four carbons or more) result in high yield; those with shorter chains result in low yield due to suboptimal positioning for coordination.**
    - *Rationale*: Optimal chain length allows the aromatic ring to position coordinating groups near the catalyst without steric hindrance.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Entry 7)
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30)

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been thoughtfully revised and crafted to reflect the nuanced relationships between the structural features of the molecular modifiers and the observed yields in the reaction. The emphasis has been on:

- **Direct Combinations of Functional Groups**: Focusing on how specific functional groups and their positions within the molecule influence the yield.
- **Underlying Physicochemical Properties**: Considering electronic effects, steric factors, coordination ability, and solubility that impact catalyst interaction.
- **Clear Predictions**: Ensuring each rule provides a clear outcome (high or low yield) for any modifier fitting its description.
- **Maximizing Dataset Coverage**: Prioritizing rules that apply to multiple entries in the dataset to enhance their practical utility.
- **Balanced Complexity**: Combining both broad rules with higher coverage and more specific rules that address exceptions or particular cases.

These refined rules serve as a comprehensive guide for predicting the effectiveness of modifiers based on their structural features. By applying these rules, researchers can make informed decisions when selecting or designing new modifiers to optimize and control the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with additional coordinating functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, thiol) within a short carbon chain (five carbons or fewer) result in high yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Short-chain aliphatic acids with coordinating groups can effectively interact with the metal center of the catalyst, enhancing its activity without introducing significant steric hindrance.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (Entry 3)
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 17)
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid, Entry 2)
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid, Entry 0)
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Entry 31)
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Entry 34)

2. **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted functional groups capable of coordination (e.g., amino, nitro, hydroxy) result in high yield; those with non-coordinating or electron-donating substituents (e.g., methyl) result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Coordination-capable groups at the para position enhance interaction with the catalyst, while non-coordinating groups do not contribute to catalysis and may not position the molecule favorably.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Entry 4)
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Entry 20)
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Entry 1)
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 22)
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19)

3. **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of coordination (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole rings) result in high yield; those with additional aromatic rings or steric hindrance result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings can coordinate with the metal center, but additional rings or bulk reduce accessibility.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid, Entry 21)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 16)
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 8)
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 12)

4. **Rule 4**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain result in high yield due to enhanced coordination and solubility; those with bulky protective groups or long chains without coordinating groups result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase the number of coordination sites and improve solubility, facilitating better catalyst interaction.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid, Entry 9)
     - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** (Entry 6)
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 33)
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Entry 29)

5. **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing thiol groups on short aliphatic chains result in high yield; those with thiol groups directly attached to an aromatic ring result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**
   - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols coordinate effectively without deactivating the catalyst, whereas aromatic thiols may bind too strongly and inhibit catalytic activity.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 17)
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Entry 10)

6. **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups beyond six carbons result in high yield; longer chains without coordinating groups result in low yield due to increased hydrophobicity and steric hindrance.**
   - *Rationale*: Short to medium aliphatic chains provide flexibility and access to the catalyst, while overly long chains hinder interaction.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **Octanoic acid** (Entry 5)
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Entry 34)
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Entry 31)

7. **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with ether linkages in aliphatic chains result in low yield due to increased flexibility and reduced ability to coordinate effectively with the catalyst.**
   - *Rationale*: Ether linkages introduce flexibility, which can prevent proper alignment and coordination with the active site.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 11)
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32)

8. **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing electron-withdrawing perfluoroalkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups result in low yield due to decreased electron density on coordinating atoms and increased hydrophobicity.**
   - *Rationale*: Strong electron-withdrawing groups reduce the ability of coordinating atoms to interact with the metal center, and hydrophobicity reduces solubility.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Entry 14)
     - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** (Entry 28)

9. **Rule 9**: **Modifiers featuring aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the aromatic ring or coordination site result in low yield due to potential deactivation of the catalyst.**
   - *Rationale*: Aldehydes and ketones can strongly bind to the metal center, inhibiting catalysis or leading to side reactions.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19)
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 18)
     - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Entry 27)

10. **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing heteroatoms capable of coordination (e.g., indole, carboxylate) result in high yield; those with hydrophobic or non-coordinating side chains result in low yield.**
    - *Rationale*: Heteroatoms in side chains enhance coordination with the catalyst, while hydrophobic side chains do not contribute to catalysis.
    - *High Yield Examples*:
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan, Entry 15)
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid, Entry 2)
    - *Low Yield Examples*:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine, Entry 13)
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 33)

11. **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with multiple aromatic rings directly attached (e.g., biphenyl structures) result in low yield due to increased steric hindrance and reduced flexibility.**
    - *Rationale*: Larger aromatic systems hinder the ability of the modifier to interact with the catalyst's active site.
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 12)

12. **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic rings connected via short aliphatic chains (four carbons or more) result in high yield; those with shorter chains result in low yield due to suboptimal positioning for coordination.**
    - *Rationale*: Optimal chain length allows the aromatic ring to position coordinating groups near the catalyst without steric hindrance.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Entry 7)
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30)

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been thoughtfully revised and crafted to reflect the nuanced relationships between the structural features of the molecular modifiers and the observed yields in the reaction. The emphasis has been on:

- **Direct Combinations of Functional Groups**: Focusing on how specific functional groups and their positions within the molecule influence the yield.
- **Underlying Physicochemical Properties**: Considering electronic effects, steric factors, coordination ability, and solubility that impact catalyst interaction.
- **Clear Predictions**: Ensuring each rule provides a clear outcome (high or low yield) for any modifier fitting its description.
- **Maximizing Dataset Coverage**: Prioritizing rules that apply to multiple entries in the dataset to enhance their practical utility.
- **Balanced Complexity**: Combining both broad rules with higher coverage and more specific rules that address exceptions or particular cases.

These refined rules serve as a comprehensive guide for predicting the effectiveness of modifiers based on their structural features. By applying these rules, researchers can make informed decisions when selecting or designing new modifiers to optimize and control the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Verify the Entry Matching**  
  It appears that the SMILES list provided does not correspond to the Entry numbers mentioned in the rules. For example, Entry 0 in the rules refers to glutamic acid, but the first SMILES string in the list does not match glutamic acid. Ensure that the SMILES list and Entry numbers are correctly aligned so that the code can accurately associate each molecule with the proper rule.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Review the Exclude Pattern for Aromatic Rings**  
  The exclude pattern `aromatic_ring = '[a]'` may be too general and might exclude molecules that contain any aromatic atom, even if the relevant functional groups are on aliphatic portions of the molecule. Consider modifying the exclude pattern to only exclude molecules where the carboxylic acid is directly attached to an aromatic ring, rather than any molecule containing an aromatic ring.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Adjust the Amino Group SMARTS Pattern**  
  The amino group pattern `[NX3;H2,H1][#6]` requires the nitrogen to be attached to a carbon atom. However, in amino acids like glutamic acid and aspartic acid, the amino group is attached to a carbon that is also connected to other heteroatoms. Use a more general pattern like `[NX3;H2,H1]` without the `[C]` attachment to capture all primary and secondary amines.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Include Additional Functional Groups in Coordinating Groups**  
  The coordinating groups in Rule 1 include amino, hydroxyl, and thiol groups, but other coordinating groups like carboxylate anions and amides might also be relevant. Consider expanding the `coordinating_groups` patterns to include additional coordinating functional groups that are mentioned in the rules or present in the dataset.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Correct the Chain Length Calculation**  
  In the code, the chain length between the carboxylic acid and the coordinating group is determined by counting the number of carbon atoms in the shortest path. However, the current implementation counts all carbon atoms in the path, including the starting and ending carbons. Adjust the code to exclude the start and end atoms when counting the carbons, and ensure that the chain length correctly reflects the number of carbons between the functional groups.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Handle Multiple Functional Group Matches**  
  The code currently stops searching once it finds the first matching pair of functional groups within the chain length limit. However, some molecules may have multiple carboxylic acid and coordinating group pairs that need to be considered. Modify the code to check all possible pairs of carboxylic acids and coordinating groups within the molecule to ensure that no valid matches are missed.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Test the Code with Known Positive Cases**  
  Manually test the code with SMILES strings of molecules known to match Rule 1 (e.g., glutamic acid and aspartic acid) to verify that the code correctly identifies them. If the code fails to match these known cases, debug the specific reasons why the matches are not occurring.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Adjust the Carboxylic Acid Pattern for Zwitterions**  
  Amino acids like glutamic acid and aspartic acid can exist as zwitterions, where the amino group is protonated and the carboxyl group is deprotonated. Update the carboxylic acid patterns to include carboxylate anions `[CX3](=O)[O-]` in addition to the protonated form to capture these cases.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Simplify the Exclude Patterns**  
  If the goal is to exclude molecules that are entirely aromatic, but not molecules with both aliphatic and aromatic portions, consider refining the exclude patterns. For example, use a pattern that excludes molecules where the carboxylic acid is directly attached to an aromatic ring, such as `[CX3](=O)[OX1H1][a]`.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Refactor the Code for Clarity and Debugging**  
  Rewrite the code for Rule 1 in smaller, testable functions. This can help isolate issues and make the code easier to debug. For example, create separate functions to find carboxylic acid groups, find coordinating groups, calculate chain lengths, and apply exclude patterns.

- **Suggestion 11**: **Include Stereochemistry in Matching**  
  Some SMILES strings may contain stereochemical information that affects matching. Ensure that the SMARTS patterns account for stereochemistry where relevant, or use the `Chem.MolFromSmiles(smi, sanitize=False)` option to avoid unintended sanitization errors.

- **Suggestion 12**: **Check for RDKit Version Compatibility**  
  Ensure that the RDKit functions and SMARTS patterns used are compatible with the version of RDKit installed. Some functions or features may differ between versions, leading to unexpected behavior.

- **Suggestion 13**: **Provide Detailed Logging of Matches**  
  Modify the code to print or log detailed information about which patterns are matched for each molecule. This can help identify where the matching process fails and provide insights into necessary corrections.

- **Suggestion 14**: **Update the Coordination Group Patterns to Be More Inclusive**  
  The current patterns may miss secondary or tertiary amines, which can also act as coordinating groups. Consider broadening the amino group pattern to include `[NX3][#6]` to capture all amines connected to carbon.

- **Suggestion 15**: **Account for Molecules with Multiple Carboxylic Acids**  
  Molecules like glutamic acid have more than one carboxylic acid group. Ensure that the code considers all carboxylic acid groups in the molecule when searching for coordinating groups within the specified chain length.

** End of Suggestions **
---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Quantify Functional Groups Numerically**  
  Convert qualitative descriptions of functional groups into quantitative numerical descriptors that can be directly calculated from the SMILES representation. For instance, instead of stating "Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups result in high yield," specify the exact count of hydroxyl groups and use this numerical value as a feature in your analysis.

- **Advice 2**: **Utilize Calculated Molecular Descriptors**  
  Employ cheminformatics tools (e.g., RDKit, ChemAxon) to calculate a set of molecular descriptors from the SMILES strings of the modifiers. Key descriptors may include:
  - **Hydrogen Bond Donors (HBD) and Acceptors (HBA)**
  - **Molecular Weight (MW)**
  - **LogP (Octanol-Water Partition Coefficient)**
  - **Topological Polar Surface Area (TPSA)**
  - **Number of Rotatable Bonds**
  - **Aromatic Ring Counts**
  Base your rules on these descriptors to create a numerical feature matrix that can be easily used for modeling and analysis.

- **Advice 3**: **Establish Numerical Thresholds for Descriptors**  
  Develop rules using numerical thresholds for descriptors to classify modifiers into high or low yield categories. For example:
  - **Modifiers with TPSA greater than 60 Å² result in high yield.**
  - **Modifiers with LogP less than 2.5 result in high yield.**
  - **Modifiers with more than two hydrogen bond donors result in high yield.**
  This approach simplifies the rules and makes them directly applicable for generating quantitative features.

- **Advice 4**: **Simplify Complex Structural Rules**  
  Streamline complex rules by focusing on specific, quantifiable features. Instead of intricate structural descriptions, emphasize measurable attributes such as:
  - **Counts of Specific Atoms (e.g., nitrogen, sulfur, oxygen)**
  - **Presence of Specific Functional Groups (e.g., carboxylic acid, amine, thiol)**
  - **Length of Carbon Chains**
  - **Degree of Branching**
  This simplification facilitates the translation of rules into numerical data.

- **Advice 5**: **Encode Functional Group Positions Numerically**  
  Assign numerical values based on the position of functional groups relative to key structural motifs. For example:
  - **Assign a value of 1 if a coordinating group is at the para position of an aromatic ring; 0 otherwise.**
  - **Record the distance (number of bonds) between functional groups and the carboxylic acid group.**
  This quantitative encoding allows for precise feature generation.

- **Advice 6**: **Incorporate Steric and Electronic Effects Numerically**  
  Quantify steric hindrance and electronic effects using numerical scales:
  - **Use Sterimol parameters or Van der Waals volumes to quantify steric bulk.**
  - **Apply Hammett sigma constants or Taft parameters to represent electronic effects of substituents.**
  Including these values in your feature matrix enhances the ability to model their impact on yield.

- **Advice 7**: **Use Binary Indicators for Key Structural Features**  
  Create binary (0 or 1) features to indicate the presence or absence of critical structural elements identified in the rules:
  - **Presence of coordinating heteroatoms (N, O, S) capable of metal coordination.**
  - **Occurrence of potential catalyst poisons (e.g., aldehydes, ketones, aromatic thiols).**
  - **Modifiers with chain lengths exceeding a certain number of carbons.**
  This binary encoding simplifies complex structural information into usable data.

- **Advice 8**: **Generate and Include Substructural Fingerprints**  
  Utilize molecular fingerprints (e.g., MACCS keys, ECFP) to represent substructural information numerically. Fingerprints translate the presence of various substructures into binary vectors, which can be included in your feature matrix.

- **Advice 9**: **Normalize Descriptors for Consistency**  
  Ensure that all numerical descriptors are normalized (e.g., scaled between 0 and 1) to maintain consistency and improve the performance of subsequent data analysis or machine learning models.

- **Advice 10**: **Reevaluate and Refine the Rules Based on Data Trends**  
  Analyze the calculated descriptors in relation to the yield data to identify new patterns or correlations. Use statistical methods or machine learning algorithms to uncover relationships that can inform the creation of more precise, data-driven rules.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing heteroatoms capable of metal coordination (e.g., amino, carboxyl, hydroxyl, indole rings) result in high yield; those with hydrophobic or non-coordinating side chains result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Side chains with heteroatoms can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalyst activity. Hydrophobic side chains lack these interactions, reducing effectiveness.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid, Entry 2)
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid, Entry 0)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan, Entry 15)
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine, Entry 13)
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 33)

2. **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromo) or coordinating groups (e.g., amino) result in high yield; those with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl) or non-coordinating groups result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing and coordinating groups enhance the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxylate, improving interaction with the catalyst. Electron-donating groups reduce these effects.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Entry 20)
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Entry 1)
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Entry 4)
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 22)
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19)

3. **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with coordinating functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, thiol) within four carbon atoms of the carboxyl group result in high yield; those where the functional group is further away result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Close proximity of coordinating groups to the carboxyl enhances effective chelation with the metal center. Distant groups reduce coordination efficiency.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (Entry 3)
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 17)
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Entry 31)
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Entry 34)

4. **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of coordination (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole rings) result in high yield; those substituted with bulky groups or additional aromatic rings result in low yield due to steric hindrance.**
   - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatics can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalyst activity. Bulky substituents hinder this interaction.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid, Entry 21)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 16)
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 8)
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 12)

5. **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with thiol groups in short aliphatic chains (up to four carbons) result in high yield; those with thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**
   - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols coordinate effectively without strongly deactivating the catalyst. Aromatic thiols may bind too tightly, inhibiting catalysis.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 17)
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Entry 10)

6. **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group result in high yield; those with hydroxyl groups further from the carboxyl or with protective groups result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Adjacent hydroxyl groups increase coordination sites and solubility, enhancing catalyst interaction. Distant hydroxyls or protected hydroxyls are less effective.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid, Entry 9)
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Entry 29)
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 33)

7. **Rule 7**: **Modifiers featuring ether linkages in aliphatic chains result in low yield due to increased flexibility and reduced ability to coordinate effectively with the catalyst.**
   - *Rationale*: Ether linkages introduce flexibility, preventing proper alignment and reducing coordination efficiency.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 11)
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32)

8. **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing bulky aromatic systems or multiple fused rings (e.g., biphenyls, indole) result in high yield if the functional groups allow coordination and steric hindrance is minimal; excessive bulk without coordinating benefits results in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Bulky systems can participate effectively if they enhance coordination. Without coordinating functionality, steric hindrance dominates, reducing yield.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan, Entry 15)
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 12)
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine, Entry 13)

9. **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the aromatic ring or coordination site result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation or side reactions.**
   - *Rationale*: Aldehydes and ketones can bind irreversibly to the metal center or participate in unwanted reactions, inhibiting catalysis.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19)
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 18)
     - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Entry 27)

10. **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl chains or strongly electron-withdrawing groups that significantly reduce electron density at coordinating sites result in low yield.**
    - *Rationale*: Strong electron-withdrawing groups diminish the ability of coordinating atoms to donate electron density to the metal center, weakening coordination.
    - *Low Yield Examples*:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Entry 14)
      - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** (Entry 28)

11. **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups result in high yield up to a chain length of eight carbons; longer chains or those lacking coordinating groups result in low yield due to decreased solubility and coordination.**
    - *Rationale*: Medium-chain aliphatic acids maintain solubility and can interact with the catalyst. Longer chains become too hydrophobic, reducing effectiveness.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - **Octanoic acid** (Entry 5)
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - **No longer-chain acids present in the dataset for direct comparison**

12. **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic rings connected via short aliphatic chains (three carbons or fewer) result in low yield due to suboptimal positioning for coordination; increasing the chain length to four or five carbons results in high yield by optimizing spatial arrangement.**
    - *Rationale*: Optimal chain length allows coordinating groups to interact effectively with the catalyst without steric hindrance.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Entry 7)
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30)

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been carefully developed to capture the relationships between molecular modifiers' structural features and their impact on the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. The focus has been on:

- **Direct Combinations of Functional Groups**: Each rule examines how specific functional groups and their positions within the molecule influence the yield, often combining multiple features.

- **Underlying Physicochemical Properties**: Consideration of electronic effects, steric hindrance, coordination ability, and solubility that affect catalyst interaction and reaction efficiency.

- **Clear Predictions**: Each rule provides a definitive outcome (high or low yield) for any modifier that fits its description, facilitating straightforward application.

- **Maximizing Dataset Coverage**: The rules are designed to apply to as many entries in the dataset as possible, ensuring broad applicability and practicality.

- **Balanced Complexity**: A mix of general rules with wider coverage and more specific rules that address particular cases or exceptions, achieving a suitable balance.

By applying these rules, researchers can predict the effectiveness of existing modifiers and guide the design of new ones to optimize and control the yield of the target reaction. These insights are grounded in chemical principles and the observed data, making them reliable tools for advancing the research program.

Rule Commenter Message:
**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**:
  - **Rule 1**: The rule is clear, allowing for a straightforward determination of high or low yield based on the presence of coordinating heteroatoms in the amino acid side chains. The property insight is strong, effectively linking the coordination ability of heteroatoms to enhanced catalyst activity. It considers combinations of substructures (amino acid backbone and side chain functionalities), demonstrating appropriate complexity. The rule is well-supported by multiple data points, including both high and low yield examples, ensuring good coverage. The balance between complexity and coverage is excellent, making this rule reliable and practical.

- **Comment 2**:
  - **Rule 2**: This rule is clear and specific, focusing on para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids and the electronic nature of the substituents. The property insight is sound, correlating electron-withdrawing groups with increased coordination ability and catalyst interaction. The rule incorporates combinations of substructures, adding appropriate complexity. It is backed by several data points for both high and low yields, providing strong coverage. The balance between complexity and coverage is well-maintained, enhancing the rule’s applicability.

- **Comment 3**:
  - **Rule 3**: The rule clearly distinguishes modifiers based on the proximity of coordinating functional groups to the carboxyl group in aliphatic acids. The property insight is adequate, emphasizing the importance of spatial arrangement for effective chelation. It considers combinations of substructures, contributing to its complexity. There are sufficient data points supporting both high and low yield outcomes, offering good coverage. The rule strikes a good balance between complexity and coverage, making it a valuable guideline.

- **Comment 4**:
  - **Rule 4**: This rule is clear in identifying high yield modifiers as heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating nitrogen atoms, and low yield modifiers as those with bulky substitutions causing steric hindrance. The property insight is solid, addressing both electronic factors and steric effects. It considers combinations of substructures, providing necessary complexity. Multiple data points support the rule, ensuring adequate coverage. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate, enhancing its reliability.

- **Comment 5**:
  - **Rule 5**: The rule is clear, differentiating between aliphatic thiols and aromatic thiols in modifiers. The property insight is acceptable, explaining how aromatic thiols may poison the catalyst. It involves combinations of substructures, adding complexity. However, coverage is limited, with only one high yield and one low yield example, which weakens the rule's robustness. The balance between complexity and coverage could be improved with more supporting data points.

- **Comment 6**:
  - **Rule 6**: While the rule is specific and clear about the effect of multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups, the coverage is limited. The property insight is reasonable, relating increased coordination sites to higher yields. It considers combinations of substructures for complexity. However, with only one high yield and two low yield examples, the rule's applicability is somewhat restricted. The balance between complexity and coverage is not optimal due to limited data support.

- **Comment 7**:
  - **Rule 7**: The rule is clear in stating that ether linkages in aliphatic chains lead to low yield due to reduced coordination efficiency. The property insight is acceptable. It considers combinations of substructures, adding necessary complexity. Coverage is limited to two low yield examples without contrasting high yield counterparts, which may limit the rule's generality. The balance between complexity and coverage could be strengthened with more data.

- **Comment 8**:
  - **Comment**:
    - **Rule 8**: The rule addresses modifiers with bulky aromatic systems, but clarity is somewhat reduced due to complexity in assessing steric hindrance and coordination. The property insight is acceptable but could benefit from more detail on how bulkiness and coordinating groups interact. The rule considers complex substructures, but coverage is limited to one high yield and two low yield examples. The balance between complexity and coverage could be improved by refining the rule or including additional data points.

- **Comment 9**:
  - **Rule 9**: This rule is clear, indicating that modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to coordination sites result in low yield. The property insight is solid, discussing catalyst deactivation or side reactions. It considers combinations of substructures, reflecting appropriate complexity. Coverage includes multiple low yield examples, though additional high yield examples for comparison would strengthen it. The balance between complexity and coverage is acceptable.

- **Comment 10**:
  - **Rule 10**: The rule is clear and concise, specifying that strong electron-withdrawing groups reduce yield. The property insight is reasonable, linking reduced electron density at coordinating sites to weaker coordination. It involves combinations of substructures. Coverage is limited to two low yield examples, which may weaken its general applicability. The balance between complexity and coverage is modest and could be enhanced with more data.

- **Comment 11**:
  - **Rule 11**: The rule is clear but lacks sufficient supporting data, particularly for low yield predictions with longer-chain acids. The property insight is acceptable, relating chain length to solubility and coordination. Complexity is minimal, focusing on simple structures. Coverage is weak due to limited data points, which affects the balance between complexity and coverage. Additional data would improve the rule's reliability.

- **Comment 12**:
  - **Rule 12**: The rule is moderately clear but involves complexity in evaluating chain lengths and spatial arrangements. The property insight is acceptable but may benefit from further explanation. It considers combinations of substructures, adding complexity. However, with only one high yield and one low yield example, coverage is limited. The balance between complexity and coverage could be improved with more supporting data.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing heteroatoms capable of metal coordination (e.g., amino, carboxyl, hydroxyl, indole rings) result in high yield; those with hydrophobic or non-coordinating side chains result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Side chains with heteroatoms can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalyst activity. Hydrophobic side chains lack these interactions, reducing effectiveness.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid, Entry 2)
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid, Entry 0)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan, Entry 15)
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine, Entry 13)
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 33)

2. **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromo) or coordinating groups (e.g., amino) result in high yield; those with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl) or non-coordinating groups result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing and coordinating groups enhance the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxylate, improving interaction with the catalyst. Electron-donating groups reduce these effects.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Entry 20)
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Entry 1)
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Entry 4)
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 22)
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19)

3. **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with coordinating functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, thiol) within four carbon atoms of the carboxyl group result in high yield; those where the functional group is further away result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Close proximity of coordinating groups to the carboxyl enhances effective chelation with the metal center. Distant groups reduce coordination efficiency.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (Entry 3)
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 17)
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Entry 31)
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Entry 34)

4. **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of coordination (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole rings) result in high yield; those substituted with bulky groups or additional aromatic rings result in low yield due to steric hindrance.**
   - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatics can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalyst activity. Bulky substituents hinder this interaction.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid, Entry 21)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 16)
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 8)
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 12)

5. **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with thiol groups in short aliphatic chains (up to four carbons) result in high yield; those with thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**
   - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols coordinate effectively without strongly deactivating the catalyst. Aromatic thiols may bind too tightly, inhibiting catalysis.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 17)
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Entry 10)

6. **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group result in high yield; those with hydroxyl groups further from the carboxyl or with protective groups result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Adjacent hydroxyl groups increase coordination sites and solubility, enhancing catalyst interaction. Distant hydroxyls or protected hydroxyls are less effective.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid, Entry 9)
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Entry 29)
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 33)

7. **Rule 7**: **Modifiers featuring ether linkages in aliphatic chains result in low yield due to increased flexibility and reduced ability to coordinate effectively with the catalyst.**
   - *Rationale*: Ether linkages introduce flexibility, preventing proper alignment and reducing coordination efficiency.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 11)
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32)

8. **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing bulky aromatic systems or multiple fused rings (e.g., biphenyls, indole) result in high yield if the functional groups allow coordination and steric hindrance is minimal; excessive bulk without coordinating benefits results in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Bulky systems can participate effectively if they enhance coordination. Without coordinating functionality, steric hindrance dominates, reducing yield.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan, Entry 15)
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 12)
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine, Entry 13)

9. **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the aromatic ring or coordination site result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation or side reactions.**
   - *Rationale*: Aldehydes and ketones can bind irreversibly to the metal center or participate in unwanted reactions, inhibiting catalysis.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19)
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 18)
     - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Entry 27)

10. **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl chains or strongly electron-withdrawing groups that significantly reduce electron density at coordinating sites result in low yield.**
    - *Rationale*: Strong electron-withdrawing groups diminish the ability of coordinating atoms to donate electron density to the metal center, weakening coordination.
    - *Low Yield Examples*:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Entry 14)
      - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** (Entry 28)

11. **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups result in high yield up to a chain length of eight carbons; longer chains or those lacking coordinating groups result in low yield due to decreased solubility and coordination.**
    - *Rationale*: Medium-chain aliphatic acids maintain solubility and can interact with the catalyst. Longer chains become too hydrophobic, reducing effectiveness.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - **Octanoic acid** (Entry 5)
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - **No longer-chain acids present in the dataset for direct comparison**

12. **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic rings connected via short aliphatic chains (three carbons or fewer) result in low yield due to suboptimal positioning for coordination; increasing the chain length to four or five carbons results in high yield by optimizing spatial arrangement.**
    - *Rationale*: Optimal chain length allows coordinating groups to interact effectively with the catalyst without steric hindrance.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Entry 7)
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30)

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been carefully developed to capture the relationships between molecular modifiers' structural features and their impact on the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. The focus has been on:

- **Direct Combinations of Functional Groups**: Each rule examines how specific functional groups and their positions within the molecule influence the yield, often combining multiple features.

- **Underlying Physicochemical Properties**: Consideration of electronic effects, steric hindrance, coordination ability, and solubility that affect catalyst interaction and reaction efficiency.

- **Clear Predictions**: Each rule provides a definitive outcome (high or low yield) for any modifier that fits its description, facilitating straightforward application.

- **Maximizing Dataset Coverage**: The rules are designed to apply to as many entries in the dataset as possible, ensuring broad applicability and practicality.

- **Balanced Complexity**: A mix of general rules with wider coverage and more specific rules that address particular cases or exceptions, achieving a suitable balance.

By applying these rules, researchers can predict the effectiveness of existing modifiers and guide the design of new ones to optimize and control the yield of the target reaction. These insights are grounded in chemical principles and the observed data, making them reliable tools for advancing the research program.---------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- ** Suggestion 1 **: **Review and Correct SMARTS Patterns for Rule 3**

  The SMARTS patterns for Rule 3 may be too general and are matching aromatic compounds instead of only aliphatic carboxylic acids. For instance, Entry 0 (phthalic anhydride) is incorrectly assigned a `1` for Rule 3, even though it's an aromatic compound. To fix this, modify the SMARTS patterns to explicitly match only aliphatic carbons and exclude aromatic systems. Use `[CX4]` (sp³ hybridized carbon) in place of `[C]` and exclude aromatic carbons with `[!c]`.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: **Refine SMARTS Pattern for Ether Linkages in Rule 7**

  The SMARTS pattern for ether linkages (`[#6][OX2][#6]`) in Rule 7 may be incorrectly matching other functional groups like anhydrides or esters, leading to false positives, such as the `-1` assigned to Entry 0. Refine the SMARTS pattern to specifically target ethers in aliphatic chains, perhaps by ensuring that the carbons are aliphatic and not part of carbonyls or aromatics. You might use `[!R][CX4][OX2][CX4][!R]` to exclude rings and ensure the carbons are sp³ hybridized.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: **Exclude Aromatic Compounds in Aliphatic-Specific Rules**

  For rules intended only for aliphatic compounds (like Rule 3 and Rule 7), explicitly exclude aromatic systems in your SMARTS patterns. Incorporate conditions like `[!c]` to avoid matching aromatic carbons. For example, in Rule 3, ensure that the chain is fully aliphatic by using `[C;!c]` or `[A;!a]` for aliphatic atoms.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: **Specify Chain Lengths and Functional Group Positions Accurately**

  In rules where the position of functional groups relative to each other is critical (such as Rule 3), make sure the SMARTS patterns accurately reflect this. For instance, to match coordinating groups within four carbon atoms of the carboxyl group, you can define patterns that specify the exact chain length, like `[*][C][C][C][C][NX3H2]` for an amino group four carbons away from another group.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: **Test and Validate Each SMARTS Pattern Independently**

  Before integrating the SMARTS patterns into the code, test each one individually on representative molecules to confirm they match the intended structures and exclude others. This can help identify mismatches early and refine the patterns accordingly.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: **Use Recursive SMARTS for Complex Patterns**

  For complicated structures where context matters (e.g., ensuring a functional group is on an aliphatic chain and not part of a ring), consider using recursive SMARTS patterns. This allows you to build more precise queries that can include or exclude specific substructures based on the molecule's context.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: **Differentiate Between Aliphatic and Aromatic Atoms**

  Utilize the 'aliphatic' atom symbol `A` in SMARTS patterns to ensure that only aliphatic atoms are matched when required. For example, `[A;!a]` matches any aliphatic atom that is not aromatic. This can prevent unintended matches with aromatic systems.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: **Correct Implementation of Count Thresholds in Rule 6**

  In Rule 6, the `count_threshold` for hydroxyl groups might not be correctly associated with their patterns. Ensure that the count thresholds are linked to the precise SMARTS patterns and that the code correctly counts the occurrences of these patterns. Use a dictionary or mapping that correlates the pattern strings with their thresholds.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: **Ensure Alternative Predictions Are Correctly Assigned**

  When alternative patterns and predictions are specified in a rule, verify that the code correctly assigns the `alternative_prediction` when these alternative patterns match. The current logic may not be properly handling cases where the main patterns do not match but the alternative patterns do.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: **Review the Control Flow in Matching Logic**

  Assess the loops and control statements in the code that handle pattern matching. There might be issues where the code continues to check further patterns or incorrectly assigns values after a match is found. Implement proper `break` or `continue` statements to exit loops as necessary once a match is determined, preventing overwriting or misassignment of feature values.

Metric Commenter Message:
**Analysis of Current Rules Based on Metrics**

**1. Comparison with Reference Metrics**

To evaluate the performance of the current rules, we'll compare the latest metrics to the reference metrics provided from previous iterations, focusing on **confidence** and **lift**, which are critical for assessing rule effectiveness.

---

**Train Support**:

- **Current**: **7.86%** (0.0786)
- **Previous**: 16.67% (0.1667), 18.45% (0.1845)

*Observation*: The current train support has decreased significantly compared to previous iterations. This indicates that the current set of rules covers a smaller portion of the training data.

---

**Train Confidence**:

- **Current**: **61.75%** (0.6175)
- **Previous**: 63.52% (0.6352), 53.96% (0.5396)

*Observation*: The current train confidence is slightly lower than the highest previous confidence but higher than the second value. This suggests that when the rules apply, they correctly predict the outcome approximately 61.75% of the time, which is comparable to earlier performance.

---

**Train Lift**:

- **Current**: **1.236** (1.2362)
- **Previous**: 1.205 (1.2048), 1.056 (1.0559)

*Observation*: The current train lift has improved compared to previous iterations. A lift greater than 1 indicates that the rules are effective at predicting the outcome better than random chance. The increase to 1.236 suggests enhanced effectiveness in identifying high-yield cases.

---

**Train Leverage**:

- **Current**: **0.0075**
- **Previous**: 0.0289, -0.0041

*Observation*: The current train leverage is positive but lower than the highest previous leverage. A positive leverage indicates a stronger association between the rule conditions and the prediction than expected by chance. The decrease suggests a modest association strength.

---

**2. Performance Interpretation**

- **Confidence**: The current confidence level is consistent with prior iterations, indicating stable accuracy when the rules are applied.
  
- **Lift**: The increase in lift demonstrates that the current rules have improved in identifying cases where the high-yield outcome occurs, relative to random chance. This reflects enhanced rule quality.
  
- **Support**: The significant reduction in train support implies that the current rules are applicable to a smaller subset of the data. This may limit their overall impact despite higher lift and consistent confidence.
  
- **Leverage**: The slight decrease suggests that while the rules are still useful, their overall contribution to improving predictions over chance has diminished compared to earlier iterations.

---

**3. Assessment of Iterations and Local Minimum**

Given the improvements in **lift** and consistent **confidence**, but decreased **support**, it appears that the rules have become more precise but at the cost of generality. The current rules are more effective for a narrower set of data points.

- **Local Minimum Consideration**: The incremental changes in metrics and the trade-off between precision and coverage suggest that the optimization process may be approaching a local minimum. Further iterations using the same approach may yield diminishing returns.
  
- **Iteration Sufficiency**: The pattern of metric changes across iterations indicates that the current methodology has been extensively applied. If no significant improvements are observed in recent iterations, it may be time to consider alternative strategies.

---

**4. Suggestions for Improving the Current Rules**

To enhance the performance of the rules, particularly in terms of support without sacrificing confidence and lift, consider the following approaches:

**a. Expand Rule Coverage**

- **Generalize Specific Rules**: Review rules that are highly specific and see if they can be broadened to cover more data points without significantly reducing confidence and lift.
  - *Example*: For Rule 5, which applies to "thiol groups in short aliphatic chains," consider whether it can be extended to include slightly longer chains if they do not adversely affect performance.

**b. Balance Between Specificity and Applicability**

- **Optimize Rule Complexity**: Analyze whether some rules are overly complex or restrictive. Simplifying conditions may increase support.
  - *Example*: Rule 12 distinguishes based on chain length between aromatic rings and coordinating groups. Evaluate if a broader range of chain lengths could be included.

**c. Integrate Additional Data Features**

- **Explore Other Molecular Descriptors**: Incorporate physicochemical properties such as pKa, logP (octanol-water partition coefficient), or molecular weight.
  - *Benefit*: These descriptors might capture trends not evident from functional groups alone.

**d. Address Underrepresented Cases**

- **Analyze Low Yield Exceptions**: Investigate modifiers that result in low yield but share features with high-yield examples. Understand factors contributing to their lower performance.
  - *Action*: Modify rules to account for these exceptions or create new rules that explain these outliers.

**e. Cross-Validation and Testing**

- **Evaluate Rules on Test Data**: Assess how the current rules perform on unseen test data to ensure they generalize well beyond the training set.
  - *Observation*: If test metrics significantly deviate from train metrics, overfitting may be occurring.

**f. Incorporate Domain Expertise**

- **Consult with Chemists**: Collaborate with experts to interpret ambiguous or conflicting data points.
  - *Benefit*: Domain knowledge can provide insights into unexpected results and suggest new rule directions.

**g. Utilize Machine Learning Techniques**

- **Pattern Recognition Algorithms**: Apply clustering or classification algorithms to identify patterns not immediately apparent.
  - *Note*: Machine learning models can complement rule-based approaches and highlight factors to include in rule refinement.

**h. Re-evaluate Rule Interactions**

- **Consider Rule Synergy**: Some rules may interact synergistically or antagonistically.
  - *Action*: Analyze combinations of rules to see if integrated rules perform better than individual ones.

---

**Conclusion**

The current set of rules demonstrates improved predictive power (as indicated by increased lift) but at the expense of reduced applicability (lower support). This trade-off suggests that while the rules are effective when they apply, they miss a significant portion of the data.

To address this:

- **Increase Support**: Work on broadening the rules to cover more data points, even if it means accepting a slight decrease in confidence or lift.

- **Prevent Overfitting**: Ensure that the rules are not overly tailored to the training data at the expense of generalizability.

- **Enhance Rules with Additional Insights**: Incorporate other molecular features and leverage domain expertise to refine the rules further.

Given the current metrics and the diminishing returns from recent iterations, it appears that a local minimum may have been reached. To break out of this, adopting new strategies as outlined above could lead to significant improvements in rule performance.

---

**Next Steps**

- **Implement the suggested improvements** and monitor how the metrics change, focusing on increasing support while maintaining reasonable confidence and lift.

- **Set Thresholds for Metrics**: Define acceptable ranges for support, confidence, and lift to guide rule development.

- **Continuous Iteration and Evaluation**: Regularly reassess the rules after each iteration to ensure progress towards the desired metrics.

By strategically refining the rules and expanding their applicability, it's possible to enhance the overall performance and utility of the rule set in predicting reaction yields.

**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

---

**1. Overview of Model Performance**

- **Current Validation Accuracy**: The latest 5-fold validation accuracy is **54.29%**.
- **Previous Reference Accuracy**: Previous validation accuracies were consistently around **76%**, with test accuracies around **75%**.
  
**Interpretation**: The current model's performance has decreased compared to previous iterations. This suggests that the current set of rules may not be capturing the underlying patterns in the data as effectively as before.

---

**2. Assessment of Overfitting and Underfitting**

- **Underfitting Indication**: The decrease in validation accuracy suggests that the model may be **underfitting** the data. This means it is not complex enough to capture the relationships between features and the target variable.
  
- **Potential Causes**:
  - The current rules may be too general or not sufficiently representative of the data.
  - There may be a lack of important features (missing rules) that capture critical variations.
  - The dataset may have changed, introducing new patterns not accounted for by the existing rules.

---

**3. Analysis of Discrepancies Using SHAP Values**

To identify which rules may be contributing to incorrect predictions, we analyzed the SHAP values associated with each molecule where the model's prediction did not match the experimental value.

**a. Cases Where Predicted Loading is Low but Experimental Loading is High (Underestimation)**

In these cases, rules with **high negative SHAP values** for high loading are likely problematic.

1. **Molecule**: C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N
   - **SHAP Values**:
     - Rule 3: **+0.03749**
     - Rule 4: **-0.01982**
     - Rule 10: **+0.03749**
     - Rule 12: **-0.01944**
   - **Problematic Rule(s)**: Rule 4 and Rule 12 (negative SHAP values).

2. **Molecule**: C1=CC(=CC=C1CBr)C(=O)O
   - **SHAP Values**:
     - Rule 3: **+0.03749**
     - Rule 4: **-0.01982**
     - Rule 10: **+0.03749**
     - Rule 12: **-0.01944**
   - **Problematic Rule(s)**: Rule 4 and Rule 12.

3. **Molecule**: C(CS)C(=O)O
   - **SHAP Values**:
     - Rule 3: **+0.03445**
     - Rule 4: **-0.02983**
     - Rule 10: **+0.01806**
     - Rule 12: **-0.03697**
   - **Problematic Rule(s)**: Rule 4 and Rule 12.

4. **Molecule**: C1=CC(=CN=C1)C(=O)O
   - **SHAP Values**:
     - Rule 3: **+0.03724**
     - Rule 4: **+0.12118**
     - Rule 10: **+0.03786**
     - Rule 12: **-0.02962**
   - **Problematic Rule(s)**: Rule 12 (negative SHAP value).

5. **Molecule**: C(CCN)CC(=O)O
   - **SHAP Values**:
     - Rule 3: **+0.01963**
     - Rule 4: **-0.05188**
     - Rule 10: **+0.03725**
     - Rule 12: **-0.03132**
   - **Problematic Rule(s)**: Rule 4 and Rule 12.

**Observation**: In multiple cases, **Rule 4 and Rule 12** have significant negative SHAP values contributing to the underestimation.

---

**b. Cases Where Predicted Loading is High but Experimental Loading is Low (Overestimation)**

In these cases, rules with **high positive SHAP values** for high loading are likely problematic.

1. **Molecule**: C1=CC(=CC=C1C2=CC=NC=C2)C(=O)O
   - **SHAP Values**:
     - Rule 3: **+0.01282**
     - Rule 4: **+0.48854**
     - Rule 10: **+0.01267**
     - Rule 12: **-0.01402**
   - **Problematic Rule**: **Rule 4** (high positive SHAP value).

2. **Molecule**: COCCOCCOCC(=O)O
   - **SHAP Values**:
     - Rule 3: **-0.38668**
     - Rule 4: **-0.08763**
     - Rule 10: **+0.00832**
     - Rule 12: **-0.03401**
   - **Problematic Rule**: No significant positive SHAP values; potential misprediction due to Rule 10.

**Observation**: **Rule 4** contributes a high positive SHAP value in at least one case where the predicted loading is high but the experimental loading is low.

---

**4. Interpretation of Accuracy Metrics**

- The decrease in accuracy suggests the current rules may not be effectively capturing the determinants of modifier loading.
  
- The iterative refinement does not appear to have reached a local minimum, indicating further adjustments are necessary.

---

**Insights Drawn from SHAP Analysis**

- **Rule 4** is frequently associated with both negative and positive SHAP values contributing to mispredictions.
  
- **Rule 12** consistently shows negative SHAP values in cases of underestimation.
  
- The presence of positive SHAP values from **Rule 10** in overestimations suggests it may need adjustment, although its impact appears less significant compared to Rule 4.

---

**Recommendations for Improvement**

---

**1. Refine Rule 4**

**Current Rule 4**: Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of coordination (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole rings) result in high yield; those substituted with bulky groups or additional aromatic rings result in low yield due to steric hindrance.

**Issues Identified**:

- The rule may be too broad, not accounting for subtle differences in steric effects and electronic properties of substituents.
- Positive SHAP values in overestimations and negative SHAP values in underestimations suggest inconsistent performance.

**Suggestions**:

- **Introduce Sub-Categories**: Differentiate between heteroaromatic carboxylic acids based on the position and nature of substituents.
  - **Rule 4a**: Unsubstituted pyridine carboxylic acids (e.g., nicotinic acid) result in high yield.
  - **Rule 4b**: Pyridine carboxylic acids substituted with electron-withdrawing groups in the ortho or para positions result in low yield due to increased acidity and potential deactivation.
- **Incorporate Steric Parameters**: Quantify steric hindrance using computational methods (e.g., Sterimol parameters) and adjust the rule based on a threshold.
- **Consider Electronic Effects**: Include the impact of substituents on the heteroaromatic ring's electron density, possibly using Hammett sigma constants.

---

**2. Adjust Rule 12**

**Current Rule 12**: Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic rings connected via short aliphatic chains (three carbons or fewer) result in low yield due to suboptimal positioning for coordination; increasing the chain length to four or five carbons results in high yield by optimizing spatial arrangement.

**Issues Identified**:

- Negative SHAP values in underestimations indicate the rule may be overly penalizing certain modifiers.
- The chain length cutoff may be too rigid, not accounting for functional groups that enhance coordination despite shorter chains.

**Suggestions**:

- **Revise Chain Length Criteria**: Modify the chain length threshold to consider effective coordination rather than a fixed number.
  - Allow exceptions for modifiers with additional coordinating groups that compensate for shorter chains.
- **Incorporate Flexibility Considerations**: Account for the conformational flexibility of the aliphatic chain and its ability to position the aromatic ring appropriately.
- **Add Functional Group Interactions**: Consider cases where electron-rich aromatic rings have ortho or para substituents that could participate in coordination, modifying their impact on yield.

---

**3. Re-evaluate Rule 10**

**Current Rule 10**: Modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl chains or strongly electron-withdrawing groups that significantly reduce electron density at coordinating sites result in low yield.

**Issues Identified**:

- In at least one case, Rule 10 contributed a positive SHAP value in an overestimation, suggesting it may need refinement.

**Suggestions**:

- **Specify the Strength of Electron-Withdrawing Effects**: Quantify the electron-withdrawing capacity (e.g., via Hammett sigma constants) and set thresholds.
- **Consider Synergistic Effects**: Evaluate how multiple electron-withdrawing groups on a modifier collectively influence coordination ability.

---

**4. Enhance Generalization of Rules**

- **Introduce New Rules**: Identify missing patterns in the data that are not captured by existing rules.
  - For example, consider modifiers with secondary interactions (hydrogen bonding) that may influence loading.
- **Use Statistical Analysis**: Employ data-driven methods to discover new relationships, supplementing expert knowledge.
- **Iterative Testing**: Apply the refined rules to the dataset and assess performance improvements, adjusting as necessary.

---

**5. Address Underfitting**

- **Expand Feature Set**: Incorporate additional molecular descriptors, such as:
  - Topological indices.
  - Quantum chemical parameters (e.g., HOMO-LUMO gap, dipole moment).
- **Model Complexity**: Consider using a more complex model if the current classification model is too simplistic.
- **Increase Training Data**: If possible, add more data points to the training set to enhance the model's ability to learn complex patterns.

---

**6. Utilize SHAP Analysis for Continuous Improvement**

- **Monitor SHAP Values after Adjustments**: After modifying rules, re-run SHAP analysis to observe changes in feature contributions.
- **Focus on Consistency**: Aim for SHAP values that consistently support correct predictions.
- **Document Iterations**: Keep detailed records of changes made and their impact on model performance for future reference.

---

**Conclusion**

The current set of rules requires refinement to improve the model's predictive accuracy. By focusing on modifying **Rule 4** and **Rule 12**, addressing potential issues in **Rule 10**, and enhancing the generalization and complexity of the model, we can better capture the nuanced relationships between molecular structure and catalyst loading. Iterative testing and careful analysis using SHAP values will guide these improvements, ultimately leading to a more effective and reliable predictive model.

**Summary and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules:**

The current set of rules for predicting the yield of the remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction has seen a decrease in performance metrics compared to previous iterations. Specifically, the validation accuracy has dropped, and the training support has decreased, indicating that the rules are applicable to a smaller portion of the data. While the lift has improved, suggesting better precision when the rules are applicable, the overall predictive power of the model has diminished.

**Key Issues Identified:**

1. **Incorrect SMARTS Pattern Matching:**
   - Some SMARTS patterns in the rules are too general, leading to misclassification of molecules. For example, aromatic compounds are incorrectly matched in rules intended for aliphatic compounds.
   - Ether linkage patterns are matching esters or anhydrides, causing false positives.

2. **Underperformance of Certain Rules:**
   - SHAP analysis indicates that Rule 4 (heteroaromatic carboxylic acids) and Rule 12 (chain length between aromatic rings and coordinating groups) are contributing to inaccurate predictions.
   - Rule 4 shows inconsistent contributions, sometimes leading to both underestimation and overestimation of yields.
   - Rule 12 may have too rigid a chain length criterion, ignoring other factors that influence coordination and yield.

3. **Overfitting and Underfitting Concerns:**
   - The model may be underfitting, not capturing complex relationships due to oversimplified or incorrect rules.
   - There's a trade-off between rule specificity and applicability, leading to reduced support and coverage of the dataset.

**Suggestions to Improve Current Rules:**

1. **Refine SMARTS Patterns in Rules:**
   - **Rule 3 (Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids):** Modify SMARTS patterns to exclude aromatic systems explicitly. Use `[CX4]` for sp³ hybridized carbons and `[!c]` to prevent matching aromatic carbons.
   - **Rule 7 (Ether Linkages):** Adjust patterns to specifically target ethers in aliphatic chains. Ensure the carbons are aliphatic and not part of carbonyls or aromatic systems. Use `[!R][CX4][OX2][CX4][!R]` to exclude rings and confirm sp³ carbons.

2. **Reevaluate and Refine Underperforming Rules:**
   - **Rule 4:** Differentiate between various heteroaromatic carboxylic acids by considering substituent effects, steric hindrance, and electronic properties. Introduce sub-rules that account for the position and nature of substituents.
   - **Rule 12:** Reassess the chain length criterion by considering the flexibility of aliphatic chains and the presence of additional coordinating functional groups. Allow exceptions for molecules where shorter chains are compensated by other favorable interactions.

3. **Exclude Aromatic Compounds in Aliphatic-Specific Rules:**
   - For rules intended for aliphatic compounds, explicitly exclude aromatic systems in the SMARTS patterns to prevent misclassification.

4. **Specify Functional Group Positions Accurately:**
   - Ensure that the positions of functional groups relative to each other are accurately captured in the SMARTS patterns. For example, specify exact chain lengths between functional groups when necessary.

5. **Test and Validate SMARTS Patterns Independently:**
   - Before integrating patterns into the model, individually test each SMARTS pattern on representative molecules to confirm accurate matching and exclusion.

6. **Use Recursive SMARTS for Complex Patterns:**
   - Employ recursive SMARTS patterns to build precise queries that consider the molecular context, such as ensuring a functional group is on an aliphatic chain and not part of a ring.

7. **Enhance Generalization of Rules:**
   - Balance rule specificity with applicability to increase the support without significantly sacrificing confidence or lift.
   - Consider introducing new rules to cover patterns not currently captured, possibly identified through data-driven methods or domain expertise.

8. **Incorporate Additional Molecular Descriptors:**
   - Integrate other physicochemical properties (e.g., pKa, logP, molecular weight) that might influence yield to capture trends not evident from functional groups alone.

9. **Iterative Testing and Refinement:**
   - Continuously assess the impact of rule modifications on performance metrics, using SHAP analysis to guide further refinements.

10. **Consult Domain Experts:**
    - Engage with chemists to interpret ambiguous or conflicting data points, providing insights into unexpected results and suggesting new rule directions.

**Possibility for Further Optimization:**

Yes, there is potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. The misclassifications and performance issues identified can be addressed by refining the SMARTS patterns, reworking underperforming rules, and incorporating additional molecular features. By improving the specificity and accuracy of the patterns, the model's performance can be enhanced while maintaining generalizability.

    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing heteroatoms capable of metal coordination (e.g., amino, carboxyl, hydroxyl, indole rings) result in high yield; those with hydrophobic or non-coordinating side chains result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Side chains with heteroatoms can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalyst activity. Hydrophobic side chains lack these interactions, reducing effectiveness.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid, Entry 2)
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid, Entry 0)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan, Entry 15)
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine, Entry 13)
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 33)

2. **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromo) or coordinating groups (e.g., amino) result in high yield; those with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl) or non-coordinating groups result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing and coordinating groups enhance the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxylate, improving interaction with the catalyst. Electron-donating groups reduce these effects.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Entry 20)
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Entry 1)
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Entry 4)
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 22)
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19)

3. **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with coordinating functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl, thiol) within four carbon atoms of the carboxyl group result in high yield; those where the functional group is further away result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Close proximity of coordinating groups to the carboxyl enhances effective chelation with the metal center. Distant groups reduce coordination efficiency.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (Entry 3)
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 17)
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Entry 31)
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Entry 34)

4. **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of coordination (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole rings) result in high yield; those substituted with bulky groups or additional aromatic rings result in low yield due to steric hindrance.**
   - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatics can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalyst activity. Bulky substituents hinder this interaction.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid, Entry 21)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 16)
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 8)
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 12)

5. **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with thiol groups in short aliphatic chains (up to four carbons) result in high yield; those with thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings result in low yield due to potential catalyst poisoning.**
   - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols coordinate effectively without strongly deactivating the catalyst. Aromatic thiols may bind too tightly, inhibiting catalysis.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 17)
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Entry 10)

6. **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group result in high yield; those with hydroxyl groups further from the carboxyl or with protective groups result in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Adjacent hydroxyl groups increase coordination sites and solubility, enhancing catalyst interaction. Distant hydroxyls or protected hydroxyls are less effective.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid, Entry 9)
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Entry 29)
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 33)

7. **Rule 7**: **Modifiers featuring ether linkages in aliphatic chains result in low yield due to increased flexibility and reduced ability to coordinate effectively with the catalyst.**
   - *Rationale*: Ether linkages introduce flexibility, preventing proper alignment and reducing coordination efficiency.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 11)
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32)

8. **Rule 8**: **Modifiers containing bulky aromatic systems or multiple fused rings (e.g., biphenyls, indole) result in high yield if the functional groups allow coordination and steric hindrance is minimal; excessive bulk without coordinating benefits results in low yield.**
   - *Rationale*: Bulky systems can participate effectively if they enhance coordination. Without coordinating functionality, steric hindrance dominates, reducing yield.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan, Entry 15)
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 12)
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine, Entry 13)

9. **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the aromatic ring or coordination site result in low yield due to potential catalyst deactivation or side reactions.**
   - *Rationale*: Aldehydes and ketones can bind irreversibly to the metal center or participate in unwanted reactions, inhibiting catalysis.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19)
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 18)
     - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Entry 27)

10. **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing perfluoroalkyl chains or strongly electron-withdrawing groups that significantly reduce electron density at coordinating sites result in low yield.**
    - *Rationale*: Strong electron-withdrawing groups diminish the ability of coordinating atoms to donate electron density to the metal center, weakening coordination.
    - *Low Yield Examples*:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Entry 14)
      - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** (Entry 28)

11. **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups result in high yield up to a chain length of eight carbons; longer chains or those lacking coordinating groups result in low yield due to decreased solubility and coordination.**
    - *Rationale*: Medium-chain aliphatic acids maintain solubility and can interact with the catalyst. Longer chains become too hydrophobic, reducing effectiveness.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - **Octanoic acid** (Entry 5)
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - **No longer-chain acids present in the dataset for direct comparison**

12. **Rule 12**: **Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic rings connected via short aliphatic chains (three carbons or fewer) result in low yield due to suboptimal positioning for coordination; increasing the chain length to four or five carbons results in high yield by optimizing spatial arrangement.**
    - *Rationale*: Optimal chain length allows coordinating groups to interact effectively with the catalyst without steric hindrance.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Entry 7)
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30)

- **Clear Predictions**: Each rule provides a definitive outcome (high or low yield) for any modifier that fits its description, facilitating straightforward application.

- **Maximizing Dataset Coverage**: The rules are designed to apply to as many entries in the dataset as possible, ensuring broad applicability and practicality.

- **Balanced Complexity**: A mix of general rules with wider coverage and more specific rules that address particular cases or exceptions, achieving a suitable balance.

By applying these rules, researchers can predict the effectiveness of existing modifiers and guide the design of new ones to optimize and control the yield of the target reaction. These insights are grounded in chemical principles and the observed data, making them reliable tools for advancing the research program.---------------------------------------------------------------

Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Refine SMARTS patterns in Rule 3 to exclude aromatic compounds.**
  - *Action*: Modify the SMARTS patterns in Rule 3 to ensure they match only aliphatic carboxylic acids. Use `[CX4]` to specify sp³-hybridized carbons and `[!c]` to exclude aromatic carbons. For example, adjust the pattern to `[*][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4](C(=O)[O-])` to match a five-carbon aliphatic chain ending with a carboxylate group, ensuring no aromatic carbons are included.
  - *Benefit*: This prevents aromatic compounds from being misclassified under this rule, increasing accuracy.

- **Advice 2**: **Adjust SMARTS patterns in Rule 7 to prevent matching esters or anhydrides when identifying ether linkages.**
  - *Action*: Revise the SMARTS patterns to specifically target ether linkages in aliphatic chains. For example, use `[CX4][OX2][CX4]` to match ethers between sp³ carbons and exclude patterns like `C(=O)O` found in esters. Adding `[!C(=O)]` before the oxygen atom can prevent matching ester linkages.
  - *Benefit*: This ensures only relevant ether-containing aliphatic chains are matched, reducing false positives.

- **Advice 3**: **Reevaluate and refine Rule 4 by introducing sub-rules for heteroaromatic carboxylic acids.**
  - *Action*: Differentiate between heteroaromatic carboxylic acids based on substituent effects, steric hindrance, and electronic properties. Create sub-rules for compounds with electron-donating versus electron-withdrawing groups, and for positions of substituents that affect coordination (e.g., ortho, meta, para positions).
  - *Benefit*: This allows for more accurate predictions by considering how different substituents influence the compound's ability to coordinate with the metal center.

- **Advice 4**: **Reassess Rule 12 to allow flexibility in chain length and consider additional coordinating groups.**
  - *Action*: Modify the rule to include modifiers with shorter chains if they possess additional functional groups that facilitate coordination. For example, accept three-carbon chains if they have strong coordinating groups like hydroxyl or amino groups.
  - *Benefit*: This increases the rule's applicability and accounts for compounds where favorable interactions compensate for shorter chain lengths.

- **Advice 5**: **Explicitly exclude aromatic compounds in aliphatic-specific rules using SMARTS patterns.**
  - *Action*: In rules like Rule 3 and Rule 6, include `[!c]` in SMARTS patterns to ensure that aromatic carbons are not matched. For example, use `[CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4]` to represent a four-carbon aliphatic chain, excluding aromatic carbons.
  - *Benefit*: Prevents misclassification of aromatic compounds as aliphatic, enhancing rule accuracy.

- **Advice 6**: **Specify functional group positions accurately in SMARTS patterns.**
  - *Action*: Use precise SMARTS syntax to define the exact number of atoms between functional groups. For example, to specify a coordinating group within four carbons of a carboxyl group, use patterns like `[CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4][C](=O)[O-]` for a four-carbon chain ending with a carboxylate.
  - *Benefit*: Ensures that only compounds meeting the specific structural requirements are matched, reducing errors.

- **Advice 7**: **Individually test and validate each SMARTS pattern before integration.**
  - *Action*: Apply each SMARTS pattern to a set of representative molecules to confirm correct matches and exclusions. Adjust patterns based on test results to correct any inaccuracies.
  - *Benefit*: Identifies and corrects issues with patterns early, improving overall model performance.

- **Advice 8**: **Use recursive SMARTS patterns for complex molecular features.**
  - *Action*: Employ recursive patterns to define substructures within the molecule. For instance, to ensure a functional group is on an aliphatic chain and not part of a ring, use recursive definitions like `[$([CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4])]` to match a four-carbon chain.
  - *Benefit*: Allows for more precise and context-sensitive matching, improving rule specificity.

- **Advice 9**: **Enhance generalization of rules by balancing specificity and applicability.**
  - *Action*: Review rules to find a balance between being too general (leading to false positives) and too specific (leading to low support). Adjust criteria to broaden applicability without compromising confidence.
  - *Benefit*: Increases the number of data entries the rules apply to while maintaining accuracy.

- **Advice 10**: **Incorporate additional molecular descriptors to capture missing trends.**
  - *Action*: Include descriptors like pKa, logP, and molecular weight in the analysis. Use these properties to refine rules or create new ones that account for factors influencing yield beyond functional groups.
  - *Benefit*: Provides a more holistic view of molecular properties affecting the reaction, enhancing predictive capability.

Rule Generator Message:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms (e.g., carboxyl, hydroxyl, indole rings) within three carbon atoms result in **high yield**; those with non-coordinating or hydrophobic side chains result in **low yield**.**
   - *Rationale*: Close proximity of coordinating groups enhances chelation with the metal center, boosting catalyst activity. Non-coordinating or hydrophobic side chains lack these interactions.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid, Entry 2)
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid, Entry 0)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan, Entry 15)

     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine, Entry 13)
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 33)

2. **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromo) or coordinating groups (e.g., amino) result in **high yield**; those with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy) or non-coordinating groups result in **low yield**.**
   - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing and coordinating groups increase the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxylate, improving interaction with the catalyst. Electron-donating groups decrease these effects.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Entry 20)
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Entry 1)
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Entry 4)
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 22)
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19)
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30)

3. **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with coordinating functional groups (e.g., amino, thiol) within three carbon atoms of the carboxyl group result in **high yield**; those where the functional group is further away result in **low yield**.**
   - *Rationale*: Close proximity of coordinating groups to the carboxyl enhances effective chelation with the metal center. Distant groups reduce coordination efficiency.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (Entry 3)
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 17)
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Entry 31)
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Entry 34)

4. **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of coordination (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole rings) result in **high yield**; those substituted with bulky groups or additional aromatic rings result in **low yield** due to steric hindrance.**
   - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatics can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalyst activity. Bulky substituents hinder this interaction.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid, Entry 21)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 16)
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 8)
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 12)

5. **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with thiol groups in short aliphatic chains (up to three carbons from the carboxyl group) result in **high yield**; thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings result in **low yield** due to potential catalyst poisoning.**
   - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols coordinate effectively without strongly deactivating the catalyst. Aromatic thiols may bind too tightly, inhibiting catalysis.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 17)
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Entry 10)

6. **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group result in **high yield**; those with hydroxyl groups further from the carboxyl or protected hydroxyl groups result in **low yield**.**
   - *Rationale*: Adjacent hydroxyl groups increase coordination sites and solubility, enhancing catalyst interaction. Distant or protected hydroxyls are less effective.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid, Entry 9)
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Entry 29)
     - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (Entry 25)

7. **Rule 7**: **Modifiers featuring ether linkages in aliphatic chains result in **low yield** due to increased flexibility and reduced ability to coordinate effectively with the catalyst.**
   - *Rationale*: Ether linkages introduce flexibility, preventing proper alignment and reducing coordination efficiency.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 11)
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32)

8. **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic rings connected via aliphatic chains longer than three carbons result in **high yield**; those with shorter chains result in **low yield** due to suboptimal positioning for coordination.**
   - *Rationale*: Optimal chain length allows coordinating groups to interact effectively with the catalyst without steric hindrance.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Entry 7)
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30)

9. **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., perfluoroalkyl chains, trifluoromethyl groups) attached to coordinating atoms result in **low yield** due to reduced electron density and coordination ability.**
   - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups lower electron density at coordinating sites, weakening interactions with the metal center.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Entry 14)
     - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** (Entry 28)

10. **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups result in **high yield** up to a chain length of eight carbons; longer chains or increased hydrophobicity result in **low yield** due to decreased solubility and coordination.**
    - *Rationale*: Medium-chain aliphatic acids maintain solubility and can interact with the catalyst. Longer chains become too hydrophobic, reducing effectiveness.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - **Octanoic acid** (Entry 5)
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - **No longer-chain acids present in the dataset for direct comparison**

11. **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the aromatic ring or coordination site result in **low yield** due to potential catalyst deactivation or side reactions.**
    - *Rationale*: Aldehydes and ketones can bind irreversibly to the metal center or participate in unwanted reactions, inhibiting catalysis.
    - *Low Yield Examples*:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19)
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 18)
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Entry 27)

12. **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing bulky aromatic systems or multiple fused rings result in **high yield** if the functional groups allow coordination and steric hindrance is minimal; excessive bulk without coordinating benefits results in **low yield**.**
    - *Rationale*: Bulky systems can enhance coordination if they bring multiple coordinating sites. Without these benefits, steric hindrance reduces yield.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan, Entry 15)
    - *Low Yield Examples*:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 12)
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine, Entry 13)

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been carefully developed to capture the relationships between molecular modifiers' structural features and their impact on the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. In creating these rules, the following considerations were made:

- **Direct Combinations of Functional Groups**: Each rule focuses on specific combinations of functional groups and their positions within the molecule. For example, Rule 1 considers amino acids with coordinating side chains, combining the presence of amino and carboxyl groups within a certain distance.

- **Underlying Physicochemical Properties**: The rules are grounded in chemical principles such as electronic effects, steric hindrance, coordination ability, and solubility. For instance, Rule 2 discusses how electron-withdrawing groups enhance coordination ability, while Rule 9 addresses the impact of electron-withdrawing groups on electron density at coordinating sites.

- **Clear Predictions**: Each rule clearly specifies whether the modifiers that fit the description will result in high or low yield, allowing for straightforward application to any new modifiers.

- **Maximizing Dataset Coverage**: The rules are designed to cover as many entries in the dataset as possible. By combining multiple functional group features and considering their positions, the rules address a broad range of modifiers.

- **Balanced Complexity**: A suitable balance is maintained between simple rules with higher coverage (e.g., Rule 2 about aromatic carboxylic acids) and more complex rules with lower coverage but addressing specific cases (e.g., Rule 9 about modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups).

By applying these rules, researchers can predict the effectiveness of existing modifiers and guide the design of new ones to optimize and control the yield of the target reaction. These insights are grounded in both the observed data and fundamental chemical principles, making them reliable tools for advancing the research program.

**Note**: Some previous rules were refined or combined to enhance clarity and coverage. For example, rules related to chain length and coordinating groups were merged to create more comprehensive rules that better fit the dataset and adhere to the provided requirements.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms (e.g., carboxyl, hydroxyl, indole rings) within three carbon atoms result in **high yield**; those with non-coordinating or hydrophobic side chains result in **low yield**.**
   - *Rationale*: Close proximity of coordinating groups enhances chelation with the metal center, boosting catalyst activity. Non-coordinating or hydrophobic side chains lack these interactions.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid, Entry 2)
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid, Entry 0)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan, Entry 15)
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine, Entry 13)
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 33)

2. **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromo) or coordinating groups (e.g., amino) result in **high yield**; those with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy) or non-coordinating groups result in **low yield**.**
   - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing and coordinating groups increase the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxylate, improving interaction with the catalyst. Electron-donating groups decrease these effects.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Entry 20)
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Entry 1)
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Entry 4)
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 22)
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19)
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30)

3. **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with coordinating functional groups (e.g., amino, thiol) within three carbon atoms of the carboxyl group result in **high yield**; those where the functional group is further away result in **low yield**.**
   - *Rationale*: Close proximity of coordinating groups to the carboxyl enhances effective chelation with the metal center. Distant groups reduce coordination efficiency.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (Entry 3)
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 17)
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Entry 31)
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Entry 34)

4. **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of coordination (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole rings) result in **high yield**; those substituted with bulky groups or additional aromatic rings result in **low yield** due to steric hindrance.**
   - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatics can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalyst activity. Bulky substituents hinder this interaction.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid, Entry 21)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 16)
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 8)
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 12)

5. **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with thiol groups in short aliphatic chains (up to three carbons from the carboxyl group) result in **high yield**; thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings result in **low yield** due to potential catalyst poisoning.**
   - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols coordinate effectively without strongly deactivating the catalyst. Aromatic thiols may bind too tightly, inhibiting catalysis.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 17)
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Entry 10)

6. **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group result in **high yield**; those with hydroxyl groups further from the carboxyl or protected hydroxyl groups result in **low yield**.**
   - *Rationale*: Adjacent hydroxyl groups increase coordination sites and solubility, enhancing catalyst interaction. Distant or protected hydroxyls are less effective.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid, Entry 9)
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Entry 29)
     - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (Entry 25)

7. **Rule 7**: **Modifiers featuring ether linkages in aliphatic chains result in **low yield** due to increased flexibility and reduced ability to coordinate effectively with the catalyst.**
   - *Rationale*: Ether linkages introduce flexibility, preventing proper alignment and reducing coordination efficiency.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 11)
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32)

8. **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic rings connected via aliphatic chains longer than three carbons result in **high yield**; those with shorter chains result in **low yield** due to suboptimal positioning for coordination.**
   - *Rationale*: Optimal chain length allows coordinating groups to interact effectively with the catalyst without steric hindrance.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Entry 7)
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30)

9. **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., perfluoroalkyl chains, trifluoromethyl groups) attached to coordinating atoms result in **low yield** due to reduced electron density and coordination ability.**
   - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups lower electron density at coordinating sites, weakening interactions with the metal center.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Entry 14)
     - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** (Entry 28)

10. **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups result in **high yield** up to a chain length of eight carbons; longer chains or increased hydrophobicity result in **low yield** due to decreased solubility and coordination.**
    - *Rationale*: Medium-chain aliphatic acids maintain solubility and can interact with the catalyst. Longer chains become too hydrophobic, reducing effectiveness.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - **Octanoic acid** (Entry 5)
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - **No longer-chain acids present in the dataset for direct comparison**

11. **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the aromatic ring or coordination site result in **low yield** due to potential catalyst deactivation or side reactions.**
    - *Rationale*: Aldehydes and ketones can bind irreversibly to the metal center or participate in unwanted reactions, inhibiting catalysis.
    - *Low Yield Examples*:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19)
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 18)
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Entry 27)

12. **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing bulky aromatic systems or multiple fused rings result in **high yield** if the functional groups allow coordination and steric hindrance is minimal; excessive bulk without coordinating benefits results in **low yield**.**
    - *Rationale*: Bulky systems can enhance coordination if they bring multiple coordinating sites. Without these benefits, steric hindrance reduces yield.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan, Entry 15)
    - *Low Yield Examples*:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 12)
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine, Entry 13)

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been carefully developed to capture the relationships between molecular modifiers' structural features and their impact on the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. In creating these rules, the following considerations were made:

- **Direct Combinations of Functional Groups**: Each rule focuses on specific combinations of functional groups and their positions within the molecule. For example, Rule 1 considers amino acids with coordinating side chains, combining the presence of amino and carboxyl groups within a certain distance.

- **Underlying Physicochemical Properties**: The rules are grounded in chemical principles such as electronic effects, steric hindrance, coordination ability, and solubility. For instance, Rule 2 discusses how electron-withdrawing groups enhance coordination ability, while Rule 9 addresses the impact of electron-withdrawing groups on electron density at coordinating sites.

- **Clear Predictions**: Each rule clearly specifies whether the modifiers that fit the description will result in high or low yield, allowing for straightforward application to any new modifiers.

- **Maximizing Dataset Coverage**: The rules are designed to cover as many entries in the dataset as possible. By combining multiple functional group features and considering their positions, the rules address a broad range of modifiers.

- **Balanced Complexity**: A suitable balance is maintained between simple rules with higher coverage (e.g., Rule 2 about aromatic carboxylic acids) and more complex rules with lower coverage but addressing specific cases (e.g., Rule 9 about modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups).

By applying these rules, researchers can predict the effectiveness of existing modifiers and guide the design of new ones to optimize and control the yield of the target reaction. These insights are grounded in both the observed data and fundamental chemical principles, making them reliable tools for advancing the research program.

**Note**: Some previous rules were refined or combined to enhance clarity and coverage. For example, rules related to chain length and coordinating groups were merged to create more comprehensive rules that better fit the dataset and adhere to the provided requirements.---------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **

- **Suggestion 1**: **Revise the SMARTS pattern for Rule 1 to correctly represent amino acids with coordinating side chains.**

  The current SMARTS for the amino acid backbone and coordinating side chain in Rule 1 may not accurately match amino acids with coordinating side chains. The direct concatenation of `amino_acid_backbone` and `coordinating_side_chain` does not ensure that the side chain is connected to the alpha carbon of the amino acid.

  **Improvement**: Define the amino acid backbone such that the side chain (`R`) is attached to the alpha carbon. Use a SMARTS pattern like:

  ```python
  amino_acid_backbone = '[NX3;H2][CX4H]([R])[CX3](=O)[OX1H]'
  coordinating_side_chain = '[R;$([CX4][$([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]),$([OX2H]),$([c]),$([#7])])]'
  ```

  This pattern ensures that the side chain (`R`) is directly connected to the alpha carbon and contains coordinating groups within three carbons.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Modify the SMARTS patterns in Rule 1 to separately match high and low yield amino acids more accurately.**

  For high yield amino acids with coordinating side chains:

  ```python
  rule1_high = '[NX3;H2][CX4H]([$([CX4][$([CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]),$([OX2H]),$([c]),$([#7])])])[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'
  ```

  For low yield amino acids with non-coordinating or hydrophobic side chains:

  ```python
  rule1_low = '[NX3;H2][CX4H]([$([CX4][C,H])])[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1]'
  ```

  Use these patterns in the code to distinguish between high and low yield amino acids.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Ensure that the SMARTS patterns are correctly representing the positional relationships in the molecules for all rules.**

  For example, in Rule 2, the SMARTS patterns should specify that the electron-withdrawing or coordinating groups are in the para position relative to the carboxylic acid. The current patterns may not correctly enforce this positional relationship.

  **Improvement**: For Rule 2 high yield modifiers, use SMARTS patterns that define the para substitution explicitly:

  ```python
  para_substituted_aromatic_acid = 'c1ccc(cc1)C(=O)O'
  para_nitro = 'c1cc([N+](=O)[O-])cc(c1)C(=O)O'
  para_bromo = 'c1cc(Br)cc(c1)C(=O)O'
  para_amino = 'c1cc(N)cc(c1)C(=O)O'
  ```

  Use these patterns to match high yield modifiers with para-substituted electron-withdrawing or coordinating groups.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Adjust the SMARTS patterns for aliphatic chains to accurately reflect the distance between functional groups and the carboxyl group.**

  In Rule 3, the patterns should ensure that coordinating groups are within three carbon atoms of the carboxyl group.

  **Improvement**: Define the pattern for high yield modifiers as:

  ```python
  rule3_high = '[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CX4][CX4][CX4][$([NX3;H2,H1]),$([SX2H])]'
  ```

  For low yield modifiers where the functional group is further away:

  ```python
  rule3_low = '[CX3](=O)[OX1H0-,OX2H1][CX4][CX4][CX4][CX4,][CX4][$([NX3;H2,H1]),$([SX2H])]'
  ```

- **Suggestion 5**: **Correct the SMARTS patterns for Rule 4 to accurately capture heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating nitrogen atoms and identify bulky substituents.**

  The current patterns may not distinguish between simple heteroaromatic acids and those with bulky substituents.

  **Improvement**: For high yield:

  ```python
  rule4_high = '[nH]1cccc1C(=O)O'  # Heteroaromatic ring with nitrogen capable of coordination
  ```

  For low yield due to bulky substituents:

  ```python
  rule4_low = '[nH]1cccc1C(=O)O[a]'  # Substituted heteroaromatic ring with bulky groups
  ```

  Ensure that bulky substituents are correctly defined, perhaps by including patterns for additional aromatic rings or large groups.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Review and refine the SMARTS patterns for all rules to ensure accurate representation of the chemical structures described in the natural language rules.**

  Go through each rule and verify that the SMARTS patterns:

  - Correctly represent the functional groups and structural features.
  - Accurately capture the positional relationships (e.g., proximity of functional groups).
  - Distinguish between high and low yield modifiers as per the rules.

- **Suggestion 7**: **Add explicit handling for cases where multiple rules may apply to a single modifier.**

  The code should account for modifiers that may match multiple rules and ensure that the features are correctly assigned.

  **Improvement**: Implement a priority system or allow multiple rules to assign values to a single modifier where appropriate.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Include error checking and logging to identify molecules that fail to match any patterns.**

  This will help diagnose issues with the SMARTS patterns and ensure that all modifiers are being evaluated properly.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Validate the SMARTS patterns against known examples to ensure they match the intended molecules.**

  For each rule, test the SMARTS patterns on the high and low yield examples provided to confirm that they are correctly identified.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Consider using more advanced RDKit functions, such as substructure matching with atom mapping, to enhance pattern matching accuracy.**

  This can help in cases where functional groups are in specific positions relative to each other.

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms (e.g., carboxyl, hydroxyl, indole rings) within three carbon atoms result in **high yield**; those with non-coordinating or hydrophobic side chains result in **low yield**.**
   - *Rationale*: Close proximity of coordinating groups enhances chelation with the metal center, boosting catalyst activity. Non-coordinating or hydrophobic side chains lack these interactions.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid, Entry 2)
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid, Entry 0)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan, Entry 15)
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine, Entry 13)
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 33)

2. **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, bromo) or coordinating groups (e.g., amino) result in **high yield**; those with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy) or non-coordinating groups result in **low yield**.**
   - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing and coordinating groups increase the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxylate, improving interaction with the catalyst. Electron-donating groups decrease these effects.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Entry 20)
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Entry 1)
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Entry 4)
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 22)
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19)
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30)

3. **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with coordinating functional groups (e.g., amino, thiol) within three carbon atoms of the carboxyl group result in **high yield**; those where the functional group is further away result in **low yield**.**
   - *Rationale*: Close proximity of coordinating groups to the carboxyl enhances effective chelation with the metal center. Distant groups reduce coordination efficiency.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (Entry 3)
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 17)
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Entry 31)
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Entry 34)

4. **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of coordination (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole rings) result in **high yield**; those substituted with bulky groups or additional aromatic rings result in **low yield** due to steric hindrance.**
   - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatics can coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalyst activity. Bulky substituents hinder this interaction.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid, Entry 21)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 16)
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 8)
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 12)

5. **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with thiol groups in short aliphatic chains (up to three carbons from the carboxyl group) result in **high yield**; thiol groups directly attached to aromatic rings result in **low yield** due to potential catalyst poisoning.**
   - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiols coordinate effectively without strongly deactivating the catalyst. Aromatic thiols may bind too tightly, inhibiting catalysis.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 17)
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Entry 10)

6. **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl groups adjacent to the carboxyl group result in **high yield**; those with hydroxyl groups further from the carboxyl or protected hydroxyl groups result in **low yield**.**
   - *Rationale*: Adjacent hydroxyl groups increase coordination sites and solubility, enhancing catalyst interaction. Distant or protected hydroxyls are less effective.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid, Entry 9)
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Entry 29)
     - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid** (Entry 25)

7. **Rule 7**: **Modifiers featuring ether linkages in aliphatic chains result in **low yield** due to increased flexibility and reduced ability to coordinate effectively with the catalyst.**
   - *Rationale*: Ether linkages introduce flexibility, preventing proper alignment and reducing coordination efficiency.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 11)
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32)

8. **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic rings connected via aliphatic chains longer than three carbons result in **high yield**; those with shorter chains result in **low yield** due to suboptimal positioning for coordination.**
   - *Rationale*: Optimal chain length allows coordinating groups to interact effectively with the catalyst without steric hindrance.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Entry 7)
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30)

9. **Rule 9**: **Modifiers containing strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., perfluoroalkyl chains, trifluoromethyl groups) attached to coordinating atoms result in **low yield** due to reduced electron density and coordination ability.**
   - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups lower electron density at coordinating sites, weakening interactions with the metal center.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Entry 14)
     - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** (Entry 28)

10. **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating functional groups result in **high yield** up to a chain length of eight carbons; longer chains or increased hydrophobicity result in **low yield** due to decreased solubility and coordination.**
    - *Rationale*: Medium-chain aliphatic acids maintain solubility and can interact with the catalyst. Longer chains become too hydrophobic, reducing effectiveness.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - **Octanoic acid** (Entry 5)
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - **No longer-chain acids present in the dataset for direct comparison**

11. **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the aromatic ring or coordination site result in **low yield** due to potential catalyst deactivation or side reactions.**
    - *Rationale*: Aldehydes and ketones can bind irreversibly to the metal center or participate in unwanted reactions, inhibiting catalysis.
    - *Low Yield Examples*:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19)
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 18)
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Entry 27)

12. **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing bulky aromatic systems or multiple fused rings result in **high yield** if the functional groups allow coordination and steric hindrance is minimal; excessive bulk without coordinating benefits results in **low yield**.**
    - *Rationale*: Bulky systems can enhance coordination if they bring multiple coordinating sites. Without these benefits, steric hindrance reduces yield.
    - *High Yield Example*:
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan, Entry 15)
    - *Low Yield Examples*:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 12)
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine, Entry 13)

**End of Rules**

These rules have been carefully developed to capture the relationships between molecular modifiers' structural features and their impact on the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. In creating these rules, the following considerations were made:

- **Direct Combinations of Functional Groups**: Each rule focuses on specific combinations of functional groups and their positions within the molecule. For example, Rule 1 considers amino acids with coordinating side chains, combining the presence of amino and carboxyl groups within a certain distance.

- **Underlying Physicochemical Properties**: The rules are grounded in chemical principles such as electronic effects, steric hindrance, coordination ability, and solubility. For instance, Rule 2 discusses how electron-withdrawing groups enhance coordination ability, while Rule 9 addresses the impact of electron-withdrawing groups on electron density at coordinating sites.

- **Clear Predictions**: Each rule clearly specifies whether the modifiers that fit the description will result in high or low yield, allowing for straightforward application to any new modifiers.

- **Maximizing Dataset Coverage**: The rules are designed to cover as many entries in the dataset as possible. By combining multiple functional group features and considering their positions, the rules address a broad range of modifiers.

- **Balanced Complexity**: A suitable balance is maintained between simple rules with higher coverage (e.g., Rule 2 about aromatic carboxylic acids) and more complex rules with lower coverage but addressing specific cases (e.g., Rule 9 about modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups).

By applying these rules, researchers can predict the effectiveness of existing modifiers and guide the design of new ones to optimize and control the yield of the target reaction. These insights are grounded in both the observed data and fundamental chemical principles, making them reliable tools for advancing the research program.

**Note**: Some previous rules were refined or combined to enhance clarity and coverage. For example, rules related to chain length and coordinating groups were merged to create more comprehensive rules that better fit the dataset and adhere to the provided requirements.---------------------------------------------------------------

Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: **Generalize SMARTS Patterns for Rules Using Structural Descriptions Instead of Specific Examples**

  The current code for several rules (e.g., **Rule 2** and **Rule 4**) uses specific SMILES strings of example molecules as SMARTS patterns. This approach limits the application of the rules to only those exact molecules, failing to capture other modifiers that fit the structural criteria outlined in the rules. To improve this, the code should translate the natural language rules into generalized SMARTS patterns that represent the structural features described. For example, instead of using the SMILES for 4-nitrobenzoic acid, create a SMARTS pattern that matches any aromatic carboxylic acid with a para-substituted electron-withdrawing group.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Revise SMARTS Patterns for Rule 1 to Accurately Capture Amino Acids with Coordinating Side Chains**

  The SMARTS patterns for **Rule 1** may be too restrictive or incorrectly specified, causing the patterns not to match amino acids with coordinating side chains. The code should be adjusted to correctly represent amino acids with side chains containing coordinating heteroatoms within three carbon atoms from the α-carbon. This can be achieved by creating a more general SMARTS pattern that matches any amino acid backbone with a side chain containing coordinating groups like hydroxyl, carboxyl, or heteroaromatic rings within the specified distance.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Ensure Correct Use of Quantifiers and Distance Specifications in SMARTS Patterns**

  For rules involving functional groups at specific positions relative to other groups (e.g., **Rule 3** and **Rule 5**), the SMARTS patterns need to accurately reflect the specified number of carbon atoms separating functional groups. The current patterns may not correctly account for the carbon chain length. The code should use appropriate SMARTS quantifiers to specify exact numbers of intervening atoms, such as `{n}` for exact counts or `{n,m}` for ranges, ensuring accurate matching according to the rules.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Develop SMARTS Patterns that Capture Electronic Effects of Substituents**

  **Rule 2** involves differentiating between electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups on aromatic rings. Designing SMARTS patterns based solely on electronic properties is challenging because SMARTS syntax doesn't directly encode electronic effects. To address this, the code can define lists of common electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups and incorporate them into the SMARTS patterns. Alternatively, the code could use recursive SMARTS to represent groups with specific characteristics.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Implement Functional Group Definitions and Use Helper Functions to Enhance Pattern Matching**

  To manage complex patterns and improve readability, the code can define common functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino, carboxyl, nitro groups) using SMARTS and use these definitions within larger patterns. Additionally, creating helper functions that encapsulate pattern matching logic can aid in matching complex molecular features described in the rules. This modular approach enhances maintainability and allows for easier updates and testing.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Thoroughly Test and Validate SMARTS Patterns Against Known Examples**

  After revising the SMARTS patterns, it's crucial to test them against the dataset to ensure they match the intended modifiers correctly. This includes both the examples provided in the rules and additional molecules that fit the criteria. Validation helps identify any mismatches or unintended matches, allowing for further refinement of the patterns.

**End of Suggestions**
---------------------------------------------------------------
Rule Advisor Message:
**Start of Advice**

- **Advice 1**: **Convert Qualitative Descriptions into Quantitative Features**
  - Redefine the rules to specify quantifiable features that can be directly extracted from SMILES strings. For example, instead of stating "coordinating heteroatoms within three carbon atoms," specify "the number of nitrogen or oxygen atoms within a three-bond distance from the carboxyl group."

- **Advice 2**: **Use SMARTS Patterns for Functional Group Identification**
  - Implement SMARTS (SMILES Arbitrary Target Specification) patterns to identify specific functional groups and substructures within the modifiers. This approach allows for precise matching of functional groups like amino, hydroxyl, carboxyl, thiol, and aromatic rings directly from SMILES data.

- **Advice 3**: **Quantify Functional Group Counts and Positions**
  - Create numeric descriptors for the count of functional groups (e.g., number of hydroxyl groups, amino groups) and their positions relative to key functional groups like carboxylates. For example, include features like "number of amino groups within three bonds of a carboxyl group."

- **Advice 4**: **Incorporate Topological Descriptors**
  - Utilize topological indices such as the shortest path length between functional groups, the presence of rings, and the size of aliphatic chains. These descriptors can capture the relative positions and connectivity of functional groups in the molecule.

- **Advice 5**: **Compute Physicochemical Properties**
  - Include calculated properties such as logP (hydrophobicity), topological polar surface area (TPSA), molecular weight, and the number of rotatable bonds. These properties can be derived from SMILES strings and provide insight into solubility and steric effects.

- **Advice 6**: **Quantify Electronic Effects with Descriptor Values**
  - Assign numeric values to represent electron-donating or electron-withdrawing effects of substituents. Use established scales like Hammett sigma constants or calculate partial charges to quantify electronic influences on coordination ability.

- **Advice 7**: **Encode Steric Bulk with Steric Descriptors**
  - Include descriptors for steric hindrance, such as molar refractivity or van der Waals volume. Quantifying steric bulk can help identify modifiers that may cause steric hindrance at the active site.

- **Advice 8**: **Simplify and Generalize the Rules**
  - Reduce the number of rules by combining overlapping ones and focusing on the most impactful features. Generalized rules are easier to translate into numerical descriptors. For example, create a rule like "Modifiers with coordinating heteroatoms (N, O, S) within a certain bond distance from the carboxyl group tend to result in high yield."

- **Advice 9**: **Create a Structured Feature Matrix**
  - Develop a feature matrix where each modifier is represented by a vector of numeric descriptors derived from the above features. This matrix can be used for statistical analysis or machine learning to identify patterns and predict yields.

- **Advice 10**: **Validate and Refine Rules with Statistical Methods**
  - Apply statistical techniques, such as correlation analysis or decision trees, to validate the importance of each descriptor. Refine the rules based on which features show the strongest correlation with yield.

- **Advice 11**: **Automate Feature Extraction**
  - Utilize cheminformatics software or libraries (e.g., RDKit) to automate the extraction of the defined descriptors from SMILES strings. This ensures consistency and efficiency in applying the rules to new modifiers.

- **Advice 12**: **Document Exceptions Clearly**
  - Identify any outliers or exceptions where the rules do not apply, and document them. This will help refine the rules further and improve their predictive power.

   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Entry 20)
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Entry 1)
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19)

  - **Coverage**: Supported by two low-yield examples, the rule meets the minimum requirement, though additional data points would strengthen it. **Score: Satisfactory**.

- **Comment 8**:

  **Rule 8**

  - **Clarity**: The rule clearly defines that modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxyl group or aromatic ring lead to low yield, making it easy to apply. **Score: High**.
  
  - **Property Insight**: The rationale is solid, explaining that such groups may cause catalyst deactivation through irreversible binding, which is a well-understood phenomenon in catalysis. **Score: High**.
  
  - **Complexity**: By focusing on the combination of carbonyl groups adjacent to key functional groups, the rule demonstrates complexity in structural considerations. **Score: High**.
  
  - **Coverage**: With three low-yield examples, the rule is well-supported by the dataset. **Score: High**.

- **Comment 9**:

  **Rule 9**

  - **Clarity**: While the rule states that simple aliphatic carboxylic acids up to eight carbons without additional functional groups result in high yield, the lack of examples for low yield due to longer chains reduces clarity in application to modifiers outside the given range. **Score: Moderate**.
  
  - **Property Insight**: The rationale suggests issues with solubility and coordination efficiency for longer chains, which is reasonable but would benefit from additional data to illustrate this effect. **Score: Moderate**.
  
  - **Complexity**: The rule is relatively simple, focusing solely on chain length without incorporating other structural features or combinations. **Score: Low**.
  
  - **Coverage**: Only one high-yield example is provided (octanoic acid), with no low-yield examples of longer-chain acids in the dataset. This limits the rule's support. **Score: Low**.

- **Comment 10**:

  **Rule 10**

  - **Clarity**: The rule clearly indicates that amino acids or derivatives with sulfur-containing side chains result in low yield, providing straightforward guidance. **Score: High**.
  
  - **Property Insight**: The rationale explains that sulfur-containing side chains may cause catalyst poisoning or steric hindrance, which is a plausible explanation based on known chemical interactions with sulfur groups. **Score: High**.
  
  - **Complexity**: The rule combines the amino acid structure with the presence of sulfur-containing side chains, considering multiple structural elements. **Score: High**.
  
  - **Coverage**: Only one low-yield example is provided to support this rule, which is insufficient according to the coverage criteria requiring at least two data points. **Score: Low**.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids or amino acid derivatives with side-chain coordinating groups (e.g., carboxyl, amino, hydroxyl, or heteroaromatic rings containing nitrogen or oxygen) within three carbon atoms from the alpha carbon result in **high yield**; those with hydrophobic or non-coordinating side chains result in **low yield**.**
   - *Rationale*: Coordinating side-chain groups enhance interactions with the metal center, improving catalyst activity.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid, Entry 2)
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid, Entry 0)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan, Entry 15)
     - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (Entry 3)
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine, Entry 13)
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 33)
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Entry 31)
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Entry 34)

2. **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted coordinating groups (e.g., amino, nitro) result in **high yield**; those with non-coordinating or electron-donating substituents (e.g., methyl) result in **low yield**.**
   - *Rationale*: Para-substituted coordinating groups enhance interaction with the catalyst through coordination.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Entry 4)
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Entry 20)
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 22)
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19)

3. **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of coordination (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole rings) result in **high yield**; those with additional aromatic rings or bulky substituents causing steric hindrance result in **low yield**.**
   - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalysis; steric hindrance reduces interaction.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid, Entry 21)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 16)
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 8)
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 12)

4. **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with coordinating functional groups (e.g., amino, thiol, hydroxyl) within three carbon atoms of the carboxyl group result in **high yield**; if the coordinating group is further away (more than four carbons), they result in **low yield**.**
   - *Rationale*: Close proximity of coordinating groups facilitates effective binding to the metal center.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 17)
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid, Entry 9)
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Entry 29)
     - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** (Entry 31)

5. **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing electron-withdrawing groups that can coordinate (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) result in **high yield**; those with electron-withdrawing groups that do not coordinate or potentially deactivate the catalyst (e.g., formyl, perfluoroalkyl) result in **low yield**.**
   - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing groups can enhance coordination unless they deactivate the catalyst or lack coordinating ability.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Entry 20)
     - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** (Entry 1)
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19)
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Entry 14)

6. **Rule 6**: **Modifiers with thiol or hydroxyl groups directly attached to short aliphatic chains (up to three carbons) result in **high yield**; when these groups are directly attached to an aromatic ring, they result in **low yield** due to potential catalyst poisoning or reduced coordination.**
   - *Rationale*: Aliphatic thiol or hydroxyl groups can coordinate effectively; aromatic counterparts may inhibit catalysis.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 17)
     - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Entry 7)
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** (Entry 10)
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30)

7. **Rule 7**: **Modifiers featuring ether linkages in aliphatic chains result in **low yield** due to increased flexibility and reduced effective coordination with the catalyst.**
   - *Rationale*: Flexible ether chains may not align properly for optimal catalyst interaction.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 11)
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32)

8. **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxyl group or aromatic ring result in **low yield** due to potential catalyst deactivation or side reactions with the catalyst.**
   - *Rationale*: Aldehyde and ketone groups can bind irreversibly to the metal center, inhibiting catalysis.
   - *Low Yield Examples*:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19)
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 18)
     - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Entry 27)

9. **Rule 9**: **Simple aliphatic carboxylic acids up to eight carbons in length without additional functional groups result in **high yield**; longer chains or increased hydrophobicity may result in **low yield** due to decreased solubility and coordination efficiency.**
   - *Rationale*: Medium-length aliphatic acids maintain solubility and can interact effectively with the catalyst.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **Octanoic acid** (Entry 5)
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **No longer-chain acids present in the dataset for direct comparison**

10. **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are amino acids or derivatives with sulfur-containing side chains (e.g., methionine derivatives) result in **low yield** due to possible catalyst poisoning or steric hindrance.**
    - *Rationale*: Sulfur-containing side chains may bind too strongly or hinder the catalyst, reducing its activity.
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (Entry 23)

**End of Rules**

---

These revised rules have been developed to closely align with the dataset and fulfill the specified requirements:

- **Direct Combinations of Functional Groups**: Each rule focuses on specific structural features and combinations of functional groups, such as coordinating groups within certain distances, types of substituents on aromatic rings, or the presence of flexible linkers.

- **Underlying Physicochemical Properties**: The rules are grounded in chemical principles, considering factors like coordination ability, steric hindrance, electronic effects, solubility, and potential catalyst interactions.

- **Clear Predictions**: Each rule clearly states whether modifiers fitting the description will lead to high or low yield, facilitating straightforward application to new structures.

- **Broad Dataset Coverage**: The rules are designed to collectively cover a wide range of the dataset entries, balancing specificity with applicability.

- **Balanced Complexity**: A mixture of simple rules with broad coverage (e.g., Rule 1 on amino acids) and more complex rules addressing specific cases (e.g., Rule 7 on ether linkages) ensures a comprehensive yet practical set of guidelines.

- **Refinement Based on Data**: Existing rules were refined to better match the dataset, correcting inconsistencies (e.g., re-examining entries like **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**) and ensuring that exceptions are accounted for.

By applying these improved rules, researchers can more effectively predict and influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. The rules serve as a valuable tool for guiding the selection and design of molecular modifiers based on their structural features and expected interactions with the catalyst system.---------------------------------------------------------------

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: Correct the SMARTS pattern for the heteroaromatic ring in **Rule 1**. The current pattern `'[a;!c;$(n),$(o)]'` is syntactically incorrect and does not properly match heteroaromatic rings containing nitrogen or oxygen atoms. It should be modified to `'[a;n,o]'`, which matches aromatic heteroatoms that are nitrogen or oxygen. This change ensures the pattern correctly identifies heteroaromatic rings with coordinating nitrogen or oxygen atoms.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: Improve the implementation of the **'within_bonds'** parameter in **Rule 1**. The current code does not accurately check for coordinating groups within three bonds of the alpha carbon. Instead, after identifying the alpha carbon, the code should use `Chem.rdmolops.GetShortestPath(mol, alpha_c_idx, atom_idx)` for each coordinating group atom and verify that the path length (number of bonds) is less than or equal to three. This ensures that only coordinating groups within the specified bond distance are considered.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: Modify the SMARTS pattern for the **carboxyl_group** in **Rule 1**. The current pattern `'[CX3](=O)[OX1H0]'` matches deprotonated carboxylate ions, not the protonated carboxyl groups present in carboxylic acids. Change it to `'[CX3](=O)[OX1H1]'` to match the protonated carboxyl group (`-COOH`), which is more relevant to the experimental conditions.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: Adjust the **Rule 2** patterns to accurately identify para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids. The current patterns for **para_amino** and **para_nitro** groups (`'c1ccc(N)cc1'` and `'c1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc1'`) do not ensure that the substituents are in the para position relative to the carboxylic acid group. Instead, use SMARTS patterns that specify the carboxylic acid at the para position, such as `'c1cc(ccc1C(=O)O)N'` for para-amino benzoic acid. This change ensures that only para-substituted compounds are matched.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: In **Rule 3**, expand the SMARTS pattern to include both five- and six-membered heteroaromatic rings containing nitrogen atoms. The current pattern `'[n,o]1cccc1C(=O)O'` matches only five-membered rings. Modify it to include six-membered rings by using a pattern like `'[nH0]1ccccc1C(=O)O'` or generalize it with `'[n]1cccc1C(=O)O'` and `'[n]1ccccc1C(=O)O'` to match both pyridine and pyrrole derivatives.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: Implement the missing rules (**Rules 4 to 10**) in the code. Currently, only the first three rules are coded, which limits the effectiveness of the feature matrix. By adding the remaining rules, the feature matrix will more accurately reflect the modifiers' properties as described in all the rules.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: For each rule, validate the SMARTS patterns against known examples provided in the rules. This can be done by testing the patterns on the SMILES strings of the examples to ensure that they match high-yield compounds and do not match low-yield compounds, refining the patterns as necessary.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: Enhance error handling and debug capabilities in the code. Add informative logging messages or print statements that indicate which patterns are matched or not matched for each molecule. This will facilitate troubleshooting and ensure the code behaves as expected.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: Review and correct the logic that determines whether a molecule matches a rule. In the current code, the variable `match` may not be set correctly due to breaks in nested loops and incorrect handling of conditionals. Ensure that `match` accurately reflects whether all necessary patterns are matched according to each rule's criteria.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: Consider using RDKit's `GetSubstructMatches` with query parameters to find specific substructures and their occurrences within the molecule. This can provide more control over pattern matching and allow for more precise implementation of the rules, especially when checking for distances between functional groups.

2. **Overall Metrics for Current Rules**

   - Train Support: **0.5143**
   - Train Confidence: **0.5143**
   - Train Lift: **1.0**
   - Train Leverage: **0.0**

**Observations**

1. **Confidence Analysis**

   - **Individual Rules**: The confidence levels of individual rules range from 56.89% to 72.57%, with most exceeding the previous average confidence of 58.74%. This indicates that, individually, the rules are fairly reliable in predicting high yields when their conditions are met.
   - **Rule 3** stands out with the highest confidence of 72.57%, significantly exceeding the baseline.
   - **Overall Confidence**: The overall train confidence is 51.43%, which is lower than both the previous average and the individual rule confidences. This suggests that when considering all rules collectively, the predictive power diminishes.

2. **Lift Analysis**

   - **Individual Rules**: Each individual rule, except for Rule 4, has a lift greater than 1, indicating a positive association between the rule conditions and the high-yield outcome.
     - **Rule 3** has the highest lift at **1.4530**, implying that the presence of its conditions increases the likelihood of a high yield by 45.3% compared to random chance.
     - **Rule 4** has a lift of **1.0**, indicating no association.
   - **Overall Lift**: The overall lift is **1.0**, signifying that, as a whole, the rules do not improve the prediction beyond random chance.

3. **Support and Leverage**

   - **Support**: Individual rule supports are generally low, with Rule 3 having the highest at **0.0643** (6.43%). This means each rule applies to a small fraction of the dataset.
   - **Leverage**: Individual leverages are positive but small, indicating a slight increase over the expected support if the antecedent and consequent were independent.
   - **Overall Support and Leverage**: The overall support is **51.43%**, but the leverage is **0.0**, further confirming that the combined rules do not provide predictive advantage.

**Assessment on Local Minimum and Iterations**

- **Local Minimum**: The plateau in overall lift and leverage suggests that the current set of rules has reached a local minimum where additional iterations without changes to the approach may not yield improvement.
- **Iterations Sufficiency**: Given the metrics, especially the overall lift of 1.0 and overall leverage of 0.0, it appears that the current rules are not effectively capturing the relationships in the data. Additional iterations are necessary, but they should include strategic changes to the rules rather than mere repetitions.

**Suggestions for Improving the Current Rules**

1. **Enhance Rule Coverage (Support)**

   - **Increase Support**: Modify existing rules to cover a larger portion of the dataset without sacrificing confidence and lift significantly.
   - **Example**: Broaden the conditions in **Rule 1** to include modifiers with side-chain coordinating groups beyond three carbon atoms if they still contribute to high yield.

2. **Focus on High-Performing Rules**

   - **Prioritize Rules with High Lift and Confidence**: Analyze **Rule 3** further to understand why it performs well and see if its principles can be applied to other rules.
   - **Eliminate or Revise Underperforming Rules**: Consider removing or revising **Rule 4**, as it does not contribute to predictive power.

3. **Combine Similar Rules**

   - **Merge Redundant Rules**: Identify rules that are similar and combine them to improve support.
   - **Example**: **Rules 1 and 5** both deal with coordinating groups; integrating them might enhance overall performance.

4. **Reassess Rule Conditions**

   - **Adjust Thresholds**: Experiment with different thresholds for distances in coordinating groups or chain lengths.
   - **Refine Functional Group Impact**: Reevaluate the impact of specific functional groups, considering their electronic and steric effects more quantitatively.

5. **Include Additional Data Features**

   - **Physicochemical Properties**: Incorporate properties such as pKa, logP (partition coefficient), and electron density into the rules.
   - **Structural Descriptors**: Use molecular descriptors or fingerprints to capture more nuanced structural information.

6. **Address Potential Overfitting**

   - **Simplify Rules**: Ensure that rules are not overly complex or tailored to specific data points, which can reduce generalizability.
   - **Cross-Validation**: Apply cross-validation techniques to test the rules' performance on unseen data.

7. **Explore New Patterns**

   - **Cluster Analysis**: Perform clustering to identify new groupings of data that may reveal hidden patterns.
   - **Machine Learning Models**: Use statistical or machine learning methods to uncover non-obvious relationships that could inform new rule development.

8. **Iterative Refinement**

   - **Feedback Loop**: Use the insights from each iteration to refine the rules continuously.
   - **Expert Consultation**: Collaborate with domain experts to validate the chemical plausibility of the rules and suggest adjustments.

**Conclusion**

The current rules show potential at the individual level but fall short collectively, as indicated by the overall metrics. To improve:

- **Expand Rule Applicability**: Adjust rules to cover more data without compromising their predictive quality.
- **Optimize Rule Set**: Focus on high-performing rules and refine or remove those that do not contribute.
- **Enhance Data Integration**: Incorporate additional molecular features and leverage advanced analysis techniques.

By implementing these strategies, we can move beyond the local minimum and develop a set of rules with stronger predictive power, ultimately enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the research program.

ML Commenter Message:
**Performance Evaluation of Current Rules**

**1. Effectiveness of Current Rules**

The latest 5-fold cross-validation accuracy obtained using the current rules is **51.43%**, as indicated in the most recent training results:

- **Current Validation Accuracy**: 0.5143

Comparing this to the reference metric data provided:

- **Previous Validation Accuracies**: Ranged from 0.76 to 0.76 across different iterations.
- **Previous Test Accuracies**: Ranged from 0.625 to 0.75.

The current validation accuracy is significantly lower than previous accuracies, which consistently hovered around **75%**. This decline suggests that the effectiveness of the current rules has diminished in the latest iteration.

Furthermore, the SHAP analysis indicates that **only Rule 3** is contributing to the predictions, and its SHAP value is **0.0** for all molecules:

```
For molecule ..., the predicted loading of modifier on catalyst is low and the experimental value is high
  Rule3 SHAP value for high loading: 0.0;
```

This pattern repeats for all molecules listed, regardless of whether the experimental value is high or low. The zero SHAP values indicate that **Rule 3 is not contributing any meaningful information** to the model's predictions.

**Conclusion**: The current rules are **not effective enough**, as evidenced by the low validation accuracy and the lack of informative contributions from the rules to the model.

---

**2. Assessment of Overfitting and Underfitting**

**Underfitting Analysis**:

- **Low Validation Accuracy**: The validation accuracy of around **51%** is only marginally better than random guessing for a binary classification problem.
- **Lack of Informative SHAP Values**: The SHAP values for Rule 3 are zero across all molecules, suggesting that the model is **not capturing any underlying patterns** in the data.

**Overfitting Analysis**:

- Given the low validation accuracy and the simplicity of the model (only one rule with zero SHAP values), overfitting is unlikely. Instead, the model seems to be **underfitting**, failing to learn from the training data.

**Conclusion**: The current model is exhibiting signs of **underfitting**. The rules are either too general or not properly capturing the features necessary to distinguish between high and low modifier loadings.

---

**3. Analysis of Discrepancies Using SHAP Values**

**Discrepancies**:

- **Zero SHAP Values**: The SHAP values for Rule 3 are zero for all molecules, regardless of discrepancies between predicted and experimental values.
- **No Differentiation**: The model does not differentiate between molecules with high or low experimental modifier loadings.

**Implications**:

- **Rule 3's Ineffectiveness**: The consistent zero SHAP values imply that Rule 3 is not impacting the predictions. It neither contributes positively nor negatively.
- **Lack of Active Rules**: The absence of other rules contributing to the predictions indicates that the feature matrix may be insufficient or incorrectly specified.

**Conclusion**: The discrepancies between predicted and experimental values are not being addressed by the current rules, particularly since Rule 3 is not influencing the model's output.

---

**4. Interpretation of Accuracy Trends**

**Decreasing Accuracy**:

- The historical data shows a decline in validation accuracy over iterations:
  - From **0.76** down to **0.5143**.
- This downward trend suggests that each iteration of rule modifications has not improved the model's performance.

**Stagnation at 50% Accuracy**:

- An accuracy around **50%** indicates that the model's predictions are no better than random chance.
- The model likely lacks sufficient complexity or fails to capture essential features.

**Conclusion**: The accuracy metrics indicate that the current rules have not improved the model and may have led to decreased predictive power.

---

**5. Insights from SHAP Analysis**

**Lack of Informative Features**:

- The SHAP analysis reveals that the only active rule (Rule 3) does not contribute to the prediction, as indicated by zero SHAP values.
- Other rules are not present in the feature matrix or are not contributing to the model.

**Opportunity for Improvement**:

- **Re-evaluate Rule Definitions**: The current rules may be too broad or too narrow, failing to capture key structural features related to modifier loading.
- **Incorporate Additional Rules**: Consider introducing new rules that address functional groups or structural motifs not covered by the existing rules.
- **Adjust Existing Rules**: Refine rules that previously had high positive or negative SHAP values but may have been removed or altered in the latest iteration.

**Conclusion**: The SHAP analysis suggests that there is significant room for improving the rules to enhance the model's predictive capabilities.

---

**Recommendations for Improvement**

**1. Review and Refine Ineffective Rules**

- **Rule 3**: Since Rule 3 is the only rule in use but has zero SHAP values, it's essential to revisit its definition.
  - **Action**: Refine Rule 3 to ensure it captures meaningful features that differentiate between high and low modifier loadings.
  - **Consideration**: Is Rule 3 too general or too specific? Adjust the criteria to increase its effectiveness.

**2. Reintroduce and Adjust Previously Impactful Rules**

- **Rules with High Positive SHAP Values**:
  - **Examples**: Rules 16, 5, and 8 had significant positive SHAP values in earlier iterations.
  - **Issue**: These rules may have contributed to overestimating modifier loading.
  - **Action**: Modify these rules to reduce overestimation by adding conditions or exceptions.
    - **For instance**:
      - **Add specificity**: Include additional structural requirements to prevent applying the rule too broadly.
      - **Introduce exceptions**: Exclude certain substructures known to result in low modifier loading despite meeting the rule's criteria.

- **Rules with High Negative SHAP Values**:
  - **Examples**: Rules 5 and 11 showed high negative SHAP values in underestimating modifier loading.
  - **Action**: Adjust these rules to avoid underprediction by re-evaluating the features they target.
    - **For instance**:
      - **Expand the scope**: Broaden the rule to include additional coordinating groups or structural motifs.
      - **Relax strict conditions**: Soften criteria that may be excluding relevant molecules.

**3. Enhance Rule Generalization**

- **Avoid Overfitting**:
  - Ensure that rules are not overly tailored to the training set at the expense of general applicability.
  - **Action**: Validate rules against a separate dataset or through cross-validation to confirm their generalizability.

- **Address Underfitting**:
  - Introduce new rules that capture missing variance in the data.
  - **Action**: Analyze molecular structures with incorrect predictions to identify common features not covered by existing rules.

**4. Incorporate Additional Molecular Features**

- **Functional Groups and Motifs**:
  - Identify functional groups or structural motifs prevalent in misclassified molecules.
  - **Action**: Develop new rules focusing on these features.

- **Electronic and Steric Factors**:
  - Consider electronic effects (e.g., electron-donating/withdrawing groups) and steric hindrance.
  - **Action**: Modify rules to account for these factors, potentially improving prediction accuracy.

**5. Iterative Rule Development and Evaluation**

- **Iterative Refinement**:
  - Continuously refine the rules based on model performance and SHAP analysis.
  - **Action**: After adjusting rules, retrain the model and re-evaluate performance.

- **Monitor SHAP Contributions**:
  - Use SHAP values to understand the impact of each rule.
  - **Action**: Ensure that rules contributing to incorrect predictions are identified and addressed.

**6. Consider Model Complexity and Features**

- **Expand Feature Matrix**:
  - Include more descriptors or features that may influence modifier loading.
  - **Action**: Integrate molecular descriptors such as LogP, molecular weight, and electronic properties.

- **Alternative Modeling Approaches**:
  - If rule-based features are insufficient, consider incorporating machine learning models that can capture nonlinear relationships.
  - **Action**: Explore models like decision trees or random forests using more comprehensive feature sets.

---

**Conclusion**

The current rules are not sufficiently capturing the nuances of the dataset, leading to poor model performance and underfitting. By revisiting and refining existing rules, reintroducing impactful rules from earlier iterations with necessary adjustments, and incorporating additional molecular features, we can improve the model's predictive accuracy. Iterative development, guided by SHAP analysis and validation metrics, will be crucial in enhancing the effectiveness of the rules and the overall model.

**Summary of Discussions and Directions for Optimizing Current Rules**

**Summary:**

The current set of rules used to predict and optimize the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction are not performing effectively. The key issues identified are:

1. **Poor Performance Metrics**: The overall training accuracy has decreased to approximately 51%, which is only marginally better than random chance for a binary classification problem. The lift and leverage values indicate that the current rules are not providing predictive power beyond random expectation.

2. **Ineffective Rule Implementation**: Only Rule 3 is currently active in the model, and it is contributing negligibly to the predictions, as evidenced by zero SHAP values across all molecules. This suggests that Rule 3, as currently implemented, is not capturing meaningful patterns in the data.

3. **Incomplete and Inaccurate Rule Coding**: Only the first three rules have been implemented in the code, and these have issues with their SMARTS patterns and logic. The patterns are syntactically incorrect or too general, leading to improper matching of molecular features.

4. **Underfitting and Lack of Generalization**: The model appears to be underfitting, failing to capture the underlying relationships between molecular structures and reaction yields. This is due to overly simplistic or incorrect rules, resulting in poor predictive performance.

5. **Potential for Overfitting Not Evident**: Since the model is underperforming and not capturing patterns effectively, there is currently no significant risk of overfitting from optimizing the rules further.

**Directions to Optimize Current Rules:**

To improve the predictive power of the model and address the issues identified, the following steps are recommended:

1. **Correct and Refine SMARTS Patterns:**

   - **Rule 1**:
     - **Heteroaromatic Rings**: Update the SMARTS pattern to correctly match heteroaromatic rings containing nitrogen or oxygen atoms. Replace the incorrect pattern `'[a;!c;$(n),$(o)]'` with a corrected pattern such as `'[a;n,o]'`, which matches aromatic nitrogen or oxygen atoms.
     - **Coordination Distance**: Implement accurate distance checks using `Chem.rdmolops.GetShortestPath` to ensure coordinating groups are within three bonds of the alpha carbon. This ensures that only coordinating groups in close proximity are considered, aligning with the chemical rationale of the rule.
     - **Carboxyl Group**: Modify the carboxyl group pattern to `'[CX3](=O)[OX1H1]'` to match protonated carboxyl groups (`-COOH`), which are more relevant under experimental conditions.

   - **Rule 2**:
     - **Para-Substituted Aromatics**: Adjust the SMARTS patterns to ensure that substituents (e.g., amino, nitro groups) are specifically at the para position relative to the carboxyl group. Use patterns like `'c1ccc(cc1[NH2])C(=O)O'` for para-aminobenzoic acid and `'c1ccc(cc1[N+](=O)[O-])C(=O)O'` for para-nitrobenzoic acid.

   - **Rule 3**:
     - **Heteroaromatic Rings Expansion**: Expand the SMARTS patterns to include both five- and six-membered heteroaromatic rings containing nitrogen atoms. Use generalized patterns such as `'[nH0]1cccc1C(=O)O'` for five-membered rings and `'[nH0]1ccccc1C(=O)O'` for six-membered rings to match compounds like pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid.

2. **Implement Missing Rules (Rules 4 to 10):**

   - **Complete Rule Coding**: Implement Rules 4 through 10 in the code to enrich the feature matrix. These rules address important structural features and functional groups that impact the reaction yield, and their inclusion is critical for capturing the diversity of the dataset.

   - **Rule Examples**:
     - **Rule 4**: Aliphatic carboxylic acids with coordinating functional groups within three carbons.
     - **Rule 5**: Modifiers with electron-withdrawing coordinating groups.
     - **Rule 6**: Thiol or hydroxyl groups directly attached to short aliphatic chains.
     - **Rule 7**: Modifiers with ether linkages resulting in low yield.
     - **Rule 8**: Modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to functional groups leading to low yield.
     - **Rule 9**: Simple aliphatic carboxylic acids up to eight carbons resulting in high yield.
     - **Rule 10**: Amino acids with sulfur-containing side chains resulting in low yield.

3. **Validate and Refine Each Rule:**

   - **Test SMARTS Patterns**: For each rule, validate the SMARTS patterns against known examples to ensure they match the intended compounds and exclude incorrect ones.
   - **Refine Patterns**: Adjust the SMARTS patterns based on validation results to improve specificity and accuracy.
   - **Example**: If a pattern unintentionally matches low-yield compounds, refine it by adding additional constraints or exclusions.

4. **Improve Rule Logic and Matching:**

   - **Accurate Matching**: Ensure that the logic used to determine whether a molecule matches a rule is correctly implemented. Use proper loop structures and conditionals to set the `match` variable accurately.
   - **Shortest Path Implementation**: Use the `GetShortestPath` function to accurately calculate the bond distance between functional groups, as required by certain rules.
   - **Comprehensive Testing**: Write unit tests or assertions within the code to verify that the rules are working as intended.

5. **Enhance Error Handling and Debugging:**

   - **Informative Logging**: Add logging messages that indicate which molecules match each rule and why. This helps in identifying any mismatches or errors in the rule implementation.
   - **Exception Handling**: Implement error handling for cases where molecules may not fit any rule or cause unexpected behavior in the code.

6. **Optimize Rule Coverage and Balance:**

   - **Increase Support**: Adjust rules to cover more molecules in the dataset without compromising the confidence and lift significantly.
   - **Merge Similar Rules**: Combine rules that target similar features to simplify the rule set and increase their applicability.
   - **Avoid Over-Specificity**: Ensure that rules are not overly specific to certain compounds, which can lead to underfitting.

7. **Incorporate Additional Molecular Features:**

   - **Physicochemical Properties**: Include features such as pKa, logP, molecular weight, and electron density, which may influence the reaction yield.
   - **Molecular Descriptors**: Use cheminformatics tools to compute descriptors and fingerprints that capture structural and electronic properties.

8. **Iterative Model Refinement:**

   - **Cross-Validation**: Use cross-validation to assess the model's performance on unseen data and prevent overfitting.
   - **SHAP Analysis**: Continue using SHAP values to understand the impact of each rule and make data-driven adjustments.
   - **Performance Monitoring**: Track changes in accuracy, confidence, lift, and leverage after each modification to the rules.

9. **Consult Domain Experts:**

   - **Chemistry Expertise**: Collaborate with chemists or domain experts to ensure that the chemical rationale behind each rule is sound.
   - **Empirical Data Alignment**: Align the rules with empirical data and known chemical behavior to improve their validity.

**Possibility for Further Optimization Without Overfitting:**

Yes, there is significant potential for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. The current model is underperforming due to incomplete and inaccurately implemented rules. By refining the SMARTS patterns, implementing all proposed rules, and ensuring accurate rule logic, the model's predictive performance can be improved while maintaining generalizability. Cross-validation and careful monitoring of performance metrics will help prevent overfitting as the rules are optimized.

    **Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are amino acids or amino acid derivatives with side-chain coordinating groups (e.g., carboxyl, amino, hydroxyl, or heteroaromatic rings containing nitrogen or oxygen) within three carbon atoms from the alpha carbon result in **high yield**; those with hydrophobic or non-coordinating side chains result in **low yield**.**

     - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Entry 34)

2. **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted coordinating groups (e.g., amino, nitro) result in **high yield**; those with non-coordinating or electron-donating substituents (e.g., methyl) result in **low yield**.**
   - *Rationale*: Para-substituted coordinating groups enhance interaction with the catalyst through coordination.

3. **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are heteroaromatic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen atoms capable of coordination (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole rings) result in **high yield**; those with additional aromatic rings or bulky substituents causing steric hindrance result in **low yield**.**
   - *Rationale*: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings coordinate with the metal center, enhancing catalysis; steric hindrance reduces interaction.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid, Entry 21)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 16)

   - *Rationale*: Close proximity of coordinating groups facilitates effective binding to the metal center.
   - *High Yield Examples*:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 17)
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid, Entry 9)

     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 18)
     - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Entry 27)

9. **Rule 9**: **Simple aliphatic carboxylic acids up to eight carbons in length without additional functional groups result in **high yield**; longer chains or increased hydrophobicity may result in **low yield** due to decreased solubility and coordination efficiency.**
   - *Rationale*: Medium-length aliphatic acids maintain solubility and can interact effectively with the catalyst.
   - *High Yield Example*:
     - **Octanoic acid** (Entry 5)
   - *Low Yield Example*:
     - **No longer-chain acids present in the dataset for direct comparison**

10. **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are amino acids or derivatives with sulfur-containing side chains (e.g., methionine derivatives) result in **low yield** due to possible catalyst poisoning or steric hindrance.**
    - *Rationale*: Sulfur-containing side chains may bind too strongly or hinder the catalyst, reducing its activity.
    - *Low Yield Example*:
      - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (Entry 23)

**End of Rules**

These revised rules have been developed to closely align with the dataset and fulfill the specified requirements:

- **Direct Combinations of Functional Groups**: Each rule focuses on specific structural features and combinations of functional groups, such as coordinating groups within certain distances, types of substituents on aromatic rings, or the presence of flexible linkers.

- **Underlying Physicochemical Properties**: The rules are grounded in chemical principles, considering factors like coordination ability, steric hindrance, electronic effects, solubility, and potential catalyst interactions.

- **Clear Predictions**: Each rule clearly states whether modifiers fitting the description will lead to high or low yield, facilitating straightforward application to new structures.

- **Broad Dataset Coverage**: The rules are designed to collectively cover a wide range of the dataset entries, balancing specificity with applicability.

- **Balanced Complexity**: A mixture of simple rules with broad coverage (e.g., Rule 1 on amino acids) and more complex rules addressing specific cases (e.g., Rule 7 on ether linkages) ensures a comprehensive yet practical set of guidelines.

- **Refinement Based on Data**: Existing rules were refined to better match the dataset, correcting inconsistencies (e.g., re-examining entries like **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**) and ensuring that exceptions are accounted for.

By applying these improved rules, researchers can more effectively predict and influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. The rules serve as a valuable tool for guiding the selection and design of molecular modifiers based on their structural features and expected interactions with the catalyst system.---------------------------------------------------------------

Rule Advisor Message:
** Start of Advice **

- **Advice 1**: **Correct and refine the SMARTS patterns in the existing rules to accurately represent the intended chemical structures.** For example, in **Rule 1**, update the SMARTS pattern for heteroaromatic rings containing nitrogen or oxygen atoms by replacing the incorrect pattern `'[a;!c;$(n),$(o)]'` with the correct pattern `'[a;n,o]'` or `'[$([n,o]a)]'`. This matches aromatic rings where the atoms are nitrogen or oxygen, correctly identifying heteroaromatic coordinating groups.

- **Advice 2**: **Implement accurate distance checks using `Chem.rdmolops.GetShortestPath` to ensure coordinating groups are within the specified number of bonds from key atoms.** In **Rule 1** and **Rule 4**, use this function to verify that coordinating groups (e.g., amino, hydroxyl) are within three bonds of the alpha carbon or carboxyl group. This will ensure that only modifiers with functional groups in the correct position are matched.

- **Advice 3**: **Modify the SMARTS patterns for carboxyl groups to precisely match protonated carboxylic acids.** Replace patterns like `'C(=O)O'` with `'C(=O)[OH]'` or `'C(=O)O[H]'` to specifically target the carboxylic acid functional group (`-COOH`), which is relevant under the reaction conditions.

- **Advice 4**: **Adjust the SMARTS patterns in **Rule 2** to accurately match para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating groups.** Use patterns such as `'c1ccc(cc1)[CX3](=O)[OX1H1]'` for benzoic acid derivatives, and include specific positional information for para-substituents, like `'c1cc(ccc1[NH2])C(=O)O'` for 4-aminobenzoic acid.

- **Advice 5**: **Expand the SMARTS patterns in **Rule 3** to include both five- and six-membered heteroaromatic rings containing nitrogen atoms capable of coordination.** Use generalized patterns like `'[cH]1[nH0][cH,c][cH,c][cH,c][cH,c]1C(=O)O'` for pyridine derivatives and `'n1cc[c,n]c1C(=O)O'` for pyrazole derivatives. This ensures compounds like pyridine-3-carboxylic acid and pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid are accurately matched.

- **Advice 6**: **Implement the missing **Rules 4 to 10** in the code to enrich the feature matrix and improve model performance.** Carefully develop SMARTS patterns for each rule that accurately reflect the structural features described. For example:
  - **Rule 4**: For aliphatic carboxylic acids with coordinating groups within three carbons, use patterns like `'C(=O)OCCC[NH2,OH,SH]'`.
  - **Rule 5**: For modifiers with electron-withdrawing coordinating groups, use patterns that include nitro or bromomethyl substituents attached to the aromatic ring.
  - **Rule 6**: For thiol or hydroxyl groups on short aliphatic chains, use patterns like `'C(=O)OCC[SH,OH]'`.

- **Advice 7**: **Validate and refine each rule by testing the SMARTS patterns against the dataset.** For each rule:
  - **Test the patterns** on known high-yield and low-yield examples to ensure correct matching.
  - **Refine the patterns** by adding constraints or removing unnecessary elements to improve specificity.
  - **Ensure no unintended matches** occur, which could introduce errors into the model.

- **Advice 8**: **Improve the rule logic and matching in the code by using accurate conditional statements and loop structures.** Ensure that:
  - The `match` variable accurately reflects whether a molecule satisfies the rule.
  - The code checks all relevant substructures within each molecule.
  - Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) are used correctly to combine conditions.

- **Advice 9**: **Use the `Chem.rdmolops.GetShortestPath` function for rules requiring distance-based criteria between functional groups.** This function allows you to calculate the number of bonds between two atoms, enabling precise implementation of distance constraints in rules like **Rule 1** and **Rule 4**.

- **Advice 10**: **Enhance error handling and debugging by adding informative logging messages and exception handling.**
  - **Logging**: Include statements that report which molecules match each rule and the reasons for matches or mismatches.
  - **Debugging**: Implement try-except blocks to handle unexpected errors, such as issues with molecule parsing or SMARTS pattern matching.

- **Advice 11**: **Optimize rule coverage and balance by adjusting rules to cover more relevant molecules without losing specificity.**
  - **Adjust thresholds**: If a rule is too stringent or too lax, modify parameters like the number of carbons in a chain or the distance to coordinating groups.
  - **Merge similar rules**: Combine rules that target overlapping features to simplify the rule set and improve coverage.
  - **Avoid over-specificity**: Ensure that rules are not tailored to only a few molecules, which can limit the model’s ability to generalize.

- **Advice 12**: **Incorporate additional molecular features into the model to capture other factors influencing yield.**
  - **Physicochemical properties**: Include features like pKa values, logP (octanol-water partition coefficient), and molecular weight.
  - **Molecular descriptors**: Compute descriptors such as topological polar surface area (TPSA), hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and electron density measures.
  - **Fingerprints**: Use molecular fingerprints (e.g., MACCS keys, Morgan fingerprints) to represent substructural features.

- **Advice 13**: **Iteratively refine the model using cross-validation and performance monitoring.**
  - **Cross-validation**: Split the dataset into training and validation sets to evaluate model performance on unseen data.
  - **Performance metrics**: Monitor accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, lift, and leverage to assess model improvements.
  - **SHAP analysis**: Use SHAP values to determine the importance of each rule and feature, guiding further refinements.

- **Advice 14**: **Consult domain experts to ensure the chemical rationale of each rule is sound.**
  - **Chemical validation**: Discuss the rules with chemists to confirm that they align with known reaction mechanisms and catalyst interactions.
  - **Empirical data alignment**: Adjust the rules based on experimental observations and literature reports to improve their relevance and accuracy.

Coverage is strong, supported by multiple high and low yield examples, and the balance between complexity and applicability is appropriately managed.*

- **Comment 2**:

  *Rule 2 is clear and provides straightforward predictions by focusing on aromatic carboxylic acids with specific para-substituents. The physico-chemical rationale is sound, linking the electronic effects of substituents to coordination efficiency. The rule considers combinations of aromatic structures and substituents, meeting the complexity requirement. Coverage is adequate, with several examples supporting both high and low yield outcomes, and the balance between specificity and broad applicability is well-maintained.*

- **Comment 3**:

  *Rule 3 offers clear guidance on the influence of hydroxyl or thiol group positioning in aliphatic carboxylic acids on yield. The physico-chemical insight is adequate, emphasizing the importance of proximity for effective metal binding. The rule addresses complexity by considering both the type and position of functional groups. Coverage is acceptable, with multiple high yield examples and at least one low yield example, ensuring the rule is supported by data. The balance between complexity and coverage is appropriate.*

- **Comment 4**:

  *Rule 4 provides clarity in predicting high yield modifiers containing coordinating nitrogen heterocycles and highlights the detrimental effect of steric hindrance from additional aromatic rings. The physico-chemical reasoning is solid, focusing on coordination ability and steric factors. The rule involves combinations of substructures, satisfying the complexity criterion. Coverage is strong, with multiple supporting examples for both high and low yield, and the rule maintains a good balance between complexity and practical application.*

- **Comment 5**:

  *Rule 5 is clear and states that aliphatic carboxylic acids with ether linkages result in low yield. While the physico-chemical insight could be deeper, it reasonably addresses how increased chain flexibility may reduce effective coordination. The rule has acceptable complexity by focusing on specific chain features. Coverage is sufficient with two low yield examples, and the simplicity of the rule is balanced by its applicability.*

- **Comment 6**:

  *Rule 6 clearly identifies modifiers with aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to key functional groups as leading to low yield, providing a plausible rationale related to catalyst deactivation. The rule meets the complexity criterion by considering the combination of carbonyl groups with other structural features. Coverage is robust, supported by multiple examples, and the balance between specificity and general applicability is well-managed.*

- **Comment 7**:

  *Rule 7, albeit complex, offers clarity by specifying that modifiers with aliphatic linkers connecting aromatic carboxylic acids to additional aromatic rings with coordinating substituents result in high yield. The physico-chemical insight is adequate, suggesting that linkers enhance flexibility and coordination. The rule addresses complexity through the combination of aromatic structures, linkers, and substituents. Coverage is acceptable, with examples supporting both high and low yield cases, achieving a reasonable balance.*

- **Comment 8**:

  *Rule 8 is clear in stating that perfluorinated carboxylic acids result in low yield, supported by a valid physico-chemical rationale related to electron-withdrawing effects and hydrophobicity. However, the coverage is limited, with only one supporting data point (Entry 14). This insufficient coverage weakens the rule's reliability, suggesting that more data is needed to strengthen this rule's applicability.*

- **Comment 9**:

  *Rule 9 provides a clear and straightforward prediction that simple aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of eight carbons or less result in high yield. While the physico-chemical reasoning is plausible, focusing on solubility and steric hindrance, the rule's coverage is minimal, backed by only one example (Entry 5). This limited data support reduces the rule's generalizability and effectiveness despite its clarity.*

- **Comment 10**:

  *Rule 10 effectively distinguishes between modifiers containing sulfur in coordinating functional groups (thiol) versus non-coordinating groups (thioether), providing clear predictions of yield outcomes. The physico-chemical insight is solid, explaining how thiol groups enhance coordination while thioethers may interfere with catalysis. The rule meets the complexity criterion by considering the type of sulfur-containing groups and their coordination ability. Coverage is adequate, with examples for both high and low yield, resulting in a balanced and reliable rule.*

Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **amino acids or amino acid derivatives** with side-chain **coordinating groups** (e.g., carboxyl, amino, hydroxyl) within **three carbons** from the alpha carbon result in **high yield**; those with **hydrophobic side chains** or side chains extending beyond **four carbons** result in **low yield**.
   - *Rationale*: Proximal coordinating groups enhance interaction with the metal center, improving catalyst activity; extended hydrophobic chains reduce solubility and hinder binding.
   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid, Entry 0)
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid, Entry 2)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan, Entry 15)
   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine, Entry 13)
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 33)
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Entry 34)

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **para-substituted coordinating electron-withdrawing groups** (e.g., amino, nitro) result in **high yield**; those with **electron-donating groups** (e.g., methyl, methoxy) or non-coordinating substituents result in **low yield**.
   - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing and coordinating substituents enhance metal coordination; electron-donating groups decrease coordination efficiency.
   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Entry 4)
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Entry 20)
   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 22)
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19)

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **hydroxyl** or **thiol groups** within **three carbons** of the carboxyl group result in **high yield**; if such groups are further than **four carbons** away, they result in **low yield**.
   - *Rationale*: Close proximity of coordinating groups enables effective metal binding.
   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 17)
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid, Entry 9)
   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Entry 29)

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers containing **heteroaromatic rings** with **nitrogen atoms** capable of coordination (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole) result in **high yield**; those with **additional aromatic rings directly attached** (increasing steric hindrance) result in **low yield**.
   - *Rationale*: Nitrogen heterocycles coordinate effectively with metals; steric hindrance reduces accessibility to the metal center.
   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Entry 21)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 16)
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 8)
   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 12)

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **ether linkages** in the chain result in **low yield**.
   - *Rationale*: Ether linkages increase chain flexibility and reduce effective coordination with the catalyst.
   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 11)
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32)

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers with **aldehyde** or **ketone groups** adjacent to the **carboxyl group** or **aromatic ring** result in **low yield** due to potential catalyst deactivation or side reactions.
   - *Rationale*: Carbonyl groups may bind irreversibly to the metal center, inhibiting catalysis.
   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19)
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 18)
     - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Entry 27)

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids linked by aliphatic chains** (three or more carbons) to additional **aromatic rings with coordinating substituents** result in **high yield**; those without such linkers result in **low yield**.
   - *Rationale*: Aliphatic linkers increase flexibility, allowing coordinating groups to interact effectively with the catalyst.
   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** (Entry 24)
     - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Entry 7)
   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 12)
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30)

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **perfluorinated carboxylic acids** result in **low yield**.
   - *Rationale*: Perfluoroalkyl groups are highly electron-withdrawing and hydrophobic, reducing solubility and coordination efficiency.
   - **Low Yield Example**:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Entry 14)

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **simple aliphatic carboxylic acids** without additional functional groups and with chain lengths of **eight carbons or less** result in **high yield**.
   - *Rationale*: Adequate solubility and minimal steric hindrance facilitate interaction with the catalyst.
   - **High Yield Example**:
     - **Octanoic acid** (Entry 5)

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing **sulfur in coordinating functional groups** (e.g., thiol) result in **high yield**, but those with sulfur in **non-coordinating groups** (e.g., thioether) result in **low yield**.
    - *Rationale*: Thiol groups can coordinate with the metal center; non-coordinating sulfur groups may interfere with catalysis.
    - **High Yield Example**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 17)
    - **Low Yield Example**:
      - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (Entry 23)

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been meticulously crafted to align with the dataset and meet the specified requirements:

- **Direct Combinations of Functional Groups**: Each rule focuses on specific combinations of substructures, such as coordinating groups within certain distances, types of substituents, and the presence of specific linkers or substituents, enhancing predictive power.

- **Underlying Physicochemical Properties**: The rules are grounded in chemical principles, considering coordination ability, electronic effects, steric hindrance, and solubility, which influence the catalyst's performance.

- **Clear Predictions**: Each rule explicitly states whether modifiers fitting the description will result in high or low yield, facilitating straightforward application to new structures.

- **Broad Dataset Coverage**: The rules collectively cover a wide range of entries in the dataset, balancing specificity with applicability to ensure meaningful guidance.

- **Balanced Complexity**: A mix of simple rules with broad coverage and more complex rules addressing specific cases ensures a comprehensive yet practical set of guidelines.

By applying these rules, researchers can effectively predict and influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. The rules serve as a valuable tool for guiding the selection and design of molecular modifiers based on their structural features and expected interactions with the catalyst system.---------------------------------------------------------------

Matrix Checker Message:
**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: For **Rule 1**, refine the SMARTS patterns to specifically match amino acids with side-chain coordinating groups within three carbons from the alpha carbon. The current patterns are too general and match any molecule with a primary amine or carboxylic acid group. Use a SMARTS pattern that represents the alpha-amino acid backbone, such as `[NX3][CX4H]([CX3](=O)[OX1H1])[#6]`, ensuring the side chain (`[#6]`) is connected to the alpha carbon and then specify the coordinating groups within three carbons.

- **Suggestion 2**: Modify **Rule 1**'s low-yield patterns to accurately capture side chains extending beyond four carbons or hydrophobic side chains. Replace `[C]{4,}` with a pattern that counts the carbons in the side chain specifically. For example, use recursive SMARTS to define the side chain length, such as `[CX4H2][CX4;!$(C(=O))](CC[CX4H2])[CX3](=O)[OX1H1]` for chains longer than four carbons.

- **Suggestion 3**: For **Rule 2**, adjust the high-yield SMARTS patterns to ensure they match **para-substituted** aromatic carboxylic acids with coordinating electron-withdrawing groups. Use a pattern like `c1ccc(cc1C(=O)O)[NX3H2,NX3H1,NX3+;X3;H1,H0]=[OX1]` for nitro or amino groups in the para position relative to the carboxyl group.

- **Suggestion 4**: Improve **Rule 2**'s low-yield patterns by accurately identifying electron-donating groups in the para position. The current pattern `c1ccc([CH3,OCH3])cc1` is too general. Use more precise patterns like `c1cc([CH3])ccc1C(=O)O` and `c1cc([OCH3])ccc1C(=O)O` to match para-methyl and para-methoxy substituents, respectively.

- **Suggestion 5**: In **Rule 3**, ensure the SMARTS pattern accurately captures aliphatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl or thiol groups within three carbons of the carboxyl group. Adjust the pattern to `[CX3](=O)[OX1H1][CX4][CX4][OX2H,SX2H]` to specify exactly two carbons between the carboxyl group and the hydroxyl or thiol group.

- **Suggestion 6**: For **Rule 4**, refine the high-yield patterns to match heteroaromatic rings with coordinating nitrogen atoms without additional aromatic rings directly attached. Use patterns like `c1cc[nH]c1C(=O)O` (for pyrrole carboxylic acid) and ensure that the patterns exclude fused aromatic systems which increase steric hindrance.

- **Suggestion 7**: For **Rule 4**'s low-yield patterns, the current pattern `[a][a][a]` is too broad. Instead, use a pattern that specifically matches heteroaromatic rings fused with additional aromatic rings, such as `c2ccc1ncccc1c2`, to identify molecules where steric hindrance is increased due to additional rings.

- **Suggestion 8**: In **Rule 5**, consider expanding the low-yield patterns to capture all possible ether linkages in aliphatic chains. The pattern `[CX3](=O)[OX1H1][CX4][OX2][CX4]` may miss molecules with multiple ether linkages or different positions of the ether group. Use a pattern like `[CX3](=O)[OX1H1][CX4]([OX2][CX4])` to match any ether linkage in the chain after the carboxyl group.

- **Suggestion 9**: For **Rule 6**, refine the low-yield patterns to correctly identify aldehyde or ketone groups adjacent to the carboxyl group or aromatic ring. Use patterns like `[CX3](=O)[CX3H0](=O)[OX1H1]` for ketones adjacent to carboxyl groups and `c[CX3H1](=O)` for aldehydes adjacent to aromatic rings.

- **Suggestion 10**: To improve overall accuracy, test each SMARTS pattern against known high-yield and low-yield examples provided in the rules. Verify that high-yield examples match the high-yield patterns and not the low-yield patterns, and vice versa, adjusting the SMARTS patterns as necessary based on these tests.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **amino acids or amino acid derivatives** with side-chain **coordinating groups** (e.g., carboxyl, amino, hydroxyl) within **three carbons** from the alpha carbon result in **high yield**; those with **hydrophobic side chains** or side chains extending beyond **four carbons** result in **low yield**.
   - *Rationale*: Proximal coordinating groups enhance interaction with the metal center, improving catalyst activity; extended hydrophobic chains reduce solubility and hinder binding.
   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid, Entry 0)
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid, Entry 2)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan, Entry 15)
   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine, Entry 13)
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 33)
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Entry 34)

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **para-substituted coordinating electron-withdrawing groups** (e.g., amino, nitro) result in **high yield**; those with **electron-donating groups** (e.g., methyl, methoxy) or non-coordinating substituents result in **low yield**.
   - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing and coordinating substituents enhance metal coordination; electron-donating groups decrease coordination efficiency.
   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Entry 4)
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Entry 20)
   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 22)
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19)

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **hydroxyl** or **thiol groups** within **three carbons** of the carboxyl group result in **high yield**; if such groups are further than **four carbons** away, they result in **low yield**.
   - *Rationale*: Close proximity of coordinating groups enables effective metal binding.
   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 17)
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid, Entry 9)
   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Entry 29)

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers containing **heteroaromatic rings** with **nitrogen atoms** capable of coordination (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole) result in **high yield**; those with **additional aromatic rings directly attached** (increasing steric hindrance) result in **low yield**.
   - *Rationale*: Nitrogen heterocycles coordinate effectively with metals; steric hindrance reduces accessibility to the metal center.
   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Entry 21)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 16)
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 8)
   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 12)

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **ether linkages** in the chain result in **low yield**.
   - *Rationale*: Ether linkages increase chain flexibility and reduce effective coordination with the catalyst.
   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 11)
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32)

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers with **aldehyde** or **ketone groups** adjacent to the **carboxyl group** or **aromatic ring** result in **low yield** due to potential catalyst deactivation or side reactions.
   - *Rationale*: Carbonyl groups may bind irreversibly to the metal center, inhibiting catalysis.
   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19)
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 18)
     - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Entry 27)

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids linked by aliphatic chains** (three or more carbons) to additional **aromatic rings with coordinating substituents** result in **high yield**; those without such linkers result in **low yield**.
   - *Rationale*: Aliphatic linkers increase flexibility, allowing coordinating groups to interact effectively with the catalyst.
   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** (Entry 24)
     - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Entry 7)
   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 12)
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30)

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **perfluorinated carboxylic acids** result in **low yield**.
   - *Rationale*: Perfluoroalkyl groups are highly electron-withdrawing and hydrophobic, reducing solubility and coordination efficiency.
   - **Low Yield Example**:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Entry 14)

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **simple aliphatic carboxylic acids** without additional functional groups and with chain lengths of **eight carbons or less** result in **high yield**.
   - *Rationale*: Adequate solubility and minimal steric hindrance facilitate interaction with the catalyst.
   - **High Yield Example**:
     - **Octanoic acid** (Entry 5)

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing **sulfur in coordinating functional groups** (e.g., thiol) result in **high yield**, but those with sulfur in **non-coordinating groups** (e.g., thioether) result in **low yield**.
    - *Rationale*: Thiol groups can coordinate with the metal center; non-coordinating sulfur groups may interfere with catalysis.
    - **High Yield Example**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 17)
    - **Low Yield Example**:
      - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (Entry 23)

**End of Rules**

---

These rules have been meticulously crafted to align with the dataset and meet the specified requirements:

- **Direct Combinations of Functional Groups**: Each rule focuses on specific combinations of substructures, such as coordinating groups within certain distances, types of substituents, and the presence of specific linkers or substituents, enhancing predictive power.

- **Underlying Physicochemical Properties**: The rules are grounded in chemical principles, considering coordination ability, electronic effects, steric hindrance, and solubility, which influence the catalyst's performance.

- **Clear Predictions**: Each rule explicitly states whether modifiers fitting the description will result in high or low yield, facilitating straightforward application to new structures.

- **Broad Dataset Coverage**: The rules collectively cover a wide range of entries in the dataset, balancing specificity with applicability to ensure meaningful guidance.

- **Balanced Complexity**: A mix of simple rules with broad coverage and more complex rules addressing specific cases ensures a comprehensive yet practical set of guidelines.

By applying these rules, researchers can effectively predict and influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. The rules serve as a valuable tool for guiding the selection and design of molecular modifiers based on their structural features and expected interactions with the catalyst system.---------------------------------------------------------------

Matrix Checker Message:
** Start of Suggestions **
- ** Suggestion 1 **: **Align the SMILES list with the dataset entries mentioned in the rules.** Ensure that the SMILES strings correspond to the correct entry numbers as referenced in the rules. There appears to be a mismatch between the SMILES list and the entries in the rules, which can lead to incorrect feature assignments. Verify the ordering and correctness of the SMILES to accurately reflect the dataset.

- ** Suggestion 2 **: **Revise the SMARTS patterns to accurately represent the chemical structures described in the rules.** For example, in **Rule 1**, the current SMARTS pattern for the amino acid backbone (`[NX3;H2][CHX4][CX3](=O)[OX2H1]`) may not capture all amino acids and their derivatives effectively. Consider using more comprehensive patterns like `[NX3;H2][CX4H]([*])[CX3](=O)[OX2H1]` to account for variations in the side chains.

- ** Suggestion 3 **: **Implement side-chain-specific SMARTS patterns that consider the distance from the alpha carbon.** For **Rule 1**, create SMARTS patterns that identify side-chain coordinating groups (carboxyl, amino, hydroxyl) within three carbons of the alpha carbon. Use recursive SMARTS or atom mapping to measure the distance between functional groups.

- ** Suggestion 4 **: **Modify the hydrophobic chain definition to detect side chains extending beyond four carbons.** The current pattern (`'[CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH3]'`) only matches specific chains. Instead, use a more general pattern like `'[CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H2][CX4H3]'` or leverage atom counts to match any hydrophobic chain longer than four carbons.

- ** Suggestion 5 **: **Enhance the SMARTS patterns to capture electron-withdrawing and electron-donating substituents correctly.** For **Rule 2**, ensure that patterns for para-substituted groups accurately reflect the positions and types of substituents. Use position-specific aromatic SMARTS patterns like `'c1ccc([NX3;H2])cc1C(=O)O'` for para-amino and include patterns for other electron-withdrawing groups.

- ** Suggestion 6 **: **Incorporate spatial and positional relationships in SMARTS patterns for rules involving distance constraints.** For rules like **Rule 3** and **Rule 6**, where functional groups need to be within a certain number of atoms from each other, use RDKit's shortest path functions or graph-based methods to calculate distances between atoms.

- ** Suggestion 7 **: **Differentiate between coordinating and non-coordinating sulfur groups in **Rule 10** by refining the SMARTS patterns.** Ensure that thiol groups (`[SX2H]`) and thioether groups (`[SX2][#6]`) are correctly identified, and adjust the code to assign the appropriate prediction based on their coordinating ability.

- ** Suggestion 8 **: **Use RDKit's built-in functionality to identify functional groups more reliably.** RDKit has predefined functions and substructure matchers for common functional groups, which can reduce errors and improve pattern matching accuracy.

- ** Suggestion 9 **: **Add comprehensive error handling and validation steps in the code.** This includes checking for molecules that cannot be parsed, handling exceptions during substructure searches, and verifying that each SMARTS pattern matches the intended structures without producing false positives or negatives.

- ** Suggestion 10 **: **Thoroughly test the updated code against known examples from the dataset.** Use the high-yield and low-yield examples provided in each rule to validate that the SMARTS patterns and prediction logic correctly assign the expected values in the feature matrix.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Current rules:
**Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **amino acids or amino acid derivatives** with side-chain **coordinating groups** (e.g., carboxyl, amino, hydroxyl) within **three carbons** from the alpha carbon result in **high yield**; those with **hydrophobic side chains** or side chains extending beyond **four carbons** result in **low yield**.
   - *Rationale*: Proximal coordinating groups enhance interaction with the metal center, improving catalyst activity; extended hydrophobic chains reduce solubility and hinder binding.
   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid, Entry 0)
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid, Entry 2)
     - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan, Entry 15)
   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine, Entry 13)
     - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** (Entry 33)
     - **8-aminooctanoic acid** (Entry 34)

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **para-substituted coordinating electron-withdrawing groups** (e.g., amino, nitro) result in **high yield**; those with **electron-donating groups** (e.g., methyl, methoxy) or non-coordinating substituents result in **low yield**.
   - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing and coordinating substituents enhance metal coordination; electron-donating groups decrease coordination efficiency.
   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Entry 4)
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Entry 20)
   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 22)
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19)

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **hydroxyl** or **thiol groups** within **three carbons** of the carboxyl group result in **high yield**; if such groups are further than **four carbons** away, they result in **low yield**.
   - *Rationale*: Close proximity of coordinating groups enables effective metal binding.
   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 17)
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid, Entry 9)
   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Entry 29)

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers containing **heteroaromatic rings** with **nitrogen atoms** capable of coordination (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole) result in **high yield**; those with **additional aromatic rings directly attached** (increasing steric hindrance) result in **low yield**.
   - *Rationale*: Nitrogen heterocycles coordinate effectively with metals; steric hindrance reduces accessibility to the metal center.
   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Entry 21)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 16)
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 8)
   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 12)

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **ether linkages** in the chain result in **low yield**.
   - *Rationale*: Ether linkages increase chain flexibility and reduce effective coordination with the catalyst.
   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 11)
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32)

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers with **aldehyde** or **ketone groups** adjacent to the **carboxyl group** or **aromatic ring** result in **low yield** due to potential catalyst deactivation or side reactions.
   - *Rationale*: Carbonyl groups may bind irreversibly to the metal center, inhibiting catalysis.
   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19)
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 18)
     - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Entry 27)

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids linked by aliphatic chains** (three or more carbons) to additional **aromatic rings with coordinating substituents** result in **high yield**; those without such linkers result in **low yield**.
   - *Rationale*: Aliphatic linkers increase flexibility, allowing coordinating groups to interact effectively with the catalyst.
   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** (Entry 24)
     - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Entry 7)
   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 12)
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30)

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **perfluorinated carboxylic acids** result in **low yield**.
   - *Rationale*: Perfluoroalkyl groups are highly electron-withdrawing and hydrophobic, reducing solubility and coordination efficiency.
   - **Low Yield Example**:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Entry 14)

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **simple aliphatic carboxylic acids** without additional functional groups and with chain lengths of **eight carbons or less** result in **high yield**.
   - *Rationale*: Adequate solubility and minimal steric hindrance facilitate interaction with the catalyst.
   - **High Yield Example**:
     - **Octanoic acid** (Entry 5)

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing **sulfur in coordinating functional groups** (e.g., thiol) result in **high yield**, but those with sulfur in **non-coordinating groups** (e.g., thioether) result in **low yield**.
    - *Rationale*: Thiol groups can coordinate with the metal center; non-coordinating sulfur groups may interfere with catalysis.
    - **High Yield Example**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 17)
    - **Low Yield Example**:
      - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (Entry 23)

**End of Rules**

These rules have been meticulously crafted to align with the dataset and meet the specified requirements:

- **Direct Combinations of Functional Groups**: Each rule focuses on specific combinations of substructures, such as coordinating groups within certain distances, types of substituents, and the presence of specific linkers or substituents, enhancing predictive power.

- **Underlying Physicochemical Properties**: The rules are grounded in chemical principles, considering coordination ability, electronic effects, steric hindrance, and solubility, which influence the catalyst's performance.

- **Clear Predictions**: Each rule explicitly states whether modifiers fitting the description will result in high or low yield, facilitating straightforward application to new structures.

- **Broad Dataset Coverage**: The rules collectively cover a wide range of entries in the dataset, balancing specificity with applicability to ensure meaningful guidance.

- **Balanced Complexity**: A mix of simple rules with broad coverage and more complex rules addressing specific cases ensures a comprehensive yet practical set of guidelines.

By applying these rules, researchers can effectively predict and influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. The rules serve as a valuable tool for guiding the selection and design of molecular modifiers based on their structural features and expected interactions with the catalyst system.---------------------------------------------------------------

**Start of Suggestions**

- **Suggestion 1**: **Improve Rule 1** by enhancing the detection of coordinating groups and hydrophobic chains. The current implementation doesn’t reliably check for side-chain coordinating groups within three carbons of the alpha carbon. To improve:
  - Ensure the alpha carbon is correctly identified using both the amino and carboxyl groups as neighbors. Then, apply `Chem.GetShortestPath` from the alpha carbon to potential coordinating groups, checking paths no longer than three bonds.
  - Refine hydrophobic side-chain detection to avoid extended search times by pre-defining substructures like alkyl chains longer than four carbons and performing a straightforward substructure match.

- **Suggestion 2**: **Fix Rule 2 for Electron-Withdrawing and Electron-Donating Groups**. The code does not accurately distinguish between electron-withdrawing (EWG) and electron-donating groups (EDG) in para positions. Improve by:
  - Correcting the `para_substituted_aromatic` SMARTS pattern to enforce para substitution.
  - Implementing separate checks using `HasSubstructMatch` for EWGs and EDGs on the identified para position of the aromatic ring.

- **Suggestion 3**: **Refine Rule 3 for Proximity of Hydroxyl or Thiol Groups to Carboxyl Group**. The code does not sufficiently check distances beyond three carbons for hydroxyl or thiol groups. Enhance by:
  - Using `Chem.FindAtomEnvironmentOfRadiusN` to create a subgraph around the carboxyl carbon to catch groups within a three-bond radius.
  - For groups beyond three bonds, use `Chem.GetShortestPath` to verify any detected hydroxyl or thiol groups at distances greater than four bonds, marking those cases for low yield.

- **Suggestion 4**: **Correct Rule 4 for Heteroaromatic Rings with Nitrogen and Additional Aromatic Rings**. The current rule doesn’t differentiate between heteroaromatics with coordinating nitrogen and those with steric hindrance due to additional rings. Improve by:
  - Defining a separate SMARTS pattern for additional aromatic rings directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring, such as `c1ccc(cc1)-c2cnccc2`.
  - Using `HasSubstructMatch` to first check for heteroaromatics with nitrogen and then applying the additional aromatic ring check to toggle between high and low yield values accordingly.

- **Suggestion 5**: **Refine Rule 5 for Ether Linkages in Aliphatic Chains**. The current code doesn’t restrict ether linkage detection to aliphatic carboxylic acids. To fix:
  - Apply `HasSubstructMatch` for the ether linkage only if the molecule matches the `carboxylic_acid` pattern first.
  - Ensure the ether linkage is within the main chain rather than branching out by using linear search patterns for aliphatic chains in combination with ether.

- **Suggestion 6**: **Modify Rule 6 for Carbonyl Groups Near Carboxyl Groups or Aromatic Rings**. The logic for detecting aldehydes or ketones near carboxyl groups is too broad. Improve by:
  - Refining the SMARTS patterns to explicitly capture adjacency to carboxyl groups or aromatic rings.
  - Checking the bond distance between carbonyl and carboxyl or aromatic rings, focusing only on immediate neighbors (one or two bonds away).

- **Suggestion 7**: **Enhance Rule 7 for Aliphatic Chains Linking Aromatic Rings**. Currently, it’s challenging to detect long aliphatic chains between aromatic rings. To improve:
  - Define a custom SMARTS pattern that includes a minimum of three carbons in the aliphatic linker between two aromatic rings.
  - Apply additional checks to confirm coordinating substituents on the second aromatic ring by filtering based on group types like hydroxyl or amino.

- **Suggestion 8**: **Strengthen Rule 9 for Simple Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids with Limited Chain Lengths**. Adjust the rule to more precisely target unbranched, low-molecular-weight aliphatic acids:
  - Define a SMARTS pattern to match simple, linear aliphatic carboxylic acids up to eight carbons, excluding additional substituents.
  - Use atom count or molecular weight constraints to avoid capturing larger molecules or those with additional functionalities.

- **Suggestion 9**: **Adjust Rule 10 for Thiol vs. Thioether Sulfur Coordination**. The rule should distinguish between coordinating thiols and non-coordinating thioethers more clearly:
  - Use separate SMARTS patterns for thiol `[SX2H]` and thioether `[SX2][#6]`, ensuring the thiol group is counted positively and thioether negatively within the feature matrix.
  - Consider implementing error handling to account for misidentified sulfur groups, as RDKit may misinterpret similar sulfur-containing substructures.

- **Suggestion 10**: **Add Error Logging and Verification for SMARTS Matches**. Implement logging for each rule’s SMARTS match results to verify correct application. This will aid in debugging and ensure transformations align with expected chemical features:
  - Log each molecule’s SMILES with a summary of matched substructures.
  - Implement unit tests or example-based tests to validate that each rule consistently produces expected high/low yields for known example compounds.

### Analysis of Current Rule Performance

Based on the current rule metrics, particularly focusing on **confidence** and **lift**, we can draw some conclusions regarding the performance of the rules in their current form. Here's a detailed analysis comparing the **current metrics** to the **reference metrics**:

#### 1. **Confidence Analysis**
   - The **current train confidence** values (e.g., 0.652, 0.568, 0.725, 0.514) show a generally higher confidence than the **previous reference confidence values** for both train (0.635 and 0.539) and test (0.333 and 0.463). This suggests that the current rules have a strong level of reliability in predicting outcomes based on conditions, especially when compared to past iterations.
   - Higher confidence indicates that, for the training dataset, the rule predictions are often accurate when the rule conditions are met. Rules like the one with 0.725 confidence show particularly strong predictive power, implying well-defined conditions that lead to consistent results.

#### 2. **Lift Analysis**
   - **Lift values** in the current rules are also relatively high compared to the reference lift values. Notably, some rules have lift values exceeding **1.3** (e.g., 1.306 and 1.452), significantly above the baseline reference lift for both train (1.20 and 1.05) and test (0.688 and 0.913).
   - Lift values above 1 indicate that these rules are capturing meaningful associations that go beyond what would be expected by chance. For example, the rule with a lift of **1.452** suggests a particularly strong association between its conditions and the predicted outcome. This high lift implies that the rule significantly increases the probability of the predicted outcome occurring, making it a valuable predictive tool.

#### 3. **Support and Leverage Observations**
   - **Support** in the current metrics tends to be lower compared to previous metrics, with values like 0.0119 and 0.0389. This indicates that while the rules are predictive, they apply to a relatively small subset of the data. Low support can be a limitation if the goal is to develop broadly applicable rules.
   - **Leverage** values are positive in most of the current rules, though relatively small (e.g., 0.005, 0.017, 0.009), suggesting that while these rules are capturing non-random associations, they may still be limited in the additional support they bring over what would be expected by chance.

#### 4. **Identifying Local Minimums and Iteration Sufficiency**
   - Based on the current metrics, we observe a **higher confidence and lift** in most rules, suggesting that we are likely approaching a local optimum in terms of rule performance. However, some rules exhibit a **train lift close to 1.0** (e.g., 1.0 for two rules), indicating that these particular rules may not provide much additional predictive value and could potentially be revised or removed.
   - The improvement in confidence and lift across most rules, compared to reference metrics, suggests we have made notable progress. However, the presence of rules with lower applicability (low support) and marginal predictive improvement (lift close to 1) implies that further refinement could be beneficial to remove redundancies and improve coverage.

### Recommendations for Improving Current Rules

1. **Consolidate Low-Support Rules**:
   - Rules with very low support may be too specific or niche, limiting their generalizability. Consider consolidating or generalizing these rules to increase their applicability. For example, rules with extremely narrow structural criteria could be broadened to cover a wider range of molecular structures, enhancing their support without significantly compromising confidence.

2. **Focus on High-Lift Rules**:
   - Rules with higher lift values (e.g., around 1.3 to 1.45) should be prioritized and potentially expanded. These high-lift rules demonstrate strong associations and can provide reliable guidance in catalyst performance predictions. Exploring additional structural or functional group variations within the conditions of these high-lift rules may reveal further refinements.

3. **Refine or Eliminate Rules with Lift Close to 1**:
   - Rules that show a lift value close to 1 (e.g., the two rules with 1.0 lift) may not add significant predictive value, as they do not increase the likelihood of the predicted outcome. These rules should be critically evaluated, potentially revised to introduce stronger associations, or even removed if they do not contribute meaningfully.

4. **Increase Dataset Coverage**:
   - To address low support, consider adding more training data or seeking ways to modify rule criteria that would apply to a broader portion of the dataset. Increasing the generalizability of high-lift rules might help improve support without sacrificing predictive performance.

5. **Experiment with Alternative Functional Group Combinations**:
   - Some rules focus heavily on specific functional groups and distances within molecules (e.g., coordinating groups within three carbons). Exploring other combinations or extending allowable distances might reveal new high-lift, high-confidence rules that apply to additional dataset entries.

6. **Evaluate Rule Applicability in Test Sets**:
   - While the focus here has been on training metrics, it's important to periodically validate these rules on an independent test set to ensure they generalize well. Rules that perform well in training but poorly in test datasets may need further revision.

### Summary

The current rule set shows promising improvements in confidence and lift over previous iterations, indicating enhanced predictive performance. However, the low support for many rules and the presence of rules with lift values near 1 suggest that some refinements are still needed. By focusing on high-lift, high-confidence rules and improving rule generalizability, the rule set can be further optimized to provide broader and more reliable predictive guidance in the catalytic problem.

**建议优化模型策略**

通过对比模型在训练集和验证集上的表现，尤其关注SHAP值对结果的影响，我们可以得出一些改进模型的策略。对于导致负SHAP值较大的规则，我们需要着重优化，以确保模型能够更准确地捕捉不同因素对预测结果的正负影响。以下是几点具体建议：

1. **高负SHAP值规则调整**：针对当前规则中存在负SHAP值较大的情况，我们可以逐步调整特征权重或者引入新特征，以减少模型低估负载的风险。可以特别关注在实验值明显高于预测值时，这些规则对负载估计的偏差，进一步优化相关权重。

2. **高正SHAP值规则修正**：在模型中，某些规则的高正SHAP值可能导致负载估计偏高。我们可以对这些规则重新调整特征重要性，或者考虑增加特征约束，以抑制预测值过高的情况，从而提高模型的整体精确度。

3. **提升模型泛化能力**：目前的模型在验证集上的准确性略低于期望值，可能是由于模型出现了轻微的欠拟合。可以考虑通过增大训练集的多样性，或引入更复杂的特征工程方法，提升模型的泛化能力，从而在验证集上获得更好的表现。

4. **SHAP分析中的异常值处理**：利用SHAP值进一步分析负载预测与实验值的偏差，可能会发现部分数据点对模型预测的误差贡献较大。可以对这些异常值重新建模，或者调整模型的目标权重，以减少它们对整体准确性的影响。

5. **规则优先级调整**：在当前规则矩阵中，部分规则对最终结果的贡献值可能过高或者过低。通过重新评估SHAP值的分布情况，可以合理调整规则的优先级，以确保模型对负载的估计更为稳定、可靠。

6. **反复验证和迭代**：建议在当前规则框架的基础上进行微调，同时通过增量训练和实时反馈，不断验证模型在新数据上的表现，保证模型的稳定性和准确性。

在这些步骤实施后，再次通过模型验证和SHAP值分析来检查调整的效果，以确认优化策略的可行性和有效性。

**Summary of Discussions and Suggestions for Improving Current Rules**

In the previous discussions, we have thoroughly analyzed the current set of rules designed to predict the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction catalyzed by the modified Hf-TPY-MOL(Fe) system. The key points and suggestions from the discussions are as follows:

1. **Analysis of Current Rule Performance**:

   - **Confidence and Lift**: The current rules demonstrate improved confidence and lift compared to previous iterations. High confidence values (e.g., 0.725) and lift values exceeding 1.3 indicate strong predictive power and meaningful associations between the rule conditions and the reaction yield.

   - **Support and Leverage**: Despite the improved confidence and lift, some rules have low support, meaning they apply to a small subset of the dataset. Low leverage values suggest limited additional predictive value over random chance for these rules.

   - **Opportunity for Refinement**: Rules with lift values close to 1.0 may not significantly contribute to predictive performance and could be candidates for refinement or removal.

2. **Suggestions for Improving Current Rules**:

   - **Enhance Detection of Coordinating Groups (Rule 1)**:
     - **Issue**: The current implementation may not reliably detect side-chain coordinating groups within three carbons of the alpha carbon.
     - **Improvement**: Use cheminformatics methods like `Chem.GetShortestPath` to accurately identify alpha carbons and measure distances to coordinating groups. Refine the detection of hydrophobic side chains by defining specific substructures for alkyl chains longer than four carbons.

   - **Accurately Distinguish Electron-Withdrawing and Donating Groups (Rule 2)**:
     - **Issue**: The code may not correctly differentiate between electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups in para positions.
     - **Improvement**: Correct the SMARTS patterns to enforce para substitution and separately check for electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups using appropriate substructure matching.

   - **Refine Proximity Checks for Hydroxyl or Thiol Groups (Rule 3)**:
     - **Issue**: The current rule may not adequately assess the proximity of hydroxyl or thiol groups to the carboxyl group.
     - **Improvement**: Utilize methods like `Chem.FindAtomEnvironmentOfRadiusN` to create subgraphs around the carboxyl carbon, ensuring accurate detection of coordinating groups within a three-bond radius.

   - **Differentiate Steric Hindrance in Heteroaromatic Rings (Rule 4)**:
     - **Issue**: The rule may not effectively distinguish between heteroaromatic rings with coordinating nitrogen atoms and those with additional aromatic rings causing steric hindrance.
     - **Improvement**: Define separate SMARTS patterns for heteroaromatics with and without additional aromatic rings, using substructure searches to apply the rule conditions accurately.

   - **Restrict Ether Linkage Detection to Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids (Rule 5)**:
     - **Issue**: Ether linkage detection may not be limited to aliphatic carboxylic acids.
     - **Improvement**: Ensure that the ether linkage check is only applied after confirming the molecule matches the aliphatic carboxylic acid pattern, and that the ether linkage is part of the main chain.

   - **Precisely Detect Carbonyl Groups Adjacent to Key Functional Groups (Rule 6)**:
     - **Issue**: The detection of aldehyde or ketone groups near carboxyl groups or aromatic rings might be too broad.
     - **Improvement**: Refine SMARTS patterns to capture carbonyl groups adjacent to carboxyl groups or aromatic rings, focusing on immediate neighbors.

   - **Improve Detection of Aliphatic Chains Linking Aromatic Rings (Rule 7)**:
     - **Issue**: Difficulty in detecting aliphatic chains of sufficient length between aromatic rings.
     - **Improvement**: Define SMARTS patterns that specify a minimum number of carbons in the aliphatic linker and confirm the presence of coordinating substituents on the second aromatic ring.

   - **Target Simple Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids More Precisely (Rule 9)**:
     - **Issue**: The rule may not precisely target unbranched, low-molecular-weight aliphatic acids.
     - **Improvement**: Create SMARTS patterns for linear aliphatic carboxylic acids with up to eight carbons, excluding molecules with additional substituents or branching.

   - **Distinguish Between Thiol and Thioether Groups (Rule 10)**:
     - **Issue**: The rule might not clearly differentiate between coordinating thiol groups and non-coordinating thioether groups.
     - **Improvement**: Use specific SMARTS patterns for thiol (`[SX2H]`) and thioether (`[SX2][#6]`) groups to ensure accurate classification.

   - **Implement Error Logging and Verification**:
     - **Issue**: Without logging, it's challenging to verify the correct application of SMARTS patterns.
     - **Improvement**: Add logging statements to record substructure matches for each molecule, aiding in debugging and ensuring the rules are applied as intended.

3. **Recommendations Based on Model Performance and SHAP Analysis**:

   - **Adjust Rules Influencing Negative SHAP Values**:
     - **Issue**: Certain rules contribute to underestimation of the catalyst loading, as indicated by high negative SHAP values.
     - **Improvement**: Reassess and adjust these rules to reduce their negative impact on predictions, possibly by refining the conditions or weighting.

   - **Reevaluate Rules with High Positive SHAP Values**:
     - **Issue**: Rules with high positive SHAP values may lead to overestimation of catalyst loading.
     - **Improvement**: Modify these rules to prevent overprediction, ensuring they do not disproportionately influence the model outputs.

   - **Enhance Model Generalization**:
     - **Issue**: Slight underfitting may be occurring, as indicated by validation accuracy.
     - **Improvement**: Increase training data diversity and consider advanced feature engineering to improve the model's ability to generalize.

   - **Handle Outliers in SHAP Analysis**:
     - **Issue**: Some data points significantly contribute to prediction errors.
     - **Improvement**: Identify and possibly exclude or adjust these outliers to minimize their impact on the model.

   - **Adjust Rule Priorities Based on SHAP Value Distributions**:
     - **Issue**: The importance of some rules may need reevaluation.
     - **Improvement**: Use SHAP value distributions to adjust rule priorities, emphasizing rules that contribute positively to accurate predictions.

   - **Iterative Validation and Refinement**:
     - **Issue**: Continuous improvement is essential for optimal model performance.
     - **Improvement**: Employ iterative training and validation cycles, adjusting rules based on performance metrics and SHAP analysis.

**Judgment on Further Optimization**

Considering the analysis and suggestions provided, there is a significant possibility for further optimization of the current rules without overfitting. Refining the rules as suggested will likely enhance the model's predictive performance and general applicability.

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

1. **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **amino acids or amino acid derivatives** with side-chain **coordinating groups** (e.g., carboxyl, amino, hydroxyl) within **three carbons** from the alpha carbon result in **high yield**; those with **hydrophobic side chains** or side chains extending beyond **four carbons** result in **low yield**.
   - *Rationale*: Proximal coordinating groups enhance interaction with the metal center, improving catalyst activity; extended hydrophobic chains reduce solubility and hinder binding.
   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid, Entry 0)
     - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid, Entry 2)

2. **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids** with **para-substituted coordinating electron-withdrawing groups** (e.g., amino, nitro) result in **high yield**; those with **electron-donating groups** (e.g., methyl, methoxy) or non-coordinating substituents result in **low yield**.
   - *Rationale*: Electron-withdrawing and coordinating substituents enhance metal coordination; electron-donating groups decrease coordination efficiency.
   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **4-aminobenzoic acid** (Entry 4)
     - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (Entry 20)
   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **4-methylbenzoic acid** (Entry 22)
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19)

3. **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **hydroxyl** or **thiol groups** within **three carbons** of the carboxyl group result in **high yield**; if such groups are further than **four carbons** away, they result in **low yield**.
   - *Rationale*: Close proximity of coordinating groups enables effective metal binding.
   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 17)
     - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid, Entry 9)
   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** (Entry 29)

4. **Rule 4**: Modifiers containing **heteroaromatic rings** with **nitrogen atoms** capable of coordination (e.g., pyridine, pyrazole) result in **high yield**; those with **additional aromatic rings directly attached** (increasing steric hindrance) result in **low yield**.
   - *Rationale*: Nitrogen heterocycles coordinate effectively with metals; steric hindrance reduces accessibility to the metal center.
   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Entry 21)
     - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 16)
     - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** (Entry 8)
   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 12)

5. **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids** with **ether linkages** in the chain result in **low yield**.
   - *Rationale*: Ether linkages increase chain flexibility and reduce effective coordination with the catalyst.
   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** (Entry 11)
     - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** (Entry 32)

6. **Rule 6**: Modifiers with **aldehyde** or **ketone groups** adjacent to the **carboxyl group** or **aromatic ring** result in **low yield** due to potential catalyst deactivation or side reactions.
   - *Rationale*: Carbonyl groups may bind irreversibly to the metal center, inhibiting catalysis.
   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **4-formylbenzoic acid** (Entry 19)
     - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid** (Entry 18)
     - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** (Entry 27)

7. **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids linked by aliphatic chains** (three or more carbons) to additional **aromatic rings with coordinating substituents** result in **high yield**; those without such linkers result in **low yield**.
   - *Rationale*: Aliphatic linkers increase flexibility, allowing coordinating groups to interact effectively with the catalyst.
   - **High Yield Examples**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** (Entry 24)
     - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** (Entry 7)
   - **Low Yield Examples**:
     - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** (Entry 12)
     - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** (Entry 30)

8. **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **perfluorinated carboxylic acids** result in **low yield**.
   - *Rationale*: Perfluoroalkyl groups are highly electron-withdrawing and hydrophobic, reducing solubility and coordination efficiency.
   - **Low Yield Example**:
     - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** (Entry 14)

9. **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **simple aliphatic carboxylic acids** without additional functional groups and with chain lengths of **eight carbons or less** result in **high yield**.
   - *Rationale*: Adequate solubility and minimal steric hindrance facilitate interaction with the catalyst.
   - **High Yield Example**:
     - **Octanoic acid** (Entry 5)

10. **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing **sulfur in coordinating functional groups** (e.g., thiol) result in **high yield**, but those with sulfur in **non-coordinating groups** (e.g., thioether) result in **low yield**.
    - *Rationale*: Thiol groups can coordinate with the metal center; non-coordinating sulfur groups may interfere with catalysis.
    - **High Yield Example**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** (Entry 17)
    - **Low Yield Example**:
      - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** (Entry 23)
