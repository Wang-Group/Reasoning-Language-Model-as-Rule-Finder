**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers with both amino and carboxylic acid groups (e.g., Î±-amino acids like (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid or (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid) generally result in **high yield**. This combination facilitates coordination with the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers containing halogen atoms attached to an aromatic ring, specifically bromine (e.g., 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid), lead to a **high yield**. Halogens can stabilize reaction intermediates through inductive effects, promoting the functionalization process.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that have both hydroxyl and phenyl groups in their structure (e.g., 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid and 30) tend to correlate with a **low yield**. The presence of electron-donating hydroxyl groups on the aromatic ring may interfere with catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with heterocyclic nitrogen-containing rings and carboxylic acid groups (e.g., 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid and pyridine-3-carboxylic acid) often result in a **high yield**. Nitrogen atoms can coordinate with Fe ions, stabilizing the catalytic species.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that include sulfur-containing groups, such as sulfanyl or thioether groups (e.g., 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid), generally produce a **low yield**. Sulfur atoms may bind strongly to the Fe catalyst, potentially deactivating it.

- **Rule 6**: Linear aliphatic carboxylic acids with medium chain lengths (e.g., octanoic acid) are associated with a **high yield**. These modifiers may enhance hydrophobic interactions, improving catalyst accessibility.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with strong electron-withdrawing groups like nitro (e.g., 4-nitrobenzoic acid) lead to a **high yield**. Electron-deficient aromatic rings can facilitate radical formation and stabilize transition states.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing aldehyde groups attached to an aromatic ring (e.g., 4-formylbenzoic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid) usually correlate with a **low yield**. Aldehyde groups may react with radicals or the catalyst, leading to side reactions.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with fluorinated alkyl chains (e.g., 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid) tend to result in a **low yield**. Fluorine's strong electronegativity can decrease the electron density required for effective catalyst interaction.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers that are amino acids with aromatic side chains (e.g., (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid) generally lead to a **low yield**. The bulky aromatic side chain may hinder proper coordination with the catalyst.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers containing multiple hydroxyl groups (e.g., (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid) are associated with a **high yield**. Multiple hydroxyl groups can enhance solubility and interaction with the catalyst.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with methoxy groups on aromatic rings (e.g., 4-methylbenzoic acid and 22) tend to produce a **low yield**. Methoxy groups are electron-donating, which may interfere with catalyst activity.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with pyridine rings connected via aliphatic chains (e.g., 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid) typically result in a **high yield**. The pyridine nitrogen can coordinate with Fe ions, enhancing catalyst efficiency.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are long-chain amino acids or acids with additional amide groups (e.g., (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid) generally correlate with a **low yield**. Additional amide groups may compete for catalyst binding sites or sterically hinder reactions.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers containing bulky substituents with electron-rich heterocycles (e.g., (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid) often lead to a **high yield**. Electron-rich heterocycles may stabilize radicals and facilitate the reaction.

**End of Rules**

These rules highlight how specific functional groups and structural features of molecular modifiers influence the reaction yield, providing guidance for selecting modifiers to achieve optimal results.---------------------------------------------------------------
