**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **α-amino acids with dicarboxylic acid groups**, such as **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** and **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid**, result in a **High Yield**.

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers that are **small ω-amino aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths of five or fewer carbons**, like **5-aminopentanoic acid**, lead to a **High Yield**.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups**, such as **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** and **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid**, result in a **High Yield**.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position**, like **4-nitrobenzoic acid** and **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid**, lead to a **High Yield**.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-amino groups**, such as **4-aminobenzoic acid**, result in a **High Yield**.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers that are **nitrogen-containing heterocyclic carboxylic acids where the carboxyl group is directly attached to the ring**, including **pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**, **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**, and **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**, result in a **High Yield**.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with long hydrocarbon chains and without additional functional groups**, such as **octanoic acid**, result in a **High Yield**.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers that are **aromatic amino acids with extended conjugation**, like **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (tryptophan), result in a **High Yield**.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers that are **ω-amino aliphatic carboxylic acids with chain lengths longer than five carbons**, such as **7-aminoheptanoic acid** and **8-aminooctanoic acid**, result in a **Low Yield**.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing **sulfur-functional groups**, like **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** and **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**, lead to a **Low Yield**.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid**, such as **4-formylbenzoic acid** and **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**, result in a **Low Yield**.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **perfluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups**, like **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** and **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**, result in a **Low Yield**.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with long chain ether linkages**, such as **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**, result in a **Low Yield**.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with weak electron-donating groups at the para position**, like **4-methylbenzoic acid** and **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**, result in a **Low Yield**.

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers featuring **bulky amide groups near coordinating sites**, such as **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**, tend to result in a **Low Yield**.
