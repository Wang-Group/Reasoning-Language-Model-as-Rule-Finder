- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is **clear**, stating that modifiers with electron-donating groups (EDGs) connected via a flexible aliphatic linker (three or more carbons) result in a **high yield**. The **property insight** is logical, noting that the flexible linker allows better alignment with the catalyst, mitigating the deactivating effects of EDGs. The rule has **moderate complexity**, considering both the presence of EDGs and the length of the aliphatic linker. **Coverage** is sufficient, with high yield examples like 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid and low yield counterexamples such as 4-methylbenzoic acid.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 is **clear** and **simple**, indicating that medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (chains of 6–8 carbons) without polar substituents result in a **high yield**.

To improve, additional supporting examples would strengthen the rule's applicability.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 is **clear**, distinguishing between aliphatic thiols leading to a **high yield** and aromatic thiols leading to a **low yield**. The **property insight** explains that aliphatic thiols coordinate effectively without steric hindrance. The rule has **moderate complexity**, considering both the functional group and its aliphatic or aromatic nature. **Coverage** is limited, with 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid as the high yield example and 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid as a low yield counterexample. Including more data points would enhance the rule's robustness.

- **Comment 8**: Rule 8 is **clear**, stating that modifiers with **ketone or amide groups adjacent to carboxylic acids** result in a **low yield**. The **property insight** is sound, indicating that additional carbonyl groups may create steric hindrance or compete for coordination. The rule's **complexity** is acceptable, focusing on specific structural features that negatively impact yield. **Coverage** is adequate, with examples like 4-oxoheptanedioic acid and (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid supporting the rule.

- **Comment 9**: Rule 9 is **clear**, noting that modifiers with **bulky ether groups and multiple methoxy substituents** lead to a **low yield**. The **property insight** is logical, attributing low yield to steric hindrance from bulky groups. However, **coverage** is limited, as the rule is primarily supported by a single data point, 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid. Including more examples would improve the rule's strength.

- **Comment 10**: Rule 10 is **clear**, indicating that modifiers with **fluorinated alkyl chains** result in a **low yield**. The **property insight** involves the high electronegativity and steric effects of fluorinated groups disrupting catalyst interactions. **Coverage** includes two examples—2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid and 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid—supporting the rule. The **complexity** is moderate, focusing on the presence of fluorinated chains.

- **Comment 11**: Rule 11 is **clear**, differentiating yield outcomes based on the aromatic ring structure of amino acids. The **property insight** is strong, explaining that heteroaromatic rings (e.g., indole in tryptophan) enhance coordination, leading to a **high yield**, while simple benzene rings (e.g., phenylalanine) lack effective coordination sites, resulting in a **low yield**. The rule's **complexity** is moderate, considering variations in aromatic ring structures. **Coverage** is adequate, supported by data points like tryptophan and phenylalanine.

- **Comment 12**: Rule 12 is **clear**, stating that modifiers with **additional hydroxyl or amino groups on an aromatic ring** directly connected to another coordinating group yield a **low yield**. The **property insight** suggests interference with binding or catalyst deactivation due to extra functional groups. The rule's **complexity** is higher, considering multiple substituents and their positions. **Coverage** is limited, with examples like 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid and 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid. More data points would strengthen the rule.

- **Comment 13**: Rule 13 is **clear**, indicating that **long aliphatic chains (more than five carbons) bearing polar substituents** result in a **low yield**. The **property insight** is solid, attributing low yield to steric hindrance and reduced compatibility with the reaction medium due to polar groups. The rule is **simple** and effective. **Coverage** is adequate, with multiple data points such as 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid and 8-aminooctanoic acid supporting the rule.

- **Comment 14**: Rule 14 is **clear**, stating that modifiers with an **aromatic ring directly connected to a carboxylic acid and bearing electron-donating groups in the para position** lead to a **low yield**. The **property insight** is strong, explaining that electron-donating groups reduce acidity and electrophilicity, hindering effective coordination. The rule has **moderate complexity**, focusing on substituent effects and positions. **Coverage** includes examples like 4-methylbenzoic acid and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives, supporting the rule.

- **Comment 15**: Rule 15 is **somewhat clear**, suggesting that modifiers with **fused ring systems or extended conjugation adjacent to a carboxylic acid** can result in a **high yield** if the electronic structure favors coordination. The **property insight** relates to the electronic structure enhancing coordination with the catalyst. However, clarity is slightly reduced due to the conditional nature ("if the electronic structure favors coordination"). The rule's **complexity** is higher, and **coverage** is limited, primarily supported by 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid. Additional examples would improve clarity and coverage.

The rule offers adequate physical-chemical insight by explaining that both amino and carboxyl groups enable effective chelation with the metal catalyst, enhancing reactivity. It considers combinations of sub-structures (amino and carboxyl groups on a short aliphatic chain), fulfilling the complexity criterion. The coverage is strong, with three high-yield examples supporting the rule, satisfying the coverage requirement.

This systematic approach aids in understanding how structural features of modifiers influence the reaction outcome and can guide the rational design of new modifiers to optimize and control the yield of the reaction.

**Explanation and Analysis**

In generating these rules, consideration was given to the following physicochemical properties:

- **Coordination Ability**: Functional groups such as amino, carboxylate, thiol, and heteroaromatic nitrogen atoms enhance the ability of the modifier to coordinate with the metal catalyst, leading to higher yields.

- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, improving coordination with the metal center. Electron-donating groups (EDGs) decrease acidity and can reduce coordination efficiency.

- **Steric Factors**: Bulky substituents or extended chains introduce steric hindrance, impeding effective interaction with the catalyst and leading to lower yields.

- **Chain Length**: Short to medium chain lengths are optimal for effective coordination without introducing steric hindrance. Longer chains may decrease yield due to reduced interaction efficiency.

- **Hydrophobic vs. Polar Interactions**: Modifiers without polar substituents on medium-chain aliphatic acids enhance hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst. The introduction of polar groups can disrupt these interactions.

By applying these rules, researchers can predict and design molecular modifiers to achieve desired yields in the reaction, optimizing the efficiency of the catalyst system.

**Start of Comments**

- **Comment 1**: Rule 1 is clear in defining that short-chain aliphatic amino acids with free amino (–NH₂) and carboxylic acid (–COOH) groups, up to five carbons in length, result in a high yield. The rule provides adequate physicochemical insight by explaining that these functional groups enhance coordination with the metal catalyst. It considers combinations of sub-structures (chain length and functional groups) and is supported by multiple data points (three high-yield examples and two low-yield counterexamples), demonstrating good coverage and balance.

- **Comment 2**: Rule 2 clearly specifies that modifiers containing a carboxylic acid group directly attached to a nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring result in a high yield. The rule offers significant physicochemical insight by highlighting the role of heteroaromatic nitrogen in enhancing coordination. It combines specific functional groups and structural features and is supported by three high-yield examples and one low-yield counterexample, indicating strong coverage and a good balance between complexity and coverage.

- **Comment 3**: Rule 3 effectively states that medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (6 to 8 carbons) without polar substituents result in a high yield. The rule provides clear physicochemical insight into how hydrophobic interactions and appropriate chain length facilitate optimal catalyst interactions. It considers chain length and absence of polar groups, supported by one high-yield example and two low-yield counterexamples, offering reasonable coverage and balance.

- **Comment 4**: Rule 4 is clear in indicating that modifiers with an aromatic ring bearing strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) like nitro (–NO₂) in the para position result in a high yield. It provides adequate physicochemical insight by explaining that EWGs increase acidity, enhancing coordination. The rule combines specific substituents and positions but has limited coverage with only one high-yield example and one low-yield counterexample. Additional data points would improve its balance.

- **Comment 5**: Rule 5 clearly states that modifiers containing thiol groups (–SH) on short aliphatic chains adjacent to the carboxylic acid result in a high yield. The physicochemical insight regarding thiol groups forming strong metal bonds is solid. While it combines functional groups and positions, the rule's coverage is limited to one high-yield example and one low-yield counterexample, suggesting the need for more supporting data to enhance balance.

- **Comment 6**: Rule 6 specifies that modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain, such as sugar acids, lead to a high yield. It provides physicochemical insight into increased solubility and additional coordination sites. However, the rule is based on a single high-yield example without counterexamples, limiting coverage and generalizability. Including more data points would improve its applicability.

- **Comment 7**: Rule 7 effectively states that aromatic amino acids containing heteroatoms in the side chain result in a high yield. The rule offers adequate physicochemical insight by highlighting the role of heteroatoms in coordination.
