**Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic amino acids with dicarboxylic acid groups** result in **high yield**. These amino acids have both an amino group and two carboxylic acid groups on a short aliphatic chain, facilitating coordination with the catalyst.  
  *Examples*:  
  - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid)  
  - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (glutamic acid)

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers containing a **thiol group (–SH) attached to a short aliphatic chain (three carbons or fewer)** lead to **high yield**, whereas thiol groups attached to an aromatic ring result in **low yield**. The positioning of the thiol group affects its ability to interact with the catalyst.  
  *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid  
  *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers with **strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro group)** attached to an aromatic ring produce a **high yield**. These groups enhance the ring's ability to coordinate with the catalyst by increasing its electrophilicity.  
  *Example*: 4-nitrobenzoic acid

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers featuring **electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxy)** on an aromatic ring result in **low yield**. Electron-donating groups decrease the ring's ability to coordinate effectively with the catalyst.  
  *Examples*:  
  - 4-methylbenzoic acid  
  - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid  
  - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid

- **Rule 5**: **Unsubstituted medium-chain fatty acids** (chains of up to eight carbons) lead to **high yield**. In contrast, fatty acids with longer chains or those bearing polar substituents like hydroxy or amino groups yield **low yield**, likely due to steric hindrance or decreased solubility affecting catalyst interaction.  
  *High Yield Example*: octanoic acid  
  *Low Yield Examples*:  
  - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid  
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid  
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing **heterocyclic aromatic rings** such as **pyridine, pyrazole, or indole**, especially when connected directly to a carboxylic acid group, result in **high yield**. These heterocycles can effectively coordinate with metal centers in the catalyst.  
  *Examples*:  
  - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid  
  - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid  
  - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan)  
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with an **aldehyde group (–CHO) adjacent to an aromatic ring** produce a **low yield**, possibly due to the aldehyde reacting with the catalyst or interfering with its activity.  
  *Examples*:  
  - 4-formylbenzoic acid  
  - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **fluorinated alkyl chains**, such as **perfluoroalkyl groups** or **trifluoromethyl groups**, result in **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing nature and steric bulk of fluorinated groups may hinder effective catalyst interaction.  
  *Examples*:  
  - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid  
  - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain** lead to **high yield**, potentially due to enhanced hydrogen bonding and multiple coordination sites facilitating interaction with the catalyst.  
  *Example*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers featuring an **amino group attached to a short aliphatic chain (up to five carbons)** result in **high yield**. Longer aliphatic chains with amino groups lead to **low yield**, possibly because of decreased solubility or steric hindrance affecting catalyst binding.  
  *High Yield Examples*:  
  - 5-aminopentanoic acid  
  - 4-aminobenzoic acid  
  *Low Yield Examples*:  
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid  
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aromatic amino acids** display different yields based on their ring structure. **Amino acids with simple benzene rings** (e.g., phenylalanine) give a **low yield**, while those with **heteroaromatic rings** (e.g., indole in tryptophan) yield **high yield**. This suggests the nature of the aromatic ring influences catalyst interaction.  
  *High Yield Example*: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan)  
  *Low Yield Example*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine)

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **ether linkages and methoxy groups** in their structure result in **low yield**. These features might introduce steric hindrance and decrease the modifier's ability to coordinate with the catalyst.  
  *Example*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers containing **carbonyl groups (ketones or amides) adjacent to carboxylic acids** result in **low yield**. The additional carbonyl groups may compete with the carboxylic acid for coordination sites on the catalyst or affect electronic properties unfavorably.  
  *Examples*:  
  - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid  
  - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with **sulfur-containing functional groups** show varying yields depending on their structure. **Aliphatic thiols** lead to **high yield**, likely due to effective coordination, whereas **thioethers** and **aromatic thiols** result in **low yield**, possibly because of steric hindrance or less favorable electronic interactions.  
  *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid (aliphatic thiol)  
  *Low Yield Examples*:  
  - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid (aromatic thiol)  
  - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid (thioether)

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with **additional coordinating groups (e.g., hydroxy, amino) on an aromatic ring** can lead to **low yield**, possibly due to these groups interfering with catalyst binding or causing deactivation.  
  *Examples*:  
  - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid  
  - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

**End of Rules**

These rules are designed to capture the relationships between specific structural features of molecular modifiers and their impact on the yield of the reaction. By focusing on combinations of functional groups and considering underlying physicochemical properties, the rules provide clear guidance on predicting high or low yield outcomes for given structures. The balance between coverage and specificity ensures that the rules are both broadly applicable and insightful for understanding the modifiers' effects.---------------------------------------------------------------
