**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **short-chain aliphatic amino acids with free amino (–NH₂) and carboxylic acid (–COOH) groups**, typically up to five carbons in length, result in a **high yield**. The presence of both amino and carboxylate groups allows effective coordination with the metal catalyst, enhancing its reactivity.

  *High Yield Examples*:

  - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)

  - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)

  - **5-aminopentanoic acid**

  *Low Yield Counterexamples*:

  - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** – The additional acetamido group and longer chain introduce steric hindrance, reducing coordination efficiency.

  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** – Extended chain length decreases effective interaction with the catalyst.

---

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers containing a **carboxylic acid group directly attached to a nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring** result in a **high yield**. The heteroaromatic nitrogen enhances coordination with the metal catalyst.

  *High Yield Examples*:

  - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)

  - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

  - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

  *Low Yield Counterexample*:

  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** – The additional benzene ring introduces steric hindrance, reducing effective coordination.

---

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (6 to 8 carbons) without polar substituents** result in a **high yield**. Their hydrophobic nature and appropriate chain length facilitate optimal interactions with the catalyst.

  *High Yield Example*:

  - **Octanoic acid**

  *Low Yield Counterexamples*:

  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** – The hydroxyl group introduces polarity, disrupting hydrophobic interactions.

  - **8-aminooctanoic acid** – The amino group interferes with catalyst binding due to polarity.

---

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers featuring an **aromatic ring with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) such as nitro (–NO₂) in the para position relative to the carboxylic acid** result in a **high yield**. EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing coordination with the metal catalyst.

  *High Yield Example*:

  - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**

  *Low Yield Counterexamples*:

  - **4-methylbenzoic acid** – Methyl is an electron-donating group (EDG), decreasing acidity.

  - **4-methoxybenzoic acid** – Methoxy is a strong EDG, reducing effective coordination.

---

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing **thiol groups (–SH) on short aliphatic chains adjacent to the carboxylic acid** result in a **high yield**. Thiol groups form strong bonds with metal centers, enhancing catalytic efficiency.

  *High Yield Example*:

  - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

  *Low Yield Counterexample*:

  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** – Thiol group on an aromatic ring may be less reactive due to resonance stabilization.

---

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with **multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain**, such as sugar acids, lead to a **high yield**. Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and provide additional coordination sites for the metal catalyst.

  *High Yield Example*:

  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

---

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aromatic amino acids containing heteroatoms in the side chain**, such as indole rings, result in a **high yield**. Heteroatoms enhance coordination with the metal catalyst.

  *High Yield Example*:

  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

  *Low Yield Counterexample*:

  - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine) – Lacks heteroatoms in the aromatic ring.

---

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with **aromatic rings bearing electron-donating groups (EDGs) such as hydroxy (–OH) or methoxy (–OCH₃) directly attached to the ring and a short aliphatic linker to the carboxylic acid** result in a **low yield**. EDGs decrease acidity and coordination ability.

  *Low Yield Examples*:

  - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

  - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

  *High Yield Counterexample*:

  - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** – The longer aliphatic chain reduces the negative impact of the EDG.

---

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **additional carbonyl groups (aldehydes or ketones) adjacent to the carboxylic acid on an aromatic ring** result in a **low yield**. These groups alter electronic properties unfavorably and may compete for coordination.

  *Low Yield Examples*:

  - **4-formylbenzoic acid**

  - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers containing **bulky substituents or extended chains with multiple polar functional groups**, such as polyether chains or additional aromatic rings, lead to a **low yield**. Steric hindrance and increased polarity interfere with effective catalyst-modifier interactions.

  *Low Yield Examples*:

  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with **fluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups (–CF₃)** result in a **low yield**. The strong electronegativity and steric bulk of fluorinated groups reduce effective coordination with the catalyst.

  *Low Yield Examples*:

  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**

  - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers containing **aromatic ring systems with fused carbonyl groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid**, enhancing electron delocalization, result in a **high yield**. The extended conjugation facilitates effective coordination with the metal catalyst.

  *High Yield Example*:

  - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

---

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **simple aromatic carboxylic acids without bulky substituents or strong electron-donating groups**, such as **4-aminobenzoic acid**, result in a **high yield** due to effective interaction with the catalyst.

  *High Yield Example*:

  - **4-aminobenzoic acid**

  *Low Yield Counterexample*:

  - **4-methylbenzoic acid** – Methyl group is an EDG, decreasing acidity and coordination ability.

---

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with an **aliphatic chain bearing a phenyl ring and sufficient chain length (more than four carbons) between the phenyl ring and the carboxylic acid** may result in a **high yield**, even if the phenyl ring has EDGs. The longer chain reduces steric and electronic interference from the EDG.

  *High Yield Example*:

  - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**

  *Low Yield Counterexample*:

  - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** – Shorter chain length leads to decreased yield.

---

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with **multiple functional groups that cause steric hindrance or chelation competition**, such as adjacent amide and hydroxy groups, result in a **low yield**. Competing coordination sites disrupt optimal binding to the catalyst.

  *Low Yield Examples*:

  - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

  - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

**End of Rules**

These rules illustrate the relationship between specific combinations of functional groups in the molecular modifiers and the observed yields in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By combining multiple sub-structures and considering underlying physicochemical properties such as coordination ability, steric factors, electronic effects, and hydrophobic interactions, the rules provide clear predictions for whether a modifier will result in a high or low yield.

The rules prioritize broader coverage of the dataset while balancing between simple rules with higher coverage and more complex rules with lower coverage. This systematic approach aids in understanding how structural features of modifiers influence the reaction outcome and can guide the rational design of new modifiers to optimize and control the yield of the reaction.

**Explanation and Analysis**

In generating these rules, consideration was given to the following physicochemical properties:

- **Coordination Ability**: Functional groups such as amino, carboxylate, thiol, and heteroaromatic nitrogen atoms enhance the ability of the modifier to coordinate with the metal catalyst, leading to higher yields.

- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, improving coordination with the metal center. Electron-donating groups (EDGs) decrease acidity and can reduce coordination efficiency.

- **Steric Factors**: Bulky substituents or extended chains introduce steric hindrance, impeding effective interaction with the catalyst and leading to lower yields.

- **Chain Length**: Short to medium chain lengths are optimal for effective coordination without introducing steric hindrance. Longer chains may decrease yield due to reduced interaction efficiency.

- **Hydrophobic vs. Polar Interactions**: Modifiers without polar substituents on medium-chain aliphatic acids enhance hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst. The introduction of polar groups can disrupt these interactions.

By applying these rules, researchers can predict and design molecular modifiers to achieve desired yields in the reaction, optimizing the efficiency of the catalyst system.---------------------------------------------------------------
