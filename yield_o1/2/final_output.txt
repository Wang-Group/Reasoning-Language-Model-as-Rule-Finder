    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic amino acids with dicarboxylic acid groups** lead to **high yield**.  
  *Examples*: (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (glutamic acid), (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid).

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers containing a **thiol group (–SH) attached to an aliphatic chain** result in **high yield**, whereas those with thiol groups on an aromatic ring result in **low yield**.  
  *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid.  
  *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid.

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers with **electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, carbonyl)** on an aromatic ring lead to **high yield**.  
  *Example*: 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers with **electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy)** on an aromatic ring result in **low yield**.  
  *Examples*: 4-methylbenzoic acid, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid.

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **unsubstituted fatty acids with an eight-carbon chain** lead to **high yield**, while similar acids with substitutions (e.g., hydroxy, amino groups) on longer chains result in **low yield**.  
  *High Yield Example*: octanoic acid.  
  *Low Yield Examples*: 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid.

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing **heterocyclic rings** such as **pyridine or pyrazole**, especially when directly connected to the carboxylic group or via a short aliphatic linker, result in **high yield**.  
  *Examples*: pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid.

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with an **aldehyde group (–CHO)** result in **low yield**.  
  *Examples*: 4-formylbenzoic acid, 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **perfluoroalkyl groups** result in **low yield** due to strong electron-withdrawing effects disrupting catalyst interactions.  
  *Example*: 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid.

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **multiple hydroxyl groups** lead to **high yield**, possibly due to enhanced coordination with the catalyst.  
  *Example*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with an **amino group attached to an aliphatic chain of five carbons or fewer** lead to **high yield**, whereas longer aliphatic chains with amino groups result in **low yield**.  
  *High Yield Examples*: 5-aminopentanoic acid, 4-aminobenzoic acid.  
  *Low Yield Examples*: 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid.

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that have a **carboxylic acid directly attached to an aromatic ring with an amino group in the para position** give **high yield**.  
  *Example*: 4-aminobenzoic acid.

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **ether linkages and methoxy groups** result in **low yield**, possibly due to steric hindrance and reduced coordination ability.  
  *Example*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid.

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers containing **ketone groups adjacent to carboxylic acids** result in **low yield**, likely due to competing coordination sites or reactivity issues.  
  *Example*: 4-oxoheptanedioic acid.

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers that are **aromatic amino acids with electron-rich benzene rings** (e.g., phenylalanine) give **low yield**, whereas those containing **heterocyclic rings like indole** (e.g., tryptophan) give **high yield**.  
  *High Yield Example*: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan).  
  *Low Yield Example*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine).

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with **amide groups or N-acetyl substitutions** tend to give **low yield**, potentially due to reduced availability of coordination sites.  
  *Example*: (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid.

    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **aliphatic amino acids with dicarboxylic acid groups** result in **high yield**. These amino acids have both an amino group and two carboxylic acid groups on a short aliphatic chain, facilitating coordination with the catalyst.  
  *Examples*:  
  - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid (aspartic acid)  
  - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid (glutamic acid)

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers containing a **thiol group (–SH) attached to a short aliphatic chain (three carbons or fewer)** lead to **high yield**, whereas thiol groups attached to an aromatic ring result in **low yield**. The positioning of the thiol group affects its ability to interact with the catalyst.  
  *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid  
  *Low Yield Example*: 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers with **strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro group)** attached to an aromatic ring produce a **high yield**. These groups enhance the ring's ability to coordinate with the catalyst by increasing its electrophilicity.  
  *Example*: 4-nitrobenzoic acid

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers featuring **electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy, hydroxy)** on an aromatic ring result in **low yield**. Electron-donating groups decrease the ring's ability to coordinate effectively with the catalyst.  
  *Examples*:  
  - 4-methylbenzoic acid  
  - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid  
  - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid

- **Rule 5**: **Unsubstituted medium-chain fatty acids** (chains of up to eight carbons) lead to **high yield**. In contrast, fatty acids with longer chains or those bearing polar substituents like hydroxy or amino groups yield **low yield**, likely due to steric hindrance or decreased solubility affecting catalyst interaction.  
  *High Yield Example*: octanoic acid  
  *Low Yield Examples*:  
  - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid  
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid  
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing **heterocyclic aromatic rings** such as **pyridine, pyrazole, or indole**, especially when connected directly to a carboxylic acid group, result in **high yield**. These heterocycles can effectively coordinate with metal centers in the catalyst.  
  *Examples*:  
  - Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid  
  - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid  
  - (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan)  
  - 4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with an **aldehyde group (–CHO) adjacent to an aromatic ring** produce a **low yield**, possibly due to the aldehyde reacting with the catalyst or interfering with its activity.  
  *Examples*:  
  - 4-formylbenzoic acid  
  - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **fluorinated alkyl chains**, such as **perfluoroalkyl groups** or **trifluoromethyl groups**, result in **low yield**. The strong electron-withdrawing nature and steric bulk of fluorinated groups may hinder effective catalyst interaction.  
  *Examples*:  
  - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid  
  - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain** lead to **high yield**, potentially due to enhanced hydrogen bonding and multiple coordination sites facilitating interaction with the catalyst.  
  *Example*: (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers featuring an **amino group attached to a short aliphatic chain (up to five carbons)** result in **high yield**. Longer aliphatic chains with amino groups lead to **low yield**, possibly because of decreased solubility or steric hindrance affecting catalyst binding.  
  *High Yield Examples*:  
  - 5-aminopentanoic acid  
  - 4-aminobenzoic acid  
  *Low Yield Examples*:  
  - 7-aminoheptanoic acid  
  - 8-aminooctanoic acid

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aromatic amino acids** display different yields based on their ring structure. **Amino acids with simple benzene rings** (e.g., phenylalanine) give a **low yield**, while those with **heteroaromatic rings** (e.g., indole in tryptophan) yield **high yield**. This suggests the nature of the aromatic ring influences catalyst interaction.  
  *High Yield Example*: (2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid (tryptophan)  
  *Low Yield Example*: (2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid (phenylalanine)

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **ether linkages and methoxy groups** in their structure result in **low yield**. These features might introduce steric hindrance and decrease the modifier's ability to coordinate with the catalyst.  
  *Example*: 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers containing **carbonyl groups (ketones or amides) adjacent to carboxylic acids** result in **low yield**. The additional carbonyl groups may compete with the carboxylic acid for coordination sites on the catalyst or affect electronic properties unfavorably.  
  *Examples*:  
  - 4-oxoheptanedioic acid  
  - (2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with **sulfur-containing functional groups** show varying yields depending on their structure. **Aliphatic thiols** lead to **high yield**, likely due to effective coordination, whereas **thioethers** and **aromatic thiols** result in **low yield**, possibly because of steric hindrance or less favorable electronic interactions.  
  *High Yield Example*: 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid (aliphatic thiol)  
  *Low Yield Examples*:  
  - 4-sulfanylbenzoic acid (aromatic thiol)  
  - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid (thioether)

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with **additional coordinating groups (e.g., hydroxy, amino) on an aromatic ring** can lead to **low yield**, possibly due to these groups interfering with catalyst binding or causing deactivation.  
  *Examples*:  
  - 2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid  
  - 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid

**End of Rules**

These rules are designed to capture the relationships between specific structural features of molecular modifiers and their impact on the yield of the reaction. By focusing on combinations of functional groups and considering underlying physicochemical properties, the rules provide clear guidance on predicting high or low yield outcomes for given structures. The balance between coverage and specificity ensures that the rules are both broadly applicable and insightful for understanding the modifiers' effects.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **amino acids with free amino groups and at least one carboxylic acid group on a short aliphatic chain (up to five carbons)** result in a **high yield**. The presence of both amino and carboxyl groups enhances coordination with the metal catalyst, promoting the reaction.

  *High Yield Examples*:
  - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
  - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
  - **5-aminopentanoic acid**

  *Low Yield Counterexample*:
  - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine) – The presence of a bulky phenyl ring may hinder effective coordination.

---

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers containing a **heterocyclic aromatic ring with nitrogen atoms directly attached to a carboxylic acid group** lead to a **high yield**. Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles can coordinate strongly with the metal center, facilitating catalytic activity.

  *High Yield Examples*:
  - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid**
  - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**

  *Low Yield Counterexample*:
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** – Despite containing a pyridine ring, the additional phenyl ring may introduce steric hindrance, resulting in low yield.

---

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers with **electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) attached to an aromatic ring directly connected to a carboxylic acid** influence yield based on the EWG's strength.

  - **Strong EWGs (e.g., nitro group)** enhance electrophilicity, resulting in **high yield**.
    - *Example*: **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
  
  - **Moderate EWGs or additional coordinating groups (e.g., aldehyde, hydroxyl)** may interfere with catalyst binding, leading to **low yield**.
    - *Low Yield Examples*:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
      - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers featuring an **aromatic ring with electron-donating groups (EDGs) connected via a flexible aliphatic linker (three or more carbons)** result in a **high yield**. The flexible linker mitigates the deactivating effect of EDGs by allowing better alignment with the catalyst.

  *High Yield Example*:
  - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**

  *Low Yield Counterexamples* (Rigid connection or shorter linker):
  - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
  - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers that are **medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (chains of 6–8 carbons) without polar substituents** result in a **high yield**. The hydrophobic chain length favors interactions with the catalyst without introducing steric hindrance.

  *High Yield Example*:
  - **Octanoic acid**

  *Low Yield Counterexamples* (Polar substituents on long chains):
  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers containing **multiple hydroxyl groups on a short aliphatic chain (sugars or polyols)** lead to a **high yield**. Multiple hydroxyl groups enhance solubility and provide multiple coordination sites for the catalyst.

  *High Yield Example*:
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

---

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers with an **aliphatic thiol group (–SH) on a short chain (three carbons or fewer)** result in a **high yield**, while **aromatic thiols** lead to a **low yield**. Aliphatic thiols can effectively coordinate with the metal center without steric hindrance.

  *High Yield Example*:
  - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

  *Low Yield Counterexample*:
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers containing **ketone or amide groups adjacent to carboxylic acids** tend to result in a **low yield**. The additional carbonyl group may create steric hindrance or compete for coordination with the catalyst.

  *Low Yield Examples*:
  - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid**
  - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers with **bulky ether groups and multiple methoxy substituents** lead to a **low yield**. Steric bulk from these groups may hinder effective interaction with the catalyst.

  *Low Yield Example*:
  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**

---

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers featuring **fluorinated alkyl chains** result in a **low yield**. Fluorinated groups are highly electronegative and may disrupt interactions with the catalyst due to steric and electronic effects.

  *Low Yield Examples*:
  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**
  - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers that are **aromatic amino acids exhibit varying yields based on the aromatic ring structure**.

  - **Amino acids with heteroaromatic rings** (e.g., indole) result in a **high yield** due to enhanced coordination via the heteroatom.
    - *High Yield Example*: **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

  - **Amino acids with simple benzene rings** lead to a **low yield**, possibly due to lack of effective coordination sites.
    - *Low Yield Example*: **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine)

---

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers containing **additional hydroxyl or amino groups on an aromatic ring** directly connected to another coordinating group (e.g., amide) yield a **low yield**. These additional groups may interfere with binding or cause deactivation of the catalyst.

  *Low Yield Examples*:
  - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**
  - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **long aliphatic chains (more than five carbons) bearing polar substituents** (e.g., hydroxy, amino groups) result in a **low yield**. The long chain may cause steric hindrance, and polar groups can reduce compatibility with the reaction medium.

  *Low Yield Examples*:
  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with an **aromatic ring directly connected to a carboxylic acid and bearing electron-donating groups in the para position** lead to a **low yield**. Electron-donating groups reduce the acidity and electrophilicity of the carboxylic acid, hindering effective coordination.

  *Low Yield Examples*:
  - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
  - **4-hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives**

---

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers containing **fused ring systems or extended conjugation adjacent to a carboxylic acid** can result in a **high yield** if the electronic structure favors coordination with the catalyst.

  *High Yield Example*:
  - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

---

**End of Rules**

These rules are crafted to elucidate the relationship between specific structural features of molecular modifiers and their impact on the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By considering combinations of functional groups and underlying physicochemical properties such as electronic effects, steric factors, and coordination abilities, these rules provide clear predictions for whether a given modifier will result in a high or low yield. The balance between broad coverage and specificity ensures that the rules are both widely applicable across the dataset and insightful for understanding the modifiers' effects on the catalytic reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **short-chain aliphatic amino acids with free amino groups and at least one carboxylic acid group (chains up to five carbons)** result in a **high yield**. The presence of both amino and carboxyl groups allows effective chelation with the metal catalyst, enhancing its reactivity.

  *High Yield Examples*:
  - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
  - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
  - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (Aminovaleric acid)
  
  *Low Yield Counterexample*:
  - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** – The longer chain and additional acetamido group may introduce steric hindrance and interfere with effective coordination.

---

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers containing a **heteroaromatic ring with nitrogen atoms directly attached to a carboxylic acid group** lead to a **high yield**. Nitrogen in the heteroaromatic ring enhances coordination with the metal center, promoting catalytic activity.

  *High Yield Examples*:
  - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
  - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
  - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**
  
  *Low Yield Counterexample*:
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** – The additional phenyl ring may cause steric hindrance, reducing effective coordination.

---

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (chains of 6 to 8 carbons) without polar substituents** result in a **high yield**. Their hydrophobic nature and appropriate chain length favor optimal interactions with the catalyst without steric interference.

  *High Yield Example*:
  - **Octanoic acid**
  
  *Low Yield Counterexamples*:
  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid** – The presence of polar substituents disrupts hydrophobic interactions and may interfere with catalyst binding.

---

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers featuring an **aromatic ring with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) in the para position relative to the carboxylic acid** result in a **high yield**. EWGs increase the electrophilicity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing coordination with the metal catalyst.

  *High Yield Example*:
  - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**
  
  *Low Yield Counterexamples*:
  - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
  - **4-hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives** – Electron-donating groups decrease electrophilicity, hindering effective coordination.

---

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing **multiple hydroxyl groups on a short aliphatic chain (polyhydroxy acids or sugar acids)** lead to a **high yield**. Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and provide additional coordination sites for the metal catalyst.

  *High Yield Example*:
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)
  
  *Low Yield Counterexample*:
  - **[No direct counterexample in dataset]**

---

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with **short-chain aliphatic thiol groups (–SH) adjacent to a carboxylic acid** result in a **high yield**. The thiol group effectively coordinates with the metal center, enhancing catalytic efficiency.

  *High Yield Example*:
  - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**
  
  *Low Yield Counterexample*:
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** – The thiol group on an aromatic ring may not interact as effectively due to resonance stabilization limiting thiol availability for coordination.

---

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aromatic amino acids with heteroaromatic rings (containing nitrogen or other heteroatoms)** lead to a **high yield**. Heteroatoms in the ring facilitate stronger coordination with the metal catalyst.

  *High Yield Example*:
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)
  
  *Low Yield Counterexample*:
  - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine) – Lacks heteroatoms in the aromatic ring, reducing coordination efficiency.

---

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with **long aliphatic chains (more than six carbons) bearing polar substituents such as hydroxyl or amino groups** result in a **low yield**. The polar substituents may interfere with hydrophobic interactions and disrupt effective catalyst-modifier binding.

  *Low Yield Examples*:
  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid**
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**
  
  *High Yield Counterexample*:
  - **Octanoic acid** – Lacks polar substituents, allowing better interaction with the catalyst.

---

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **bulky substituents such as multiple methoxy groups or large ether chains attached to aliphatic or aromatic backbones** lead to a **low yield**. The steric hindrance from bulky groups hinders effective interaction with the catalyst.

  *Low Yield Examples*:
  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
  - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**
  
  *High Yield Counterexample*:
  - **[No direct counterexample in dataset]**

---

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **fluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups** result in a **low yield**. The strong electronegativity and steric bulk of fluorinated groups reduce effective coordination with the catalyst.

  *Low Yield Examples*:
  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**
  - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**
  
  *High Yield Counterexample*:
  - **Octanoic acid** – Similar chain length without fluorination, leading to high yield.

---

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers with **additional carbonyl groups (aldehydes or ketones) adjacent to the carboxylic acid on an aromatic ring** result in a **low yield**. The carbonyl groups may compete with or block the carboxylic acid from coordinating with the catalyst.

  *Low Yield Examples*:
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
  - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**
  
  *High Yield Counterexample*:
  - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** – Contains an EWG that enhances coordination without additional carbonyl groups nearby.

---

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers featuring **aliphatic chains longer than five carbons with polar functional groups and additional amide groups** result in a **low yield**. The combination of chain length and polarity may lead to unfavorable interactions with the catalyst and solvent.

  *Low Yield Examples*:
  - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**
  - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid**
  
  *High Yield Counterexample*:
  - **5-aminopentanoic acid** – Shorter chain with amino group leading to high yield.

---

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **aromatic carboxylic acids bearing electron-donating groups (EDGs) such as methyl or methoxy groups in the para position** lead to a **low yield**. EDGs reduce the acidity and electrophilicity of the carboxylic acid, decreasing its ability to coordinate with the metal catalyst.

  *Low Yield Examples*:
  - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
  - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**
  
  *High Yield Counterexample*:
  - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** – Contains an electron-withdrawing group enhancing coordination.

---

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers containing **multiple coordinating groups that may cause chelation competition or steric hindrance**, such as adjacent hydroxyl and amide groups on an aromatic ring, result in a **low yield**.

  *Low Yield Examples*:
  - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**
  - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

**End of Rules**

These rules have been carefully crafted to capture the relationship between specific structural features of the molecular modifiers and the observed yields in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By analyzing combinations of functional groups such as amino, hydroxyl, thiol, and various aromatic systems, the rules consider underlying physicochemical properties like coordination ability, steric factors, electronic effects, and solubility.

The rules aim to balance simplicity and coverage, providing clear predictions for high or low yields based on modifier structures. They cover a broad range of the dataset while offering detailed insights into how specific functional group combinations influence the reaction outcome. This systematic approach enhances the understanding of modifier effects and aids in the rational design of new catalysts for improved reaction yields.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Current_Rules:
    After analyzing the dataset and considering the underlying physicochemical properties, I have generated the following rules that describe the relationship between molecular modifiers and the relative high or low value of yield.

**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **short-chain aliphatic amino acids with free amino (–NH₂) and carboxylic acid (–COOH) groups, typically up to five carbons in length**, result in a **high yield**. The presence of both amino and carboxylate groups facilitates strong chelation with the metal catalyst, enhancing its reactivity.

  *High Yield Examples*:
  - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
  - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
  - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (Aminovaleric acid)

  *Low Yield Counterexamples*:
  - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** – The longer chain and additional acetamido group introduce steric hindrance, diminishing coordination efficiency.
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** – Extended chain length reduces effective interaction with the catalyst.

---

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers containing a **heteroaromatic ring with nitrogen atoms directly adjacent to a carboxylic acid group**, such as pyridine carboxylic acids, lead to a **high yield**. The nitrogen atom enhances coordination with the metal center, promoting catalytic activity.

  *High Yield Examples*:
  - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
  - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
  - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

  *Low Yield Counterexample*:
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** – The additional phenyl ring may introduce steric hindrance, reducing effective coordination.

---

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (chains of 6 to 8 carbons) without polar substituents** result in a **high yield**. Their hydrophobic nature and appropriate chain length favor optimal interactions with the catalyst without steric interference.

  *High Yield Example*:
  - **Octanoic acid**

  *Low Yield Counterexamples*:
  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** – The hydroxyl group introduces polarity, disrupting hydrophobic interactions.
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid** – The amino group may interfere with catalyst binding due to polarity.

---

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers featuring an **aromatic ring with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) such as nitro (–NO₂) in the para position relative to the carboxylic acid** result in a **high yield**. EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing coordination with the metal catalyst.

  *High Yield Example*:
  - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**

  *Low Yield Counterexamples*:
  - **4-methylbenzoic acid** – Methyl is an electron-donating group (EDG), decreasing acidity.
  - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** – Hydroxy group is an EDG, reducing effective coordination.

---

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing **multiple hydroxyl groups on a short aliphatic chain**, such as sugar acids, lead to a **high yield**. Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and offer additional coordination sites for the metal catalyst.

  *High Yield Example*:
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

---

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with **thiol groups (–SH) adjacent to a carboxylic acid** result in a **high yield**. Thiol groups can form strong bonds with metal centers, enhancing catalytic efficiency.

  *High Yield Example*:
  - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

  *Low Yield Counterexample*:
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** – Thiol group on an aromatic ring may be less accessible due to resonance stabilization.

---

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aromatic amino acids with heteroatoms in the aromatic ring**, such as indole or other nitrogen-containing rings, lead to a **high yield**. Heteroatoms enhance coordination with the metal catalyst.

  *High Yield Example*:
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

  *Low Yield Counterexample*:
  - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine) – Lacks heteroatoms in the aromatic ring.

---

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with **bulky substituents or extended chains with polar functional groups, such as methoxy (–OCH₃) groups or ether chains, attached to aliphatic or aromatic backbones** lead to a **low yield**. Steric hindrance from bulky groups hinders effective interaction with the catalyst.

  *Low Yield Examples*:
  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
  - **4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **fluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups (–CF₃)** result in a **low yield**. The strong electronegativity and steric bulk of fluorinated groups reduce effective coordination with the catalyst.

  *Low Yield Examples*:
  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**
  - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **additional carbonyl groups (aldehydes or ketones) adjacent to the carboxylic acid on an aromatic ring** lead to a **low yield**. These groups may compete with the carboxylic acid for coordination or alter electronic properties unfavorably.

  *Low Yield Examples*:
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
  - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers containing **electron-donating groups (EDGs) such as methyl (–CH₃) or methoxy (–OCH₃) on aromatic rings**, especially in the para position relative to the carboxylic acid, result in a **low yield**. EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, weakening its ability to coordinate with the metal catalyst.

  *Low Yield Examples*:
  - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
  - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

  *High Yield Counterexample*:
  - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** – Contains an EWG enhancing coordination.

---

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **long aliphatic chains (more than six carbons) bearing polar substituents such as hydroxyl (–OH) or amino (–NH₂) groups** result in a **low yield**. The polar substituents may interfere with hydrophobic interactions necessary for effective catalyst-modifier binding.

  *Low Yield Examples*:
  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  *High Yield Counterexample*:
  - **Octanoic acid** – Lacks polar substituents, allowing better interaction.

---

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **multiple functional groups that could lead to chelation competition or steric hindrance**, such as adjacent hydroxyl and amide groups on an aromatic ring, result in a **low yield**. Competing coordination sites can disrupt optimal binding to the catalyst.

  *Low Yield Examples*:
  - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**
  - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers containing **extended conjugated systems with electron-rich fused rings adjacent to a carboxylic acid** can result in a **high yield**. The conjugated system may facilitate electron delocalization, enhancing coordination with the metal catalyst.

  *High Yield Example*:
  - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

---

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with **unsubstituted or simply substituted aromatic carboxylic acids without additional steric bulk or interfering groups** can lead to a **high yield** due to effective interaction with the catalyst.

  *High Yield Example*:
  - **4-aminobenzoic acid**

  *Low Yield Counterexample*:
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** – The additional pyridyl group may introduce steric hindrance, reducing catalyst binding efficiency.

---

**End of Rules**

These rules illustrate the relationship between specific combinations of functional groups in the molecular modifiers and the observed yields in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By combining multiple sub-structures and considering underlying physicochemical properties such as coordination ability, steric factors, electronic effects, and solubility, the rules provide clear predictions for whether a modifier will result in a high or low yield.

The rules balance coverage and specificity, covering a broad range of the dataset while maintaining a suitable balance between simple and complex rules. This systematic approach aids in understanding how structural features of modifiers influence the reaction outcome and can guide the rational design of new modifiers to optimize and control the yield of the reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: Modifiers that are **short-chain aliphatic amino acids with free amino (–NH₂) and carboxylic acid (–COOH) groups**, typically up to five carbons in length, result in a **high yield**. The presence of both amino and carboxylate groups facilitates strong chelation with the metal catalyst, enhancing its reactivity.

  *High Yield Examples*:
  - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** (Aspartic acid)
  - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** (Glutamic acid)
  - **5-aminopentanoic acid** (5-Aminovaleric acid)

  *Low Yield Counterexamples*:
  - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** – The longer chain and additional acetamido group introduce steric hindrance, diminishing coordination efficiency.
  - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** – Extended chain length reduces effective interaction with the catalyst.

---

- **Rule 2**: Modifiers containing a **carboxylic acid group attached directly to a nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring**, such as pyridine or pyrazole carboxylic acids, lead to a **high yield**. The nitrogen atom enhances coordination with the metal center, promoting catalytic activity.

  *High Yield Examples*:
  - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** (Nicotinic acid)
  - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid**
  - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid**

  *Low Yield Counterexample*:
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** – The additional phenyl ring may introduce steric hindrance, reducing effective coordination.

---

- **Rule 3**: Modifiers that are **medium-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (chains of 6 to 8 carbons) without polar substituents** result in a **high yield**. Their hydrophobic nature and appropriate chain length favor optimal interactions with the catalyst without steric interference.

  *High Yield Example*:
  - **Octanoic acid**

  *Low Yield Counterexamples*:
  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** – The hydroxyl group introduces polarity, disrupting hydrophobic interactions.
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid** – The amino group may interfere with catalyst binding due to polarity.

---

- **Rule 4**: Modifiers featuring an **aromatic ring with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) such as nitro (–NO₂) in the para position relative to the carboxylic acid** result in a **high yield**. EWGs increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, enhancing coordination with the metal catalyst.

  *High Yield Example*:
  - **4-nitrobenzoic acid**

  *Low Yield Counterexamples*:
  - **4-methylbenzoic acid** – Methyl is an electron-donating group (EDG), decreasing acidity.
  - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** – Hydroxy group is an EDG, reducing effective coordination.

---

- **Rule 5**: Modifiers containing **multiple hydroxyl groups on an aliphatic chain**, such as sugar acids, lead to a **high yield**. Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and offer additional coordination sites for the metal catalyst.

  *High Yield Example*:
  - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** (Gluconic acid)

---

- **Rule 6**: Modifiers with **thiol groups (–SH) on short aliphatic chains adjacent to the carboxylic acid** result in a **high yield**. Thiol groups can form strong bonds with metal centers, enhancing catalytic efficiency.

  *High Yield Example*:
  - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid**

  *Low Yield Counterexample*:
  - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** – Thiol group on an aromatic ring may be less accessible due to resonance stabilization.

---

- **Rule 7**: Modifiers that are **aromatic amino acids with heteroatoms in the side chain**, such as indole-containing amino acids, lead to a **high yield**. Heteroatoms enhance coordination with the metal catalyst.

  *High Yield Example*:
  - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** (Tryptophan)

  *Low Yield Counterexample*:
  - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** (Phenylalanine) – Lacks heteroatoms in the aromatic ring.

---

- **Rule 8**: Modifiers with **electron-donating groups (EDGs) such as methyl (–CH₃), methoxy (–OCH₃), or hydroxy (–OH) on aromatic rings** result in a **low yield**. EDGs decrease the acidity of the carboxylic acid, weakening its ability to coordinate with the metal catalyst.

  *Low Yield Examples*:
  - **4-methylbenzoic acid**
  - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid**

  *High Yield Counterexample*:
  - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** – Contains an EWG enhancing coordination.

---

- **Rule 9**: Modifiers containing **fluorinated alkyl chains or trifluoromethyl groups (–CF₃)** result in a **low yield**. The strong electronegativity and steric bulk of fluorinated groups reduce effective coordination with the catalyst.

  *Low Yield Examples*:
  - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid**
  - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 10**: Modifiers with **long aliphatic chains (>6 carbons) bearing polar functional groups such as hydroxy (–OH) or amino (–NH₂) groups** result in a **low yield**. The polar substituents may interfere with hydrophobic interactions necessary for effective catalyst-modifier binding.

  *Low Yield Examples*:
  - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid**
  - **8-aminooctanoic acid**

  *High Yield Counterexample*:
  - **Octanoic acid** – Lacks polar substituents, allowing better interaction.

---

- **Rule 11**: Modifiers containing **additional carbonyl groups (aldehydes or ketones) adjacent to the carboxylic acid on an aromatic ring** lead to a **low yield**. These groups may compete with the carboxylic acid for coordination or alter electronic properties unfavorably.

  *Low Yield Examples*:
  - **4-formylbenzoic acid**
  - **5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers with **bulky substituents or extended chains with polar functional groups, such as polyether chains or bulky aryl groups**, lead to a **low yield**. Steric hindrance from bulky groups hinders effective interaction with the catalyst.

  *Low Yield Examples*:
  - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid**
  - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid**
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid**

---

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers with **multiple functional groups that could lead to chelation competition or steric hindrance**, such as adjacent hydroxyl and amide groups, result in a **low yield**. Competing coordination sites can disrupt optimal binding to the catalyst.

  *Low Yield Examples*:
  - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**
  - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers containing **aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-rich fused rings or additional conjugation adjacent to the carboxylic acid** can result in a **high yield**. The extended conjugation may facilitate electron delocalization, enhancing coordination with the metal catalyst.

  *High Yield Example*:
  - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

---

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers that are **unsubstituted or simply substituted aromatic carboxylic acids without additional steric bulk**, such as **4-aminobenzoic acid**, can lead to a **high yield** due to effective interaction with the catalyst.

  *High Yield Example*:
  - **4-aminobenzoic acid**

  *Low Yield Counterexample*:
  - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** – The additional pyridyl group may introduce steric hindrance, reducing catalyst binding efficiency.

**End of Rules**

These rules illustrate the relationship between specific combinations of functional groups in the molecular modifiers and the observed yields in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By combining multiple sub-structures and considering underlying physicochemical properties such as coordination ability, steric factors, electronic effects, and hydrophobic interactions, the rules provide clear predictions for whether a modifier will result in a high or low yield.

The rules balance coverage and specificity, covering a broad range of the dataset while maintaining a suitable balance between simple and complex rules. This systematic approach aids in understanding how structural features of modifiers influence the reaction outcome and can guide the rational design of new modifiers to optimize and control the yield of the reaction.---------------------------------------------------------------

  - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid**

---

- **Rule 12**: Modifiers containing **aromatic ring systems with fused carbonyl groups adjacent to the carboxylic acid**, enhancing electron delocalization, result in a **high yield**. The extended conjugation facilitates effective coordination with the metal catalyst.

  *High Yield Example*:

  - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid**

---

- **Rule 13**: Modifiers that are **simple aromatic carboxylic acids without bulky substituents or strong electron-donating groups**, such as **4-aminobenzoic acid**, result in a **high yield** due to effective interaction with the catalyst.

  *High Yield Example*:

  - **4-aminobenzoic acid**

  *Low Yield Counterexample*:

  - **4-methylbenzoic acid** – Methyl group is an EDG, decreasing acidity and coordination ability.

---

- **Rule 14**: Modifiers with an **aliphatic chain bearing a phenyl ring and sufficient chain length (more than four carbons) between the phenyl ring and the carboxylic acid** may result in a **high yield**, even if the phenyl ring has EDGs. The longer chain reduces steric and electronic interference from the EDG.

  *High Yield Example*:

  - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid**

  *Low Yield Counterexample*:

  - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** – Shorter chain length leads to decreased yield.

---

- **Rule 15**: Modifiers with **multiple functional groups that cause steric hindrance or chelation competition**, such as adjacent amide and hydroxy groups, result in a **low yield**. Competing coordination sites disrupt optimal binding to the catalyst.

  *Low Yield Examples*:

  - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid**

  - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid**

**End of Rules**

These rules illustrate the relationship between specific combinations of functional groups in the molecular modifiers and the observed yields in the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By combining multiple sub-structures and considering underlying physicochemical properties such as coordination ability, steric factors, electronic effects, and hydrophobic interactions, the rules provide clear predictions for whether a modifier will result in a high or low yield.

The rules prioritize broader coverage of the dataset while balancing between simple rules with higher coverage and more complex rules with lower coverage. This systematic approach aids in understanding how structural features of modifiers influence the reaction outcome and can guide the rational design of new modifiers to optimize and control the yield of the reaction.

---

**Explanation and Analysis**

In generating these rules, consideration was given to the following physicochemical properties:

- **Coordination Ability**: Functional groups such as amino, carboxylate, thiol, and heteroaromatic nitrogen atoms enhance the ability of the modifier to coordinate with the metal catalyst, leading to higher yields.

- **Electronic Effects**: Electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) increase the acidity of the carboxylic acid, improving coordination with the metal center. Electron-donating groups (EDGs) decrease acidity and can reduce coordination efficiency.

- **Steric Factors**: Bulky substituents or extended chains introduce steric hindrance, impeding effective interaction with the catalyst and leading to lower yields.

- **Chain Length**: Short to medium chain lengths are optimal for effective coordination without introducing steric hindrance. Longer chains may decrease yield due to reduced interaction efficiency.

- **Hydrophobic vs. Polar Interactions**: Modifiers without polar substituents on medium-chain aliphatic acids enhance hydrophobic interactions with the catalyst. The introduction of polar groups can disrupt these interactions.

By applying these rules, researchers can predict and design molecular modifiers to achieve desired yields in the reaction, optimizing the efficiency of the catalyst system.---------------------------------------------------------------
