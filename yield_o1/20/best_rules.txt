**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are carboxylic acids with amino groups (–NH₂) at the beta (β) or gamma (γ) position (within three carbons of the carboxyl group) lead to high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: The proximity of the amino group to the carboxyl group allows effective chelation with metal centers in the catalyst, enhancing catalytic activity and stabilizing intermediates.
  - *Supporting Examples*: 
    - **High Yield**: 
      - 5-aminopentanoic acid *(True)*
      - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid *(True)*
      - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**: 
      - 7-aminoheptanoic acid *(False)*
      - 8-aminooctanoic acid *(False)*

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halogens) at the para position lead to high yield, unless the group interferes with metal coordination.**

  - *Explanation*: Electron-withdrawing groups enhance the acidity of the carboxyl group and can facilitate stronger interactions with the catalyst's metal centers.
  - *Supporting Examples*: 
    - **High Yield**:
      - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid *(True)*
      - 4-nitrobenzoic acid *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 4-formylbenzoic acid *(False)* *(The aldehyde may form unfavorable interactions or chelate the metal center differently.)*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with functional groups capable of coordinating to metal centers (e.g., amino (–NH₂), hydroxy (–OH), pyridinyl nitrogen) directly attached to the ring lead to high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: These groups provide additional coordination sites, strengthening binding to the catalyst and enhancing catalytic activity.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **High Yield**:
      - 4-aminobenzoic acid *(True)*
      - pyridine-3-carboxylic acid *(True)*
      - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 4-methylbenzoic acid *(False)* *(Methyl groups do not coordinate with metal centers.)*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with non-coordinating electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl (–CH₃)) at the para position lead to low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Electron-donating groups without coordinating ability may reduce the acidity of the carboxyl group and weaken interactions with the metal catalyst.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 4-methylbenzoic acid *(False)*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a chain length of six carbons or more and no additional functional groups lead to high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Longer hydrophobic chains can favor interactions with the catalyst surface, enhancing adsorption without introducing steric hindrance or electronic interference.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **High Yield**:
      - Octanoic acid *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid *(False)* *(The hydroxy group may interfere with optimal binding.)*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing flexible ether chains, such as ethylene glycol units (–O–CH₂–CH₂–O–), lead to low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Flexible ether chains may prevent optimal positioning of the functional groups for effective interaction with the catalyst, reducing activity.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid *(False)*
      - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid *(False)*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with acidic side chains (additional carboxyl groups) lead to high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Extra carboxyl groups can enhance chelation with metal centers, increasing catalyst stability and reactivity.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **High Yield**:
      - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid *(Aspartic acid, True)*
      - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid *(Glutamic acid, True)*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with sulfur-containing side chains lead to variable yield depending on the sulfur's ability to coordinate; methionine derivatives lead to low yield, while thiol-containing modifiers may lead to high yield if the thiol is not directly attached to an aromatic ring.**

  - *Explanation*: Sulfur atoms can coordinate with metal centers, but steric and electronic factors affect this interaction. Free thiol groups (–SH) can act as good ligands if appropriately positioned.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **High Yield**:
      - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid *(True)* *(Thiol is accessible for coordination.)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid *(False)* *(Methionine derivative where sulfur is less available for coordination.)*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde or ketone groups attached directly to the ring lead to low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: These carbonyl groups may compete with the carboxyl group for coordination sites on the catalyst or form inactive complexes, reducing catalytic efficiency.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 4-formylbenzoic acid *(False)*
      - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid *(Despite being a cyclic ketone, the carbonyl groups may interfere; however, note that this example was actually reported as high yield, so exceptions may exist.)*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen heteroatoms capable of coordinating with metal centers lead to high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles can act as strong ligands, enhancing coordination with the catalyst's metal centers and promoting reactivity.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **High Yield**:
      - pyridine-3-carboxylic acid *(True)*
      - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid *(True)*
      - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid *(False)* *(Possible steric hindrance or lack of effective coordination due to the substituent's position.)*

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with aliphatic amino groups at the delta (δ) position or further from the carboxyl group (four or more carbons away) lead to low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Distant amino groups may not effectively participate in coordination with the catalyst, reducing their positive impact on yield.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 7-aminoheptanoic acid *(False)*
      - 8-aminooctanoic acid *(False)*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are carboxylic acids with fluorinated aliphatic chains lead to low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Highly electronegative fluorine atoms can create strong electron-withdrawing effects, destabilizing interactions with the catalyst and possibly leading to unfavorable binding.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid *(False)*
      - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid *(False)*

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are sugar acids or sugar derivatives with multiple hydroxyl groups attached to a carboxylic acid lead to high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Multiple hydroxyl groups can enhance solubility and provide additional hydrogen-bonding interactions with the catalyst, potentially stabilizing reactive intermediates.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **High Yield**:
      - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid *(True)*

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with functionalized aliphatic side chains containing hydroxy (–OH) or methoxy (–OCH₃) groups, especially when the chain is extended (three carbons or more), lead to high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: The extended side chain allows the functional group to interact effectively with the catalyst, and polar groups enhance solubility and binding affinity.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **High Yield**:
      - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid *(True)*
      - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid *(False)* *(Shorter chain may limit effective interaction.)*

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing flexible chains with ether linkages (e.g., ethylene glycol units) lead to low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Such flexible chains may not hold functional groups in the optimal position for catalyst interaction and could introduce conformational dynamics that reduce binding efficiency.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid *(False)*
      - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid *(False)*
