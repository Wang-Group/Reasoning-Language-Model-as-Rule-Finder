**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) lead to a **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: The presence of both an amino group at the α-position and two carboxyl groups allows for strong chelation with metal ions, enhancing coordination with the catalyst's metal center and improving reaction efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)* *(Aspartic acid)*
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(True)* *(Glutamic acid)*

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strongly electron-withdrawing groups at the para position (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) lead to a **high yield**; those with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, hydroxy) lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and coordination ability, reducing catalytic performance.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(True)* *(Para-nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing)*
      - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** *(True)* *(Bromomethyl group withdraws electron density)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Methyl group is electron-donating)*
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** *(False)* *(Hydroxy group is electron-donating)*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino or hydroxyl groups within two carbons of the carboxylate lead to a **high yield**; those with these groups more than four carbons away lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Functional groups proximal to the carboxylate enhance chelation with metal centers, improving catalyst interaction. Distant groups are less effective due to decreased coordination capability.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-aminopentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Amino group two carbons away from carboxylate)*
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)* *(Thiol group adjacent to carboxylate)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(False)* *(Amino group distant from carboxylate)*
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(False)* *(Amino group far from carboxylate)*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aromatic heterocyclic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms in the ring directly attached to the carboxyl group lead to a **high yield**; if the heterocycle is connected via a linker, they lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in the heterocyclic ring can coordinate with metal centers. Direct attachment allows effective coordination, while linkers increase distance and may introduce steric hindrance, reducing interaction.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(True)* *(Carboxylate directly attached to pyridine ring)*
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)* *(Pyrazole ring facilitates coordination)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Pyridine ring attached via benzene linker)*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing perfluorinated alkyl chains or highly fluorinated groups lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Fluorine's high electronegativity withdraws electron density from the carboxylate oxygen, weakening its ability to coordinate with metal centers and reducing catalytic activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(False)* *(Perfluorinated chain reduces coordination)*
      - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** *(False)* *(Fluorinated acyl group diminishes electron density)*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups lead to a **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Simple carboxylic acids can coordinate effectively with metal centers without steric hindrance or electronic interference from other groups, facilitating efficient catalysis.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Octanoic acid** *(True)* *(Unsubstituted aliphatic chain enhances coordination)*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing multiple ether linkages or polyether chains lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Ether linkages increase flexibility and solvation, potentially causing the modifier to sequester metal ions or block active sites, hindering effective catalysis.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(False)* *(Polyether chain hinders coordination)*
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** *(False)* *(Multiple ethers reduce effective coordination)*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with bulky substituents near the carboxyl group (e.g., aromatic rings) lead to a **low yield** due to steric hindrance; if bulky groups are distant, they have less impact on yield.**

  - **Explanation**: Bulky groups near the coordination site impede effective interaction between the modifier and the metal center. Distant bulky groups allow for flexibility and better coordination.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(False)* *(Phenyl group near amino and carboxylate reduces coordination)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Phenyl ring distant from carboxylate minimizes steric effects)*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are N-acylated amino acids or peptides lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: N-acylation reduces the availability of the amino group for coordination with metal centers, and peptide bonds may introduce steric hindrance, limiting catalyst interaction.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** *(False)* *(N-acylation impedes coordination)*
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)* *(Acetamido group hinders coordination)*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids fused with oxygen-containing heterocycles lead to a **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: The heterocyclic oxygen atoms provide additional coordination sites with metal centers, enhancing catalyst interaction and stability.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** *(True)* *(Heterocyclic oxygen aids in coordination)*
      - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)* *(Lactam oxygen enhances coordination)*

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic systems connected via flexible aliphatic linkers (four or more carbons) to the carboxyl group lead to a **high yield**; shorter linkers lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Longer linkers allow the aromatic group's functional sites to interact effectively with the metal center without causing steric hindrance, enhancing coordination and catalyst activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Flexible chain allows effective interaction)*
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** *(True)* *(Pyridine ring at optimal distance)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** *(False)* *(Shorter chain limits flexibility and coordination)*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing thiol groups lead to a **high yield** when the thiol is proximal to the carboxyl group; aromatic thiols lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Aliphatic thiols near the carboxyl group can strongly coordinate with metal centers. Aromatic thiols may engage in side reactions or cause steric hindrance due to rigidity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)* *(Thiol group adjacent to carboxylate enhances coordination)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Aromatic thiol may cause side reactions)*

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (–CHO) groups lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups are reactive and may participate in side reactions or interfere with metal coordination, reducing catalyst effectiveness.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Aldehyde group may interfere with coordination)*

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups proximal to the carboxyl group lead to a **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxylate enhance chelation and interaction with metal centers, improving catalyst performance through additional coordination sites.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(True)* *(Multiple hydroxyls facilitate coordination)*
