    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are carboxylic acids with amino groups (–NH₂) at the beta (β) or gamma (γ) position (within three carbons of the carboxyl group) lead to high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: The proximity of the amino group to the carboxyl group allows effective chelation with metal centers in the catalyst, enhancing catalytic activity and stabilizing intermediates.
  - *Supporting Examples*: 
    - **High Yield**: 
      - 5-aminopentanoic acid *(True)*
      - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid *(True)*
      - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**: 
      - 7-aminoheptanoic acid *(False)*
      - 8-aminooctanoic acid *(False)*

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halogens) at the para position lead to high yield, unless the group interferes with metal coordination.**

  - *Explanation*: Electron-withdrawing groups enhance the acidity of the carboxyl group and can facilitate stronger interactions with the catalyst's metal centers.
  - *Supporting Examples*: 
    - **High Yield**:
      - 4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid *(True)*
      - 4-nitrobenzoic acid *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 4-formylbenzoic acid *(False)* *(The aldehyde may form unfavorable interactions or chelate the metal center differently.)*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with functional groups capable of coordinating to metal centers (e.g., amino (–NH₂), hydroxy (–OH), pyridinyl nitrogen) directly attached to the ring lead to high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: These groups provide additional coordination sites, strengthening binding to the catalyst and enhancing catalytic activity.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **High Yield**:
      - 4-aminobenzoic acid *(True)*
      - pyridine-3-carboxylic acid *(True)*
      - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 4-methylbenzoic acid *(False)* *(Methyl groups do not coordinate with metal centers.)*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with non-coordinating electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl (–CH₃)) at the para position lead to low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Electron-donating groups without coordinating ability may reduce the acidity of the carboxyl group and weaken interactions with the metal catalyst.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 4-methylbenzoic acid *(False)*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with a chain length of six carbons or more and no additional functional groups lead to high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Longer hydrophobic chains can favor interactions with the catalyst surface, enhancing adsorption without introducing steric hindrance or electronic interference.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **High Yield**:
      - Octanoic acid *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 7-hydroxyheptanoic acid *(False)* *(The hydroxy group may interfere with optimal binding.)*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing flexible ether chains, such as ethylene glycol units (–O–CH₂–CH₂–O–), lead to low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Flexible ether chains may prevent optimal positioning of the functional groups for effective interaction with the catalyst, reducing activity.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid *(False)*
      - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid *(False)*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with acidic side chains (additional carboxyl groups) lead to high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Extra carboxyl groups can enhance chelation with metal centers, increasing catalyst stability and reactivity.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **High Yield**:
      - (2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid *(Aspartic acid, True)*
      - (2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid *(Glutamic acid, True)*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with sulfur-containing side chains lead to variable yield depending on the sulfur's ability to coordinate; methionine derivatives lead to low yield, while thiol-containing modifiers may lead to high yield if the thiol is not directly attached to an aromatic ring.**

  - *Explanation*: Sulfur atoms can coordinate with metal centers, but steric and electronic factors affect this interaction. Free thiol groups (–SH) can act as good ligands if appropriately positioned.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **High Yield**:
      - 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid *(True)* *(Thiol is accessible for coordination.)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid *(False)* *(Methionine derivative where sulfur is less available for coordination.)*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde or ketone groups attached directly to the ring lead to low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: These carbonyl groups may compete with the carboxyl group for coordination sites on the catalyst or form inactive complexes, reducing catalytic efficiency.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 4-formylbenzoic acid *(False)*
      - 1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid *(Despite being a cyclic ketone, the carbonyl groups may interfere; however, note that this example was actually reported as high yield, so exceptions may exist.)*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are heterocyclic carboxylic acids containing nitrogen heteroatoms capable of coordinating with metal centers lead to high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Nitrogen atoms in heterocycles can act as strong ligands, enhancing coordination with the catalyst's metal centers and promoting reactivity.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **High Yield**:
      - pyridine-3-carboxylic acid *(True)*
      - 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid *(True)*
      - 2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid *(False)* *(Possible steric hindrance or lack of effective coordination due to the substituent's position.)*

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with aliphatic amino groups at the delta (δ) position or further from the carboxyl group (four or more carbons away) lead to low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Distant amino groups may not effectively participate in coordination with the catalyst, reducing their positive impact on yield.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 7-aminoheptanoic acid *(False)*
      - 8-aminooctanoic acid *(False)*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are carboxylic acids with fluorinated aliphatic chains lead to low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Highly electronegative fluorine atoms can create strong electron-withdrawing effects, destabilizing interactions with the catalyst and possibly leading to unfavorable binding.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid *(False)*
      - 4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid *(False)*

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are sugar acids or sugar derivatives with multiple hydroxyl groups attached to a carboxylic acid lead to high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Multiple hydroxyl groups can enhance solubility and provide additional hydrogen-bonding interactions with the catalyst, potentially stabilizing reactive intermediates.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **High Yield**:
      - (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid *(True)*

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with functionalized aliphatic side chains containing hydroxy (–OH) or methoxy (–OCH₃) groups, especially when the chain is extended (three carbons or more), lead to high yield.**

  - *Explanation*: The extended side chain allows the functional group to interact effectively with the catalyst, and polar groups enhance solubility and binding affinity.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **High Yield**:
      - 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid *(True)*
      - 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid *(False)* *(Shorter chain may limit effective interaction.)*

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers containing flexible chains with ether linkages (e.g., ethylene glycol units) lead to low yield.**

  - *Explanation*: Such flexible chains may not hold functional groups in the optimal position for catalyst interaction and could introduce conformational dynamics that reduce binding efficiency.
  - *Supporting Examples*:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid *(False)*
      - 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid *(False)*

    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups** lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Simple aliphatic carboxylic acids can interact effectively with the catalyst's metal centers without steric hindrance or interference from other functional groups. The unimpeded carboxyl group can coordinate with metal ions in the catalyst, facilitating the reaction.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Octanoic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *(No low-yield examples in the dataset with simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups.)*

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino (–NH₂) or hydroxyl (–OH) groups at the beta (β) or gamma (γ) positions** relative to the carboxyl group lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: The presence of amino or hydroxyl groups near the carboxyl group enhances the ability to chelate metal centers in the catalyst. This chelation strengthens the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst, promoting higher catalytic activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-aminopentanoic acid** *(True)*
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)*
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(False)* *(Amino group beyond the γ position reduces coordination efficiency.)*
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted groups capable of coordination**, such as amino (–NH₂), nitro (–NO₂), or bromomethyl (–CH₂Br), lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Coordinating groups at the para position enhance electron density and provide additional sites for interaction with metal centers in the catalyst. This increases the effectiveness of the modifier in stabilizing the catalyst and promoting the reaction.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-aminobenzoic acid** *(True)*
      - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(True)*
      - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Methyl group is non-coordinating.)*
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Aldehyde group may interfere with coordination.)*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are **nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the ring** lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing binding affinity and catalytic activity. The direct attachment of the carboxyl group ensures effective positioning for coordination.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(True)*
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)*
      - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Carboxyl group is attached to a benzene ring, not directly to the pyridine ring.)*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are **aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino or hydroxyl groups beyond the gamma (γ) position** lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Functional groups located too far from the carboxyl group are less effective in coordinating with the catalyst's metal centers. The increased distance reduces the likelihood of forming strong chelation bonds, diminishing catalytic enhancement.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-aminopentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Amino group at γ position.)*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are **amino acids with side chains containing functional groups capable of coordination**, such as indole nitrogen, **lead to high yield**, while those without such groups **lead to low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Side chains with coordinating functional groups enhance the interaction with metal centers in the catalyst, improving catalytic performance. Amino acids lacking these groups do not provide additional coordination sites and are less effective.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(True)* *(Tryptophan derivative with indole nitrogen.)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(False)* *(Phenylalanine derivative without coordinating heteroatoms.)*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers with **polyether chains or ether linkages** in their structure lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Ether linkages introduce flexibility and may prevent optimal alignment of coordinating groups with the catalyst's active sites. This reduces the efficiency of coordination and diminishes catalytic activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(False)*
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that have **highly fluorinated aliphatic chains** lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Fluorinated chains are highly electronegative, which can reduce the coordinating ability of the carboxyl group by withdrawing electron density. Additionally, fluorinated compounds may not interact favorably with the catalyst's surface.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are **polyhydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids (sugar acids)** lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and provide numerous sites for hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst. This enhances the overall interaction between the modifier and the catalyst.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(True)* *(Gluconic acid derivative.)*
      - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *(No low-yield examples in the dataset with polyhydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids.)*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are **aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (–CHO) groups directly attached to the ring** lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups can engage in side reactions or interfere with metal coordination by forming undesired complexes. This reduces the availability of the carboxyl group and diminishes catalytic efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(No high-yield examples in the dataset with aromatic aldehyde carboxylic acids.)*

These rules illustrate the relationship between molecular modifiers' structural features and their impact on the reaction yield. By focusing on combinations of functional groups and their positions within the molecules, the rules consider underlying physicochemical properties such as coordination ability, electron density, and steric factors. The rules are designed to cover a broad range of the dataset, balancing simplicity and complexity to provide comprehensive insights into how different modifiers influence the reaction outcome.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Unsubstituted aliphatic carboxylic acids can coordinate effectively with the catalyst's metal centers without steric hindrance or electronic interference from other functional groups. The simple structure allows for optimal interaction with the catalyst, enhancing its activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Octanoic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *(No low-yield examples in the dataset with simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups.)*

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino (–NH₂), hydroxyl (–OH), or thiol (–SH) groups at the alpha (α), beta (β), or gamma (γ) positions lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Functional groups near the carboxyl group can chelate the metal centers in the catalyst, forming stable complexes. This chelation enhances the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst, improving catalytic efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)*
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(True)*
      - **5-aminopentanoic acid** *(True)*
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)*
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(False)* *(Amino group beyond γ position.)*
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino or hydroxyl groups at positions beyond the gamma (γ) position (i.e., delta (δ) position or further) lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Functional groups located too far from the carboxyl group are less effective in forming strong chelation with the metal centers. The increased distance reduces the coordination efficiency, diminishing the modifier's ability to enhance the catalyst.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-aminopentanoic acid** *(True)*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-withdrawing or coordinating groups, such as amino (–NH₂), nitro (–NO₂), or bromomethyl (–CH₂Br), lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing or coordinating groups at the para position can enhance metal coordination and electron delocalization. This increases the interaction between the modifier and the catalyst's active sites, promoting higher catalytic activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-aminobenzoic acid** *(True)*
      - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(True)*
      - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Methyl group is electron-donating and non-coordinating.)*
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Aldehyde group may interfere with coordination.)*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted electron-donating or non-coordinating groups lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-donating groups can reduce the ability of the carboxyl group to coordinate with the metal centers by increasing electron density, which may hinder effective interaction. Non-coordinating groups do not provide additional sites for metal binding.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(False)*
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-aminobenzoic acid** *(True)*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the ring lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in heteroaromatic rings can coordinate with metal centers, enhancing binding affinity. The direct attachment of the carboxyl group ensures effective positioning for coordination, improving catalytic performance.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(True)*
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)*
      - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Carboxyl group attached to benzene ring, not directly to the heteroaromatic ring.)*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing polyether chains or multiple ether linkages in their structure lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Ether linkages introduce flexibility and may prevent optimal alignment of coordinating groups with the catalyst's active sites. They can also increase steric hindrance, reducing the efficiency of coordination and catalytic activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(False)*
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(No high-yield examples in the dataset with polyether chains or multiple ether linkages.)*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that have highly fluorinated aliphatic chains lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Fluorinated chains are strongly electron-withdrawing, which can reduce the coordinating ability of the carboxyl group by withdrawing electron density. Additionally, fluorinated compounds may not interact favorably with the catalyst's surface due to hydrophobic interactions.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are polyhydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids (sugar acids) lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups increase solubility and provide numerous sites for hydrogen bonding and coordination with the catalyst. This enhances the overall interaction between the modifier and the catalyst, promoting higher catalytic efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(True)*
      - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - *(No low-yield examples in the dataset with polyhydroxylated aliphatic carboxylic acids.)*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with side chains containing coordinating functional groups, such as indole nitrogen in tryptophan, lead to **high yield**; those without such groups or with non-coordinating side chains lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Side chains with coordinating functional groups enhance interaction with metal centers in the catalyst, improving catalytic performance. Amino acids lacking such groups do not provide additional coordination sites and are less effective modifiers.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(True)* *(Tryptophan derivative with indole nitrogen.)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(False)* *(Phenylalanine derivative without coordinating heteroatoms.)*
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)* *(Lysine derivative with amide group reducing coordination.)*

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with thiol (–SH) groups at the alpha (α), beta (β), or gamma (γ) positions lead to **high yield**; aromatic carboxylic acids with thiol groups lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: In aliphatic acids, thiol groups near the carboxylate can strongly coordinate with metal centers, enhancing catalyst activity. In aromatic acids, steric hindrance and electronic factors may reduce the effectiveness of thiol groups in coordination.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are dicarboxylic acids or possess multiple carboxyl groups close together lead to **high yield**; those with additional interfering functional groups may lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple carboxyl groups can enhance coordination with metal centers due to increased binding sites. However, functional groups like ketones adjacent to carboxyl groups may interfere with coordination.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)* *(Aspartic acid)*
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(True)* *(Glutamic acid)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-oxoheptanedioic acid** *(False)* *(Ketone group may interfere with coordination.)*

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with aldehyde (–CHO) groups directly attached to the ring lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups can engage in side reactions or form undesired complexes with the catalyst, interfering with metal coordination and reducing catalytic efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(No high-yield examples in the dataset with aromatic aldehyde carboxylic acids.)*

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with substituents that increase steric hindrance near the coordinating groups lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Bulky groups near the coordinating sites can prevent effective interaction with the catalyst's metal centers by hindering access, thus reducing the modifier's ability to enhance the reaction.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** *(False)* *(Steric hindrance from methylsulfanyl group.)*
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** *(False)* *(Bulky benzoyl group adjacent to coordinating sites.)*

---

- **Rule 15**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with hydroxyl (–OH) groups on the aromatic ring but without additional chain extension lead to **low yield**; extended chain analogs may lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Hydroxyl groups on the aromatic ring can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds or lead to unfavorable electronic effects, reducing coordination efficiency. Extension of the chain can mitigate these effects by distancing the hydroxyl group from the coordination site.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Extended chain reduces interference.)*

**End of Rules**

---

These rules capture the relationships between the structural features of molecular modifiers and their impact on the reaction yield. By combining multiple sub-structures and considering underlying physicochemical properties such as coordination ability, electron density, steric hindrance, and functional group effects, the rules provide a comprehensive framework for predicting whether a modifier will lead to a high or low yield in the reaction.

The rules balance simplicity and complexity to cover a broad range of the dataset:

- **Simple Rules with High Coverage**: Rules 1, 2, 3, and 4 cover fundamental structural features affecting yield.
- **Complex Rules with Specific Applications**: Rules 10, 11, and 15 address more intricate combinations of functional groups and their positions.

This set of 15 rules should aid in the selection and design of molecular modifiers to optimize the reaction yield for the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization of aliphatic alcohols.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino (–NH₂) groups at the alpha (α) or beta (β) positions lead to **high yield**; when the amino group is further away or there are bulky groups, they lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Amino groups near the carboxylate can chelate metal centers effectively, enhancing catalyst interaction. Distant amino groups or bulky substituents reduce coordination efficiency due to decreased chelation and increased steric hindrance.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)*
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(True)*
      - **5-aminopentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Amino group at γ position but still close enough for coordination.)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)* *(Amino group is distant, and acetamido group adds steric bulk.)*
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(False)* *(Amino group far from carboxylate.)*
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents at the para or meta positions lead to **high yield**; those with electron-donating substituents or interfering groups lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity and coordination ability of the carboxylate by stabilizing the negative charge, enhancing interaction with metal centers. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and coordination, while interfering groups may block coordination sites or engage in side reactions.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(True)* *(Nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing.)*
      - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** *(True)* *(Bromomethyl is electron-withdrawing.)*
      - **4-aminobenzoic acid** *(True)* *(Amino group can act as an additional coordination site.)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Methyl group is electron-donating.)*
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** *(False)* *(Hydroxyl group is electron-donating.)*
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Aldehyde group may interfere with coordination.)*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic carboxylic acids with the carboxyl group directly attached to the heteroaromatic ring lead to **high yield**; if the heterocycle is a substituent on a benzene ring or there is steric hindrance, they lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Direct attachment allows lone pairs on heteroatoms to participate in coordination, enhancing catalyst interaction. Attachment via a benzene ring increases distance and steric hindrance, reducing effectiveness.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(True)* *(Carboxylate attached directly to pyridine ring.)*
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)* *(Carboxylate attached to pyrazole ring.)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Pyridine ring attached via benzene ring, increasing steric hindrance.)*
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** *(True)* *(Exception due to flexible aliphatic chain reducing steric effects.)*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with functional groups capable of metal coordination (e.g., hydroxyl, thiol) near the carboxylate lead to **high yield**; if these groups are distant or if interfering groups are present, they lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Functional groups close to the carboxylate can chelate metal centers, enhancing coordination and stability. Distant groups are less effective, and interfering groups may block coordination.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)* *(Thiol at β position enhances coordination.)*
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(True)* *(Multiple hydroxyls near carboxylate enable chelation.)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(False)* *(Hydroxyl group distant from carboxylate.)*
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers with flexible aliphatic chains connecting coordinating groups to the carboxylic acid lead to **high yield**; those with rigid structures or bulky substituents near the coordinating groups lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Flexibility allows the modifier to adapt for optimal interaction with the catalyst. Rigid or bulky structures hinder access to coordination sites due to steric effects.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Flexible chain and phenolic hydroxyl aid coordination.)*
      - **Octanoic acid** *(True)* *(Long, flexible aliphatic chain.)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(False)* *(Rigid aromatic side chain near amino group.)*
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing polyether chains or multiple ether linkages lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Ether linkages increase flexibility and may adopt conformations that hinder effective coordination with the catalyst's active sites. They can also solvate metal ions, reducing availability.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(False)*
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** *(False)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(No high-yield examples with polyether chains in the dataset.)*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are highly fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids lead to **low yield** due to decreased coordination ability.**

  - **Explanation**: Fluorine's high electronegativity withdraws electron density from the carboxylate, weakening its ability to coordinate with metal centers.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with bulky or sterically hindering groups near the carboxylate or coordinating functional groups lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Steric hindrance from bulky groups impedes the effective interaction between the modifier and the catalyst, reducing catalytic efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)*
      - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** *(False)* *(Bulky side chains hinder coordination.)*
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with multiple hydroxyl (–OH) groups near the carboxylate lead to **high yield**; those with single distant hydroxyl groups lead to **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups can form strong coordination complexes with metal centers through chelation. Single hydroxyl groups far from the carboxylate are less effective in coordination.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(True)* *(Gluconic acid with adjacent hydroxyls.)*
      - **2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propan-2-yl]oxy]acetic acid** *(True)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(False)*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with para-substituted thiol (–SH), aldehyde (–CHO), or other potentially interfering groups lead to **low yield**; their aliphatic counterparts with these groups near the carboxylate lead to **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: In aromatic systems, these groups may participate in side reactions or resonance structures that reduce coordination effectiveness. In aliphatic acids, these groups can coordinate effectively when near the carboxylate.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Thiol on aromatic ring less effective.)*
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Aldehyde may engage in side reactions.)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)* *(Thiol near carboxylate enhances coordination in aliphatic chain.)*

**End of Rules**

These rules illustrate how combinations of functional groups and structural features in molecular modifiers influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By considering underlying physicochemical properties—such as coordination ability, electron-donating or -withdrawing effects, steric factors, and functional group proximity—the rules provide a framework for predicting whether a modifier will lead to a high or low yield.

- **Rules with Higher Coverage and Simplicity**:
  - **Rule 1** and **Rule 2**: Address aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids with emphasis on the position and nature of substituents.
  - **Rule 4** and **Rule 5**: Focus on the proximity of coordinating groups and the flexibility of the modifiers.
  - **Rule 8**: Highlights the general impact of steric hindrance.

- **Rules with Specificity and Complexity**:
  - **Rule 3** and **Rule 7**: Discuss specific ring structures and the effects of fluorination.
  - **Rule 6** and **Rule 9**: Consider the impact of polyether chains and multiple hydroxyl groups.

By applying these rules, chemists can predict the performance of various molecular modifiers and strategically design new modifiers to optimize the reaction yield.

    Current_Rules:
    ---

**Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with an amino group (–NH₂) at the alpha (α) or beta (β) position lead to a **high yield**; when the amino group is at a more distant position (gamma (γ) or beyond), or when bulky groups are present near the amino group, they lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: The proximity of the amino group to the carboxylate allows for effective bidentate chelation with metal centers, enhancing catalyst interaction. Distant amino groups or steric hindrance from bulky substituents reduce coordination efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)* *(Amino group at α position enhances coordination)*
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(True)* *(Amino group at α position enhances coordination)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)* *(Amino group distant and acetamido group adds steric bulk)*
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(False)* *(Amino group far from carboxylate reduces chelation)*
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(False)* *(Reduced coordination due to distance)*

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position lead to a **high yield**; those with electron-donating substituents or interfering groups lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group and enhance its ability to coordinate with metal centers. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and coordination ability, while interfering groups may engage in side reactions.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(True)* *(Nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing)*
      - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** *(True)* *(Bromomethyl group withdraws electron density)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Methyl group is electron-donating)*
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Aldehyde may interfere with coordination)*
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Thiol may engage in side reactions)*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with additional coordinating groups, such as hydroxyl (–OH) or thiol (–SH), located near the carboxylate (α or β positions) lead to a **high yield**; if these groups are distant or absent, they lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Additional coordinating groups near the carboxylate can form chelate rings with metal centers, enhancing binding affinity and catalytic activity. Distant groups are less effective for coordination.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)* *(Thiol group at β position enhances chelation)*
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(True)* *(Multiple hydroxyls enable strong chelation)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(False)* *(Hydroxyl group distant from carboxylate)*
      - **Octanoic acid** *(True)* *(High yield despite lack of additional groups—may act as a baseline)*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with nitrogen-containing heterocycles directly attached to the carboxyl group lead to a **high yield**; if the heterocycle is attached via a linker or substituent, they lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Direct attachment allows the lone pair on the nitrogen atom to participate in metal coordination alongside the carboxylate. Linkers increase distance and steric hindrance, reducing coordination efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(True)* *(Carboxylate directly attached to pyridine ring)*
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)* *(Effective coordination via heterocycle)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Pyridine ring attached via benzene reduces coordination)*
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(False)* *(Aromatic ring not directly attached to carboxylate)*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with flexible chains bearing coordinating groups (e.g., phenolic –OH, amino –NH₂) lead to a **high yield**; rigid structures or bulky substituents near the coordinating groups lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Flexibility allows the molecule to adopt conformations that facilitate effective coordination with the catalyst. Rigid or bulky groups hinder access to coordination sites due to steric effects.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Flexible chain with phenolic –OH enhances coordination)*
      - **Octanoic acid** *(True)* *(Long flexible chain may assist in molecular interactions)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)* *(Bulky acetamido group causes steric hindrance)*
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(False)* *(Rigid aromatic side chain reduces flexibility)*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that contain multiple ether linkages or polyether chains lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Ether linkages increase flexibility and solvation, which may result in the modifier wrapping around metal centers and reducing the availability of active sites. They can also sequester metal ions, decreasing catalyst efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(False)* *(Polyether chain reduces coordination with catalyst)*
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** *(False)* *(Multiple ether linkages hinder effective coordination)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - *(No high-yield examples with polyether chains in the dataset)*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that are perfluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids or contain highly fluorinated groups lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Fluorine atoms are highly electronegative and withdraw electron density, reducing the nucleophilicity of the carboxylate oxygen atoms and weakening their ability to coordinate with metal centers.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(False)* *(Multiple fluorines diminish coordination ability)*
      - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** *(False)* *(Fluorinated acyl group reduces electron density)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Octanoic acid** *(True)* *(Non-fluorinated analogue shows high yield)*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with interfering groups at the para position (e.g., aldehyde (–CHO), thiol (–SH)) lead to a **low yield**; if these groups are in aliphatic chains near the carboxylate, they can lead to a **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: In aromatic systems, these groups may participate in side reactions or hinder coordination due to resonance stabilization. In aliphatic systems, proximity to the carboxylate allows cooperative coordination.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Aldehyde group may engage in unwanted reactions)*
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Thiol on aromatic ring may interfere with coordination)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)* *(Thiol near carboxylate enhances coordination in aliphatic chain)*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers with bulky substituents near the carboxyl group or coordinating functional groups lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Steric hindrance from bulky groups impedes effective interaction between the modifier and the metal center, reducing coordination and catalytic activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)* *(Bulky acetamido group near coordinating amino group)*
      - **2-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]acetic acid** *(False)* *(Bulky benzoyl group hinders coordination)*
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(True)* *(Indole ring may introduce steric hindrance, but still shows high yield possibly due to π-π interactions)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)* *(No bulky groups near carboxylate)*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional coordinating groups lead to a **high yield**; however, the absence of any functional groups capable of enhancing coordination may limit further improvements.**

  - **Explanation**: Simple carboxylic acids can still coordinate with metal centers, but lack of additional coordinating groups means they rely solely on the carboxylate for interaction.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Octanoic acid** *(True)* *(Simple aliphatic acid shows high yield)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **No low-yield examples with simple aliphatic carboxylic acids in the dataset**

**End of Rules**

---

These rules elucidate how combinations of substructures and functional groups in molecular modifiers influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By considering underlying physicochemical properties—such as coordination ability, electron-withdrawing or -donating effects, steric hindrance, and the proximity of functional groups—these rules provide a predictive framework for assessing whether a modifier will lead to a high or low yield.

- **Rules with Higher Coverage and Simplicity**:
  - **Rule 1** and **Rule 2**: Focus on primary functional groups (amino and substituents on aromatic rings) and their positions relative to the carboxyl group.
  - **Rule 5** and **Rule 9**: Address the effects of molecular flexibility and steric hindrance, which are broadly applicable.
  - **Rule 10**: Highlights the role of simple aliphatic carboxylic acids as effective modifiers.

- **Rules with Specificity and Complexity**:
  - **Rule 3** and **Rule 4**: Discuss specific positioning of coordinating groups and heterocyclic systems.
  - **Rule 6** and **Rule 7**: Consider the impact of polyether chains and fluorination, which affect coordination in nuanced ways.
  - **Rule 8**: Explores how functional groups can have different effects depending on their context within the molecule.

By applying these rules, chemists can predict the performance of various molecular modifiers and design new modifiers to optimize the reaction yield. The balance between simple, high-coverage rules and more specific, detailed rules allows for both broad applications and fine-tuning based on molecular structure.

    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (α-amino acids with two carboxyl groups) lead to a **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: The amino group at the alpha (α) position adjacent to two carboxylic acid groups enhances chelation with metal centers, improving catalyst interaction and stability.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)* *(Aspartic acid with amino group at α position)*
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(True)* *(Glutamic acid with amino group at α position)*

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) lead to a **high yield**; those with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, hydroxy) lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and coordination ability.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(True)* *(Nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing)*
      - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** *(True)* *(Bromomethyl group withdraws electron density)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Methyl group is electron-donating)*
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** *(False)* *(Hydroxy group is electron-donating)*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aromatic heterocyclic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms in the ring directly attached to the carboxyl group lead to a **high yield**; if the heterocycle is connected via a linker, they lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in the heterocyclic ring can coordinate with metal centers. Direct attachment allows effective coordination, while linkers increase distance and may introduce steric hindrance.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(True)* *(Carboxylate directly attached to pyridine ring)*
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)* *(Pyrazole ring facilitates coordination)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Pyridine ring attached via benzene linker)*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with proximal functional groups (amino, hydroxyl, thiol) within two carbons of the carboxylate lead to a **high yield**; those with these groups at distant positions lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Functional groups near the carboxylate can form chelates with metal centers, enhancing coordination. Distant groups are less effective due to decreased interaction and flexibility.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)* *(Thiol at β position enhances chelation)*
      - **5-aminopentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Amino group within effective chelation range)*
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(True)* *(Multiple hydroxyls near carboxylate)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(False)* *(Amino group too distant for effective coordination)*
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(False)* *(Amino group far from carboxylate)*
      - **7-hydroxyheptanoic acid** *(False)* *(Hydroxyl group distant from carboxylate)*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers that are simple aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups lead to a **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Lack of interfering groups allows the carboxylate to coordinate freely with metal centers, facilitating effective catalyst interaction.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Octanoic acid** *(True)* *(Unsubstituted aliphatic chain enhances coordination)*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers containing bulky substituents near the carboxyl group lead to a **low yield** due to steric hindrance; if bulky groups are distant, they have less impact on yield.**

  - **Explanation**: Bulky groups near the coordination site impede effective interaction between the modifier and the metal center. Distant bulky groups are less obstructive due to increased flexibility.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(False)* *(Phenyl group near amino and carboxylate reduces coordination)*
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)* *(Bulky acetamido group causes steric hindrance)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Phenyl group distant from carboxylate minimizes steric effects)*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers that contain perfluorinated alkyl chains or highly fluorinated groups lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Fluorine's high electronegativity withdraws electron density from the carboxylate oxygen, weakening its ability to coordinate with metal centers and reducing catalytic activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(False)* *(Perfluorinated chain reduces coordination)*
      - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** *(False)* *(Fluorinated acyl group diminishes electron density)*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers that have multiple ether linkages or polyether chains lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Ether linkages increase flexibility and solvation, which may result in the modifier wrapping around metal centers, blocking active sites, or sequestering metal ions, thus hindering effective catalysis.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(False)* *(Polyether chain hinders coordination)*
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** *(False)* *(Multiple ethers reduce effective coordination)*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids fused with oxygen-containing heterocycles lead to a **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: The heterocyclic oxygen atoms provide additional coordination sites with metal centers, enhancing catalyst interaction and stability.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** *(True)* *(Heterocyclic oxygen aids in coordination)*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers containing interfering groups (e.g., aldehyde (–CHO), thiol (–SH)) at the para position of aromatic carboxylic acids lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Such groups may engage in side reactions or disrupt coordination due to their reactivity or steric effects, reducing catalyst effectiveness.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Aldehyde group may interfere with metal coordination)*
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Thiol group may cause side reactions)*

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with chain lengths that position functionalized aromatic rings at a distance from the carboxyl group sufficient for flexibility (e.g., five carbons or more) lead to a **high yield**; shorter chains lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Longer chains allow the aromatic ring's functional groups to interact effectively with the metal center without causing steric hindrance, enhancing coordination.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Flexible chain with phenolic –OH enhances coordination)*
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** *(True)* *(Pyridine ring at an optimal distance for coordination)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** *(False)* *(Shorter chain limits flexibility and coordination)*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers that are amino acids with indole-containing side chains (e.g., tryptophan derivatives) lead to a **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: The indole ring can interact with metal centers via π-π interactions and nitrogen coordination, enhancing catalytic activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid** *(True)* *(Tryptophan derivative with indole ring facilitating coordination)*

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers that are N-acylated amino acids or peptides lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: N-acylation reduces the availability of the amino group for coordination with metal centers, and peptide bonds may introduce steric hindrance, limiting catalyst interaction.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** *(False)* *(N-acylation impedes coordination)*

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups proximal to the carboxyl group lead to a **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxylate enhance chelation and interaction with metal centers, improving catalyst performance.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(True)* *(Hydroxyl groups facilitate coordination)*

---

**End of Rules**

---

These rules illustrate how combinations of substructures and functional groups in molecular modifiers influence the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. By considering underlying physicochemical properties—such as coordination ability, electron-withdrawing or electron-donating effects, steric hindrance, and the proximity of functional groups—we can predict whether a modifier will lead to a high or low yield.

- **Rules with Higher Coverage and Simplicity**:
  - **Rule 1**, **Rule 2**, and **Rule 4**: Focus on primary functional groups and their direct impact on coordination, providing broad applicability.
  - **Rule 5** and **Rule 7**: Address common structural features that negatively influence yield, such as perfluorination and polyether chains.

- **Rules with Specificity and Complexity**:
  - **Rule 3**, **Rule 9**, and **Rule 12**: Discuss specific structural features, such as heterocyclic systems and indole-containing amino acids.
  - **Rule 6** and **Rule 11**: Explore how chain length and positioning of bulky groups affect the reaction, requiring detailed structural consideration.

By applying these rules, chemists can design and select molecular modifiers to optimize the reaction yield. The balance between simple, high-coverage rules and more specific, detailed rules allows for both broad predictions and fine-tuning based on molecular structure.---------------------------------------------------------------

    Target Name: yield
    GPT Model: o1-preview-2024-09-12
    ML Model: ETC
    Current_Rules:
    **Start of Rules**

---

- **Rule 1**: **Modifiers that are α-amino dicarboxylic acids (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid) lead to a **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: The presence of both an amino group at the α-position and two carboxyl groups allows for strong chelation with metal ions, enhancing coordination with the catalyst's metal center and improving reaction efficiency.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-aminobutanedioic acid** *(True)* *(Aspartic acid)*
      - **(2S)-2-aminopentanedioic acid** *(True)* *(Glutamic acid)*

---

- **Rule 2**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids with strongly electron-withdrawing groups at the para position (e.g., nitro, bromomethyl) lead to a **high yield**; those with electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, hydroxy) lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the carboxyl group, enhancing its ability to coordinate with metal centers. Electron-donating groups decrease acidity and coordination ability, reducing catalytic performance.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **4-nitrobenzoic acid** *(True)* *(Para-nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing)*
      - **4-(bromomethyl)benzoic acid** *(True)* *(Bromomethyl group withdraws electron density)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-methylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Methyl group is electron-donating)*
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** *(False)* *(Hydroxy group is electron-donating)*

---

- **Rule 3**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids with amino or hydroxyl groups within two carbons of the carboxylate lead to a **high yield**; those with these groups more than four carbons away lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Functional groups proximal to the carboxylate enhance chelation with metal centers, improving catalyst interaction. Distant groups are less effective due to decreased coordination capability.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-aminopentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Amino group two carbons away from carboxylate)*
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)* *(Thiol group adjacent to carboxylate)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **7-aminoheptanoic acid** *(False)* *(Amino group distant from carboxylate)*
      - **8-aminooctanoic acid** *(False)* *(Amino group far from carboxylate)*

---

- **Rule 4**: **Modifiers that are aromatic heterocyclic carboxylic acids with nitrogen atoms in the ring directly attached to the carboxyl group lead to a **high yield**; if the heterocycle is connected via a linker, they lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Nitrogen atoms in the heterocyclic ring can coordinate with metal centers. Direct attachment allows effective coordination, while linkers increase distance and may introduce steric hindrance, reducing interaction.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid** *(True)* *(Carboxylate directly attached to pyridine ring)*
      - **1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)* *(Pyrazole ring facilitates coordination)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Pyridine ring attached via benzene linker)*

---

- **Rule 5**: **Modifiers containing perfluorinated alkyl chains or highly fluorinated groups lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Fluorine's high electronegativity withdraws electron density from the carboxylate oxygen, weakening its ability to coordinate with metal centers and reducing catalytic activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoropentanoic acid** *(False)* *(Perfluorinated chain reduces coordination)*
      - **4-[(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)amino]butanoic acid** *(False)* *(Fluorinated acyl group diminishes electron density)*

---

- **Rule 6**: **Modifiers that are aliphatic carboxylic acids without additional functional groups lead to a **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Simple carboxylic acids can coordinate effectively with metal centers without steric hindrance or electronic interference from other groups, facilitating efficient catalysis.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **Octanoic acid** *(True)* *(Unsubstituted aliphatic chain enhances coordination)*

---

- **Rule 7**: **Modifiers containing multiple ether linkages or polyether chains lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Ether linkages increase flexibility and solvation, potentially causing the modifier to sequester metal ions or block active sites, hindering effective catalysis.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid** *(False)* *(Polyether chain hinders coordination)*
      - **3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid** *(False)* *(Multiple ethers reduce effective coordination)*

---

- **Rule 8**: **Modifiers with bulky substituents near the carboxyl group (e.g., aromatic rings) lead to a **low yield** due to steric hindrance; if bulky groups are distant, they have less impact on yield.**

  - **Explanation**: Bulky groups near the coordination site impede effective interaction between the modifier and the metal center. Distant bulky groups allow for flexibility and better coordination.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid** *(False)* *(Phenyl group near amino and carboxylate reduces coordination)*
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Phenyl ring distant from carboxylate minimizes steric effects)*

---

- **Rule 9**: **Modifiers that are N-acylated amino acids or peptides lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: N-acylation reduces the availability of the amino group for coordination with metal centers, and peptide bonds may introduce steric hindrance, limiting catalyst interaction.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **2-[[(2S)-2-amino-4-methylsulfanylbutanoyl]amino]acetic acid** *(False)* *(N-acylation impedes coordination)*
      - **(2S)-6-acetamido-2-aminohexanoic acid** *(False)* *(Acetamido group hinders coordination)*

---

- **Rule 10**: **Modifiers that are aromatic carboxylic acids fused with oxygen-containing heterocycles lead to a **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: The heterocyclic oxygen atoms provide additional coordination sites with metal centers, enhancing catalyst interaction and stability.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **1,3-dioxo-2-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid** *(True)* *(Heterocyclic oxygen aids in coordination)*
      - **2-oxo-1H-pyridine-4-carboxylic acid** *(True)* *(Lactam oxygen enhances coordination)*

---

- **Rule 11**: **Modifiers with electron-rich aromatic systems connected via flexible aliphatic linkers (four or more carbons) to the carboxyl group lead to a **high yield**; shorter linkers lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Longer linkers allow the aromatic group's functional sites to interact effectively with the metal center without causing steric hindrance, enhancing coordination and catalyst activity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid** *(True)* *(Flexible chain allows effective interaction)*
      - **4-pyridin-4-ylbutanoic acid** *(True)* *(Pyridine ring at optimal distance)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid** *(False)* *(Shorter chain limits flexibility and coordination)*

---

- **Rule 12**: **Modifiers containing thiol groups lead to a **high yield** when the thiol is proximal to the carboxyl group; aromatic thiols lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Aliphatic thiols near the carboxyl group can strongly coordinate with metal centers. Aromatic thiols may engage in side reactions or cause steric hindrance due to rigidity.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **3-sulfanylpropanoic acid** *(True)* *(Thiol group adjacent to carboxylate enhances coordination)*
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-sulfanylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Aromatic thiol may cause side reactions)*

---

- **Rule 13**: **Modifiers containing aldehyde (–CHO) groups lead to a **low yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Aldehyde groups are reactive and may participate in side reactions or interfere with metal coordination, reducing catalyst effectiveness.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **Low Yield**:
      - **4-formylbenzoic acid** *(False)* *(Aldehyde group may interfere with coordination)*

---

- **Rule 14**: **Modifiers with multiple hydroxyl groups proximal to the carboxyl group lead to a **high yield**.**

  - **Explanation**: Multiple hydroxyl groups near the carboxylate enhance chelation and interaction with metal centers, improving catalyst performance through additional coordination sites.

  - **Supporting Examples**:
    - **High Yield**:
      - **(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid** *(True)* *(Multiple hydroxyls facilitate coordination)*

---

**End of Rules**

These rules capture the relationship between molecular modifiers' substructures and their impact on the reaction yield. By focusing on combinations of functional groups and their positions within the modifiers, the rules provide predictive power grounded in chemical principles. The balance between broad coverage and specificity ensures practical applicability across a range of modifiers.

- **Rules with Higher Coverage and Simplicity**:
  - **Rule 1**, **Rule 2**, **Rule 3**, and **Rule 6** address fundamental structural features affecting coordination, offering broad applicability.
  - **Rule 5** and **Rule 7** highlight common motifs that negatively influence yield, such as perfluorination and polyether chains.

- **Rules with Specificity and Complexity**:
  - **Rule 4**, **Rule 10**, and **Rule 11** focus on specific structural arrangements, like heterocycles and linker lengths, requiring detailed structural considerations.
  - **Rule 8** and **Rule 12** delve into steric and positional effects of bulky groups and thiols on coordination.

By applying these rules, chemists can rationally design and select molecular modifiers to optimize the yield of the radical-mediated remote δ-C(sp³)–H bond functionalization reaction. The integration of chemical insights into functional group behavior and coordination chemistry enhances the predictive capability of the rules.---------------------------------------------------------------
